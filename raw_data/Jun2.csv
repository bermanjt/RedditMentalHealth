0,My depression,"is it just me

i have to confess, i have this weird wish. the wish is where every human being is gone on the planet, and its just me. in my experience, every human being ive met as hurt me, even my closest friends. especially because of corona, they started texting less and less, until it was like they forgot about me. For me, it would be so much better if everyone was gone because it's just easier that way. Nature has never hurt me and neither has animals either, in fact theyre the only reason im still here. without people, i wouldnt have to worry about envying people who actually have friends who want to hang out and text, and people who are social. There's always been something so weird about me, like i can just tell from anyone's body language their emotion. idk if it's just a thinking error or something like that. That's what my therapist said. And there was one time where I actually succeeded in getting rid of this. but then i lost myself. I didn't know how i was anymore. Please, anyone help. I'm tired of living but afraid to die. can someone explain this... i can say this pain of loneliness and depression and feeling like im so different from everyone else i wish i was just never born is just unexplainable, unimaginable pain that clings to you and won't let go. Therapy makes me lose a part of myself, and im not comfortable with that, so maybe i should just stick with this pain that apparently is now a part of me. there's people that say to be stronger because the old generation had to go through the great war and great depression i guess, but they don't understand that my war is spiritual and emotional, and im losing. i cant describe how painful it is, just please someone help. thanks for reading if u read the whole thing."

2,I’m just always sad,Having a dad that hates you and a broken family that don’t get along and considering I’m the most hated child being 16 everyone judges me and calls me shit I feel depressed every single day of my life. Tried getting health in real life but did nothing I have been depressed since I was 11 and planned suicide multiple times. Tbh I don’t think I’ll make it to 20 at this point.
3,Don't know if it belongs here but I need help.,"Of recent I've saw some traumatic violent stuff that I can't take off my mind. This would be fine as I'm used to seeing blood and violence but this particular time hit me hard. Everytime I close my eyes I see this image I'm having terrible sweats, paranoia and every time I look in a remotely dark corner I feel afraid. This has been going on for almost a month now, is there something wrong with me? Please help Reddit I don't know what to do."
4,I feel imprisoned and depressed because of ERP,"ERP is really hard. I kind of feel imprisoned. I feel trapped. They won’t let me talk to my outpatient therapist which is understandable but I really want outside insight. I feel like I’m trapped in a cage and I’m not even committed, I’m just a telehealth patient. 

I keep relapsing, and because of that I’ll likely have to stay longer. I feel trapped in a cage, stuck, unable to escape. ERP is making me feel more depressed than I ever have in my life. My obsessions feel so real that I feel there’s no way they could possibly be false even though I’ve had these same obsessions before. These past two weeks have probably been the worst in my life: depression, crying, meltdowns, sadness, all of it. I just can’t do this anymore. I wanna pull out so bad. I even feel like my relationship ships are suffering because of this. This is is just too hard for me to handle. I’m going to keep going so I can be well treated but I’m so scared that I’ll have to stay longer. I know it gets worse before it gets better but nothing is getting better yet and I’m just so sad. 

I don’t like this feeling. I hate it so much.

My HOCD just feels so real and I feel like ERP turned me gay- which was my fear. I’m having a hard time drying yet I cry so easily and I can’t let it all out. I feel like I’m calling out for help but my cries aren’t heard. I feel like I’m drowning with no one to save me. I feel like there’s no escape. I think I probably should text the crisis line, maybe they can help.

I just need some support. ERP is supposed to free me but I feel more trapped than I ever have in my life. Please help."
5,Anyone else want this to end?,"To give some background I'm 19m in California and have always been shy and introverted growing up. I never had many friends and never dated which led me to a suicidal depression from age 14-19.

Around February this year I decided I wanted to finally be happy, I started going to the gym and got my resume ready. And was ready to take more college classes in order to meet and make friends. As we all know around that time the lockdown began worldwide. 

I have tried my best to be positive and do my best during these forced stay at home orders. Stuff like home workouts and online class but I'm fucking sick of this. 

I want to go outside to the gym again with more equipment, I want to apply for a job, I want to go to class and learn in person. Online classes fucking blow donkey shit, I want to meet people and make friends, I want to start dating, I want to pursue more hobbies,  but this lockdown has literally stopped all of that. 

And for those saying to make friends and date online, my entire social interaction has been online my entire life I'm sick of it. I want to live my life especially when its during a time of self improvement and my youth. 

Is it selfish to want to open things up for my own benefit? Absolutely it is but you know what else is selfish? Forcing millions to stay home with 30 million unemployed unable to pay bills, forcing millions with a forced garbage online education, causing suicide, mental illness, abuse, divorce, rates to skyrocket all because of some virus which was blown out of proportion in terms of deadlines.

Both choices have massive costs but imo staying in lockdown is going to do allot more harm than good. I feel like bashing my head against a fucking wall every day this gets prolonged. I just want my life to resume so I can finally move towards being happy.

How are you all holding up? Thoughts and opinions are welcomed and appreciated."
6,I feel like I failed everyone and everything.,"Before I transferred into a big university, I was a a good student in my community college. Good grades etc, and I kinda got forced into transferring early by my parents. They agreed to pay for it and I tried my best. I have been depressed but it feels like things have been getting worse. I transferred in Fall of 2019. My grades were borderline passing, but once COVID hit, I felt like I could try to handle it, but my grades started suffering. I thought that maybe I'm just being lazy. I did all my work and studied but still did bad on tests. I...I think I'm too much of a failure. I want to die. My parents tried hard for me, and I let them down. My dad is the angry type and calls me a lazy piece of crap. I've been having trouble getting out of bed, and even made an attempt. I don't know. I feel like I'm running out of time. I also live in LA, so I was here when the protests and Riots happened. And now, I just feel....numb honestly. And I want everything to stop."
7,Does anyone else feel like this?,[deleted]
8,ADVICE: I moved and now I need to find a therapist/ psychiatrist,"I am in a new city, alone, and need to find a therapist and psychiatrist. People with complex mental health history I need your advice on a couple things. (BTW I'm in America so health systems may be different if you live in a different part of the world)

1. Do I find a therapist first and wait for her to tell me to go to a psychiatrist or do I schedule that on my own? I've been getting Prozac from my old PCP but I never took it because I knew I'd be moving and wouldn't be able to take it consistently and didn't want to risk getting serotonin syndrome. I've never seen a psychiatrist before-- I don't know how it works. (BTW I know my health insurance doesn't require mental health approvals, I can seek these services on my own-- I just don't know if it makes sense for me to find my own psychiatrist.)
2. How do you tell your psychiatrist your history? I have a LONG mental health history-- do I just take the first few sessions to tell my therapist my history or disclose it in bits and pieces as we start to talk?

If it helps my previous diagnoses are: Anxiety (if you couldn't tell by my anxiously worded questions), Depression, OCD, PTSD, Anorexia (but I am not seeking mental health services for this-- I'm not ready to address it.)"
9,How do I stop feeling repulsed by people if I feel like I got too close to them?,"This happens with anyone in a romantic context or friends, but especially with my family.

I'll be hit with this high mood where I feel like I have so much love for a person and need to spend time with them, and have long and interesting conversations with them, then I'll feel guilty, like I did something wrong (even though nothing I said or did was regrettable), and I'll either have to distance myself or start an argument with them to go back to normal.

I realize this is probably a fairly normal thing to experience, but still, I don't like how toxic this makes me and how much it ruins my day. Any advice is welcome"
10,What is wrong with me??,[deleted]
11,"I’m a looser and I know it, I always manage to fck up everything","I’m terrible at life. I always manage to fck-up everything in the last second. I don’t think anyone likes me, and the one person that did realized her mistake very quickly.

This year, I already managed to mess up a relationship with a girl that I opened up to and told about my feelings. She told me she also likes me but right now has too many issues to deal with and is too worried about being too emotionally unavailable and messing up the concept of normal relationships for me so she decided to get over it.

I trust her 100% on this and don’t think any of this is a lie, as she’s never lied to me and wouldn’t even consider that. So, basically, I’m so trash that I can’t even get a relationship to work that both sides are interested in because I’m apparently so fragile that I can’t even get into a relationship because it might make me unable to have relationships. That basically amounts to the ultimate irony. Can’t get a relationship because I’d be unable to have relationships. Love you too, universe

Anyway, I don’t know what exactly I’m expecting from posting this but I just have to tell someone about this bullshit. I hate myself for ruining everything, especially with her as she’s the only person I’ve ever felt comfortable opening up to. She knows me better than anyone else, including the psychologist I used to have… who also never managed to make me feel like being able to open up

I’ve fallen for a lot of women over the years (none of which ever worked out in the end, of course, this is me after all), but I’ve never trusted anyone else that much and never felt worse about fucking everything up… I genuinely think this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and that I’ll never find anyone else again who’s so understanding and trustworthy

The best thing is that there was a realistic chance that it’s gonna work out, and then life throws a fkin pandemic between us. She went  back to her family on a different continent to support them as they need her help quite a lot. She quit her job in my country which was the main reason she travelled here a lot. It’s unclear when and if she’ll ever come back to my country. All of this is just pissing me off so much. It’s like I finally managed to have a normal life, I even managed to go to the gym twice a week… until this virus fckd everything. Because, you know, it’s impossible for me to be happy, so much so that there’s coincidentally the biggest pandemic since the plague just to stop me from even considering to have a chance at life

Now I’m stuck at home again, lazy, alone, demotivated, sad, you get the point

Sorry for the long and incoherent rant, I just hate everything right now"
12,I made a big mistake at work,"I have been doing well part time working with children for about to school years. Last school year was cut short by coronavirus and about a month before that I accidentally (anxiously/impulsively)  self-disclosed my diagnosis. At the school I work at I only have about 11 co-workers and I told my assistant supervisor because she was poking around at why I'm on disability. I know I shouldn't have told her but I felt comfortable, falsely, because I talk to this woman every other day and she was being really nice. She's always pretty nice to me. anyway, sorry... I told my assistant supervisor that I have bipolar. I didn't go into details and she didn't give me a crazy expression or anything and honestly, I think work went on as usual for the next month before Corona. Now I've had a few months to think about it, ruminate and I don't even know if I feel comfortable going back to work there. It's difficult for me to get another job though as I didn't finish college due to mental health issues and my anxiety is so bad I can't do simple things like cashier or barista. I'm totally stable now and have been for a few years except for the anxiety. What would you do? or do you try to find a new job or would you just pretend it never happened? Thank you so much if you read this"

15,"I’ve been feeling empty, and nothing seems to make me happy.","At the beginning of quarantine I was diagnosed with depression and since then it got better, but recently it came back in full force and all I’ve been doing is sleeping and I even started smoking weed, this helped for a while but now even while high nothing seems to make me smile. I just wish everything was silent and everything just stopped. I don’t know how to explain it. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to exist. I’m just scared."
16,"I need to get off social media, but how?","I feel how my attention span is getting worse, and how I check my social media accounts all few minutes. It is getting ridiculous, and at this point it is a habit, that I do almost automatically

Even worse, I am very empathetic, and all I hear/see all day long is everything that is wrong with this world. it started to affect my mental health a lot. I'm stressed out whenever I'm online, but also start to get anxious when I'm not.

Another problem is: I listen to music on my phone pretty much all day long. It helps my anxiety. Now I would love to just turn my phone off and throw it aside, but then I can't listen to music either, and I don't want to stop that. It's also very tempting to just go online when you're skipping through the music on the phone, since it's just a click away.


I thought about deleting all online/social media apps, but this is kinda drastic, and I might regret it later.


Does anyone has tips?"
17,I (23F) have a great relationship with my mom now but I feel like the way she raised me (physically and emotionally abusive) messed me up for life. Repressed thoughts are finally coming back and I'm not sure how to deal with them. Feeling a lot of trauma.,"I'm 23 now and I've kind of repressed all of this so this is my first time writing it down/talking about it. To be honest, I've pushed it down so hard that I totally forgot that all of this even happened until recently. Keep in mind that I am the oldest child and my mom only did this with me.

When I was younger (mainly elementary school and middle school) my mom was very harsh on me. She has a lot of anxiety and definitely took it out on me. She also was not very affectionate towards me. Every time I did something wrong she would chase me around the house and hit me/spit on me etc. These would cause me to have anxiety attacks and start hyperventilating. She was also very emotionally/verbally abusive towards me. A big issue was that I had a problem with wetting the bed and she would make fun of me for it/hit me because of it. Some specifically traumatic times would be when she'd come to my room to wake me up at night to use the bathroom and she'd notice that I already wet the bed so she would wake me up and start screaming at me.

On top of this, she was very strict. If I ever got in trouble (I was a really smart and athletic kid so never anything major) she would ground me with no explanation on how long it would last or her reasoning. Also, absolutely no sleepovers. And if I had hung out with friends one day, that meant I definitely couldn't hang out with friends the next day. That kind of thing.

I was very emotionally closed-off because of this. I had trouble hugging family/telling them I love you/ showing them any type of emotion (whether positive or negative). I always had a huge need to please my parents and be extremely perfect so I put on a huge front. I was extremely scared to ask my parents for things. I remember I would often ask my sibling to ask my parents if I could go have a play date for me because I was too scared to ask them myself.

This all randomly subsided when I was like 16-17 and ever since I went to college, I've become much closer to my mom. We do a lot of traveling together now and stuff like that. She sometimes acknowledges the fact that she treated me badly when I was young and she always apologizes for it. I usually just brush it off because I don't want to make her feel bad. It has definitely had a huge affect on me though, I'm a very anxious perfectionist type of person. I work very hard and have a huge need to please others. I have history of eating disorder as well as the tendency to abuse drugs/alcohol. I also get pretty dependent on my SO when I am in a relationship.

All of these memories just randomly came back to me and I definitely think I need to address them with a therapist. I don't really know what the point of this post was but it felt good to write it out. Thinking about a 10 year old me being treated like this makes me so upset. Thanks for reading &lt;3

Edit: I have no bad feelings towards my mom btw. I understand that her anxiety/depression probably played a factor in how she treated me. She is also an immigrant from a country where hitting your child is pretty normal."
18,Ive never been happy,A toxic family and constantly getting bullied at school made my childhood and teen years miserable. Now im an adult (23m) with zero social skills and no idea how to have fun.

20,Day Dream,"I am 23, I suffer from PTSD, Manic Depression, recovered alcoholism, past drug use,and past parental abuse. I am not the best at grammar so I am sorry if I irritate you in any way. 

Hello, I am going to be asking lots of questions, and explaining why I am here. As a young child, my father would yell at me, has slapped me several times, and was I believe Bipolar 2. To explain the reasons he has done so I will make it quick, and as simple as I can. He was beaten at a young age, he would wake up getting punched by his second stepfather, he would get slapped for spilling things on accident, he was held outside of a window by his collar from 3 stories. He acted out of course, I guess he had a plan to kill his oldest little brother, and my grandmother, and then blame it on his youngest brother. He was sent into a mental institution, came out even skinner, and fell into speed, and shot up as well. Though as he reached 19 he impregnated my mother with me,  giving him some type of purpose to continue living. When I was born, like a majority of fathers, he changed his ways, he was a neo-nazi, covered his tattoos and worked on becoming A+ certified, as I am currently doing. He was deeply troubled, and would snap into rage fits I called ""Caveman Anger"" saying demeaning things, and just so...angry at me. When Super Mario Sunshine came out, I walked quickly in front of the TV screen, causing him to die, and he freaked out, yelling at me, and throwing a the TV remote so fast and hard I heard the speed of it brushed past my ear hitting the sofa. My parents had been seperated since I was young, maybe 2 or 3. My mother was married to my first Step father who was a black man, anyways, I started crying of course, since he was in a severe anger stage, he took me home, driving irratically through my city of 70,000+ people, dropping me off at my mothers as I screamed for her, wanting love in a moment of fear, a sincere knowing of protection, and care. My father was in IT and was incredibly smart, he shut a whole computer company down cause they were doing something he didnt agree with causing him to, you guessed it, flip out, He had a family friend take all of his hard drives, and bury them. The FBI couldn't find anything against him, he lost his job, and any chance of being in IT field again I guess idk I was too young, and too focused on video games and books to escape. He became the guy that lived in his mothers basement, especially so after I told him to download the 14-day free trial of WoW, he withdrew from society, and my life. Stopped talking to me, though I went to my grandmothers every other weekend, but hung out with my grandparents, who would take me to KC to go out to eat, and we would go to Barnes and Nobles for them to get me a new book I would quickly digest in a matter of a day or two maybe 3. As I reached 12 I was raped by a man who told me there was an awesome fort in the woods, I of course eager to see it told him to prove it to me, I do not remember much of the incident, besides pushing him off of me with such insane strength as I was a skinny white boy, that looked like I hadnt eaten in days, but I ate alot lol. Anyways, I had ran to a friends to tell him that, I ran so hard and so fast, I never looked back, I didnt care too. I was hanging out with the older teens, some my age would go and hang out with this 19 year old who would watch WWE matches, he was an awesome guy along with my 3 other friends. My 3 other friends took me to the office as I lived in an aprtement complex. The walk to there was long, as I was crying, and it was hot, my 19 year old friend was so angry he was taking a bat to all his possessions, ultra rare WWE figures in the box, in mint condition. They had to leave as I told the office lady what had happened, I was in a state of shock, of disbelief, it was a hazey dream I remember too well of everything else but the incident, which bothered me, it must have been so traumatic that I guess I couldn't truly process the event correctly shutting me down into a lifeless husk of a human, as I probably laid there motionless. I continued to act like nothing much had happened to me, I guess my father was trying to not kill the man, and I had uncles and family members who almost got past the cops arresting him and killed him. One of my older cousins who was like an older brother gave me my first real pocket knife, as I held it in my hand, I wanted to just stab my throat over and over, brushing off the thought, I mentally retreated into a new mental hole, becoming the lifeless husk of my former self that was outgoing. I went on autopilot, waking up sometimes screaming and kicking, and a bed full of sweat as my mother rushes to my room crying and holding me saying she was so sorry she couldnt be there to protect me. I was guessing that my father who still was not talking to me was thinking, he comepletley gave up on life. I went to catholic school, and I do not want to cause any religious arguments, but I had lost any faith I had in any religion, solely focusing on escapism through video games, and now a new form of entertainment, drugs. Weed was okay for me I guess, I skated and found friends outside of the catholic school full of stuck up rich kids, I was the poor kid of course, I got kciked out of catholic school, placing me in a public school. After my 7th grade year, I stayed a cousins houses, venturing out into the nights to escape my life. It was august, I believe, I was in my cousins room downstairs in his basement, playing call of duty black ops 1, I got called up, it was my uncle from my fathers side of the family, he told me to come take a walk with him, anxiety filled me, I was walking with him, and he was trying so hard not to cry for some reason,  I could see that something was bothering him, and I asked him what was wrong but he told me that my grandma wanted to talk to me. We reached my grandmas house, as my aunts, her 7 other sisters,stood outside crying, she ran to me saying that my father had shot himself, I was 14, yet again going through another traumatic event, I again, in disbelief as any child would be. I sat in the room I would stay in on the weekends and cried with her, I ran out the back door, seeing my two uncles, his brothers, cry, I had to get away, I had to run, just like how I ran from ""That Man"", I ran from in the forest. I ran back to my uncles house who only lived a block away who was my fathers best friend back in the day, who gave the blessing of my father to date my mother. I balled into his arms, and him freaking out asking me what was going on I told him that my dad killed himself, he called my mother, my mother came and got me yet again to embrace me into protection, and comfort, but I was still in autopilot lifeless husk mode in some way shape or form though I felt emotions. It was after that I truly felt alone, and defeated, even after the abuse the yelling and demeaning name callings I loved my father, I just wanted to sit on his lap again and play PC games like Quake, and half life. I wanted to hear his deep voice, though I thought it was a prank of some kind an evil prank, that he was going to walk in through my bedroom door at my mothers house and call my name as he would in his deep voice. He would share songs with me such as Joy Division, The Cure, Ministry, White Zombie, punk, techno such as Crystal Castles etc. The Cure is what stuck with me the most because before he passed he would always put them on, and I never thought to actually understand that he was communicating through music. though he told me he loved me, he couldnt show it , cause as a kid, he wasnt shown. As an adult I didnt get a job until I was 19 at a local Taco Bell, then I retreated to my grandmothers on my fathers side, and became a hermit, only going out to get cigarettes, and hang out with friends that had weed, though I dont consider weed to be a hard drug, or a gateway drug, I fell in love with speed, it gave me happiness as the drug does, an overload of seratonin to make me go go go, and be happy happy happy. I did pills, drank though I was a lightweight when it came to alcohol id still push myself to keep drinking, and Id even throw up and continue drinking until I blacked out. Through the years of my teenage past life, I had attempted to take my life several times with ibuprofen, but would just wake up the next day feeling sick, I was almsot unable to die, to scared to slice my wrists, or my throat, I wanted to pass away in my sleep,I just couldnt die. As I hit 21 I was working at a Bar and Grill, and I would get a triple shot of jager in a to go cup filled with energy drink (a vegas bomb or jager bomb)  Id drink a few of those, and I would be so drunk but so wired I could feel my heart pounding out of my chest yet I am wasted. As time went by I finally bought my own car at 22, and took forever to get my liscence. I promised my family I wouldnt drink and drive, yet I did, I got off work from a Texas Roadhouse, which was always busy everyday, mentally, and pyschically demanding, hot and tired I worked almost everyday. I never got a raise though I would help as many people as I could, anyways, I went to the Bar and Grill I last worked at to get that sweet, sweet liquor in me. Still a lightweight, I drank, I didnt eat at all that day, and drove home to be balcked out rolled my car on a parkway, totalled hit, yet I didnt hit anyone, I dont even hardly remember what happened I was so wasted. that was over a year ago, I feel disguested with myself each and everyday, I could've killed someone, I could had taken a precious babies life, or a fellow citizens life. I wanted to die again, I betrayed the promises I once made to my family, and to myself. I never condone anyone to drink and drive, though its still illegal for some dumb reason, just walk fucking home, or call a cab. I still havent forgiven myself for it yet I should because I didnt hurt anyone, or myself. Yet I have flashbacks of the anxiety of coming to, and being in jail. I continued workin at the Texas Roadhouse, and promised myself I wouldnt ever drink, yet I lied to myself again, and my family. Family being mad at you isnt the worst thing, it is when they say they are dissapointed in you, and your actions. I gotten 3 grand from my car, I blew it on more video games, blow, booze, shrooms, and shit load of good weed. I went to a friends bday party last august, and blacked out, waking up on my grandparents' house on their front lawn, I was filled with anxiety, of what happened, I rushed to the bathroom to throwup, only to throw up blood, my grandmother being a nurse, had had enough of this and booked me to a rehab which was 1,200 miles away, a two day drive, it was all so fast to make the decision yet i said yes only to get there and it be some kind of christian cult rehab where the only way to progress is to accept jesus as your master, your lord, and saviour. I demanded my grandparents to pick me up and take me home, they didnt speak to me for the two day drive back home which was the longest drive of my life. I had had a therapist, and was on two different medications after my DWI, and my therapist before my DWI. Idk how much longer I can type anymore, but I have images of myself shooting myself, of some distorted figure screaming at me in my face, as I day dream about it. The final moments of my own life transforming into my fathers stand off with the police in a hotel in his final moment to shoot himself. I think about the sweet release of death, to take me from this world that had defeated me, yet I stay strong, do my breathing excersises, and walk outsideif needed though i still reside inside, to play my bass guitar, to listen to Black Metal bands the only bands that I truly care about Leviathan, and Xasthur. To sit and face those thoughts head on, though some times they consume my thoughts. I do not want to take my life, nor harm others in any way. I just sit in misery though I act happy, ashamed of my DWI, ashamed of being raped, ashamed of being me. Being defeated, I too have gave up on life, but I still want to drag myself along to someday finally grasp my meaning of life, other than sitting in my room day dreaming of being in a band, or what comes after my death in the eternal void of nothingness. To finally not be able to feel even numb. Again I do not want to die, though it may seem life I am trying to convince myself, it is true. Do you have images of your distorted figured self screaming at you as you day dream? Why do I imagine that? Why do I always become a hermit of my room? Why? I dont know if ill ever return to this post for fear of embarssment. But I want to assure you dear reader, that i am in fact not going to take my life, I guess I just maybe needed to type this out  idk. Maybe this will make someone else, another dear reader, not feel so alone, becuase youre not either."

23,Still struggling to adjust to college after 2nd year.,"At the end of the first semester of my freshman year of college, I started struggling with depression and anxiety a lot because of feeling lonely from not making as many friends as other people, living alone, and feeling lost about my future. It also may be the fact that I don’t trust myself to make good decisions for my life on my own, maybe because I’m not used to it.

The 2nd year rolled around and I found roommates that I really liked and spent a lot of time with. They eventually became my main group of friends. I still struggled a lot with anxiety and feeling lost.

The 2nd year just ended and I still can’t shake the feeling of loneliness and feeling lost, even though I’ve made my mind up on a major and made a few friends. I even have a boyfriend now, and go to therapy, but I don’t know why I feel this way still. I’m hoping that it’s just a phase I’m going through in struggling to adjust to college, but I feel kind of hopeless still."
24,General life question,"Starting off I will say that I am a junior in college with a 4.0 gpa (I work very hard) and I plan on applying to med school when I graduate.

My question is pertaining to a feeling I constantly have about not really understanding a lot about life (and medicine in general). It seems to me that the more I try to find answers, the more I end up running into questions that I am inclined to find answers to. I also understand that this is literally how learning is done and it may be a good habit to have; however, this way of thinking constantly gives me anxiety and is extremely tiring (it is an OCD like way of thinking).

I want to ask those of you in this community who have moved on from their college years if this analytical way of thinking is just a result of constantly dealing with the stress from college or if it is just a specific way of thinking in some people?

To clarify: Is this way of thinking permanent or does the way you think / approach life in general continue to change as you continue to grow older?"
25,When someone commits suicide it’s very triggering,"Am I the only one but when I hear someone who committed suicide it is so triggering to me and it honestly makes me very sad and depressed for a while. This hits so close to home as someone who has contemplated suicide for the last 6 years. I don’t talk about my mental health  and no one really knows about what I’m going through, I have this facade of this happy-go-lucky attitude. Today an actor committed suicide and I see a lot of people (famous and people I personally know) posting on social media of saying how people should “reach out if you’re struggling and don’t feel alone, etc”. Honestly it’s just BS. Because you fail to do this to people in YOUR life. No one is to blame for suicide of course. However, I cannot hear these false pretence of people caring about mental health when someone dies. Why is this talked about ONLY when someone dies. Honestly, my heart dropped today and I just can’t stop thinking about this. The people that have “urged” others to reach out are the ones that have never paid attention to me in real life and then they go and say how much they care about others. I’m not blaming anything for anything but I can’t help but think it’s bullshit."
26,I need help,"Lately I’ve just felt so crappy and down. I feel worthless at this point. My girlfriend had changed severely since the whole lockdown started from COVID and when I finally pulled her up about it we argued for about 12 hours on and off over snapchat until she finally came out and told me she had schizophrenia. She’d been lying to me about it for 3 whole years of me knowing her and falling in love with her. Turns out that the voice internally communicating with her is what has made her basically take 0 interest in me for the best part of 3 months. Finding this out has crushed me and I don’t know what to trust is true from her anymore. I have been sat here sobbing on my bedroom floor for hours trying to figure out what to do. I’m starting to have really really dark thoughts I feel worthless and better off dead. 
I understand this is very confusing and long I apologise. I just needed to vent it out. If anyone has any advice on what I should do it would be very much appreciated. Thanks"
27,I feel like a bloated nincompoop. Any suggestions?,"Mostly I don't have a life. Apparently without my antidepressants I cry...alot. I feel like I'm not very loveable...I'm trying to pull it together. Make something out of this rolly polly poop self that I've made myself into. But it's hard because I'm rolly polly, medicated as all heck, and mostly tired of stoofs. I'm getting old now. I'm een my dirty thirties. You know? It's sad. I have no one to call me own. I'm just a nobodies....Now I'm all...lost and stuff. Oh weel. If anyone would like to comment on tings. I would appreesh. Tanks."
28,Violent Dreams,"I've been having violent dreams every so often. It's not like I actually do anything violent in the dreams, its more like I'm doing something illegal, and as a result, I end up witnessing something violent.

For example, In one of them, me and some guy were robbing a bank, and the guy ended up getting shot in front of me.

Could this maybe be because of past trauma? I had some traumatic things happen to me as a child, but nothing related to physical violence.

Ive also been feeling really on edge lately. 

Does this happen to anyone else?"
29,I need to call a stranger,"I need to call a stranger

I'm going through the worst medication withdrawal ever and my pain is on a 9/10 scale. I feel like I'm going to explode. 

If there's anyone out there that's willing to hear me fucking let it all out (I don't have anyone else really), I'd really appreciate it. 

Thank you"
30,How do I get closure from a break up?,"Long story short because of beleifs (non-religious) my girlfriend and I took a break because she felt she wasn't ready for a relationship. In a short few days she met a new guy at her work and they are in a relationship now. Meaning she broke our promise to get back together when she felt ready. This probably isn't the appropriate place for this but its constantly making feel depressed after period of feeling fine, I constantly find myself halfway in a breakdown and questioning what I did wrong and almost crying. Usually as I drive which is worrying me because if I were to tear up while driving that could be bad but I also notice that though im nkt feeling suicidal I constantly feel like I need to hurt myself in some way for messing up with her. I just constantly feel it was my fault. (I've never hurt myself during the relationship or had thoughts of doing so)"
31,How do I deal with self hatred?,"I hate my body and myself. My bf tries so hard to make me feel better even though he owes me nothing and I tell him that it's useless. I want nothing more than to escape this horrible prison that is my body. I want to claw my skin off and rip away all of my imperfections. There is not an inch of my body that I don't hate.

Yes, I'm in therapy.
Yes, I'm taking medication (it isn't working).
Yes, I am an otherwise healthy teenager.
I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphic disorder.

How do I stop my self hatred?"
32,[23M] Therapy and meds dont work. i want to die,"Let me start with this: all my therapy is (thankfully) covered by Medi-Cal. I have reported and compained about the two bad therapists discussed below.

My first therapist lasted for 4 months and we mutually agreed I wasn't getting any better and I saw someone new. She refused to diagnose me the whole tome though.

After 10 minutes, the new one said ""I cant help you. You're too complicated. I'm ending this"" and quit the Zoom session. I reported her and complained.

One week later, the new guy YELLED AT ME and said ""I have helped people much worse than you but you can't be helped"". I also reported and complained.

Now I'm 3 sessions in with another new guy and I like him but it isn't going anywhere at all. 3 weeks and he hasn't given a single bit of advice or homework or anything. He's gathering information but it's taking too long. 

He did diagnose me with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the first session, at least.

I have been on meds for 5 months and it hasn't helped at all and my psychiatrist just says ""it takes time"". He also refuses a diagnoses, only ""unspecified mood disorder"" sayingn diagnoses take time as well.

I have been depressed for 7 years. Since then I've only gotten worse: suicidal ideation, paranoia.

I also did therapy a couple years ago for a year and it didn't help (and that cost 15 bucks a session and wasn't fully covered like it is now).

I just want to die now.

Something or someone please just kill me. I hate being alive. All my life is is suffering. Please just let me die.

All that is wrong with my life:

1. Disability
2. chronic pain
3. inability to work with barely any government support as income
4. depression
5. anxiety
6. likely OCD and autism - need evaluation)
7. emotionally and verbally abusive parents
8. virgin
9. irrational fear of STDs and HIV (ironic because I really want to be a freeuse cumdump urinal slut)
10. debilitating paranoia
11. physically and mentally incapable of driving
12. financially dependent on my parents and their home
13. no PhD programs I can get into
14. no boyfriend
15. nothing to do in life
16. hobbies bore me (anhedonia)
17. no in-person friends (and inability to make them because I can't go places on my own)"
33,I dont know who i am,I'm writing to see if anyone is the same as me I'm 16 female and recently I was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia but I'm starting to believe I have more than that wrong with me I figure this out recently but I am a very very strong pathological liar. One of the reasons I believe is I didn't have the easiest childhood but I was okay but still.I lie about the worst things I don't even want to but it's just my brain forces me.I don't know and recently I've just felt more more anxious and I'm debating whether I have anxiety or not I don't have a clue anymore who I am I'm confused. what makes sense and what doesn't and i am worried about how people view me but a lot of people don't like me because they pick up I'm lying.but I physically can't stop it I've tried it just makes me sad and really it's difficult I can't talk to a therapist I had one for ages. I just cannot open up to people it's always been like that I don't know if there's something wrong with me or I need to find some professional help who knows. I just need to know if anybody can help me stop lying I've done so much research online to try and find why i do it but I still come up with the same things and I'm not narcissistic that they keep saying I don't think so. At the moment I'm starting to confuse myself what is real and fake sometimes I just cannot tell the difference.
34,My mother once was suicidal and again has mental problems.,[deleted]
35,Depression Support,I have been struggling a lot with loving myself. Some days I hate myself so much it scares me. Like I just want to die and stop worrying about my future. I have one year of undergrad left and hopefully afterwards I'll go to graduate school. I can't get that voice out of my head that keeps telling me that I'm worthless and won't get anywhere in life. I'm just so tired these days. I feel like every day is a struggle to be awake and present. It's difficult to think positively and hate myself less. Thanks for listening.
36,I'm finally deciding to go on a run tomorrow to try to get myself feeling a little better mentally.,"I dont have a bad figure or anything, I just think itd be good to finally get back to running again like I did in high school. It's been a few years since then, and throughout that whole time, I've probably been on a legit run only a handful of times. I LOVE to run, but I get extremely anxious from getting too tired or even too hot because it makes me feel more vulnerable and helpless.

But enough is enough. I'm sick of waiting for another job opportunity and sitting around doing nothing while my bf comes home from work and is tired a lot. I want to feel good! I want to get some well earned bruises! I want a break from what my mind goes thru every single day. I'm going to set a goal and do my best at it!

I'm going to use this to hopefully get my mind in a better state. I didnt know where else to post this, but I just wanted to get his off my chest. I'm feeling good finally having the determination and motivation to get thru this."
37,How to cope with a sick spouse.,"My wife and I have been married for almost 2 years now (together for 5) we have a beautiful 6 month old daughter and a baby boy due in December. Don’t trust birth control. For the majority of our marriage my wife has been in and out of the hospital with a variety of problems. She spent almost a month in the hospital before our daughter was born and every single night I was there I slept there hell outside of work I lived at the hospital. It wasn’t too bad they had a couch that converted to a bed and I’m an infantryman so I’ve lived off less. My wife was hospitalized 4 days ago for gallbladder problems. They’re most likely going to have to do surgery it’s just a matter of when. And they’ve discovered other issues since she’s been there. They’ve even talked about keeping her until our baby boy gets here. In the past I had no issue living in the hospital but now it’s different we have a child already I can’t stay at the hospital with her especially with everything going on in the world and I work in law enforcement now so I’m having to put in a lot of hours (that’s a different topic don’t hate me I’m a person just like you) I’m lucky enough that my family helps me and I’ve been able to go and see her for at least an hour a day but I don’t sleep I feel worthless because I can’t help her I can barely manage my own daughter without her. Every waking moment I spend thinking about her and wanting to be by her side but I can’t and I myself am starting to get physically ill from it. I’ve slept for 2 hours in the last 2 days and lost 8 pounds since she’s been there half the time I can’t keep my food down. We are only coming up on day 5 and looking at up to 5 months. How can I function while still being a good husband that’s there for my wife.

Sorry for all the run on sentences and any spelling errors. And for those of you that worry about my state because of my career I’m not naive I plan on taking a day or two away from work to get my mind right the last thing we need is a public servant/ law enforcement officer flying off the hinges."
38,My first time venting...,[deleted]
39,I feel like I'm falling apart.,"Covid has left me wanting, sure. But lately I have been having really bad thoughts about suicide. My new relationship is suffering because of my depression. I was told by a friend of mine to find my happiness, but I have no idea how to do that. I'm rarely only happy when I'm with my gf and we have to spend huge times apart now that the world is slowly coming back together. I need help but there's no therapist that are taking patients around me. What can I do?"
40,After a rough weekend my girlfriend checked herself into an inpatient facility. What are some good ways to help us improve our mental health when she is released?,"I'm quite torn at the time of writing this, I go through minor episodes myself but not to the same extent that my girlfriend does with her anxiety and depression. I feel helpless, and I know I can't just change her mind and fix it instantaneously, but I desperately want to help her maintain a better outlook and find joy in things again. The job market has been difficult and unemployment has really drained her, so finding a job she enjoys to occupy some of her time and help with the sense of accomplishment is on the list. Getting outdoors and in the sun more is there too, as is trying to find a hobby that keeps her or both of us feeling a sense of gratification and enjoyment. 

Are there any other things that can help us rewire our brains a bit so that we don't feel like we are just floating through space with nothing to look forward to?"
41,Having a game addicted SO,"Hello, 
I have an SO who is so addicted to games that they set an alarm for event and such in games they are playing. I feel like I am 2nd in their life and that they dont care about my feelings or needs. I feel that they and I have lost some if not all intimacy in our relationship. I get to the point that I feel the need to seek what I am missing with someone else. I have struggled with finding a place to belong for a very long time. I thought I had found it, but now I feel like I didnt. 

I can feel myself spiraling down a black hole again. Isolated and alone. I can feel myself drowning in my own feelings of worthlessness. 

I need help pulling out of this."
42,I'm happy but this is a depressing post,"My liver is failing and I'm letting myself die. I also have multiple sclerosis. My life has been full of abuse. I feel like it has been a punishment.

Not belonging. People being uncomfortable around me. Starving. Getting beaten. Watching my grandmother abuse her pets. Witnessing the sexual abuse of my sister. Getting abused in front of a room full of kids.

Being friendless. Not trusting anyone. Random people saying hateful things. I became abusive emotionally to my sister. To my mother. To other kids. I hoped it was a nightmare but I know its not.

I have so many terrible memories. I took on the abusive nature of the people in my life. I felt like a demon. I have done nothing for this world. I hope I find out there was a purpose. I know the pain of this world and maybe I can tell god and he will help you all. There is pain that seens insurmountable and there is pain that no one knows about.

Theres no good way to end this. I feel like I have a few days left. If you know of a way to change life for the better please do it."

45,A little vent.,"These past few months i’ve been feeling lonely and like nothings real. Im always out of it. I lost all my friends and I feel like nothing matters anymore. I havent text or called anyone. I havent gotten out of bed in 3 weeks. I just stopped caring. I also have been very anxious and Im just stressed about whats going on in the world. I always blame myself for the reason I have no friends. Its maybe because I push them away when I try so hard not to. I do it naturally, its my defense mechanism and I hate it. I draw the closest people away from me just because I am such a anxious and pessimistic person. I just feel numb right now but hopefully it will get better eventually. I mean it has to of course..."
46,How do I find a psychologist/psychiatrist?,"18F here. Pretty sure I suffer from anxiety, OCD and binge eating disorder, but I’ve never been to therapy or have been diagnosed and I think it’s time I do. I live in NYC and have a bunch of questions on how to go about this. Do I first go to a psychologist or just straight up find a psychiatrist since I’m so sure I have these disorders (and maybe others more idk)? How do I find one? I dont want my parents to find out, I don’t feel comfortable telling them this so how can I go about this?"
47,How do I talk with my mom about my mental health?,"I’m 18 and live at home with mg parents. My mom and I have a good relationship now, but it wasn’t like this until i moved out to college. I’m pretty sure I suffer from anxiety, OCD and binge eating disorder, never been diagnosed and never been to therapy or any psychiatrist. My mom doesn’t know none of this, she doesn’t know how I feel or nothing. And I’m TERRIFIED to tell her. I want to open up to her and tell her what’s going on, and that I want to go to therapy or see a doctor. But there are so many “what if”s in my head that I can’t do it. What if she gets mad that I never told her about this (she is the kind of person who would get offended for not being open with her about this), what if she gets paranoid about my mental health and doesn’t let me go away to college anymore, what if she doesn’t believe me (she was born and raised in a completely different country, where mental health is not “real” and it’s all in your head so I’m scared that she has that mindset still) or what if she asks me why I feel this way, why this is happening, and honestly idk why. It’s been going on for so many years now that I feel bad for lying to her and pretending like everything is fine."
48,Does anyone else have detrimental thoughts while they're asleep?,I've had this issue for quite a while now. I do tend to think a lot when i'm trying to fall asleep but the my concern is the thoughts happen when i'm already asleep. I'm prone to having nightmares too but I also have thoughts that wake me up. It's like my brain searches for new problems while i'm asleep. The things I think about wouldn't usually be a big deal but if they come to me in my sleep they become quite detrimental and I will fixate on them for days and it becomes quite distressing. Just one of these thoughts is enough to set off my anxiety and my mental health falls apart.
49,I just need to talk,"I’ve also been posting to r/suicidewatch 
I am almost certain I have bi polar (undiagnosed)
I am certain I have depression (undiagnosed)
Child PTSD (diagnosed)

Bipolar: I sometimes lose my cool and have outbursts of pure rage and anger. I also occasionally can unintentionally be a straight dick head. I wish I could control this. I’ve lost friends over that stuff.
Depression: sadness, suicidal thoughts, self hate, and a range of other shit.
Child PTSD (can’t remember name): was result of physical and emotional child abuse. I can’t trust anyone until they’ve been a positive part of my life for a long time and even then I can’t completely trust them. I envy those who can fully trust someone. Anytime someone touches me, even just a tap on the shoulder I jump and my first reaction is to attack. 

I hate all of it. I want to die. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. Not much is keeping me holding on. If I died tonight I could count my regrets on one hand."
50,Needs a talk please,I think I'm developing some phobias and have intense fears about particular things.I want to know more about it.Can anyone talk to me?
51,Mental Disorder?,"
Honestly, I’m just a bit sad. Growing up, my parents were emotionally abusive. Called me names, gaslighted me, and when I wanted to open up emotionally, they just didn’t care, or shamed me for it. I also wasn’t given much attention or was shown that I was loved. I experienced some physical abuse too. Just a generally toxic environment. 

But that’s all besides the point. I’m afraid I have issues because of this. I never thought I’d be saying this, but I’m kinda sensitive. Sometimes I feel as if my friends/family don’t care. And when I feel this way, it saddens me and upsets me, so I kinda get rude. Which isn’t good, and I always feel guilty later or apologize. I don’t ever want to be a horrible person, ever.

Sometimes I just get really angry. Like when my parents are yelling at me or badgering me, and it makes me want to lash out. But I just hold it in. I’ve pinched myself and stuff before, so I don’t punch anything. Sometimes I just hide my emotions. Never show them. Like inside I could be boiling, but never say anything. There’s times where I’m mad about something for a long time. I never like talking about my feelings, and I have severe trust issues. 

I don’t have many friends, or close ones. I’ve been improving with that, though. It’s hard since I have Asperger’s, but I haven’t let it hold me back, and I’m trying to improve. So, I have no one to talk to this stuff about. And sometimes if I make a mistake, I dwell on it for a long time, and blame myself depending on what it is. And I overthink everything, and am always worried about something. It’s not good

I’m afraid that I may have underlying issues, I’m just not sure what. Any advice?"
52,anyone else have these types of thoughts? *mildly* paranoia(?) related,"i apologize in advance if i sound ridiculous or annoying. i keep these thoughts completely internal 98% of the time. also i didn't know what mental forum this has to do with specifically, so i'll just post it here. i know nobody here is a doctor, but just let me know if you have a similar experience. obviously i'll talk to my doctor about this, but first i just wanted to see if other people have similar problems and what causes it for them. basically i take almost everything the wrong way. my brain immediately makes me think that everyone has bad intentions or that they HATE me. for example, someone could DM me on social media and my brain automatically assumes that they have ill intentions even if it was a completely normal DM ( in the moment i don't see these interactions as ""normal"" but looking back on it, i can see that i was being overly paranoid). i could order a coffee from a shop and if the person working there didn't seem to like me, i'll assume they did something to my drink. i don't know if i was imagining it or if it actually happened, but i was ordering a smoothie one time and i was convinced i saw the girl put something from the trashcan in my drink (i didn't say anything of course) and my bf at the time had to drink it to prove to me that it was fine. still wasn't convinced.  at my job (i work in food service), i fear that if i have a bad experience with an overly angry customer, that they'll come back and harm me. one time i thought this girl was trying to hack my phone all because she was facetiming me (which she never does), turns out she just wanted to ask if i wanted to go to the beach.  obviously i can occasionally rationalize with myself in the moment and realize that i'm digging too deeply into things, but it just gets so exhausting being this way. they say ""listen to your gut"" but i can't even trust my own gut feeling. there were long periods of time when i genuinely was concerned that a few people were gonna kill me, even though looking back on it there was absolutely no valid reason to be thinking that way. i'll assume a car is following me when it turns out they're just going the same way, or if i'm walking my dog i feel like someone's constantly behind me. as a child i was convinced there were secret cameras hidden in my stuffed plushies, so i'd occasionally open them and then stitch them back up just to make sure (this problem went away as i got older of course).  i know i sound self-aware but in the moment it is so hard to not be so scared. most of the time, while the thoughts are happening, i don't realize that i was thinking wrongly and irrationally until i look back on it once my brain is ""normal"" again. i just always feel like everyone in my life knows something i don't and the interactions are fake. there's a lot more i can't think of right now, but this is the gist of it. i keep most of this internal, and i have friends and i'm still able to have healthy relationships and hold a job and get through classes, but my brain just makes me so tired sometimes, like i can't trust my own view of the world"
53,Is there any antidepressant more known to help motivation?,"I currently take Prozac, but I still have a major problem with absolutely no motivation at all. I'm almost 30 and i just feel like it's absolutely ruining my life. I mainly take Prozac for anxiety as it never did much for depression. Antipsychotics  have been the only drugs that help with that in my case. That being said I stopped my antipsychotic over a month ago and seem to be doing fine mood wise. I stopped because I thought it was affecting my motivation and energy. It appears I was wrong, or there is at least more going on. Since I'm not feeling depressed at the moment I'm not going to bother go back to it. I realize all SSRIs for the most part are super similar, but i thought maybe the effects might vary. Are SNRIs better at helping the motivation aspect of depression? Or is it likely I need to look at a totally different class of meds?   


I have a doctors appointment tomorrow, and unfortunately it's only via the phone because of COVID, so I dont feel like I'll have as much of a chance to elaborate on how I feel, and in the past my doctor has been totally fine with me doing research online and then asking him what his thoughts are on certain meds. More often than not he's been willing to let me try things I ask about.  


The only suggestion I'm not looking for is Adderall. I already take Dexedrine for school, but I'm already on the max dosage and I only like to take it when I need to really focus on my studying. It's literally a silver bullet, but I don't like the thought of taking it daily, especially at the maximum dose which seems to be the only effective dosage for me, and I dont want my tolerance to go up. So if there is some none amphetamine that helps improve motivation/drive, that's what I'm looking for. I realize it wont be as much of a silver bullet as an amphetamine, but that's fine. I just want to not be stuck behind anymore. I'm trying to study to get into a program so that I can get my life ahead. I actually took about 3 months off of Dexedrine to see how much I could do on my own compared to taking the medication, and the amount I've accomplished in these 3 months is honestly probably less than 1 week taking Dexedrine. Not only was this disheartening cuz I don't want to rely on an amphetamine where my brain expects to almost have like an 'on switch' just to be productive, but I lost about 3 months worth of studying which means i'm probably not going to get into the program when I wanted to."
54,"Turning 18 tomorrow, missed out on everything."," I don't know if I'm depressed, but I have been very sad for a long time. Tomorrow I'm an adult. I don't have any friends, never been to a party, never gone out for dinner with some buddies. Never had a girlfriend, never held a girls hand, never kissed a girl, never had sex, never even flirted or gone on a date. When I say I have no friends, I'm serious. I have never had a friend, never had someone over to my house, never shot the shit over lunch, nada. All of this isn't for a lack of trying. I'm quite smart, relatively attractive, I have hobbies, play sports and instruments. I'm anxious socially but push myself to talk to people. People seem to like me, but never want to be a friend. I'm finished high school my graduation is next week, online, socially distanced. I don't even get to say bye to my teachers. The people around me have girlfriends and they go out to parties, go surfing and skiing together. I would be lying if I said I wasn't jealous. I don't want sex I just want someone to love, someone to hold and just talk with. Before you say the people in my high school are probably just drunk teenage assholes, they aren't. The vast majority of people in my grade are great, cool, talented people. I don't know where I went wrong. When I was a sophomore I told myself it was about how I looked so I cleaned up, got a new wardrobe and got super fit. I used to be insecure about my height even though I'm 5'11"". I've grown out of that stage and I understand that it's about how you act more than how you look. Thing is I act well. I'm kind and empathetic to everyone. When there are group projects I pull my own, but I am not bossy. We did a French class where we described everyone in the class in french anonymously, people said I was funny and sweet. I just don't get it. I feel like I have missed out on high school, and before you say highschool is lame and not worth anything, it sure feels like it matters right now. I'm 18 in a couple of hours, don't have anybody to spend it with. I don't have a party, not that I want one. I was supposed to go to university next year, and I thought it would be a fresh start. Turns out engineering will be fully online. I don't get to go to the campus, I won't be able to live in dorms won't get that experience either. For the next year, I will be sitting in my basement bedroom doing classes online. Won't be starting anew, just sitting here wasting my life. I'm fucking tired. I just want to be around someone. I just want someone to love me. Here's to being an adult."
55,I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I can’t get help,"For quite the while now, I’ve been struggling with EXTREME paranoia, I always feel like I’m being watched, I see things sometimes, I have frequent breakdowns, I have anxious habits (rocking back and forth ALL day, pulling my hair out, crying a lot), and I can’t concentrate on anything.
I would get professional help, but my family doesn’t believe in that kind of thing.
Does anyone have any idea what’s wrong with me? I hate feeling like this with no help and no explanation."
56,Is this just depression?,"I've been depressed for years but gave up on treatment awhile ago. I spent a year trying 7 different medications (SSRIs, antipsychotics) but none of them provided any results. Am I missing something? Is it not depression and the treatment didn't work because it's not correct, or am I just treatment resistant? 

- My sleep schedule rotates. I'm pretty much nocturnal every other week or so. 
- My appetite switches between eating all the time and not hungry at all. Each lasts a few days. 
- Sometimes I stay awake for 20 hours because I'm not tired, other days I have to take naps. 
- I'm always anxious and depressed except for a few days every so often when I feel like maybe there's hope for a future and I don't need to kms. During this time I'm not happy but I'm less sad than normal. 

Please comment if you have some insight or thoughts, thanks."
57,I feel like people will only take me seriously if I really kill myself,"The whole “you can talk to be about ANYTHING” or “feel free to reach out to me” is kinda bullshit. I totally understand that no one can expend themselves to point of exhaustion, but I feel so alone. I feel unheard and insignificant. I feel like if I died today, people would laugh. They didn’t expect me to amount to much so I proved them right. I just don’t want to be here anymore. I have nothing to live for. I really am a bad person and a joke. I can’t get over it like they tell me to. It’s not their fault because we were all teens. But it hurt nonetheless. Am I bad for talking about it? I have absolutely nothing to offer. Just a stupid fat slut who whores herself for money. If I wasn’t such a goddamn punk I would’ve done it already. I have not friends because I’m a bad person."
58,Did I have a psychotic/delusional episode? If so what does that mean for my future,"Today when I was at work, out of nowhere i started having delusions. I’m a cashier at a discount retail store (summer job while i’m in college) and today a customer started putting their stuff down and i immediately had a bad feeling. The items seemed to have some liquid on them, and there was a weird (not bad, just weird) smell, which i think was real but now i don’t know. when they went to pay, in addition to their change they gave me a round, penny sized sticky thing, which i thought was some sort of drug that would seep into my skin. These thoughts made everything about my mind completely different for a bit, and my chest felt weird and i felt dizzy and lightheaded. After only 5 or so minutes, the thoughts about being drugged went away, but this was by no means over. (My lifelong friend had a couple psychotic episodes the other month, and had to spend a week in the hospital twice. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was not the same person anymore for a while, he has recently started to become himself again but not fully because he is on medication.) For the next 25 minutes or so, i was just incredibly worried about this happening to me. My initial thoughts went away, but the general anxiety, panic and physical feelings in my chest and head did not. For the rest of the day since then, I’ve been doing pretty well, just occasionally worrying about the instance. I have not found anything anywhere on the internet about a psychosis episode that only lasts 30 minutes, so i am genuinely confused about what happened earlier. Maybe it was just some sort of panic attack, i’m not sure. If anyone has any idea and can let me know, please do. Thank you."
59,Why are suicidal thoughts the first thing I think about when I want to quit on something?,"When I think that something is too hard &amp; I want to give up my first thought is suicide...Why am I not positive and not willing to fight and keep going? I just want to give up. Why is my mentality like this? 24 yes old so. So this is normal at least, right? People think about suicide when something doesn’t go right? Just the thought I mean...not going a day without these thoughts and I am trying to make them stop &amp; at the same time I feel like they’re smart thoughts. Hard to explain 😞I just really feel like this is normal...people won’t admit it"
60,I can't forgive my family their stupidity and mentality,"I was smart at school and became my mother's trophy child. This led me to have inflated self-expectations but I was left alone to work towards fullfilling them and failed. The environment I've been set in didn't help at all:
The TV was on for all day and it is till today.
My family is thoughtless and impetuous.
No book reading habits.
No hobbies or genuine interest in things other than supermarket deals.
Several upbringing faults.

I am an adult woman unable to establish an adult life. I've been through therapies but I am still trapped in this mentality and cannot stop to blame my mother. I lost my intellectual capabilities, hope to regain them and I became my family."
61,my brother is different?,"i feel like he's different mentally. he's two years older than 6 (which is the approximate age kids develop empathy and the world doesn't revolve around them) but he still has that self centered mentality and thinks that if hes interested in something, he can touch it/mess with it. he never listens to us, and has an awful superiority complex for someone whos just a child.

he also extremely hates certain words/ ways of pronouncing words and refuses to say them. When we say the words /pronounce them normally he gets angry and throws a tantrum, often crying and getting a bit violent.

He forces my parents to do crap for him that he should be doing by himself, like eating with utensils.

a few examples of the sounds he hates are the words ""tongue"" or ""sorry"" and if we pronounce bottom like ""boddom"" (he gets really mad at that one).

so...  somethings wrong here, I'm just not sure what's causing this behavior. Is it bad parenting or an actual disorder?"
62,Is there a word for this?,"
Tw animal death?

I’m sorry if this has been answered before or has an obvious answer. 

When I was 11 I watched my dog die who was my best and closest friend. Before this I was a pretty happy kid and lived life pretty intensely and presently.

After that though things changed, I got severely depressed etc. But one thing I’m wondering about is a thought pattern I picked up where I felt like I was operating a character and not living. 

Like I never felt completely present in any of my life for a long time. Like I have watched horrible things happen in front of me since then and not reacted then had to remind myself to react because I’m real and this is real. Sometimes I just don’t feel anything and I can watch bad things happen completely passively, which I feel very guilty about because it’s allowed people in my life to be hurt or bullied without me stepping up. 

For a long time I didn’t really internalize a lot of what was happening in my life. I have moments where I’ll watch a bad thing happen, it vaguely bothers me like it would if I saw it on TV and then I remind myself to feel present and that this is real and I feel it the more intense and appropriate amount then. I have felt like I was a character kinda. It’s hard to describe exactly how it feels. Like I am watching through someone else’s eyes and it’s not completely real, like a tv show. 

I’ve heard of disassociation but this is different because that’s when you forget things and have lack of continuity?"
63,Please help,I have gone from being happy and lively to sat crying in bed feeling suicidal with despair and angry. What the hell is wrong with me?
64,Declining mental health during pandemic,"I’m (18F) from the USA, and while there hasn’t been a true lockdown, I have been self quarantining to the best of my ability. The only person I’ve seen for the most part is my boyfriend (18M) of seven months.

Before this, I was thriving. I had a nice group of friends, was always occupied with school, extracurriculars, and social stuffs, and I genuinely was enjoying life. Two to three years ago my mental health was horrible- for over a year, I felt hopeless and lonely and had plans to kill myself, but I got better. I never wanted to slip back into my old habits again, but that’s what’s been happening. I think it might be the monotony or the relative social isolation or not always being occupied. I had trouble with everything from the start of it around 3 months about, but it got really bad about three/four weeks ago when I had a panic attack that kept me up all night. Ever since then, I’ve physically felt myself deteriorate to the point where I can’t hold it in anymore. 

I’ve been getting so anxious that I shake multiple times a day, and I’ve been crying almost every night. Sometimes I start overthinking over something small and I spiral out of control, and sometimes I don’t even know why I’m freaking out. I’ve been upsetting my boyfriend because I keep asking if he still likes me/ if he still cares about me/ if he still wants to date me, and I don’t want to keep doing it but it’s like I can’t help it. I know he loves me, I just need reassurance constantly. He said he doesn’t know how to help and he’s tired of seeing me cry every time we hang out. He also said that he’s not going to break up with me, but I’m scared I’m going to make him resent me. I feel so guilty. I feel like I’m putting so much strain on our relationship right now and I’m so so so worried about losing it, both because I love him dearly and because I don’t know if I could handle having no one right now. 

Ive reached out to my 3 friends, but I’ve been feeling very disconnected from them. One practically disappeared, while the other two have been talking to me on occasion. I opened up to one of them about how I’m feeling a few times, and it makes me feel better in the moment but it doesn’t fix me. 

I set up an appointment with a cognitive behavioral therapist for a few days from now, and I genuinely want to get better. I’m scared and I’m worried that it’s not going to work. I can’t handle being like this again, I feel like I’m breaking. Can anyone give me some advice on things to do to get me back to normal? How to make the most of therapy, and what to expect? How to stop worrying about my relationship, and how to stop ruining it with my irrational worrying? 

I really really just wish things were normal right now; I’m sorry to all of those impacted by the events in the world right now. I know I have it relatively easy compared to some people, but I still really feel messed up. 

TLDR; social isolation and lack of constant stimulation in my life have caused my mental health to decline. I’m meeting with a therapist soon, but I’m scared and don’t know what to do to make myself better again."
65,What do you call episodes of depression that recur?,"8th going to 9th grader here. Depression started in 7th grade of loneliness, but I kinda just ignored it and got by it at the end of 7th grade. It came back in 8th grade, especially now at home; I get the usual major depression symptoms in ""episodes"", which usually last like 3 hours. During the episodes, I also babble a lot; my words are coherent, but I just repeat them over and over. Also, if an episode is really intense or depressive for me, I start to scream loudly and wheeze. There is about a 2 or 3 day gap when another depressive episode starts again, and I can almost predict when I'm about to have another feeling of depression again. The cause of each episode is just something minor, and from what I can tell it seems to be atypical depression (correct me if I'm wrong). Please tell me if this depression or if this is just a part of growing up. Also tell me if I need to really ask my parents to take me to counseling; I tried telling them about what I felt and they just said that it was a part of ""growing up"". I've read some experiences about the growing up phases, but all of mine seem to be more intense, more lonely, and more hopeless than those described online.

P.S. I'm also the type of person who's really bad at hiding my emotions i.e. I cry a lot or I get visibly frustrated quite easily. Doesn't happen with anger though. I've been trying to separate my conscience from my emotions to the point where I seem like an emotionless robot since that's what seems most ideal to me. Also I've been the subject of a lot of bullying; not physical, but mainly being ostracized by the school and people treating me as a social pariah. Also I'm the nerd in school.

P.P.S - Coping mechanisms: Cooking, especially baking pastry, bread, and making confectioneries help me calm down but by parents always don't let me do it since apparently I clean it up too slow (I clean my mess up in a day, maybe two if some things need to soak). Also, I've thrown all of the more dangerous coping methods out of considerations, and I'm not depressed to the point of suicide yet.

By ""major depression symptoms"" I mean a lack of interest in anything, hopelessness, loneliness, not general sadness.'

I also read something called functional depression that is similar to my case I think?

Thank you so much for reading up to here as well as offering support if you commented. Since this is a throwaway, I might not be checking PM's very often (or at all, it fit comes to my brain's ability to remember where I had written the login details)."
66,I know everyone has different experiences but can someone tell me if their college experience was better than their high school experience? I’m struggling to make a decision.,I want to further my education because I understand that it’s important but if it isn’t any better than high school than I’m not sure if I can put myself through 4 more years of that. I just graduated and at this point I’ve been starting to feel better than I ever have. My school was super cliquey and not always welcoming. I managed to make a couple of “friends” but I don’t even know if I’d call them that. Anyway I started a new job and the people I work with are pretty great. I work with people of varying ages and I get along with all of them. They are welcoming and helpful. I feel comfortable and am starting to gain some more confidence. I feel free to ask questions without being judged. Im able to talk and have a bit of fun with these people. The thought of going to college has me anxious. I feel like I’ll do well but the whole social part is what makes me nervous. I actually look forward to my work and coworkers now but I could never say the same for school. I feel like I’d just get excluded and be lonely again. I don’t want to be a loner for four more years. I really would like to make friends but it’s harder for me. I do struggle to make the first move sometimes. I’m someone who has never had much self confidence due to my history at my school. The thing that sucks is one of my favorite coworkers is going back to college after the summer so I’d probably be a little bit more lonely at work anyway. Sorry if this all didn’t make much sense. I’m tired and just kind of throwing my thoughts out there.

68,I just want an opinion,"I can’t be happy

For a long period of time (around last spring to now) I’ve barely been able to feel happy. I just seem to find the worst in myself and I feel like I’m helpless and alone. And I feel extremely shitty because I know a few people care and if I was gone they would miss me. But I really hate life. I feel like I’m losing my mind and I can split apart any second. It feels like an endless cycle where I lose my mind and break down then I feel like I’m better until I break down again. A lot of new things are happening this summer for me and I’m not going into detail but I’m scared I will be judged and I feel like the pressure of the world is collapsing in on me. I hardly find the will to sleep because I know my dreams will just be filled with dread. Everyday I wake up in agony because I can’t sleep because I stay up thinking about how awful of a person I am too. I can’t seem to find anything that I can do properly and I feel like I’m losing everything and am descending further into an abyss of madness. All of this and I can’t find joy that lasts a long period of time. I can be happy but it never lasts. I forgot how it feels to not be in pain. I just want to wake up knowing I will have a good day and people care and I won’t be judged on everything I hate about myself. I want help but I’m too scared to reach out and no one would believe me anyway and I think they don’t care even if I told them. I feel like whenever I try to bring it up with someone I’m close to I mess something up and I’ve been in a cycle of just ruining everything that I’m close to and I’m scared it will reach the people I’m closest to and I’ll push the away even I care a lot. I feel like I’m a burden on them and I cant help that. It just adds the cycle of self hatred and I look out more only to feel less like I can get something to help me. I’m just so scared of everything and I want to leave forever but I’m so scared. I’ve been on the edge of it so many times but I am too scared to do it. Because in the end I think I’m weak. And that’s what hurts the most. Knowing I don’t have the courage to do anything . I just want it to end and I want help but I’m not going to reach out because I’m too scared. Sorry for the tangent I just feel temporarily better because I could voice how I feel."
69,Is my behavior normal?,"I never went to a doctor because I always thought my anxiety is normal or like controllable. But recently I’ve been a bit worried that it’s not as controllable.

Whenever I’m overwhelmed I just start talking gibberish to myself or I’ll curse at myself or yell without even realizing. However when someone’s is around I can control it more or I’m more aware so I’ll stop myself. Idk y. So like I thought as long as no one else notices it’s ok? But I’m just not sure if it is. Do others do this?

I have also developed fears of losing my teeth and hair. I keep checking if have bald spots it freaks me out. 

I’ve also had a lot of rejections recently so it’s definitely worsened the anxiety and strange habits. I applied to grad school and got rejected. I have been having a harder time ever since I decided to apply again. My anxiety is just getting worse and worse I can’t even breathe some times, my chest pain started again, I’ll start crying for no reason, my head feels like it’s going to explode from the bad thoughts I’m so desperately fighting. I already feel like I failed again. But I keep telling myself no you didn’t just get everything in push through, you got this. I don’t want to go through the anxiety though so it’s making me not want to apply. 

Why do I have to feel like I’m dying just to apply?

70,My opinion about mental health,"My first ever post on Reddit

 

We intentionally / unintentionally do hurt people around us. It may not affect some but it does affect people without you even knowing how or why or when. Tbh I myself do not know how to get rid of depression , it fucks with the head in many ways. But we, being the fighters we are do try to fake a smile and lead on our normal lives thinking it was nothing/stupid . But before you even know it grows , weeks/months/years later it shows. And by then it would be really tough for you to continue normal lives. Mental illness is a real thing and I have always stressed about its importance . I am not a survivor but still suffering; with the help of a few friends I have done better and owe it out to them.

These two shows have been about mental health , both are different about expressing themselves but the last season is where it gets deep and concludes. My 2 personal favorites in this genre.

71,Today is one of those days where I really regret that I didn't die when I last attempted suicide,"I'll start by saying that I'm not actively suicidal right now, but I just really wish I was dead. My last serious attempt almost killed me, but my mom happened to come home early (crazy coincidence-- I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want to be interrupted.) 

I guess sometimes I'm grateful but days like today I just feel useless and shitty and I don't even really know why. I had a nice time with a friend, but the whole time I was obsessing over other friends who I feel like don't care about me. I feel like a burden when I try to reach out and tell people how I'm feeling because I'm *always* the sad or angry person. I've tried not to be. It just happens and I can't control it and I hate being a slave to my emotions.

Anyways, I'm just exhausted. Life is frustrating. 2020 has been a fucking nightmare. I'm enraged about everything that has been going on and just generally hopeless/tired of fighting. I just want to give up. I wish I hadn't lived to see this year, and I'm afraid to tell my friends because I don't want them to think I'm just trying to get attention. I need validation sometimes but none of my friends operate that way so I'm stuck feeling like I can't talk about my emotions and I guess I just needed to vent somewhere about it."
72,"First time posting here, just going through a rough time","I’m a 20 y/o male. I’ve struggled with a lot of sadness ranging from my parents divorce to losing friends to suicide to being cheated on and generally not being treated well. I’ve watched my sister and a close friend struggle with depression and self harm. Most of my life I was just the average guy I played some sports but mostly stayed in playing games. I moved states for about a year and did 11th grade in a completely different state across the country and I think that’s when it started. I had a hard time making friends and was generally alone most of the time. I eventually got sick of living with my mom and moved back to where I grew up with my dad. I went back to high school and got really into smoking weed, heavy drinking, dropping acid every weekend, whippets, and just being fucked up all the time. I went from the average guy to the one that was only know for his drug use which didn’t do well with the ladies. About half way through senior year I was kind of hooking up with my best friend but it was a little more but not dating. I over did with the drugs and I was traveling every week to go to a trade school 2 hours away. We ended that on a bad note and I lost all my friends because of it. I landed a job at a construction company and was making really good money. I didn’t have bills and was alone all the time. I started drinking heavier than I ever had. About a gallon of rum a week and this went on for 3 months then I got laid off and spent the winter unemployed. My dad was something else too he was always yelling at my and on my ass for stupid shit. I wasn’t the guy fucking either I was doing my best but it wasn’t good enough ever. That took a big toll on my mental health as drank myself to almost suicide. I put a loaded gun in my mouth multiple times just wanting to end it all and have the nightmare be over. I would also get drunk and cut my self too. I still have the scars all over my arm and chest and leg. Then my best friend who just got back from boot camp came back home and asked me if I wanted to move so we moved about 3 hours away. ( that was 4 months ago we moved) and it’s been ok not loving with my dad but I still have cut myself because I’m not happy and I want to feel something just to make sure I’m alive. I can’t seem to talk to a girl for more than 3 days or even talk to one. I feel as long as I’m not happy I can’t make someone else happy but I can’t seem to be happy unless I’m with someone. I had a crazy controlling girlfriend as my first girlfriend. I was then cheated on with the next 2 girlfriends and haven’t been in a real relationship in 3 years since the last girlfriend. I’ve messed up with a lot of girls because I can’t seem to not drink. I know that it’s all my fault but I don’t know what to do. My family has really bad mental health issues but I don’t want to go to a doctor cause I don’t want to believe I have depression or something else. I know this is really long but i have no one to talk to and this is the only platform I feel I can express how I feel."
73,Highs and lows after certain events,Ok so I get this thing where if I do something fun or something that makes me happy or hanging with friends or traveling I feel fine but then later on that night I get this really bad feeling of sadness and like a crash of emotions like why bother doing things if it’s going to end.

74,How do I know if I'm autistic?,"14M, have suspected I'm autistic for a while but I don't like to say I'm fully sure because a pet peeve of mine is self diagnosis. What are the steps I can go on to find out, or at least know what to look out for?"
75,Thoughts,"This word is far more dangerous than it looks. It can give you all the happiness and in just a sec it can turn all that happiness into a nightmare where you may struggle to sleep.

And this thing gets to work when you are making a decision. Should I really do it? What if it goes wrong? Maybe it’s the right choice but your brain will trick into thinking of all kinds of negative things around that decision.

Thoughts are the base point for the “depression” that is going on in the world right now. When you keep thinking about all the negativity around one thing and it gets worse and worse. You try to think positive but the brain doesn’t let you.

But thoughts are not that bad. When you are excited about something and motivated, thoughts will boost that motivation but tricking you into thinking all the great things that might come.

Now it’s up to you how you want to use your thoughts. A good way or the other way.

76,"Not really expecting a ton of help I haven't heard before, but I feel like I should post this anyway so I can feel better.","So, context:  (Sorry for text-wall)  


 About 2 years ago I got with someone, I'll just call them ""Ex"". Relationship was fine for a while, I had pretty big problems with insecurity, always sorta poking at my own image and looking for self validation. Both of us weren't perfect, but I'm sorta resigned into the fact the breakup was my fault. I never cursed or yelled at my ex, never directly insulted them or anything like that, but I feel like I was being a dick without really attempting to? I got called an evil, abusive, gas-lighting - mindtwister by the end of it by my ex, (Secondhand to one of my friends, not directly to me), and I know someone wouldn't say that just to be a dick, something is obviously wrong on my part. I was devastated by the breakup, and only THEN did I realize all of the stupid tiny little things I was doing wrong that all added up into pissing off my ex, and I begged them and pleaded, spamming their Pintrest and their friends to try and get in contact, I was crying whenever I thought about them, to the point of extreme excessiveness ( We had to see eachother daily in school ) But this isn't a post about trying to get an ex back.   


(End Context)  


It's been a year, I think, or maybe a little past that, since our breakup. It took me almost 365 days to actually throw away my ex's stuff, I kept telling myself no matter how bad it got, they would come back eventually if I was sad enough. I was suicidal in the first few months, but I was too scared to really commit to anything. In any case, My life is always going completely fine, and then suddenly I'll remember my ex? Like- I'll be doing random shit, and then all of a sudden my brain is like-  


""Remember your ex? You fucked that up. They were PERFECT, yeah they did some stuff to you but YOU were the one who ruined it. You will never find another one of them again. They were your soul-mate. It's your fault. Can't get with them again. Remember that instagram post you saw of them going to other countries? Having fun? Posting amazing selfies? That could've been YOUR life. But no, you're sitting here on your computer doing nothing, no wonder they left you. You haven't changed for shit.""  


I've read online up to six months for a breakup, varying levels of anxiety are normal, but it's been a year and even the mention of my ex's name makes my stomach twist into all kinds of knots. My friends are really agitated by it now and they always tell me to just ""not care"" or ""let go"", but I can't and I have no idea why. I've already pretended like I don't care for eons now, especially when I had to see them in school, but my heart refuses to actually stop caring. I'm not in contact with my ex every day anymore, but even the slightest mention makes me anxious to the point of vomiting or excluding myself from social activities just to try and get rid of the crippling guilt and anxiety I feel in my stomach. It's a mix inbetween feeling insecure about my own image, and a desperate longing to try and get back with them when I know 100% that it is \*OVER\*. My brain even tries to make me cry about it just by thinking it, even though I don't want to cry.  


This anxiety has practically taken over my life, I know I just need to let go, but I swear for the life of me I don't know how. I have another person I'm in a relationship with, and they love the hell out of me, but they also \*HATE\* my ex and talk about them constantly. I thought that would be amazing and give me self validation but it just makes me feel even more anxious, I can't even get in the mood when we're in bed unless I imagine my ex or people that look like them and I haven't told my partner yet.  


(I wrote this post because I recently had the anxiousness, I stupidly looked up their instagram after searching for images of their face for hours, and I have the pages open on my other monitor, they hurt when I look but I can't make myself close them.)  
How on Earth can I get over this? It's literally takes over my life at random times, and I just want to forget about my ex and be happy with myself."
77,Is it okay not to think about anything?," In winter i had the worst anxiety. My immune system was failing, my sleep schedule was ducked and it was just one of the worst times in my life ever. And ever since that time it feels like i can’t remember anything from that time nor i can think about something in general. It’s like meditating 24/7 when your mind is absolutely empty.

I just don't know what to do. Everyday I feel very irritable and feel a lack of energy to do anything productive. This feeling has been getting worse. I don't want to talk to my parents about it because I don't think they would understand; I don't even understand. I am currently laying in bed writing this, shaking my leg, and crying (with bursts that come with suicidal thoughts)."
79,How to cry ?,"I have trouble crying, and when i'm sad, i just can't cry but my heart always carry the pain. The only way to stop it is to cry. I feel relieved whenever i cry . I dont carry the pain anymore. I'm not a guy. If there is thing that can surely makes people cry on their own, just tell me what it is. 

Sometimes i cry suddenly when i listen to sad song, but its just sometimes.

Nope i dont have friend, or someone i can talk to this too, it makes me uncomfortable, so dont suggest expressing it to others."
80,Borderline personality disorder,Recently got diagnosed after going into ER after 3rd suicide attempt. Got depression and anxiety too. Tips on how to manage? ThNks
81,Depression again (possible trigger),I’m feeling depressed again after I was fine for a year roughly. There’s a lot of trauma that I don’t know how to deal with healthily and nothing that my therapist has said helps me and I’m beginning to feel hopeless and that I won’t be able to get over it. All through high school so about 2012-2016 I was told to kill myself everyday and called ugly and i didn’t get help until 2018 where I was diagnosed with mdd and mild anxiety. I just made this account because I can’t rely on anyone anymore even close friends and family. I don’t know who to turn to anymore. Please anyone
82,My Suicidal Sister(40) refusing help for treatable condition,"My sister was diagnosed with Lyme last spring after losing some sensation in her nerves or feeling some sort of nervous system discomfort in her limbs, and spent dozens of thousands of dollars treating her Lyme over the span of 2-3 months at expensive Lyme-specific centers here in the U.S. She returned home feeling worse. One doctor thought it could be CIDP and prescribed IV treatment for it. She discontinued it after the first few treatments, when her symptoms didn’t immediately go away and insisted it was Lyme. A few months later, tests from Stanford showed that while she has Lyme in her system, it’s inactive and not causing any ailment, and was still likely CIDP.  
  
She refused all treatment until a few months ago and tried the IVIG infusions again for 4 of 5 infusions in the week before giving up on it again. The doctor prescribed medication to help alleviate the symptoms, but she refused to take them for more than a day because it didn’t immediately help her. She would occasionally take one dose a day, instead of the three as prescribed, which obviously wasn’t doing anything for her except enforce her beliefs that hope was lost. The doctor said that her severe depression over this is what’s causing the most harm to her and she needs to get that treated. She's beautiful, successful, and vain, and feels that her near perfect life is lost forever. She's refused any sort of therapy or psychiatrist/psychologist. She’s been in bed for the majority of a year, and attributes her difficulty walking and weight loss, which seems to be normal for bed rest, to her illness.  
  
She has attempted suicide by hanging herself, fortunately she was found soon after her attempt and admitted to the hospital, but not psych ward. She was admitted to a psych ward a few weeks later, only when she sent goodbye texts to her family, snuck into her car, and drove away. She came back home after about 10 minutes, but the police had to take her to the hospital to make sure she wasn’t a danger to herself or others. I was told she wasn’t forced to take medication or see a psychologist or get any real help from the psych ward. From what I understood, the best they can do is make sure people don’t kill themselves. She occasionally threatens that she’ll try again, and last week she tried to starve herself but failed after a couple days. We don’t know what to do. She’s so negative and pessimistic and refuses to take medication as prescribed or try another treatment which might help her. Her daughter (22) has put her life on hold and been taking care of her for close to a year now. I’ve done the same, along with our mother, to support my niece for about 6 months now. My sister has had friends and family visit her and spend much of their time with her to try to get her to change her mentality to no avail.  
  
I feel that she might attempt suicide again soon/eventually, and even be successful. She says she would rather have cancer or aids, because at least that would kill her quicker. Or that she wished she would have died when she hung herself. Is our only option to call the police to admit her to a hospital every time she threatens suicide? She’s refusing any help for an illness that the doctor is optimistic about successfully treating. What can we do?"
83,Are there any person here diagnosed with GAD?,"Hey, how are you all doing, hope you’re all safe and taking care of yourselves and your loved ones. So my question: is there anyone diagnosed with GAD might have a lot of questions related to their mental illness because i have many questions too that i want to relate with others but when i see no questions about GAD-related then i don’t know if here is the right sub to ask. Don’t perceive it from a way that only people diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder can only understand me, i know most of us might relate with things that are common not only people diagnosed with GAD. My point is, can i ask questions about GAD in this sub. Hope i didn’t cause any hate after reading this post. Have a great day everyone 🙌🌅."
84,"History of sexual assault, emotional and physical abuse induces in me (29f) horrid panic/anxiety attacks that leave me sleepless for days.","Hi, I am fairly new to this subreddit, but I see a lot of people with more or less my issues so I am giving this a go. 

I am survivor. I had just turned sixteen when someone forced me to give up my dignity and most precious thing I had about myself. I never told anyone about it, it took me 12years to finally confess to my mother and brother, but weirdly enough that's not even the biggest culprit in my mental health. I sort of got over it in my own way, even if it means flinching when a male touches me, or carrying pepper spray in my backpack. I will also be undertaking therapy that will cover that part of my past pretty soon. But.

It's my most recent relationship, where I was promised mountains, given engagement ring six months into dating, urged to finish studies asap, and then basically shipped out of home to foreign country. He promised my parents, my brother and me that he'd take care of me, and he sort of did at the start of us living together, but as the time passed and he realised I don't really have anywhere to run, I am stuck with him at his mercy things changed very rapidly. 
I am not without blame, because once he stopped showing me any attention whatsoever, or any interest in spending time with me - I started looking for that outside our ""relationship"", and although it never got any further than a few, filled with genuine care and concern messages between me and another person I was immediately tagged as cheater, wasn't given any chance to explain myself and upon any argument it would be thrown in my face and used as final argument to defeat me. It completely took away my confidence, self-esteem and dignity. I started seeing myself as the monster he painted me as because that's all I ever heard. Like I said, I don't think I am without blame, but maybe if he had given me a chance to explain myself he'd understand that I didn't do it to hurt him, I was simply hurt myself by the lack of everything he showed me while I was still so far from his grip.

 I retreated from any social life, my social interactions were reduced to 12hours at work, I stopped asking if I can tag along when he goes out, I stopped asking if we could go somewhere in general, I basically completely withdrew from my life. I was reduced to cleaning/cooking, and if something wasn't done because I was tired after X amount of shifts in a row at work (used to work in healthcare for privately owned care home) I would be blamed for it straight away. I was forced to walk to and from work almost every time, whether it was snowing, raining or windy, I was always asked to do the shopping even though he was at home hours before me and drove a car. I didn't have any savings of my own because I was always paying for most of things, I wasn't allowed to question anything - he could stay up.on his.pc until 3-4am, but if I stayed up on my pc for half an hour longer after he had gone to bed, he'd be snooping on my laptop to.see what I am doing. I wasn't allowed password on my phone or tablet, I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone he didn't previously approve or was friends with. He had tremendous anger issues, to a point where he'd be screaming at me for the tiniest thing, punching walls and doors, which led to a very unfortunate event where weight lifting bar bounced off the door he smacked with his fist, flew right at me and cut my thigh. He was very apologetic but I already knew then that this will only get worse, so I started looking for a way out. Towards the end of this ""relationship"" it became his usual behaviour to scream at me, ignore me, show interest in me only if I had too much fun playing games with other people that he approved, it also became normal for him to throw in my face ""if I ever find out you're with someone else - I will find you and kill you both"" with a grin on his face. 
When I left I was blamed for every psychological issue he has now, I don't know what he told his family, but in my frantic escape I left quite a few sentimental items behind that I did not.manage to retrieve and probably never will, given most of his family lives in the same town and all of them use threats as jokes, and display anger issues on multiple occasions I think it would be very risky move to come over and try to retrieve my things. I did ask quite a few times, sent courier that was paid for the take my things but every time it was refused. He demanded that I come and take them myself. I knew immediately it's a trap and never agreed. It's been two and a half years since I left, and I still experience panic attacks that leave me lying in my bed until morning, convinced that he is standing behind my door, waiting for me to open so that he can keep up his promise. The amount of abuse I had gone through unknowingly is actively destroying my current relationship despite going through therapies. 
I don't know what I can do to help myself, I try and tell myself that he'd never do that, that it's very silly to think that, but I don't know what he is capable of, he was very unpredictable and unstable, last I heard he started smoking pot again and is accusing me of cutting himself, as well as dating another girl rather than looking for psychological help. I just hope for his own sake that he won't turn out to be that same person to her that he was toward me.

I am so sorry for how messy this post is but even writing this makes me incredibly anxious that he might find me this way. I just genuinely don't know what to do or how to free myself from his seemingly endless clutch over my emotional health. It's ruining my current relationship with someone who is so incredibly patient and understanding, someone who I genuinely think I can have good life with. Maybe I just wanted to vent, I don't know. Any advice or word of comfort is appreciated. And once again sorry for how messy this is - writing from my.phone while fighting anxiety attack."
85,I’m losing my mind,I don’t know what to do anymore my friends don’t talk to me anymore my parents don’t accept me and my depression makes my other illnesses worse the other person in my head is constantly yelling at me to hurt myself and today i lost my emotions and wanted to snap and have a breakdown I feel like everything I do is wrong and that I just want attention and that’s why I show off or that’s why I do what I do is because I want attention and it’s  taking a toll on my own self image and it’s driving me more crazy because it seems like everyday something I do wrong piles up in my head giving him more power and control over my actions.
86,What are some good ways to cope with anger issues or any kind of emotion related issues?,"My temper and overall emotional response has been fucked for some time now, its easy to make me cry or go completely psychotic when im mad and my mother is the cause for it and as much as I know that I need help, I can't get any right now so if there are any ways to help with this or help with staying calm and not spiraling out, I'd be glad to hear it."

90,Would anyone ever notice if I just disappeared?,So ive got low self esteem and bad anxiety.(great combo i know) I am non binary and asexual and my parents are anything but supportive. Ive never really had friends or someone that talks to me. For awhile now ive just been contemplating if anyone notices me. No one even looks my way. It makes me feel hollow. Im thinking it would be better if i just never existed. Im always telling myself to be positive but its kinda hard with no support of any sort. I just wish i didnt exist because i already feel as if im just nothing.
91,Struggling with Lexapro (Escitalopram) withdrawal!,"Reddit community, please help. I stopped taking Lexapro abruptly and yes, I know that's a bad thing. I am just not able to figure out if I am going through a relapse or if what I'm experiencing is drug withdrawal symptoms. It has been only around 2 months since I started taking it again (previously I had taken Lexapro for 6 months last year and went cold turkey on it but never really experienced negative emotions) I have zero energy and motivation to do anything, I'm always tired and I overthink about everything. I get panicky thinking everyone else is being super productive these days and are getting ahead of me but still find it impossible to get up and do some work. I just end up binge-watching movies on Netflix ( I feel like it's just an escape mechanism) I tend to wake up and sometimes feel the need to cry for no reason. I feel the need to scream about what's bothering me and making me soo sad but then I realize I don't really have a particular reason as to why I feel that way and it becomes overwhelming sometimes. Oh, and my stomach is always upset these days. If there is anyone out there who went through a similar experience please help. What has been done is done. Is there any way I can manage these symptoms and ease the withdrawal on my own? I really do not want to go back on medications since I felt like they didn't work that well this time around (which is why I stopped taking it) And since my country is under lockdown I cannot see my psychiatrist in person and I did not find it satisfactory to converse with him over a phone call. PLEASE HELP!!"
92,How do you make yourself Rest?,"Despite those nagging thoughts in your head? “I’m not being productive! This is boring. I’m wasting time. I could be learning something. Learning is fun. What will I have done by the end of the day? Nothing! I’ll have nothing to show for it.” 

UGH. I need to rest and I know it and I still don’t let myself. Why!"
93,I'm off my antidepressants!,"A few months ago I was on 30mg of citalopram, but since the lockdown started I decided to use that as an opportunity to reduce my dosage given that I needed to move out of uni for the time being and move back with my family. I am now not taking any more medication - my current dose is 0mg!

My dad said he is pleasantly surprised at how different I seem and that I seem more focused and more relaxed. I feel slightly less sedated/clumsy than I did before, but it's too early to tell if the difference is significant.

I thought I might share this small victory with people ^^"
94,What happened?,"I don’t know where else to post this so here goes. Anyways, whenever I’m in the car, my mom would let me steer from the passenger seat because we didn’t live in a busy area so why not? The street my house was on is steep and curves. She let me drive down the street, and all I can remember is her looking at her phone. This, in combination with me being always careful and antsy, caused me to scream at her to take the wheel. The thing is, she *completely* ignored me. I brought this up a while later and my mom gave me a confused face and told me that I wasn’t telling the truth, or something like that. See, my mom would never do something like that, but the memory was so vivid. This definitely wasn’t a dream. It is one of the questions I always have. If anyone has an explanation that would be great!"
95,Advice ASAP,"So I've been abusing xanax and alcohol for a while now. I'm always fighting with my psychiatrist at the moment. Cut most of my relationships off. She won't diagnose me with borderline, even if I obviously am. I am extremely out of control with no way to reach out to anyone right now. Been drinking, been taking xan not overdose risk but do you think it is worth going to the hospital to get hospitalize since it's been getting worse and worse for the past couple of weeks?   
I'm doing pretty unwell in this precise moment."
96,Switched at Birth?!,"I don't know if this should be posted here.

Recently I have been getting obsessive thoughts about being switched at birth, and that my parents are not the real ones. I know that I look like my brothers in some way, but sometimes I focus on the differences and tend to think the opposite. One thing for sure, the only way to determine 100% this didn't happen is to make a DNA test, otherwise there will always be a tiny possibility I was switched. I know the possibility is very, very small, but just imagining it could happen and that people make mistakes is disturbing.

Some of you would say that hospitals have procedures and that mothers will not commit a mistake like that, once they see you after delivery they will imprint your image in their mind and they won't mistake you for another baby. But just the fact it happened to others whom you can read about in the news, means it can theoretically happen to anyone.

How can I get rid of these obsessive thoughts once and for all?"
97,[trigger warning] Do you think your self harm scars are beautiful and want them to be romanticised?,I've been seeing ppl romanticising mental illnesses to the point they don't look at its symptoms and it as an issue.
98,My Sibling is on the way and I'm Worried,"I have been a Single child for 19 years of my life. About 2 months ago in the beginning of Covid 19 Lock down my mom was giving hints that she is pregnant they haven't officially told me yet but I saw her go to doctor for routine check, and I found some papers confirming this, and I overheard him talking to my father about this. Now here is the thing is a sibling gonna effect how they treat me ? because I've seen my friends parents treat elders children more roughly then the younger**.Also Me and my father are not that close we don't talk anymore for like 3 months because of my bad grade in school**. *So yeah thats my concern that my Younger sibling she or he might be their favorite children.*"
99,How do i cope with this emotional pain?,Right now i'm in a bad way due to emotial pain. I have server pain across my body and can't focus on anything for more than a few seconds and it feels like my entire body could explode at any minute.
100,How can I ask for help without feeling bad?,"tl;dr Never had a meaningful connection, which made me a socially aloof adult. Don't know how to function due to mental health. 

Ever since I (m, 20) was a kid, I've always had the idea that other people have it worse than me. It was emphasized by the problems my sisters had with my parents. This kind of made me detached, keeping to myself as to not trouble them and generally being the ""good kid"" that avoided getting into trouble so I won't be in the limelight of gossip within my extended family. 

That caused me to be emotionally aloof and have a hard time communicating with people since I always handled things on my own due to the fear of being ridiculed for not being able to do a basic task. I haven't had experience with professional help since my country (Ph) has a terrible track record with these sort of stuff.

I had friends and relationships before, and have tried reaching out to them. But I always felt like they didn't really understand or got tired of it. Eventually the communication got distant and I feel bad since I feel like I inconvenienced them more than connecting. I also feel like a burden due to my painfully boring lifestyle and plain stoic personality. I'm afraid that it will always be like this and I'll be missing out in my life, and might also ruin my career in the future. 

Thank you to anyone who read this wall of text and I hope you guys have a good day ahead!"

102,What is wrong with me?,"I had very hard times in past. But nearly for 2 years my life is going mostly good. But in this time when I feel alone or I am alone or I feel empty... Actually I dont know when, I start to think to much and think and do things that I would never do in a normal state of mind. I am currently in bad state of mind and I will probably delete this because when I turn normal I just start to think I am overreacting but I know that if I stay like that It will not be good for myself. I kinda want to stay like this forever but at the same time I dont. I know what to do but I dont want to talk to somebody. What should I do? I tried to hurt myself physically yesterday. I do not want it to continue like that but at the same time I want it to continue like that."
103,What is it like to be on Medication for Germaphobia/OCD?, I'm thinking about getting prescribed some cause of how bad mine is getting but I'm so scared of being zoned out from them. I'm also scared to damage my body with them cause i also have medical anxiety. At this point im considering anything to calm down this though.
104,I will never be happy with myself.,"I will never be happy with myself. Even when i feel somewhat good about myself, i see someone more attractive or more fit and i want to die instantly. I realise that i ain't shit.

I will never be happy with what i look like. With makeup, without etc. I will never be happy."
105,There must be someone else who feels the same,"I'll keep it as brief as I can.. I seem to be experiencing the same problems and thoughts all the time that are basically ruining my life. I literally can't enjoy anything anymore and it's more than depression and anxiety. In a nutshell here's how I would summarise it

1) I'm obsessed with trying to get laid. Like literally obsessed. I have a gf but all I think about 24/7 is trying to get with other women, travelling to get other women, running businesses to get women.  But the mad thing is, when i do have sex it's not as good as what you build it up to be in your head. I have no idea where this obsession comes from and it's there even when I'm getting laid. 

2) I'm from England and I have no interest in English women. Like zero interest. I only want foreign. What's the problem with this? Well, I only want foreign girls if I'm abroad. If I bang a foreign girl in London, I just don't enjoy it and I don't know why

3) I cannot stand normal life. Everything seems like absolute bollocks. I don't care about jobs, houses, material crap, but then I don't enjoy the little things either 

4) I'm obsessed with becoming famous or leaving a legacy. It literally drives everything I do. I think it comes from a huge fear of death and not achieving anything. 

Anyone have any ideas as to what my actual problem is? This is all completely ruining my life as my head is not in the here and now. I'm always dreaming about the future or making plans and schemes for mad stuff to do. 

Any help would be much appreciated."
106,How do I help and support my brother who has depression?,"I have a brother who earlier this year has depression (not yet diagnosed afaik). He used to be really productive, but now he has been finding it very difficult to do basic daily tasks or work deliverables. He used to be online on social media all the time and posts and tweets multiple times a day, but now he is barely online and takes hours or days to respond to a chat message. The problem is that he has been procrastinating on something he needs to do for work for over a week now, and the deadline is later this week. I can't just tell him to ""get your shit together"" since it will probably just make things worse. What can I say to him to help and support him to find the willpower to do his work? Also, I would love to hear any general tips on how to be supportive since I oftentimes find myself at a loss on how to respond when people confide about their mental struggles. Thank you in advance to anyone who replies."
107,I am so pissed of that it is so hard to get help where I live,"I've been diagnosed with OCD and I have recovered two years ago. But about a year ago it started to relapse and new mental problems that I haven't faced before started to arise (like depression, anhedonia, panic attacks, mania). I told my therapist about these problems but everything got stronger and old methods don't work. That's where everything started to go down. Throughout that time I begged for help everywhere I could but every recommended psychologist or therapist that could help me was unreachable. I guess it could be worse but I managed to get in touch with a psychiatrist so I've got the meds so that's the plus. But meds won't solve my problems only alleviate them. Also I'm not surprised because the corona hit just in time I had the chance to get help. I don't really know now who to blame. Me? Or everyone else? Now I'm sitting here withdrawn from everything I was doing because nothing is fun anymore. I am writing this to just feel a little better about myself as well as to talk with people and see whether someone had a similar problem or just talk about mental health. I am sorry for that rant you all."

110,I can't get help for my mental health and it's getting worse everyday,"I'm a 16 year old male and I live in a country where mental health is generally looked down at and I feel like it's only getting worse. I never really paid any attention to it until it started to really bother me at age 14, since than it only kept on getting worse. No one I know would ever take mental health seriously. I have anxiety and depression, but of course I can't get it diagnosed. To top it off, my family is also very religious and they follow a religion which I left years ago, but I have to keep pretending so I don't get thrown in the streets. I also don't have any friends, but I'm assuming it's because I'm so different from everyone else in this country. I also have tinnitus (constant ringing in my ears), but I can't visit a doctor because of covid-19. To conclude, I'm living my best life."
111,CPTSD,"Hello everyone. I know mental health can be a very difficult topic to discuss, but I wanted to share my experience with PTSD. I never thought I would be diagnosed with it, let alone experience the symptoms. My father is an alcoholic, and growing up he would go into fits of rage, show up to extracurricular activities drunk, or not show up at all. I never realized how much it affected me until after I graduated high school and started working. I constantly felt like I was going to be yelled at when I had done nothing wrong. There was a coworker who reminded me of my father, so when I was put in the same area as him I had almost unbearable anxiety. I isolated a lot and minimized human contact at work until I felt I was no longer human. I finally broke down when I woke up when it was still dark out, and thought I was in the bunk bed I slept in as a kid. I could see the bars of the top bunk over my head, even though they were no longer there. I completely lost track of where I was and laid frozen in terror until the sun peeked through my window, and I realized I was not where I thought I was. I also began having vivid nightmares, not about any particular experience, just vivid and horrific events that never took place. Sometimes I felt like I was in a dream at work, my surroundings only seemed like an illusion. Convinced I was losing my mind, I got the help I needed and am still trying to heal. It will be a long journey, but I am hoping to recover. I thought I was too young, but anyone at any time in their lives can develop post traumatic stress. This diagnosis is not just for veterans, despite society's assumptions. If anyone is struggling I have found Complex PTSD : From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker and The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk very helpful. The biggest struggle is feeling alone in the symptoms, and if anyone needs to talk you can message me if you want to. Thank you for reading."
112,Feel like I'm sabotaging relationships - help please?,"I have very unstable relationships with my family and friends and it's making my life hell.

My family want nothing to do with me because I'm just horrible to be around. I get explosively angry at the smallest, most random things. I'm so easily set off and blow up from 0 to 100. My mum says she feels like she's walking on eggshells around me, terrified that she's going to set me off. It makes life so hard for my family, and for me as I'm constantly self-destructing by ruining my family relationships. 

With friendships I'm able to keep up a facade of being ok. I can control my anger around them, but it all builds up inside. I get deeply resentful of any small thing my friends do to upset me. Sometimes I love them, sometimes I hate them. I'm a very jealous friend. For example, I've voted against new members at clubs at school to avoid my friends in the club getting closer to new members. I've not had birthday parties because I'm afraid to invite friends from different areas of my life (e.g. school friends, outside of school friends, etc.) and have them mingle and meet each other. I can grow very bitter very quickly. 

Today was a horrible day. A few days ago my close friend had his 18th birthday party, and I wasn't invited. He invited 20 people (COVID restrictions), and I didn't make the cut. Of course, I was devastated. However, other people who didn't get invited were able to manage their anger/disappointment/sadness. Me though? I could not handle it. Broke down, called the friend out on our group chat with mutual friends, and just snapped. Then at school today I called out another friend for not being there for me. I feel like I have a tendency to sabotage relationships.

Could anybody enlighten me on maybe why I'm acting like this, what it could be indicative of, or ways I could fix this behaviour?"
113,I'm stuck in an abusive household with no way out.,"Hey reddit.

I'm a 19 year old in India. Although I am technically undiagnosed, I have suffered a lot of trauma in the past. My dad is an alcoholic who abuses my mum a lot when he's drunk. She's not perfect but has done nothing to deserve this abuse. The words he calls her are quite hard to listen to. He has called me a lot of shit in the past as well, and we have had bouts once or twice.

Whenever he has an episode, I am deeply impacted by what's happened but as soon as his episode is over, I am somewhat normal again. I do not know if I was dealing with the trauma or just suppressing it. All this has made me contemplate suicide in the past (a couple of times) but have never truly acted on it because I want to get her out of this mess.

None of the people I know are on reddit so that is why I am able to post this here. I do not know what to do. It's getting harder to deal with each time this hapens. I have had breakdowns as well.

He drinks everyday and is a bit abusive but every 2 months or so, he goes all out. Drinking for weeks straight. All day. We have tried stopping him, getting him in rehab, attending AA meetings as well.

My mum cannot get a divorce or have a separation because of societal constraints. Also, our family business is also partially dependent on him. I have enrolled in courses which statistically lead to high paying jobs so that I can get out of this. But every single exam of mine has an episode just before this. I need to study at least 10 hrs a day but am unable to do so rn.

The last time he came back from rehab, I told him that I couldn't live like this and told him I was feeling suicidal because of him. He told me he couldn't stop drinking, alcoholism is a disease and that I should support him. I have tried my best but I can't do this any longer. I can't live like this. 


Please tell me-what do I do?? I have lost my faith in God as well, have tried everything, words like ""it will get easier"" / ""everything will be alright"" seem fake and false reassurance. Rehab doesn't work, I cannot escape this. I can't even go out for a drive without risking my life."
114,I think I have depression,"I'm writing this from the comfort of my own bed as in trying to process the revelation I've had yesterday. 

For about 4 months now, everything in my life seems to be falling apart - upon closer inspection the biggest cause seems to be my recently developed short temper. 

I have had depression in my teens for which I have taken anti depressants, but for years I've been fortunate enough to have gained confidence, I was sure of myself, outgoing and had a ton of hobbies. However my mental health has been on a steep decline and upon closer investigation I seem to have all the symptoms pointing at the scary depression: 

Feeling helpless, loss of interest in hobbies, insomnia, huge anger and irritability, loss of energy, fatigue, self-loathing, reckless behaviour, loss of libido, concentration problems etc.

I have been extremely distracted. Losing track of conversations, zoning out, missing things like not realising my car is still in reverse instead of gear 1 (even though I just looked at a big fat R on the screen). Forgetting conversations, names, titles. I'm insanely distracted. 

I have always loved me time and tending to all of my hobbies. These past few weeks I havent touched a book or piano or even a video game. Just dreaded the idea. Instead I've begun doing stuff that distracted me from my thoughts, as I dreaded having only myself for company (I used to love love this) so since lockdown was lifted I've been going out where I can way, way more. However even now I have started to withdraw as my insecurities are beginning to fill the cracks. I feel like I'm no fun to be around, like my friends are around because they're somehow sorry for me. Like I cant make a joke. So I am starting to avoid going out to spare them the trouble. I havent felt like this in years. I know its irrational thinking, but it feels so so real to me right now. 

I have been extremely irritable. My relationship with my parents has suffered, whom I always got on great with. Now I get frustrated with every comment. 

And biggest of all - my long term relationship is beginning to crack because of this irritability. I have begun to nitpick on pretty much everything he does. Everything frustrates me. I take things the wrong way, I lose trust when we argue. It has taken a toll on both of us and I'm so tired of being this way. I love him so much and yet I cant get over this frustration. He seems to bouncing off me now and is starting to take things the wrong way too. We both want to save this relationship so badly, but I dont know what to do. My inability to concentrate for long bursts isn't helping either, because as he goes back to conversations weve had few days ago - I cant remember the details. 

I've been eating like shit, stopped exercising and have had surges in anxiety + very mild panick attacks. I have started to disassociate for a few minutes when I feel anxious - for those who dont know what this is - feeling detached, distanced from reality and emotions. All you're left with is mild anxiety about the state of disassociation you're in. It is a stress response to limit the negative triggers. Doesnt sound all that helpful to easing stress though, does it? 

Recent unemployment due to Covid is likely adding to the stress, as my savings ran out too. 

So as you can see I have a lot on my plate right now. I just dont know where to start fixing this. Therapy isnt an option right now, with offices closed due to covid restrictions and my ass being utterly broke. I dont want to go on anti depressants either. I guess I'm looking for people who are also struggling so I feel a bit less alone in all of this - and suggestions on what to do which have helped people in the past. I feel so insanely alone in this, I am surrounded by amazing people but I feel like they cant relate or give constructive advice on a topic they havent experienced."
115,I don't trust myself. There's an anecdote in here somewhere.,"This is a therapeutic post to help me get some thoughts straight and to reach out to anyone interested in commenting. Thank you if you read and thank you if you comment, but this is more just to get my head and heart on the same page. It's long and a little convoluted. But here it is.

I ran away from home at 23.

I didn't realize it at first, but yea that's almost exactly what I did. Just not from my parents home, but from my hometown. I thought I was running towards a solution by moving 15 hours drive from anyone or anywhere I'd ever known. I thought I could find a solution to my addiction to alcohol and anything that got me high. I thought I'd finally solve all my big problems. I sort of did.

Before the move I'd lay in bed after a day/night of drinking and smoking, torturing myself to sleep. 

In my mind I would place my childhood self in a corner and begin to loom over myself. I would make myself like those shadows I used to see in my bedroom corner as a child. Paralyzed with fear and helplessness. I tried to do to myself what those shadows did to me. Threatening myself with pain and death; murdering every scrap of love and joy inside of me because I didn't deserve it. I would call myself the weakest, dumbest, most gullible, least capable, least liked, most annoying person in existence. It goes without saying that there were plenty of thoughts of suicide and self abuse. One night in particular, when I got the closest, I had gotten in my car to drive to the Memphis-Arkansas bridge and jump. I gave myself a scar on my hip to remind myself of that night.

The things that stop me are sobering guilt and learning from others who have already ended their lives. They leave a trail of Destruction in the wake of their suicide and Destruction is a very close relative to whatever it is that made me this way. Destruction had become a habit I was very familiar with and I developed a skill in it through constant thought and daily practice upon myself. 

But I am a lover, not a fighter. You can see the problem when the way I was living was full of hatred. That's where the alcohol helped because it helped me slowly let go of my heartache with my parents and extended family. I had a nice life, but even my mom admitted to not really being able to love me. Alcohol helped me forgive and forget. But now that I have, it's time to move on.

This coalesced into one very big and very swift decision: moving to Tennessee. I moved 15 hours away from my hometown to live in Memphis, TN in what seemed like a week, but was actually about a month or so. I was so lost in a haze of weed, alcohol, and acid that I didn't really realize what was going on... I just said, yes I'll move to Memphis with you (my friend) and then boom there I was.

I was leaving everything behind. Trying to do better than I was. And 6 years later I am still unpacking that crazy mess.

I feel I may have failed my friends and family when I moved and of course because I developed a bad habit and a polluted heart. 

I choose to fight like hell to gain ground in being free from anxiety and fear; the control they have over my actions and the pain it so clearly causes in my friends and family who seem to take it personally. And I don't blame them. My parents deserve it. They didn't show me how to love but how to hate and to fear. But for all of their decisions during my younger years they are merely human mortals and deserving of forgiveness in all things. 

As a kid and teenager, my friends were loving enough to listen to my endless goings on about my sadness, even when it was completely irrelevant or untrue. I became addicted to the emotional release of talking about my problems. But now? Now I'm far away, not being loud, crazy, and energetic. Not being a comedian to my friends. Not lovingly encouraging and gently pushing them towards their greater growth. Nope. Just slowly losing life in a city that's only barely home.

I'm having a mid life crisis and I'm not even 30 yet. I guess it can happen at any time.

There's a short list of important things that have happened to me. At the top are my friends and my girlfriend. She saved me. She fought for me. She sacrificed more for me than she'll ever admit to. I love her like a sister and a mother. I love her like a friend and a partner. I couldn't have changed in the ways that I needed to without her. 

But, I am afraid that I am avoiding my future by staying in Memphis. She says when she gets a better position at work we'll move back to my hometown with me so it would be easy to find a good paying job. But, that's 2-3 more years. Can I wait that long? Maybe. Could be a good time to continue saving. Or, a waste of time not connecting to important people from my past, face to face.

I want to farm. I want land and crops and animals. I want mud and dirt and loud noises. I want wiry muscles from years of hard labor. I want to be a life time learner and a life time grower. I want to give more than I get. I want to be on my own, but I want a community. I want achy knees and a favorite walking cane. I want to work for myself but have some help to keep me from being subject to my own idiotic decisions. I want to work with like minded hippy business men and women and buy abandoned plots in cities and repurpose them to encourage social change: healthy families, financial and legal aid, courses on how to handle children, money, heartache and stress, understanding yourself and others. I want to make enough money to focus on humanitarian goals and self sufficient lifestyles. I want to change my tiny piece of the world to encourage others to live with love on the forefront of their conscious thoughts through all of their most difficult choices. I want to encourage wisdom and togetherness.

I'm afraid of running from Memphis because I might just be repeating the failure I think I committed when I ran from home.

I want to believe that if I ran back home I could start over, acquire some land, get to work, and make my dream real. That way I'd be close to the ones I think of all the time and they would share in my joy. 

But I do not trust myself. I constantly think things and then my brother, friend, or gf talks to me and helps me see how what I'm thinking is off base.

I blame the alcohol and drugs. They've made me slow and crippled by decisions. 

I don't know how to end this. I'm just glad to get it out there in the world and not stuck in my brain. Today I'm going to try to make it my best. I'm finally coming out of my shell and I'm actually hanging out with some people today. I read today that many successful people think in terms of decades and not individual years, so that's what I'm going to contemplate today. 

Thanks"
116,How do I ask for help?,"I have a very close friend even though we have only know each other for 1/2 a year really they were the first person I told I was self harming and thinking about killing myself. They themselves have been though a lot and have self harmed they want to take me to get help but now they are really busy and don’t have the time. I thought they wanted me to get help so I have been trying to get help by myself but every time I start walking there I shake, literally vomit and cry ect I want to ask them to take me I just don’t have the guts I don’t like self harming and blood I do it because I deserve it. I don’t want more people to know that I’m self harming bc I’m normally the friend people come to for advice and help I just don’t want people to know that I’m hurting bc I have always been the stable friend in the friend group. How do I ask them to take me there without bothering them? (I have already posted this in self harm but no one really responded I thought it might make more sense here)"
117,"I think I have burnout, but I don't know what to do","I'm the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exausted.

I work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing, taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the begining of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9 p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really commom (or not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides all that the coronavirus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgeting any information

I asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing carrers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions and asking if I have a solution too. There was no empathy to my feelings.

I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.

TL;DR: I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to alot of clients, going through a lot of stressful situations (like averting cancellations). Now I'm feeling really down about my work and myself latelly, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away."
118,I'm scared to go outside,"I come from a very small city, everyone knows everyone, you know the drill. I've been bullied for being fat since middle school and all through highschool (im a 17y/o female) so as you might imagine, I have practically no friends in my hometown. Everyone knows me as the fat lesbian chick (not a lesbian but hey, sure, whatever you say). Recently I've lost the only person that I considered a friend here. Now this person got all her new, better friends to create a shit tone of instagram accounts and anonymously harass me(call me names, threaten me etc.) I'm constantly anxious. I feel like I have no one to talk to during this quarantine, for almost a 100 days Ive been sitting in my room, scared to go outside. If I wanted to go for a walk I'd see at least one/two of my past bullies and have to relive all these memories again. I'm awful at confrontations so all I'd be able to do is walk with my head down and pretend I don't see them when my heart is racing and I feel like I'm gonna die at any second. It destroys me mentally, I find myself constantly and constantly thinking about that ex friend of mine, her new friends, all my past. If anyone has any tips for dealing with this sort of a situation, any advice for somehow moving on and living your life - I'd truly appreciate it. Reading reddit posts, or more so listening to them on yt/Spotify helped me a lot so I figure I might as well try."
119,My genetic flaws have prevented me from ever being normal and life is getting fucking harder everyday.,"I won't sugarcoat it, I have a smaller than average dick.  It is literally so depressing to look down at each and everyday and know that women are disgusted by me.  I didn't get to choose this.  It wasn't my decision to be small and therefore less deserving of love.  I honestly just wish I had passions or hobbies that consumed me so that I would never think about all the sex I'm not going to have.  
Don't hit me with a size doesn't matter post.  It obviously does.  Sorry for the rant.  I'm just my usually angry self today."
120,Do you ever find that music stirs feelings inside of you that you don’t want to feel?,"For fear of losing it and not being able to come back to calm and focus and losing yourself later on in the day if you listen to too much as a result? Is this a sign of how bad music can be for you, if you get too unwell mentally before going into it?"
121,My mental health....,"I have dealt with ADHD and depression for a few years now and have learnt many lessons from my mental health &amp; how to maintain it. I know that this is such an overstated and frequently answered question, but what is a foolproof and trustworthy way to feel “better” in a state of depression ?

(Better suggesting a more positive frame of mind and positive outlook on life)"
122,Confronting a Friend about Their Hypomania,"I need help knowing how to appropriately ask my friend to consider the possibility that she had bipolar disorder. 

 She has been struggling with severe general anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and depression for about a year now, and has been receiving therapy and medication for about 7 months now.  Luckily, in the last 2 months, after adjusting to quarantine, her depression and anxiety have subsided ... basically entirely. I was very happy for her, but i spoke to her a few days ago and I am now concerned that she is hypomanic (I don't think she is manic but i also haven't been able to observe her in person because of the quarantine.  She is showing many symptoms, and I also know that Bipolar Disorder runs in her family. I want to suggest to her that she may be going through a hypomanic stage with sensitivity, but I'm not sure how since we aren't seeing each other in person.  I also am afraid that she will believe that I am reacting to her not being depressed for the first time in a long time as a different illness and feel like I am judging her or don't believe that she can be ""normal"".  We've discussed her mental health a lot of the years but this is different, and I don't know how to bring this up with her when she is so happy with the way she is right now.  If anyone has any advice or experience in a situation like this, i could really use your help."
123,I've finally started talking to someone and now in not sure what to do.,"I finally started talking to a therapist who had diagnosed me with several different disorders and I have no idea where to start to tackle them. I was diagnosed years ago with bi polar disorder, anxiety and depression but she recently diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder, intermittent explosive disorder and PTSD. I've felt so lost in my own head for years and knowing some of what's been going on has helped, but not very much. Honestly, I don't even know where to begin trying to help myself, so any thoughts or suggestions would be most welcome at this point."
124,Is there a word for experiencing multiple emotions simultaneously?,"TL;DR: there a term that anybody knows of for feeling two or more conflicting emotions at the same time? 

For context, I have clinical depression and suspected BPD (in the process of getting a diagnosis). I was made redundant on Friday, from a job which was extremely detrimental to my mental health. Today I feel... weird. I can't put my finger on it, and was wondering if there's a word for it? I'm swinging between total elation, to the point where I nearly cried with overwhelming joy that I never have to go back there to enveloping fear and anxiety. I've got adrenaline rushing through me and almost feel sick with horror at the predicament I'm in, but simultaneously giddy with joy. 

Honestly I've never experienced such extreme coinciding emotions. I feel physically weird and almost lightheaded and like my veins are alight with energy. 

Is this a thing? What is this thing I'm feeling? Sorry for the rambling post!"
125,Got social anxiety? Want limitless confidence? You need to read this!,You too can be freed from social anxiety the way I was! Here is how : https://www.lancesinclair.com/blog/2020/6/15/confession
126,Went to Therapy for the First Time!,"I finally worked up the nerve to go! I've never felt so understood, and I ended up bawling my eyes out. She said it's so good that I'm finally reaching out to get help for the first time. I hope things get better, and I feel like they might for the first time."
127,I always believed I was smart.Turns out I'm just extremely manipulative,"I'm a 28 year old girl.I've always been insecure about many things,but one thing that made me feel better was that,in my head,I was smarter than most people.I could easily see through people,their weaknesses and soft spots. Pretty much everyone seemed weak and beneath me.
When I was a kid I realised I didn't really get along with others,I couldn't really get how social skills work,or humour.When I got into uni I realised that my whole life I had a pattern when I chose my friends at school.I would always target the kid that was intellectually weak and had no friends,so they would depend on me and do what I wanted.I had also found some interesting ways to get out of trouble and I ve been very careful about how and when I used them.
For example,when I was 8 I beat up a kid and immediately ran to find my teacher, crying and saying how awful I felt about what I did.All lies.When the kid went to the teacher to tell on me,he was yelled at and I was praised for my courage.

I've done much worse since then of course,but what ""worries"" me is how early it started and how natural this was for me.
Kids never liked me,but teachers and principals did.Today,all my friends at work are managers.I talked my way out of jail when I was arrested for cocaine possession.I ve tricked so many people into thinking I possess specific skills when in reality I don't.I've been cruel,very cruel and emotionally abusive.
Empathy is not my strongest aspect.The only reason I probably wouldn't kill someone is because I don't want to end up in jail,although most of the time I see this as the fastest and most effective way to get someone out of the way.

I never really cared to see these things until now.Being an adult can really be a slap in the face,and my recent experiences made me redefine what I saw as ""being smart"".I don't think I'm that smart anymore.Im not dumb either,just mediocre.The only thing I'm good at is making people see what i want them to see in me.
But this made me realise that there is nothing else there.I'm just a con artist.I don't know what I want to do with my life,as I don't like anything or anyone deep down.I don't really have opinions.The only times I felt something strong for anyone were just toxic and psychotic feelings.

I'm not gonna lie,I don't really feel bad about the things I've done.For some reason I can't.But i know something is wrong and I want to know what it is.I'm tired of wasting my life feeling like an empty shell, detached from everything.Ive considered therapy but I cannot afford it at this moment.Has anyone experienced anything similar?Any suggestions on what could help?"
128,I fucked up real bad. Slandered someone behind their back and I just don't feel like living anymore. I want to remove myself from everybody's life because I am the toxic one and I don't deserve their love and care.,"I don't know what to do, where to go, or how to deal with this feeling. It's just too overwhelming. I did not want to hurt anyone, it just happened and i feel extremely sorry."
129,Are there ways the mind essentially takes over when you feel too much of anything negative?,"I'm wondering what happens in such situations. I've read that different things happen to different people. Psychosis can appear after trauma or from severe stress. Some people fall into daydreaming to escape. Sometimes you feel emotionally numb all of a sudden. &lt;&lt;&lt; This one happens to me a lot. 

I hate it but sometimes I wish I could escape what I feel somehow. It's awful to think this way but sometimes it feels like my mind is sick but also really strong because I haven't cracked yet. I should be thankful for that but sometimes I wish it would all just stop. And sometimes I question if I'm really as depressed as doctors and professionals say I am. Sometimes I feel like such a fake, though I know I have the symptoms and such. I don't know. I apologise in advance if I said anything insensitive or ridiculous in this post."
130,"freaking out, on edge","idk i guess i just need some advice or something

feels like im a horrible person with things i just cant fix."
131,Physical Disability has made me second guess everything,"I'm a 26 yr old male with a case of Ataxic Cerebral Palsy, it never really bothered me until I was about 6 when I accidentally pushed someone over, causing there chin to split open (made worse by the fact that it was my first crush). When I was 13 started thinking that I only had friends because people took pity on me. I used to deal with my negative thoughts by telling myself that I was fortunate to have some motor skills. Turning 15 I wanted to start dating but never tried because I was scared I would get rejected because of my disability, now I am ashamed for not having any experience."
132,should i go back to therapy?,"recently, my mom brought up the possibility of me going back to therapy. the reason she gave was something along the lines of “You haven’t talked to anyone in a long time”, but i’m pretty sure i know the real reason. ever since the shutdown, my life has been considerably worse, to put it in a sentence. however, the last time i went to therapy, i was genuinely depressed. like, there were times when i contemplated suicide. all of that is behind me now, and i don’t like to dwell on it. i’m afraid that if i do go back, and the therapist doesn’t find anything wrong, then all of it would be a waste of time and money. and if there’s two things i hate, it’s wasting time and wasting money. i probably should add more to this post, but i’ve been rambling nonsensically for a while now, so i’m just gonna stop."
133,I believe that inanimate objects have something against me. Am I crazy?,"There are objects in my house that I believe to hold some kind of grudge against me. When I take a shower, the water is always freezing cold despite there being nothing wrong with the boiler. My siblings and parents have all said that there's always hot water when they have showers but for some reason, it's always cold for me. Same with all of the taps in the house. 
My books and pencils like to randomly develop weird textures that make it hard for me to write and/or draw. They're not low quality so the quality isn't the problem. 
My guitar falls from its stand quite often but only when I'm alone. I've checked and the stand isn't broken in anyway and I always make sure my guitar is stable when I leave it but it still happens. 
My tablet glitches severely but when I show it to someone, the glitches go away. 
Even the rug is mean to me and keeps bundling up when I walk on it but no one else in my house has a problem with it. 
I feel like everything wants to ruin my day but that can't be because they're all inanimate objects. Am I going insane?"
134,Afraid I Have Issues?,"Honestly, I’m just a bit sad. Growing up, my parents were emotionally abusive. Called me names, gaslighted me, and when I wanted to open up emotionally, they just didn’t care, or shamed me for it. I also wasn’t given much attention or was shown that I was loved. I experienced some physical abuse too. Just a generally toxic environment. 

But that’s all besides the point. I’m afraid I have issues because of this. I never thought I’d be saying this, but I’m kinda sensitive. Sometimes I feel as if my friends/family don’t care. And when I feel this way, it saddens me and upsets me, so I kinda get rude. Which isn’t good, and I always feel guilty later or apologize. I don’t ever want to be a horrible person, ever.

Sometimes I just get really angry. Like when my parents are yelling at me or badgering me, and it makes me want to lash out. But I just hold it in. I’ve pinched myself and stuff before, so I don’t punch anything. Sometimes I just hide my emotions. Never show them. Like inside I could be boiling, but never say anything. There’s times where I’m mad about something for a long time. I never like talking about my feelings, and I have severe trust issues. 

I don’t have many friends, or close ones. I’ve been improving with that, though. It’s hard since I have Asperger’s, but I haven’t let it hold me back, and I’m trying to improve. So, I have no one to talk to this stuff about. And sometimes if I make a mistake, I dwell on it for a long time, and blame myself depending on what it is. And I overthink everything, and am always worried about something. It’s not good

I’m afraid that I may have underlying issues, I’m just not sure what. Any advice?"
135,I have a question,"To all the people who have been through a tough time, did you feel like going and talking to others or did you hide your feelings because you were afraid?

I am seeing a lot of people post on Instagram about how they are always there for people, but do the people really have enough courage to seek help?

Just wanted to know your opinion on this issue :D"
136,"How do I find out if I really have depression, anxiety, bipolar, or self destructive habits?","So I’m in the middle of my teenage years, and I’ve recently felt like I could possibly suffer from depression, anxiety, bipolar, and self destructive habits. I think I might have depression, because I cry several times a day for extremely stupid things like looking in the mirror, or breaking something. Lately I can also literally never fall asleep and I longer enjoy many of the things I used to enjoy. I also don’t enjoy things like chips or cookies, and doing things like playing video games just feels like a routinely thing I don’t really enjoy much anymore, and I can only do things for an hour at a time before I lose interest. I’m can’t really list the reasons I might have anxiety, but I still feel like I might possibly have it. I think I have bipolar because I have the most extreme sudden mood swings over practically nothing. I also have extreme sudden bursts of energy and randomly become all tired and sloppy again. I also randomly decide that I’m gonna quit bad habits, go outside, excercise everyday, and eat healthier, and then I forget about it all in like an hour or two. I’m not as certain on having self destructive habits as much as the other 3, but I do find myself ruining things for myself and doing stupid things for practically no reason. I don’t know where to go, or what to do, or who to talk to, and every time I search up if I have it or not, I feel like some overreacting, self centred, attention seeking asshole for whatever reason. I just need help finding out whether or not I actually have these."

140,Starting BetterHelp therapy. Is kicking off with a 2000 word essay on my mental health background a good idea or bad? Will it negatively affect my counselor's compensation?,"I recently learned my student health insurance fully covers Betterhelp counseling, and I'm working on figuring out how to get that started. In the meantime, I'm writing a detailed account of my mental health background and current situation with the plan of sending that to my counselor right off the bat. In my experience with in-person therapy, the most frustrating thing about starting with a new therapist is that it can take a few sessions to get them up to speed on the basics, and only after that do the sessions become helpful. They have you fill out a detailed questionnaire which helps with that, but there is no similarly detailed questionnaire on Betterhelp. So I'm already halfway through typing out basically an essay on the relavant details of my background and current situation to send to my counselor once I get Betterhelp up and running. I figure this is a good way to take advantage of the textual format to get my counselor up to speed quickly. However, I want to make sure my counselor gets compensated as fairly as possible for their time. If sending this wall of text instead of having a back and forth would negatively affect their pay, I don't want to do it. Does anyone know if that is the case? Or is there any other reason this is a bad idea?"
141,I don’t know what to do,"My life is a complete mess

They notice my indifference and would rather me not be there than be a daunting presence. I'm so angry all the time and find joy in nothing.

144,I think I need help,"Hello everyone!  
I am 27 years old and have the following problems: I got my master's degree in Sociology 2 years ago. Since then I have changed 2 jobs (in the profession) - I was a replacement for both jobs. I don't have a job at the moment, which is my biggest problem because I strive for success and business achievement, and due to various circumstances (but also myself), it is very difficult for me to achieve at the moment. In a month I am getting married and I feel like this is the worst period of my life. The boyfriend (future husband) is full of understanding and support for my daily mood swings. Mood swings had happened before, but to a lesser extent (probably because I had a job then, so it wasn’t some source of trouble). I’ve always been a bit introverted, so I guess that has something to do with the aforementioned problem as well. Also, a year ago I became a Ph.D. student in Sociology, which made me very happy at the time - but now I don't have the will for anything.    
Sometimes I feel completely incapable of everything and wonder who I am. As if I don’t recognize myself and as if I don’t have my real desires. I'm not sure how to explain it - but it's like I haven't found myself completely yet.  
 I am intensively looking for a job and trying to dedicate myself more to my doctoral dissertation, however, I find it very difficult to focus and concentrate, I am haunted by black thoughts (and sometimes even suicide) and I am very tired of these mood swings. There is also a big problem with the lack of self-confidence. I am happiest when I am with my few best friends, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes.  
Do you think I should seek professional help or is this just a product of unemployment, wedding stress, etc.? Thank you in advance."
145,Is this normal?,"Hi - to keep short I’m going to brief and bullet point.

24, Female, lovely partner and family, ok friends, good salary (crap job), ED from 13 - 18 ish. Depression since 14 - now. (Sertraline since 18 - 24 200mg).

I am spiralling so bad right now.

- obsessed with my weight and how fat I am but just keep eating it’s all I talk about. (I’m 11st 3 5’6) so technically not overweight but I look it. 
- work is full of pressure following loads of furloughs and covering all their work
- constantly thinking my partner doesn’t want to be with me/thinks I’m fat/is going to leave me 
- constantly thinking I’m annoying my friends, partner and family because I voice the above 
- random hyper happy moments that I wish I could keep but I go rock bottom straight away
- 0 motivation
- slight suicidal thoughts, I want to be out my head
- thoughts of car crashes and fast deaths 
- dreams of death 

With all these things I’m pushing everyone away, yet I don’t want to be alone and my thoughts are so horrible all the time. Is this normal?? I haven’t spiralled like this as far as I remember. I’ve had bad bouts of suicidal thoughts and been in worse places then this but never this feeling .. if that makes sense"
146,My mother keep mentioning me as her sick child,I’m pretty much a human being like everybody else not only an illness...
147,What contributing to mental health is like,"As a kid I used to look at security guards in malls and airports and often wonder, why do they even bother to look - they never seem to find anything. Their entire work-day consists of frisking people and their baggage. Perhaps they even secretly wish they'd find something dangerous one day - just to have one exciting day at work for a change, and more importantly to feel that their job has a point. But the reality is that it's a million to one shot, and for most frisking guards, every day is more or less similar.

I overlooked a small detail back then. If for one day, or even one hour, there is no guard at the mall or airport, hundreds of lives would instantly be at risk. 

There are a great many important things in life we do everyday that may not seem glamorous or exciting, but save lives. This is the essence of mental health as well.

We are all like those security guards for people we care about. Instead of frisking, we ask them how they feel. Instead of asking them to throw away their bad feelings, we embrace them in spite of these feelings, and this acceptance helps these people accept themselves.

This is not a one-day job, nor is it a spy-thriller. It is mundane, like that of a security guard. About not liking their job. A person they like but doesn't like them back. Feeling lonely. It all may sound familiar to the one who is listening, and maybe sometimes a bit frustrating. But it means the world to the one who is sharing. Because you created what the security guards, our unsung heroes, create everyday.

***A safe space.***

Go be someone's hero. Whether someone is happy, sad, successful, ambitious, unsuccessful, weird, sorted - does not matter. Because you know what? 

***Everyone has baggage.***"
148,"Mental health, disorders, and sensitive topics: How do I balance these?","This sounds contradictory I know, but read further before answering, should you choose to reply.

I have been diagnosed as bipolar and high-functioning ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) since my freshman year of highschool (13-14 years old for those not familiar with United States education system). During my manic episodes, I am energetic, comedic, and try my hardest to make everyone around me laugh, as I enjoy the fun atmosphere of people having a good time. However, when I am having a depressive mood, I tend to withdraw, sometimes ignoring my phone and isolating myself from conversation and/or interaction. When isolation is not possible, I become extremely irate, and regrettably, provocatively combative.

I find certain topics will push me into a worse mood while experiencing a depressive episode, hence my distance. These topics will cause my mind to race ahead in conversation, predicting (at least, in my head) how the sensitive topic can cause an argument to erupt. Discussions are one thing, but raised voices and accusations are not a discussion.

Due to recent events, the topic of racism makes a frequent appearance. It infuriates me that in 2020, this needless bias is still present. What's worse is that this one topic can instantly switch me from manic to depressive. I try to change the topic, not to avoid the issue, but to keep myself and my behavior pleasant. I am vehemently against biases based on unavoidable conditions (race, gender, orientation, etc.), but when I try to change the conversation, I'm accused of being silent towards the cause, and by proxy, an uncaring privelaged white guy.

This is not the case at all.

So here is my compound question, as there are many parts:

1. Am I being selfish by avoiding the discussion, when it so often gets too heated?

2. How can I diffuse the situation without coming across as uncaring (as I care GREATLY about eliminating bias)?

3. How can I balance a triggering topic with my mental health/conditions?

I want to help, but in the CORRECT way. I want to change the opposition's mind, but not through bullying and oppression, as that is the cause we are fighting against."
149,Advice for panic attacks?,"My mother always has panic attacks over the smallest things, and I do not know what to do. I wish to prevent this again. Any advice?"
150,Is this normal?,"Have no idea if this is the right r/ for this questions but here it goes. I've been struggling with anxiety and panic attacks for a while and it has affected me to the point where I struggle to make myself have emotion (e.g. being sad when i want to be or happy when i want to be etc.) and now I'm experiencing something new with this sort of thing. If i see someone be happy or into a certain thing, then I almost 'assimilate it' and then I almost pretend to be interested in that same thing yet I can never see myself actually being interested in it. Overall I'm not sure if this is kind of normal or something rooted that has evolved from my existing problems or something else entirely. "

152,I feel burned out,"I feel like I'm burned out from caring about things in general and having to fight with my OCD that tells me that I actually feel the opposite.  I feel burned out from listening to everyone and being sensitive to everyone and nobody doing the same for me.  I feel burned out from suppressing something, but not sure what I'm suppressing, and my mind keeps telling me I'm bad and I'm going to hurt people.  I don't know what to do.  I feel bad that I originally wanted to volunteer for the crisis text line, but around the end of the training I realized I couldn't do it.  I don't think my mind can handling caring about people any more.  I feel terrible and failure for not doing something I said I would commit to."

157,Job situation not much time help,So I applied for multiple jobs being that I left my old one or rather got replaced but my mom forces me to look for a job and I have enjoyed taking it easy during the time being unemployed. I got an email saying someone would like an interview and I got a wave of feeling kind of sad because not being able to talk to friends and my girlfriend as much anymore starting to work fast food and such I do not know wether to tell my mom and go do the interview or not because even if I do not like the job it I get it I will be stuck in a situation to where I can not get out of it. I hated my last job and had not been talked to in the workplace even though I tried to talk to others and those people talked to other people not to me though. I do not have much time to decide this being the interview is in a few days. It really goes down to my happiness or money and doing what my mom wants. I would appreciate some advice on this situation thank you. I have really bad OCD and paranoia as well and that makes working or even doing daily tasks hard sometimes. I am a high school graduate of this year if that changes any advice. Thank you.

161,"Overthinking, paranoia, absent-mindedness - allegedly, all three are signs of a mental breakdown. I don't know what a mental breakdown is, but if I can summarise my entire life's mental health in three words, they are: Overthinking, paranoia and absent-mindedness.","Has my whole life been one continuous mental breakdown?

I've found myself with that ""mentally at the bottom of the barrel"" feeling, so I started watching videos to find some clue as to what's going on. Apparently my brain is tired of thinking so it does the only thing it knows to do: Think. In fact in response to the agony of thinking, it starts thinking so hard that I can't focus my attention on anything.

Usually whenever I do something that doesn't involve Reddit or gaming, my mind will simply take over and essentially spam me with an endless playlist of thoughts. Often it's imaginary conversations that I actually get caught up in - maybe I'm being accused of something, or maybe I'm explaining why I'm doing something the way I'm doing it (like, washing the dishes).

This is a constant in my life. Are you telling me this isn't normal?"
162,Lately I just don't feel I belong anymore.,"I've been going through a lot lately and it's getting to the point where I can't handle it anymore.  I started leaving many online communities because of stress, and the addiction of technology.  Several years ago I even went back to using my Nokia phone (thank goodness it still has service!) and shelfed the smart phone, because it was getting pretty bad.  Since doing that, when outside the house my mental health was a lot better.  Not being compelled to check something, just living the life in front of me.  But when home it wasn't working because I'm at a computer, like right now.  Thing is, I'm not happy.  


I'm stressed, I have heart disease and heart failure and the stress is getting to the point where I really feel it (heart palpitations are harder and more severe).  


Thing is, it's also hard for me to ""let go"".  For example, when I switched to the Nokia again, I actually got harassed and picked on in public for using a 22 year old phone.  It didn't matter to them it was for my mental health, and it got to the point where I was embarrassed about it, and almost put my SIM back in the smart phone.  I resisted that and I'm glad.  But on the computer when home, it's just so hard not to sit in bed with a laptop.  So my idea was ""delete my accounts, then I can't use the service"".  But then we're back to the phase of 'hard to let go'.  I'm now feeling distance, and that I don't belong in this time frame.  It's 2020 and here I am getting off of technology, rather than going on it.  


Don't worry, I'm not suicidal.  While I wish I would just pass away in my sleep like my grandmother last week, I do want to live.  I want to improve, but I'm actually scared to do it, in fear of what others and my friends/family will think of *me*.  


Sorry if I don't make sense, my mind is all over the place right now."

169,telling reddit about my problems because I can‘t talk about them to people I know and trust,"This is probably going to be a long and really confusing and unstructured one, English is not my first language so please excuse any mistakes.

I just want to write down what I‘m feeling and I thought this place might be a good one since I‘m afraid of being judged from people I know if I told them, I just really want to tell someone...

Basically, I don‘t know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like I‘ve lost control and I find myself thinking I have anger issues. I‘m writing this post because I can‘t bring myself to really talk to anyone I know about what I‘m going through, my mother tends to unintentionally do something that aggrevates me and I tend to then just explode with emotions that mostly result in me being a real piece of shit towards her. It‘s gotten a lot worse lately as I‘ve physically attacked her twice in the past month (nothing real bad, a light kick against her shin or a slap against her arm because I just couldn’t do anything else and was really really frustrated). I don‘t know why I am like this and I really don‘t want to be, but in situations where I get frustrated I can‘t control my emotions/anger. I really don‘t want to be such an asshole but I can‘t help myself and afterwards I always cry in my room/sometimes harm myself... I tried to talk with my mother about all that stuff but she never accepts an apology and really often provokes me and laughs at me when all I want from her is to take me seriously (which then resolves in frustration on my side and it all starts over again...) 
This has been going on for years but has gotten especially bad lately and I think I know some of the reasons/things that may made me like this:

In the past year my mother has ‚bombarded‘ me with revelations about our family life. for example that I have an (half?)uncle I never knew about, that he has children who my grandpa seems to love a lot more than me (it‘s all really complicated but my grandpa‘s always been a hero to me since my parents divorced really early on and I just always felt unconditional love from him). She only recently told me that my father‘s bipolar (diagnosed) and that he used to threaten her a lot (with a gun once - our gun laws are pretty strict where I live), that the first words he said when I was born were ‚I hope she won‘t turn out like her brother‘, that my cat has cancer (she told me that a few days ago but has known it for weeks)... basically she always waited to tell me things and it‘s just been a LOT to process in a short amount of time. I think she now tells me these things because I turned 18 earlier this year. It‘s just a lot and I‘m kind of upset because she never told me these things that seem like pretty important information to me.

I‘ve also always struggled with my weight/confidence (I was pretty skinny until ~half a year ago but always felt fat) and it doesn‘t help that my mother tells me I can‘t wear shorts in summer and that I shouldn‘t wear bikinis, that I need to lose weight etc... I‘ve gained a lot of weight while being in my first relationship which ended about 2 weeks ago and I‘ve already lost a few pounds... (I broke up with my s/o because I felt like I wasn‘t mentally stable enough to be in a relationship that needed a lot of time and that I need to focus on improving my own life)

I‘ve been crying a lot. Isolating myself in a way... I also developed a really bad fear of/in the dark and I can‘t sleep through the night.

I feel like I really should go see a therapist but I can‘t bring myself to do it. This might sound pretty stupid, but I don‘t want to have it ‚validated‘ that my problems are my own fault and that I have to change in order to make other people‘s lives with me easier. The thought of me being the way I am being the problem really frustrates me and I can‘t accept that to be honest...

170,Unfulfillable sexual desire affecting my life,"What are some good ways to kill sexual desire?

I’m trying to end it for good. For all my life, I’ve been always haunted by too much of it. Every time girls of my taste (certain ethnicities of thicc volume) come into my sight, I become extremely hyper af for like 5-10 seconds and screams inside in a full vulgarity while keeping a poker face, of which I believe I have become a master.

The problem is that I’m in a serious relationship. I think this is why my desire becomes a huge problem. So it’s like me vs another me every freaking day, more so at my new workplace where I see so many girls of my taste constantly walking around, which amplifies their thiccness... and I’m like oh god just kill me please. 

I’ve tried so many times to convince myself that thicc girls are nothing special, but no success. I’m now thinking that the only way to fix myself is to adjust my brain neurotransmitter or hormone or whatever for good.. or undergo some intensive cerebral stuff like in Clockwork Orange.

   I often find myself judging my worth based off of the difficulties that I have experienced in my life, the trials and tribulations I have been through, or just how shitty my life has been in general. I feel oddly validated by negative experiences, like they make me more of a person, regardless of if I handled them well or not.

   At the same time, I frequently write off the experiences I have had as not being 'bad' enough, or myself off as not having 'suffered' enough to really matter. As this is (for some reason) tied to myself worth, it becomes a way to tear myself down. An example of this thought process might be, 
   ""Oh, getting assaulted at a young age didn't really effect me/wasn't that bad. I haven't really suffered enough to matter. My life has been too easy.""

   I am not writing this as an attempt to invalidate anyone's experiences, or create a narrative in which I am the pinnacle of human suffering, obviously other people have had comparatively worse lives than me with less privileges. I'm just trying to express that I often feel validated by my negative experiences while simultaneously trying to invalidate those instances in my head or find a reason for why they are just my fault.

   My question is, does anyone experience something akin to this? And is there an easy word or descriptor for these feelings, like there is for anxiety?

   TLDR: Negative or traumatic experiences feel validating to me even though I try to invalidate those experiences in my head, is there a word for this though process?"

i did the math based on how many trucks they have and they probably dump about 750,000 to 1,000,000 gallons a year.

eventually i begged to be terminated and allowed to collect unemployment and didn't want to continue being forced to do illegal things.   but they just responded with pressure for me to resign

i was bullied for a year by my lead tech because im passive and have no middle ground..  either calm or explode.   so i did half his work..  the bullying and there was widespread discrimination, tokenism and favoritism.  white people were favorite followed by blacks and most hated was this small trans boy who the bigot production manager would assign the hardest, lowest paying work and constantly demoted..   anybody who worked with this person shared in his pain so it was the elephant in the room.

when i worked with him the manager harassed me on a daily basis and was angry about any little thing he could find because thats how much he hated this trans boy.

i raised all of these issues and just wanted a financial cushion to transition to next employer.

they tried to force me to resign by gas-lighting me, railroading me, steamrolling me,  ignoring my complaints and even resorted to lying in the termination letter.

eventually this 2 day battle sent me into a manic episode and ultimately i lost it on co worker who bullied me and production manager and told them off and stood up to them for bullying me and a trans boy thats cool af and less than half their size and told them if they didnt like what i had to say id meet them half way and i was fired 5 minutes later.

i lost all claim to unemployment, wrongful termination, everything.

do i have any recourse for discrimination against mentally ill?

i have none in discrimination retaliation because my termination overrules i think?or whisleblower retaliation.

i blew it...

they are monsters.

its not right and if i have to be the victim then so be it.

if all legal recourse is lost and all i got is my story then im going to tell my story.

and if i have to write petitions and go after their major accounts publicly one by one from the top down then so be it.

they can sue me if they want they made sure i have nothing to take and they made sure of that.

m not doing to good right now but **FIRST** when i have the **ENERGY** im going to write petitions **FIRST** then talk to different groups about contacting them directly

Civil rights activists, eco-activists, bullying awareness, mental health awareness, anti-discrimination.  and just about everyone else who isn't a piece of shit could be a potential signature/person who would take the time to write.

is it a lost cause or should i stand up to these people for myself and all the others they have screwed over?

they exploited my mental illness to pressure me into actions that they could fire me for and im not doing too well.  just isn't right.

they bully trans boys and hold black people back from promotions/raises.   they only hire enough minorities to not look like the racists they are.   i even saw a guy try to fight a trans boy 1/3 of his size!!!

im not doing too good right now and spiraling and probably heading into the hospital ive somehow managed to stay out of up to this point.

if all i got is my story then my story is all i got.  so be it.

im on hold right now with EEOC to try to file a charge and got a buddy who they used to bully and discriminate against who may as well.

i could get sued for this but idc i got nothing to take they will pay more in legal fees than they will ever get from me.

idk what to do...

what do you guys think?  do i have any grounds for discrimination because of my mental illness?   think people will help me write their big customers or sign petitions to them?

if i dont respond then i headed to psych.  people are fucked up, yo!!!!

idk whats worse my mental disorders or being a good person in this horrible world."
174,How to start over?,How can I convince myself to start over after losing all progress? I feel as if there's no hope left for me anymore.
175,i'm having suicidal thoughts and it seems like my mother has them too. what do i do?,"hi. this is going to be some venting. 

 i feel stressed and stuck on what to do. my mother has said things like ""peace when i stop breathing,"" ""god please take my life,"" and directly telling me that if she were dying to not give her medication or to save her life but to let her go so she wouldn't be a burden. 

im stressed. i know she needs help but i dont know how to talk to her. ive never really talked about things mental health wise because its hard for me to open up to my family or parents that way. idk why but i fear our relationship might change negatively afterwards for some reason. hence why they dont know about how i actually feel on the inside. 

there was some commotion today, which resulted me in smashing some piece of glass on the floor and stomping out of the house as i had a mental breakdown. i needed space and privacy as i have none of that at home (i dont have my own room or anything.) ive had suicidal ideation for a very long time, though I somehow managed it. but today i completely broke and now im thinking strongly of it. for a second there i finally considered confessing how i felt to my family but then i ultimately turned it down. 

my mother texted me, begging me to come back home and that her worry will cause problems for her heart (she has heart problems) which made me feel even worse. i dont want to lose my mom ever. 

she isn't a perfect mom. she's done things that i feel like have caused some type of trauma to me growing up, but shes gotten better over the years (altho she can still be a bit harsh at times) and shes provided a lot im grateful for. but i feel like because of the way i grew up, it makes it very hard to actually talk to her and be close. 

i just turned 18 this year and i was excited for college and all of that but i feel like letting go of all my dreams and everything. and with everything going on in the world, its harder to look at the bright side of things too. 

sorry this is long. but if you could provide any advice, i would greatly appreciate it."
176,Let's talk about Alice and Wonderland Syndrome....,
177,Made the first step today,After years of going back and forth on whether or not to seek help for past trauma and anxiety I decided to call and schedule an appointment with a therapist. It seems like a small first step but it felt like it was time.
178,I just wanna end it all,"I’ve been not okay for a long time now. I am in grade 12 and these last 2 years had a huge toll on my mental health. Till grade 10 I was always the “funny guy” of my class. I was popular I had a lot of friends. When i got into grade 11, I changed schools. I went to a school in which attendance isn’t mandatory so I could attend coaching classes(Its normal in my country). 

There, everyone was so different than I am (I’d rather not go into details but most of them didnt even speak english) I never could connect with anyone  so I felt lonely....I went to my old friends for comfort and I realised *people had expectations that I’d make them laugh* and joke around being the “fun guy”. All they want is me to keep them happy and they don’t like it when I’m down. For company sake I still hung out with them pretending to be the same funny guy but I felt it was forced earlier it was natural. 

Now, I have noone not even my parents to just listen ti how much internal pain I am in. I cry in the shower, alone on the terrace at night knowing noone cares. The girl whose life I basically saved after her nudes got leaked stopped answering my texts after I told her I am not okay mentally. 

Theres this void in my heart i just wanna fill. Whether it be by opening to a confidant or with a knife. I dont think I can go on living like this anymore....and the sad part is I have noone to tell this to. Please someone help me I cant feel like this anymore."
179,Drowsiness from meds?,"I take 5mg of Zyprexa as needed for my bouts of depression. I usually take it at night about an hour before bed because it knocks me out. While it works for my depression, I feel very groggy, slow and tired the next day, even after sleeping 12-13 hours. I know I could be sleeping too much, but I cant even keep my eyes open if I try to get up any earlier. Does anybody else experience this?"
180,In doubt if I should tell my partner about my depressive thoughts (my therapist knows),"I have ptsd and depression and am seeing a therapist weekly. I am very open to my partner about my ptsd; I sometimes explain or share things about moments of distress or panic attacks if I feel the need to do so. He doesnt mind and doesnt experience too much mental distress because of this (this is not an assumption, we discuss this frequently). My depression is relatively new, my partner sort of knows what kind of depressive symptoms I have, but not all of it.

Recently I started getting suicidal thoughts. My therapist knows and I discuss this with her, and I also know which hotlines to call if I ever need to. However I'm not sure if I should share these thoughts with my partner. On the one hand I feel like I want to share it, but on the other hand I'm worried that it will cause him too much (unneccesary) distress. 

I am wondering if there is anyone that has been through the same, or has experience as a partner of someone with depression. I'm also going to discuss this with my therapist, but it would be nice to get some other thoughts on this as well."
181,Would my experience be considered traumatic?,"A stranger had non consensual sex with me while I was drinking. I was 19 and he was 30. He took me off the streets, brought me back to his place, and did this:
Bit me
Photographed me
Suffocated me
Held me in the room with him for hours
Continued to have sex with me after I was bleeding 
Forced me to sing for him
Screamed at me when I tried to leave 
Smirked and looked smug the whole time
Forced me to say things to him during the sexual parts
This was my first time having sex 

I managed to get away by waiting until he fell asleep and ran to the door. 
I showered and cried. 
I dropped out of college after this and developed PTSD.

I feel like I don’t have any right to be traumatized. Like it messed me up so badly that I’m still crippled by it twelve years later. Others have had it worse, though."

184,ER discrimination,"So angry. I’ve been really sick the past few months. Doctors are looking at a possible neurologic disorder. 

Last month, I went to urgent care because I was really exhausted and weak. They took one look at me and sent me to the ER. The ER doc took one look at my meds (mainly basic stuff like high blood pressure meds, etc...and two antidepressants). Immediately he started running tests for drug overdoses. I also got a chest X-ray for some unknown reason. He never once asked about my symptoms. Never had a conversation with me. He actually didn’t say a word to me except to tell me his name. I was basically just laying on the gurney with my eyes closed, too exhausted to do much more than say yes or no. 

Suddenly he popped his head in the room, told my husband I was fine and should take “vitamins and supplements,” and that we could go. The nurse handed us a few papers, and they hurried us out the the door. 

As we drove away, I looked at the paperwork. You know what his diagnosis was? A bipolar mixed episode. I don’t even have bipolar disorder!

I submitted a formal complaint and just got the response back—that even though the doctor couldn’t find evidence of a psychiatric condition, he felt strongly that my chronic psychiatric history (i.e., depression and PTSD) caused my fatigue. 

And now I’m in a wheelchair. Maybe if that doctor had done his job and looked for something beyond a psych issue I would be walking now."

186,Need some advice,"Someone I know has been acting really weird recently. she was mentally ill few months before but she recovered from it but recently she has been acting strange. Sometimes during the day she just loses control and acts like a child, it's like her brain doesnt work properly sometimes she cant even speak properly and when she becomes normal again she forgets everything she has done.  I am not sure if this is a mental illness or some kind of brain problem. If someone knows this problem pls give some advice."
187,I need some help.,"I don't know where else to go for help seeing as my family don't believe in mental health issues. I've suffered from anxiety and depression for a few years and today is one of my worst days. I was with my girlfriend and my ex turned up and started showing me intimate photos of her and another guy, as well as slapping my ass when I asked her not to. My gf is annoyed at me now and now my head is a mess. Have i don't something wrong? Why is all I can think about hurting myself? Sorry for the rant"
188,Emotionally tired...,"I wake up emotionally tired. Yes, i can get out of bed. But i don't wanna do anything. Everything i do, needs to be forced. Eating. Working out. I usually after waking up in bed, transfer to sofa. And lay there for the most of the day. 

And in the evening, i feel upset, that i wasted a day for nothing. Get motivated. Plan things for the next day. But the next day, is exactly the same.

(On Zoloft for 1 year now)"
189,Being Forgotten,"Does anyone have any tips on getting over being forgotten a lot? Because every time I remember one of the worst times of me being forgotten (or being forgotten in general which makes me remember that time) I start to feel really bad and sometimes start nervous twitching and maybe even be close to crying. 

I just really don't want to hold anything against my friends."
190,i cant cry,"i cant cry anymore.

i tried to force myself to cry.

i got into emotionally uncomfortable situations, still didnt cry.

i hurt myself, didn't cry.

i witnessed mentally damaging things, still nothing 

did i finally break my mind?

im serious i cant cry, but i wanna cry its one of the only ways for me to release anger now i get frustrated at the little things and i have to workout constantly to not be mad. i wanna joke about this but it all sounds like im just a douche. i dont know what to do im lost and confused. is this what it means to grow up????? please somebody help."
191,repost because i need help,"first of all, i love my mom. i love her woth my whole heart.
that being said, she is worsening my health every day
my mom is the kimd of person that is morlstly fpcused om herself. she doesnr care what others think of her and doesnt care much for others feelings.
lately, sinxe avout last september, things have been hard for her at work. she is angry and stressed and takes it out on me. she yells at me at least once every day, always nitpicks on everything, and she always finds something that i did wrong and yells at me for it for hours. then, shes passive aggressive amd doesnt want to talk to me. then, she comes to me and doesnt even apolpgise, just says 'i dont wanna yell at you, bit things are hard for me, you have to understand' and leaves. she calls me a disappointment, and says im ungrateful and says things like 'well do you pay me for taking care of you?, and makes me feel guilty about evem existing in her presence and living in her home, even yho im 17 and cant move out, even tho i want to. she dpes this evwryday, 24/7, unless im at my fiances, whete she doesnt have control over me, thankfully. she threatens me, for example once she said shes tnrow put my cats if i fifnt do what she said. shes very hypocritical, she doesnt do much at home and wants me and dad to do everything, and her only excise is 'im tired from work', when my dad has even more wprk and has severe back issues. she treats us like trash and then wonders why i dont want to be around her. she makes herself put to be the victim, and o cant talk back because she would be even angrier. at this point, im worried she might start getting physical.
i am diagnosed with clinical depressipn, an anxiety disorder and possibly ptsd (ive been to a doctor with it and i have a therapist, but i havent been diagnosed yet or anything, but i have been through a very traumatic even at the age of 11) so this isnt helping me at all, plus i have a very bad immune system and when i feel terriblr and depressed, i take worse care of myself, so therefore i am more sick, and therefpre she is angry again.
i feel the need to avoif her at all costs. its so hard to please her. every time i ipen my mouth, its wrong. so i avoid her as much as possible, which means i stay out of the hpuse a lot and stay at my fiances, so i dont see my dad much either unfortunately, but he is great anf i love him dearly
i hate her, but i love her. i am absolutely tereified of her at this point, and just thinking about being around her makes me tear up
does anyone have any advice? i would hoghly appreciate it"

195,How to stay positive when working night shifts?,"Hi guys, i recently started working a night shift of 4 to 8 am for one of my part time jobs. Lately, i noticed its becoming hard to stay positive and motivated when the night hour creeps in. I feel anxious, stressed, and sometimes tortured by the thought of having to get up at 4 am every day. Another thing i noticed is, its kind of lonely to be the only person awake between these hours. Everyone is asleep and its too quiet. It kind of sets my mood back, so night shifts become dragging for me. Do you guys have any tips on how i can keep a positive and light attitude and motivate myself during these times?"
196,Help me be a better brother.,"A few months ago my 16 year old brothers best friend who has been a close friend of the family since they were 6 passed away do to a freak accident at home. It was truly a tragic situation, and my brother seems all but unfazed. How can I help him deal with this? Any literature you’d recommend maybe tips on talking to a 16 year old who games with his buddies all day? He is a pretty stoic little dude normally so I want him to know it’s ok to not be ok some times, I just need a more eloquent way of putting it I guess. Anything helps"

I feel trapped.","I've realised that I am having anxiety issues and I probably need help, but I can't describe my feelings/emotions and I don't know what to say. I feel trapped.

My mom is 2 times cancer survivor and she was diagnosed with cancer again in Dec 2019. I wasn't here for here very much for previous two times as I was in college, but I suspect my problems began at that time. My mom and my dad don't get along. They have completely different ideologies and just refuse to agree. Both of them confide in me and my sister for problems they have with each other, but my mom does it more than my dad.

Its very difficult for me to explain them that the other one doesn't mean anything bad of whatever they said. This new cancer has been especially problematic because some medicine induced depression in my mom, and now she's having depression and anxiety attacks, and she's very bitter about my dad and it's very exhausting for me to handle. 4 days ago she was tested positive for COVID-19, and my dad wants her to be in complete isolation for 2 weeks, but as she was tested randomly and doesn't have any symptoms, she, my sister and and I are convinced that she doesn't need to be completely isolated etc. now again she and my dad are fighting and she ends up crying and there's no one except me to give her some support. my sister seems to have sort of given up and doesn't take her too seriously now a days.

I've noticed that now I have continuous anxiety whenever things are not ""happy"" between everyone in my family, and I take it upon myself to rectify them, but they seem out of my hands at times and I keep feeling bad for it. I don't know, maybe I feel some guilt, maybe I feel its my responsibility to keep my family happy, its weird. I try to never get angry, but whenever I do, there's no one I can go to, my family doesn't provide me any emotional support when am sad or angry, instead they get angry at me for not understanding. I just feel so crappy all the time and afraid that things might go wrong any moment if my parents talk and my delicate balance which I just established will break.

I'm always jealous of my friends, who can be carefree and focus on their passions and careers, while I focus only on my family. 

My professional life is suffering too. I used to be above average in office at my tasks, but I've lately been just mediocre. I thought that I'm handling all this pretty well but today something snapped and I think I need to tell somebody about this. I am very confused and disoriented right now and would appreciate any help."
198,"I went to the ER due to suicidal thoughts, a week later i still cant see a mental health professional.","i went to the er on the 9th of this month feeling worse than i ever had in my life. they checked my vitals and did blood work and urine tests but other than that i just sat around and waited for a psychiatrist to call. (normally they see you in person but because of covid they cant) once they did they set up an appointment and then i was discharged. i didn't feel any better but i was willing to carry on and see how this appointment would go. today i show up, as i was told, and they didn't let me in. (again, due to covid.) i should have seen that coming but i was just doing what i was told, i was told to show up to an appointment and i did. they turned me away, didn't want to do the call that day, and have rescheduled a new call appointment 5 days from now. i showed up to the ER to get help, i didnt get any, and i feel like its my fault for fucking up this appointment. i want help from a professional and i dont think i can get it."

I’m never been one to result contemplate suicide, but I’m doing it more and more. But I have kids and a wife and me parents, I can’t imagine doing that to them but I just want it to end."
200,When exactly is it time to go to seek counselling services?,"I live in a country where mental health is mostly a taboo topic. Those going for counselling services are usually for individuals who are already at their breaking point and have serious issues that are clearly visible and are at a high risk of physical harm. Hence, anyone going for these types of services are usually shun on by most people.

Currently, I am at a dilemma. I have been incredibly demotivated lately to the point where when I close my eyes, all I see is darkness. I can’t even picture how I want my future to be like. I’m about to graduate from university and I can’t imagine how my career would be like. I can’t comprehend having to move on from being single to (potentially) having to spend the rest of my life with someone who’s a complete stranger to me. These are some of the many thoughts circulating in my head but basically, I’ve felt numb and blank to have the drive to do anything anymore. 

So, my question is, would it be appropriate for me to seek counselling services? I know what I am going through is perhaps menial when compared to so many others who have more severe issues, so would it be wrong of me to possibly take away a resource that someone may need more? Would a psychologist even take me in and hear out what I have to say?"

I've always had health issues and the pressure ended in me developing an eating disorder which caused in a REALLY bad relationship with my mother (she comes from a disfunctional and poor home so I understand where her character comes from. I’ve always preferred my dad over her but that doesn’t mean I don’t love her, I will always be thankful for what she has done for me.

So I really don’t like being with her for extend period of time because it ALWAYS ends up in a fight, but yesterday we had to go to my brother’s house and had to cook the meal in our house so me trying to be nice I helped her (I really didn’t want to but whatever) and apparently I’m too expressive so the dislike I had showed and my mother couldn’t take it and had a very aggressive meltdown so I went for my sister so she could talk to her (my dad isn’t home) and went to my room. Between screams I overheard how she is tired of me and basically how I don’t love her (she’s always had this attitude towards me because I’m not a person of touch and she is) and told me to go where she was and I went, she started to complained of how I’m not grateful enough and how disrespectful I am towards her and started making fun how I still go to therapy I started to cry and haven’t talked to her since. I know she’s very anxious and depressed because of quarantine and not having incomes and that was part of the melt down but I don’t think she should’ve let that out with me.

209,Facing denial and couldn't connect well with others.,"Hello

Few years back I wanted to be in a relationship with a girl. She didn't want to be in realtionship with me stating she didn't want to be in a realtionship then, I think I was being a fool n thought she might change her mind later n MIGHT be in a realtionship with me. She stayed a friend, I lost touch for a while bt later when i could talk to her i stayed in touch with her regularly in hopes she might accept me. We used to chat frequently, she made it look like she's also an introvert like me and i was the only one whos in regular contact with her n told i was a grt friend to her. Obviously this made my feelings for her more strong. But after few mre months like this with regular chatting etc. she showed less interest to talk with me, initially i thought she was busy but after repeated incidents like this i wanted to get some closure. All this time i was losing contact with the world around me n became more n more introverted. When asked would she be in relationship with me she told she dint want to yet or she never might, after this it looked like shes started avoiding me one fine day i told i cant be a friend like this. She won't be in a realtionship with me and shes not even treating me as a good friend like she claimed. That hurted more than she saying she dint want to be in relationship. It's been few months since i stoppped talking to her but yet every now n then I think of situations where she's with me, how i could handle things differently where she mightve accepted to be with me. 

I know there's no fault of her, but it looked like a toxic friendship. I was giving her way too much attention and affection n getting nothing in return. I know its better to stay away from her for me but I am in denial. I still think everything might get better if I try or she might only patch things. 

I don't even know what to expect from others from then, I feel hollow without feeling any connection with people trying to minimize social contact with minimal friends.

I am trying to get out of this denial and improve myself. These constant thoughts are filling me up with emotion i cant handle. It's hurting n I choking me. I have lost interest in parties, shopping etc. I feel like I don't know myself. I don't know what I'll get from you guys but i wanted to share these feelings n let some burden of off me which is choking me constantly increasing with thoughts i am having. I've never let anyone close to me like I let her n now I dont have anyone to share these things with.

This might look silly to many of you but all these things with her were very serious to me. I don't even know if my problem is a serious thing to be considered bt I am letting this out, hoping to get better.

TIA for any suggestions u might give, its even okay if there r no suggestions just reading my problem is more than enough."
210,I have officially hit rock bottom but maybe I can rise through it.,"I'm 19. I barely have a job. I'm pretty introverted lonely person. I'm stuck doing drugs to at least numb the fact that I have hit rock bottom. I'm still living in my parent's house. The coronavirus makes it hard to go outside. I am a very anxious person nowadays. I can't even work without wanting to lose my shit.

I rarely talk to people as well. I'm becoming more asocial. Sometimes, I don't even want to socialize even with family. I feel like they don't get my sense of anything. I feel like i'm ok being a little lonely but at the same time I don't want to be more isolated. The isolation kills me, it gets me more paranoid. As I sometimes hear chatters through walls or thinking that my parents are up to something evil. So unsure with people at times. I get delusional. I don't wanna talk. You are part of something malicious. You are going to conspire something against me. Punk! I watch the news and sometimes I feel like I can predict what's going to happen next sometimes. I think of something and boom it happens. I mix other celebrities death to predict something severe to happen. IT has happened! It's crazy! Words are useless, fuck communication. I can read your thoughts. I can read them. I can hear your weird shit. The weird chatters, the dysfunctional reality. I can see all of it.    

I just dropped out of this technical college because i'm stupid like that. I don't like to be near people anymore. I get paranoid that I smell bad and I shower almost everyday. Any day. I also don't like asking for help for some reason. I'm becoming even more lazy. 

I hate playing this game of duck,duck, therapist. I keep having to go find another one after the one I had didn't help at all. The usual bullshit question, ""did you take your medication."" I just wanted to reply with, ""Yes, Ms. Ratched. I take my medication."" Blah, blah, blah. I spill my guts and they are just shocked. She would usually reply with, ""wow, that's sad"" or just something you would hear if you told some random stranger. So, I was like fuck this. Just drop this. I need another therapist.

I have been drinking lately, daytime too. My only friend asks why I drink during daytime. I just replied with, ""because fuck it."" My intrusive thoughts are just gone when i'm drinking and that's not a good thing because it promotes alcoholism, which i'm probably prone to due to the fact that I had uncles who were severe alcoholics. My dad wasn't, thankfully. Not only that, I will use any drug to escape at this point. I'm thinking codeine tonight. The intrusive thoughts murder me every time, feeling all guilty as hell thinking fucked up shit. But when I just drink, boom. It's all gone. But it's all wrong. Alcohol is bad for me. I have been also gaming and binge watching Youtube videos for the past week. It's just not worth it anymore. At this point, it's just to get by the days. Medication just seems like a way to numb everything. Literally everything. My feelings are just gone at this point. The only thing I shit out is a normal sedation feel. I was on antipsychotics but it made me boring. I would also drink during those times. Bad idea. First week of withdrawals were fucking hell. Nausea like a motherfucker. Hot flashes every day. 

I daydream a lot. I like to live in a fantasy land. I don't even talk when i'm in those thoughts. I dissociate severely almost to the point of not even moving at all. I just ignore everything around me, just deeply concentrating in these thoughts. I went camping 2 weeks ago and I rarely talked. I was too busy in my own world. I did however had fun, I went through puddles with my sister and cousin while driving a 4 wheeler. I just really need to stop being so deep inside a reality that seems to be distracting my actual place I am living in.

I wanna work at a better job, I have been applying but no one's wants to hire me. Interview, after interview. 

I still have a little bit of optimism. I feel like I can still get the fuck out of this numbing place. Fuck this feeling of depression bullfuck. It's retarded. I hate depression, I hate it. It makes me feel like a little bitch. I just want to kill myself in the Walmart bathroom. I'd do it with a big ass shotgun too. Blast my brains in the wall. But I don't wanna do that. I wanna be a crazy guy with crazy muscles! I wanna work out and shit. It can sure as hell make me look good! Fuck it though. I'm a skinny bastard. I can a fit body! Maybe have a girlfriend. Nah. I'd be fine just being alone. I don't want intimacy anymore. I think it's a waste of time now. I like being alone and I don't have to worry to be fair. I'm already a broken human being. That's why all the women I had a ""thing"" with always end up gone and honestly it's probably for the best. I also hope to get a good paying job to, so I can get out of my parent's house. I'm also hoping to be productive as well. I have been a lazy fucker lately. I need to get out more too or maybe not."

212,Stay happy everyone,"We have a million thoughts that make us feel we're not okay. 
There are times we want to say so much but we can't. 
There are a lot of struggles behind those smiles you see everyday.

There are times we wish someone would listen, not judge.
There are times all we want is a shoulder to lean on, to cry and scream.

Yes, we all have things we go through alone but seek help, find someone you're comfortable sharing it with, because at the end of the day you have no idea how important it is for yourself."
213,A quick look at the history and applications of Expressive Writing and it's immense benefits for mental health.,[deleted]
214,"You in this moment in an unfiltered, unbiased environment","TL; DR: Describe your current environment in great detail for me. Do not describe anything with good or bad labels or whether you like/dislike it. You may describe feelings and levels of comfort/your demeanor and clothing. What are you sitting on/standing near? What sounds are around you? What is the lighting like? Are there any other people in the space? What color are the walls? Etc... 

I occasionally send this exercise to friends asking out of curiosity being honest that it’s a simple thought exercise and most of them find no one asks them things like this especially with 0 pressure to seem put together or “productive.” 

I usually offer mine first so they can see there’s no judgment. It can be as long or as short as you observe. I’m curious to read about your real time stimuli processing. 

————————————

My real-time example if you’re interested: 

I am alone at the moment and my nose whistles quietly every time I breathe in. 
I’m wearing pajamas and I feel comfortable in them. I have several journals sprawled around a red fainting couch. They all serve different purposes and I am scribbling my racing thoughts/ideas in them periodically. 

The walls vibrate when a truck drives past and I can feel the ground shake. The lighting is warm, coming from sconces on the walls. Sometimes I can hear the building creak. This building is old. The walls are cream colored and the wood trim is dark oak. There are cracks running from floor to ceiling. The window is open so I can feel a cool breeze coming in and I hear birds singing “chicka deedeedee”. A lot of the trees around here have those seed pods we call “Helicopters” that spin to the ground much to the delight of squirrels who catch them and run off to bury their treasures. 

I am in my bedroom. I separated my clean laundry and it’s on the floor waiting to be put away. I’m drinking cold coffee that was warm around 40 minutes ago. My hair is pulled into the messiest bun imaginable and my right eyebrow is itchy. My toes are kind of cold and I feel like I’m about to fall asleep. Speaking of falling asleep, my right arm is about to go numb from leaning on it for so long and I’ve begun to slouch. My shoulders ache because I just realized I’ve been tensing them up. On that note I’ve also been clenching my jaw, so I relax them. 
I’m curled up with my legs tucked in on the aforementioned red fainting couch. It has flowers and paisley patterns weaved into the fabric (subtle). Here and there a melody will pop into my head and I’ll find myself humming a tune aloud. 

Occasionally I can hear my partner in the other room crack their wrists or move about.

—————————
Final notes: 

As someone with cptsd I am eager to capture these moments of objective reality and not put so many expectations on myself. I’ve had a pretty serious journaling habit for a few years now. I felt silly at first but then I realized just how much it would make me smile looking back if I was completely honest with myself and didn’t only write about the negatives. I oftentimes live inside my head so I have been practicing grounding myself in the real world as often as I can."
215,A need to vent my story and for advice,"Hi, 

I'm sharing my story with the hopes that someone will read it and offer some help. I cannot afford therapy but I really need to vent somewhere.

I grew up with 2 older siblings in a dysfunctionnal family. My parents had me quite late, my mum is 72, my dad 66 and I am 25. 

Both my parents were authoritarian and old-school in their way of raising us. Mum was staying at home raising the kids, Dad provided for the family. My older brother, the eldest, was not expected to help with housekeeping, but me and my sister were. My older brother's interest in sciences was encouraged and he taught by my dad how to fix things while my mum forced me and my sister to cross stitch and read books. 

They've always demanded the utmost respect for themselves and for the education they were providing us. As kids, we had to keep silent while sat at the dining table or while playing. To this day they have many rules in the house that we need to respect when visiting especially us daughters. Many of these are hypocritical such as not interrupting, when they interrupt us constantly. I am left handed, they forced me to write with my right hand but were unsuccessful.

Since very young I remember my dad getting into insane outbursts of anger where he would smash absolutely everything and everyone standing on his way. Home was normally very quiet with  few visitors, my parents having nearly no friends, so it was a huge contrast. To this day my heart starts beating really fast if I hear something accidentally break or a loud noise at my parent's house. Loudness always meant bad things were coming. My dad's rage was not directed at us kids for misbehaving, but we definitely avoided making him angry. Although he would beat us for the smallest thing, for example I remember one day being held upside down by one leg when I was 8. I'd always pee myself if he was approaching me when angry.

My mum was actually worse, but it took me many years to come to the realisation. She'd beat us not just to discipline us but also when she was in a bad mood. My brother took a lot less beatings than me and my sister. She broke objects on our heads, pull us throughout the corridor by our hair. She would not accept that we show sadness or anger. I once asked her when I was 6 and she was beating us to have mercy and stop, she made fun of me and kept going harder. She once nearly strangled my sister out of frustration about an event exterior to our home. 

We grew up thinking we were horrible kids, that we were tormenting our mum, so we constantly walked on eggshells and tried anything to please her. And she took this to her advantage. We were still very young when she was telling us all about her problems and how horrible Dad was to her, how dared he hit her, her step-family being mean to her. So we sided with her and we started disliking Dad, on my side at least I was hating him as a child and teenager because I thought he was a monster. Dad is also quite introverted and never shows affection, so alongside the education we were receiving it was easy to think so. My mum always denied knowing why my Dad would get angry, I know guess she must have been ""responsible"" but was in total denial.

Asking for help to other adults was nearly impossible as we relied on our parents, we were scared to think that they were not perfect. I once vented at the school's infirmary when I was 13, who then called my mum to talk about it. My mum got mad and chopped off my hair to a hideous, way too short bob. At that point I felt so humiliated and down that I seriously considered suicide.

My mum insisted to have an African grey parrot when I was still small. But she had zero empathy or patience with him when these parrots actually need a lot of work and care. Having an african grey is pretty much like having a 3 year old who never grows up. So she'd beat him with a spoon or yell at him almost every day for his ""bad behaviour""

The worst part is that to this day they still believe that they were right and that this upbringing was the best thing they could do for us. I can understand that they are repeating what they were taught but it is difficult for me to forgive them. I have so many issues today in my adult life that stem from this education.

It's hard especially because my mum NEVER admits her wrongs. Which is why I have to bend to her will as trying to calmly argue makes her go mad. She is very good at playing the victim instead of taking responsibility for something. She is also incredibly immature. I have spent now 8 years away from home, coming back twice a year, and have grown into a young and mature adult (for the most part). 

And I am shocked to realise how immature my mum is. She pouts, gives the silent treatment, get upset for the smallest thing like a door not shut or the cat meowing. If that happens you'll hear her yell from the other side of the house and that gives me and my sister so much anxiety and worry. She criticises everyone but herself on a constant basis. My Dad gives in to her behaviour, and she manipulates him and makes sure her views become the family truth. To this day she singles my sister out as the lazy, fat and unintelligent kid (when none of this is true or justified) and coopts me and my brother. My mum manipulates everyone to revolve the attention around her. She has always made my sister feel ""less than"". My sister is able to see the truth but does not want to talk about it. She craves love from my parents and wants them in her life.

My brother is a replica of my parents. He adopted the same authoriarian behaviour and it is impossible to have a normal discussion with him. He is in total denial of your feelings or thoughts if they do not ressemble his. My parents enable his behaviour and allow him to hit me or my sister or call us foul names, and to this day have a preference for him despite his constant gross behaviour.

Sometimes I feel like going crazy because my sister tries to forget as much as she can and my brother never experienced the same childhood. I have no one to talk to about it. I cannot afford therapy and this is a really heavy story to tell friends. I'm not sure what relationship to have with my parents as unlike my sister I am more rebellious. I cannot fake it around people I dislike. For the last 5 years I have tried everything I could to please my parents with my own time, money and energy but they have not changed. The family has stayed the same and is still just as dysfunctional no matter how much we pretend otherwise."
216,What is my problem?,"
Hi,
I’ve been scrolling this sub and I think I relate to many things. I’m 25 M. 
Here are the things I noticed about myself:

1- I started going to gym to build up my body but left after 2 months or so. And this happened multiple times. I have joined the gym maybe 5-6 times and left after a month or two.

2- I started learning python(computer coding language) but lost interest after 2-3 lectures. Left it. Started it again some time ago but left it again after 2-3 lectures again.

3 started learning guitar in university was able to play some basic tunes. And it was like learn a tune leave for a month and then again learn a tune and leave for a month. Can’t build a routine to learn it.

4- Half assed my way through university but passed with a average GPA.

5- I have small bursts of energy that make me want to start a blog, learn about cars, learn about electronics but it fades away quickly when I get into it.

6- I have never been consistent in anything in all my life. I scored above average marks till university but then dropped to a average student.


7- Read a total of 1 book(non-curricular )in my life. Struggling to read another. Started a book maybe 3 months ago still haven’t finished it, today I started reading it again and I know if anything else comes up I will leave it too and maybe pick it up again after months when I have that burst of motivation.

I don’t know about this post and I think its structurally weak because I may have half assed it too.

Ask anything concerning this if you want further details.What is my problem?"
217,Meds question,Has anyone taken Zoloft?
218,How I Got Off The Antidepressant Venlafaxine (SNRI),"At the start of last year (2019), I was put on Antidepressants to treat my anxiety. Never did I imagine myself having to be put on medication for my mental health. It took me a while to figure out what ultimately led me to that point. 

Looking back, it was likely a culmination of factors. Being away from my family, a new living environment, stress, lack of sleep, self-consciousness, and maybe a bit of genetics. The thought of being tethered to the medication for the rest of my life really bothered me. I had this feeling that as long as I kept taking it, I would never feel or be myself, or I would be perceived by others as weak, or emotionally unstable. 

But after some time to really assess my circumstances, I was able to shift from the perspective of “why is this happening to me,” to “how can I use this to my advantage.” 

I introduced myself to a variety of things like reading, journaling, podcasts, supplementation, and eating a healthy diet. And more recently, I’ve discovered the amazing benefits of meditation and cold water immersion. 

After months of commitment to these practices, I’ve been able to come off the medication, and can confidently say, I’ve never felt better! 

I really wish you guys all the strength to get through whatever mental health struggles you may be going through❤️ let me know if you are in the same boat, and maybe I can assist you in someway.🙏🏽

Here is a video of my journey: 

[How I Came Off Antidepressants ](https://youtu.be/GuCr8UfVUtM)"
219,Does anyone feel like a huge disappointment?,"I’ve pretty much disappointed everyone I know. Failed my parents, shame to my family, couldn’t be there for my sister. I’m a huge disappointment and never enough for anyone."
220,I’ve been in mental crisis and have little to no healthy coping mechanisms,"i’m 19F and my life has been absolutely insane the last 8 months. my bfs mom died which was extremely hard on us, my childhood cat passed who was my world and a huge piece of me, my uncle passed, i’m struggling with self image and i’m also experiencing relationship problems. i’ve always battled with mental illness and i’ve gotten through it but nothing this intense and scary before. i find myself sobbing every single day, i have this underlying sadness about me and i feel myself becoming something i’m not. 

growing up i was never taught how to cope. i was sexually abused at 6 and my family thought they were helping me by pretending it didn’t happen so from a young age i was taught very unhealthy ways to self soothe. i excessively smoke weed, i used to have a major adderall addiction and even turn to drinking sometimes to make myself feel better (this is very rare but still used to cope). 

i’m a self aware person and i know i’m not helping myself and at this point i cannot keep doing this anymore. i need to find a way to help myself or i genuinely will not survive this. thank u for reading and i appreciate any advice."
221,I look at myself in the mirror and I feel disgusted.,I look at myself in the mirror and I want to puke. I strongly dislike the person I see there and I have no respect for this person. I really want to kill myself but I can't because I'm too scared to do it and it makes me feel like a coward for not being able to take the one step that'd end it all. I'm not going to die but I have no desire to keep on living this life either.
222,What role does your significant other play in your mental health?,Trying to set expectations for myself and healthy boundaries in a new relationship. Advice also welcome
223,If I ask my doctor for strong anti anxiety meds am I gonna sound weird?,"I’ve been taking propranolol as during quarantine I’ve been stuck with my family which is making me a lot more anxious than usual but being out of the world has made my social anxiety a lot worse and I’m about to start back to normal and I’ve been having panic attacks that my meds having been calming 

Is it ok to ask for stronger meds... am I gonna sound like a junkie or something. Like do I seem strange or something because every time I think of going back to school or crap like that I get have a long escalating panic attack that even my medication isn’t helping and I took like 6"
224,I have Casual Suicidal thoughts,"I’m 17m and was diagnosed with lupus 4 years ago, and to sum it up, life long, no cure, no origin, just a bad roll of dice. And I’ve had additional little kicks in the kidneys from it and it’s just an uphill battle

And ever since my diagnosis freshman year I’ve dabbled with the idea of suicide. I’ve never had any weapons or seriously considered it, I just don’t mind thinking about the idea.

I have a girlfriend now, but things aren’t well. I’m going to college only 40 minutes away, and I’m dorming because my family situation isn’t always healthy, she isn’t for the semester because money. And I have tons of financial aid so I can. And it’s upsetting her because she thinks I’m going to move on. And I am not good looking, skinny, and I’m a ball of depression inside. So her giving up hope (we’ve been dating for about a year and a half) is just sending my mental all over the place and landing on suicidal thoughts. 

And she has every right to not have hope, I haven’t treated her as well as I should in the past, but I feel like I have explained my situation and want to get away from my family enough for her to understand.

And I know if I wasn’t here one day it would upset many people, but idk I just feel like shit. And the fact that I will never truly stop feeling like shit just makes me feel worse."
225,Right in the feels.,"I’m watching Shia LaBeouf’s movie, Honey Boy.   There is a scene where young Otis is relaying messages between the mom and the dad during an argument. He was caught in the cross fire of two fucked up parents spewing hate at each other. And it flashed me back to my child hood and I am sobbing as I type this. Fuck."
226,"When you hear ""RESPECT YOUR ELDERS"" its just an excuse that the older generation uses to avoid being held accountable for their abusive behaviors and/or beliefs.","Every human deserves to be heard and to be validated. Just because someone is older than you that does not make them a good person or a reliable source for information. 

You should not respect adults, you should respect PEOPLE. If you know something in your heart to be true then trust your own opinion and instincts. You do not need to rely on an adult that is clearly doing wrong just because they claim to have ""more life experience"" or any other type of bull shit like that over you."
227,I don't know what to do anymore. My family is broken and I'm essentially sacrificing myself to fix it and that still isn't enough. What's so bad about wanting to fix things?,"I just finished a yelling match basically that went on for multiple hours and all my dad has to say is that I'm a disrespectful child, and that I need to worry about my own health before I fix anyone else, that I'm broken and messed up and have no business trying to fix anyone other than myself. He's so mean and cruel he yelled at me like I wasn't even his daughter. I cried and spoke through the tears and nothing. It's like I was talking to a wall. 

I know how bad it is to try to advocate for sensitive issues, especially family issues, but I'm so tired of us just tolerating each other that I almost don't care what happens to me. My dad can lash out all he wants and say terrible things but I told myself that it'd be okay as long as it got through to him. But I was wrong and I don't know what to do. I'm panicking because it's all so much and I honestly want to just end it all right now but I know that'd only be the easy way out for me. But then I think that maybe I deserve to be selfish and just escape however I can. 

They say the best revenge is to make it (he said I'm just like my mother and 50 years from now I'll be screwed up) but I'm just so tired. I don't want to make it anymore. I'm sure I'll get replies about how I walked into that but I really want us to get better. It's too toxic. I just turned 18 and my dad is always like ""you can go get your own place"" and yeah I can but I'm still broken and he knows that and throws it in my face."
228,A quick look at the history and applications of Expressive Writing and its immense benefits for mental health., [https://bluedoormedia.co/2020/06/15/this-expressive-writing-exercise-can-boost-your-mental-health/](https://bluedoormedia.co/2020/06/15/this-expressive-writing-exercise-can-boost-your-mental-health/)
229,I can’t motivate myself to be better I just rely on the chance that things will magically better themselves,"I know it’s an issue of mine but I’m unaware of how to solve it. I know I probably have some undiagnosed problems I’m dealing with besides only anxiety and ocd. I crave control and want to know what will happen before it happens. I’ve resorted to tarot cards and coincidences to tell me the future since I can’t predict it myself. I know I need therapy, I rehearse what id say in my head every time I’m sad. But every time I get a chance to go, I tell myself I’m fine and don’t need to talk. If I just get more medication all my problems will fix themselves. I can’t reach out to my friends, I’m too annoying, they’ll reach out to me. Working out is too stressful, I’ll just magically lose weight one day. I’m sad, that’s ok, I’ll eventually be happy. My friend is online, I have to talk to them or they’ll find someone else to talk to and get bored of me. I have no motivation to make myself better, even though mentally I know I need to, physically I can’t. I never find time to wash my face, half the time I forget to brush my teeth, when I’m bored I just sleep to pass time. Right now I have a hopeless crush on someone that I’ll never ever tell them about because the tarot cards told me they liked me too so one day I think they’ll just tell me first. I just think if I get enough medication in my system I’ll be fine and that therapists only pretend to care because I’m paying them. How can I motivate myself to be better when nothing seems to work. In my head all my problems are solved but when I try to turn my imagination into reality my motivation disappears."
230,What Is Wrong With Me? No One Will Listen,"Hello! I’m a 17 year old looking for some advice. I don’t know what wrong with me. I’ve been to therapy and everything. Even to the mental hospital but no one can pinpoint what is wrong. My mom doesn’t believe anything is wrong with me, and she tells my doctors and therapists this, so they have already dismissed me when I walk through the door. Here are some of the things I deal with and my concerns in list form for convenience. If anyone has ANY input, I would be more than thankful.

1. I can’t remember anything from my childhood. Or what happened 3 seconds ago. Everything feels like a dream and like I’m watching myself from far away.

2. I have gaps in my memory sometimes. Where everything is just black, or I know I did something but can’t remember doing it fully.

3. I dissociate REALLY bad and have been for months. I haven’t felt at the front of my head since last September. It had completely destroyed my grades and relationships with people. Whenever I think about what’s wrong with me (like rn) I get super dissociated and go into autopilot. It’s hard to type. This also happens when something stressful happens or someone talks to me. I have to actively fight to stay in the present and not get pushed back.

4. I hear voices sometimes. About once a month. I started writing them down while in the mental hospital. Keep in mind, these aren’t like thoughts. They are loud. They are obviously coming from my head, so I’m not hearing them, but my brain processes them like I’m hearing them if that makes sense. Here are my notes 

  *females voice, calm but disappointed tone* *in left ear mostly kinda surround sound* “everything is failing”

*whisper female voice, about my age, soothing and deeper than mine. Right next to my right ear* “hey”

*call of duty guy voice* *intercom noise* ——- inbound! Get down! 

*while I was laughing my ass off* *deep mans voice whispering* “what..the fuck”

*female voice open mouth gasp* (right ear)

5. I panic and go into delusions sometimes. My mom wasn’t home one time when I woke up. I spam called her and my sister and neither answered. I started panicking and thinking they were both dead and had been dead, but I just imagined them being alive and my neighbors were watching me panic feeling bad for me bc they knew I was delusional and lost my mom. My mom and sister were fine. 

6. Sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and be really unfamiliar with my surroundings, even though I’ve lived here for quite some time. This also sometimes happens in places I’m familiar with.


I’m sure there are some things I’ve missed. I just want someone’s input to maybe name of the of these things if they have names, or maybe having someone say they deal with the same thing and know what it is. I just want some insight. I’m not necessarily looking for a diagnosis on reddit, but if this sounds like anything you know of I would love that hear it and look into it. It might help me find what I need. I just feel helpless and stuck.
And if anyone is curious, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, C-PTSD, GAD, and MDD by the mental hospital I was in. I was tested for none of these and I was only there 2 weeks."
231,I'm not so sure what to do anymore,"For the past two months or so, I have just been feeling like I'm in a downward spiral. I've been having such ups and downs lately that I feel like I'm going insane. I'm sleeping in until like 3 or 4 on days I don't have anything to do. When I work I start having such bad anxiety and break down towards the end of my shit. My boyfriend doesn't understand what mental illness is like so he gets frustrated and when I talk to him about it he says ""I just don't know how to fix it"" and he says that's why he gets frustrated. I'm on medication for Bipolar and Anxiety, taking Lamotrigine and Hydrxyxine. It just doesn't feel like anything is working or helping. I try so hard to have a good mindset but it just demolishes itself throughout the day. I feel like no one understands at all what I'm going through and that everyone just thinks that I'm lazy and don't want to do anything. When I get anxiety episodes it's like I snap at my mom or my brother and they are the only ones that see that side of me directed to them. I hate myself for what I've become and I don't know what to do anymore. I cry almost every day about anything and everything and I get so angry about nothing. Do people really mean it when they say that it does get better because right now, it feels like an endless slope into depression. I can't get out."
232,Please help me,"I haven’t slept in three days and I am so tired. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I started vomiting about two hours ago. I can’t eat or sleep. What do I do? Please help me, I feel very sick. I took benedryl and I bought alcohol today, but nothing is helping. I don’t have sleeping pills  what do I do please help"
233,"Does anyone else feel pathetic when they break down for small, insignificant things?",FUCK
234,Something snapped today in my brain. (Trigger warning-sudstance and depression),"I feel like something clicked. And not in a good way. I have been fighting my demons hard and not having anything to show for my hard work or any recgonition from loved ones. Ive never been a drinker. Socially even im usually the DD, im a smoker. But i bought a bottle today. I know if i drink it all i will pass out or atleast not be coherant enough to feel the pain inside. Even though i will 100% get sick afterwards ill do anything to numb my emotions right now. Ive been self harm free for about 4 months and trying not to do that instead. I dont know why im posting exactly i just had to get my thoughts down as im sitting here with indecision on what route to take. All i know is all day ive been thinking ""i finally underdtand why people are alcoholics or drug addicts"" the emtionless shell life seems like a bliss to me right now."
235,I Wish She Could Stay,"I can't even begin to recount all the horrible things that have happened to me just since 2013. I'm not going to because I'm already depressed. Currently I am dealing with my dad having to serve jail time soon. That whole situation and the cause of it is another story for another day. If you're curious I am willing to answer questions. So that part is stressful as is. But it became painfully obvious to me over the past week that it is time to put down my beloved dog. She is 17.5 years old. I've had her for 15 years. She has helped me through so much. But she is now immobile, can't sit up very well anymore, and is showing signs of occasional pain. The problem is that she is still so mentally alert and aware. It's her body that is failing her. I promised myself that at the first sign of pain or discomfort I would make the necessary calls. I made that call today. It was the hardest thing I've done in a while. Her appointment is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon so that my fiance and mother can be there with us. I've asked my doctor to call in a couple emergency xanax to help me through it. I'm so heart broken and sad over her failing health, and other recent events that it physically hurts. I don't want her to go. I wish she could stay. But there is a fine line between living and existing and we are dancing on it right now. The past seven years have been filled with so much sadness and loss. It's so hard to have the energy and motivation to face life sometimes. It's even harder when it's darkness is unrelenting. Idk what I want from this post. I'm just sad and trying to process everything."
236,Obsessed over someone I never met,"**throwaway account ***

I’m obsessed with a girl I’ve never met or talked to. So, last year this girl was in my college class, she was always the one the professor would call on, and she would always know the answer. I really didn’t notice her until half way through the semester. But I believe her intelligence is what made me notice/become obsessed with her. She is also very pretty. 

Being an introvert I never made an attempt to talk to her or anything like that. I have only seen her one other time (last semester), but for some reason I can’t get over her. I obviously know this is very bad, but I can’t stop thinking about her. Maybe I regret not talking to her?  Or maybe I need a therapist. I do have bad anxiety which doesn’t help anything. So, I guess what I am wondering is what should I do to get over this obsession? 

I’ve read some other posts and many of them state that the person needs a hobby. But really with any free time I have outside of school work I work on coding and building electronic projects. So I honestly believe that I’m busy enough not to be obsessing over a thing. 
But I’m open to any and every suggestion. 
 

Also, sorry if the post is all over the place, I was just typing as to what I thought may be important came to mind. 

Thank you"

I often just sit in my bed, under the covers, contemplating what i couldve done to make my parents love me. Ive cut my wrists multiple times, but weirdly not to try end my life. I look at self harm as an escape, like a release of stress with each cut (i know that sounds psychotic) but basically idk what to do and my nan is picking up on the fact im not normal, but i dont want to open up"
240,What to do when your mental health is going down again? (Trigger Warning just in case),"These past days have been really going well for me, with only a few and mild ups and downs.
Well recently I catch myself thinking more and more about drinking to cope, doing drugs again, self harming, suicide, starving myself again, traumatic events, even the ones that have been burried, etc etc.
I have tried meditating, doing workouts and all that stuff, but it doesn't really work for me."
241,Please help,"Sorry if I ramble, I'm just going to outline the bad shit that happened to me and then the effects. I think I should contact my doctor, but I want your guys' opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mum was a drug addict and an alcoholic who suffers from more than a few psychiatric disorders including bipolar. When we were children she emotionally and physically abused myself and my five sisters. She later allowed men to abuse us sexually. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were all taken into foster care. I was cared for by two emotionally abusive elderly people who made me terrified of the world. I was heavily bullied in school. My anxiety levels have been through the roof daily for over 10 years on an almost continual basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

These days I am finding it hard to function. My anxiety got to such an unmanageable level that I had to drop out of University and, just this past year, had to resign my position at work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went four months without showering before, and I urinate in bottles in my bedroom and hoard them. This only makes my anxiety 10x worse in case my landlord discovers this. But I can't overcome some mental block, and consequently spend upwards of 12 hours per-day simply lying on my bed. These periods of lethargy are punctuated by fits of anger and sorrow, wherein I will smash up my stuff, knock all of my books over or cry for a long time alone.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other problems, too. I'm unable to connect with people. I knowingly, but unconsciously (hard to explain) act in a certain way around people: over-the-top, funny, dramatic, sarcastic. What's funny is that hardly anyone I've met has apparently seen through the act, and I can function well around people if I have to, but it only provokes a greater sense of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I attended counselling after I tried to arrange to have myself murdered by a guy in London, but I chickened out. The counselling didn't work. As well-intentioned as my counsellor was (she recommended mindfulness), I couldn't overcome the thought of, ""None of this is going to fix me."" - Thereafter, though, I just lied to her and told her I felt better so that I didn't have to attend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how much of this I should tell my doctor. Please let me know what you guys think. I'm reaching a point of extremis."
242,I think im getting worse," So first things first, medic said i might be on initial stage schizophrenia, before the meds when i was going to travess the avenue near my home, something on the back of my head always said to me that i should jump infront of the cars that were passing by, after the avenue there is a bridge, there my mind told me to toss my bag with phone and everything at the river, also i was way more hatefull before the meds, angry all the time. these days with the meds im better but still i have emotional flattening, i dont care about most people these days to be honest, i use to feel empathy but it just vanished, one thing that still buggers me is that i was with the doctor and a suicide survivor, she told me her story, but i didnt feel anything, no pitty, no empathy, nothing. sometimes, even with the meds when i see a sharp object or tool, i imagine myself hitting the nearest person to me, like my sister was fixing something in her home and she was below me and i imagined myself hiting her with the screwdriver in the head, the thing going all the way in and she dropping. i know its messed up but still i gotta tell someone. and these violent impulses makes me wanna stab people on the street, anyone that give me a funny look or laugh near me. since i was bullied a lot i think i got a chip on my shoulder and this makes things way worse for me.

244,Tried to kill myself again recently and remembered that I can't afford it.,"[This is the price list](https://i.imgur.com/kT3p0cH.jpg) for *county* mental health services. This is who I was referred to after being held on a 5150 in a private psychiatric hospital that will bill for significantly more. I also had to take money out of savings to get my car out of impound. It was in for a single day and cost $560. Nothing says ""we're happy you're alive"" like crushing debt."
245,"I don't know how much patience I have left, need advice","So I have been with my girlfriend for about 2 and a half years now, things were okay for the majority of it but about a year ago her brother came back to her house and she started to have really bad, well, let's call it ""episodes"" I am by no means am expert and all the information I know comes from her and research I've done on my own, she tells me she dissasociates, in simple words she literally stops talking and curls into a ball and hides in a corner. 

But anyway, apparently her brother has a long story of substance abuse and has caused her a lot of issues, to the point that she's quite literally scared of him, she hides in her room a refuses to leave (to go as  far as not going to the restroom for days) 

I've talked to her parents and they told me how mental illness ""runs in the family"" and that they have tried literally everything but even when I'm therapy she refuses to talk. And don't get me wrong, she's a sweet, funny and talkative girl but now it feels like at even the slightest inconvenient or when someone disagrees with her she just has an episode. I feel like I can't communicate or disagree with her. however when these episodes happen I never leave her side (I try to talk to her or get close to her) but then she accuses me of trying to ""guilt her out of it"". 

And on top of that she has a very bad food intolerance that took a long time to pinpoint (when she was younger) and as a result she's always weak and sleeps 10-22h every day. She's been cutting her arm and the best explanation I've gotten from her is that she wants people to see she's not okau. Oh and she has a very bad case of anxiety (she can't order at drive thrus and has to cover her ears whenever I do)

Since she's so physically weak and she needs to do things, I pretty much do everything (cleaning, driving, cooking) and recently she's started to do some of these things on her own, and I thought it was a good thing but now while I'm at work she texts me about how miserable she is and how's she's planing on suicide because she's gross and weak and how she sometimes hallucinates while vacuuming because she's so weak (she also purposely goes more than 24h without eating) because, well, I don't know, I don't have an explanation for that. I offer her my help but she refuses to take it while also complaing so much when I don't help. I don't know what to do, I work 10h every day and I have to sleep early every night and she always has something to feel bad about or cries till late at night and if I don't console her she accuses me of ""getting tired of her"" 
I'm making an inhuman effort to keep myself from collapsing, I am getting tired and I don't know how much longer I can take. I tried to confront her and her solution was just repeatedly telling me to leave her and how horrible of a human being she is and how maybe if she's by herself she can die in peace. She refuses to come to therapy with me because she says she has tried. I don't want to leave her, I really want to help her and see her get better. Does anybody know what I can do to help her?

Hope you guys are doing well. I think I had my first panic attack or anxiety attack, I'm not sure to be honest I've never dealt with anything like this before and frankly I don't even know where it came from. I was just sitting at my desk and then all of a sudden I had trouble breathing, my hands got all clammy, and I felt really trapped almost like how you would imagine a cornered animal would feel. After that I haven't been able to concentrate properly on my work and am struggling keep up performance. Has anyone experienced these kind of symptoms and what could it possibly be?

I don’t buy the entire “treatment resistant depression” thing."
249,I confronted my mum today about her making me lie to an ER doctor after a bad relapse. She apologised to me.,"TW: self harm.




Hi, everyone. So a few years ago, I’d had a really bad relapse after getting into a big fight with my mum and sister. Our family environment has always been incredibly toxic and my mental health was never as bad as when I was living with them (luckily I’ve been living alone for a long while now and they don’t stay on the same continent as me). 

About 3-4 years ago I was really going through it, it’s all a blur but those years were really really bad. I’d recently gone through a bad breakup, the relationship ended because of my mental health. I was going through my BA and it was really tough. On top of that, my family was being overwhelming af and they fight... a lot. Everything became a fight, and if end up involved whether it was about me or not, they’d drag me into it. 

I don’t remember much of the build up, but I remember wanting to disappear, wanting them to just shut the fuck up for once, make my own thoughts slow down, just make every single thing in and around me stop. I blanked and at the end of it I’d popped my head open because I kept hitting it. I wear a lot of rings so it was pretty bad... 

i don’t remember much of what happened immediately after but I remember hearing my mum yelling my name, my sister started screaming at my mum saying it was her fault , and then I was somehow at the hospital. My mum made me lie to the ER doctor and say that “I got dizzy because of my period and I fell.”  She kept asking me if I got the story straight. 

I know where she was coming from: it would be on my record somewhere if I got institutionalised and might have been difficult for me to get a job in the future. Also, her reputation. I don’t agree with it, it’s why I brought it up years later. Looking back, I really needed professional help. I was incredibly suicidal and had been severely self harming for years. I’d stopped for a few months but this episode threw me right back into the thick of it. I should have told the doctor truth, and if the doctors wanted me institutionalised, I honestly think it would have been a good thing. I needed help... it took me so so long to recover from those episodes on my own and now, years later, I have severe recurring chronic migraines and have an MRI scheduled cause I never got the mental or physical treatment I needed because I kept being coerced into lying to doctors. 

She did apologise and admitted that it probably would have been for the best but she was just “trying to protect me”. I don’t buy it. I believe she believed she was trying to protect me but in reality she was protecting herself and her reputation. I’m just glad I can look back on it now and see where it went all wrong when I was actually getting better. It makes me really sad cause it was clearly a cry for help. I just wanted all the pain and noise to stop... 

I’m a lot better now and have started therapy, of my own accord. It’s good to have control over my own life. It’s taken many many years but I no longer have to feel shamed of my mental health. I can say I need help and not be scared of someone stopping me. I’m sorry this is long, but I just wanted to get it off my chest."

251,Nervous about seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow,"CW: depression,  anxiety, suicidal ideation, medication, self harm, od, please let me know if anything else


Heyy so I just figured talking about it could help me process a wee bit and someone might relate or have some advice

Im currently medicated for anxiety and depression, however these past couple months have been really difficult in a way I had never felt before. I’m not suicidal at all or fantasise about it anymore, not because i am happy existing but because i have kinda just wanna try new things and hit rock bottom instead. Like the worse I am, the freer? If that makes any sense

My anxiety is way better than when I first saw the doctor, but every day is just the same shit over and over, and I have kinda come to terms with it. I’ve been trying things to take my mind out of it, including overdosing (which i know was irresponsible and won’t do again), cbd (didn’t work for me), then ended up with self harming. I like seeing blood and it calms me down—although now I’m always worrying if the cuts are showing.

To make things extra awkward, last time i talked to my doctor i just basically said everything was fine and now I’m not sure how to go about this, or even what to tell/not tell him. I have self-harmed before but uhm never really opened much about it and am afraid of how he might react"
252,How do I get a diagnosis?,"I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me or where to look, I work full time and NHS therapy only operates weekdays. I can’t afford private therapy. Where do I start?"
253,Hypnagogic hallucinations and trouble sleeping....medication recs? Seroquel?,"I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and mild bipolar disorder. I've also been experiencing hynagogic hallucinations for a year or so. They are terrifying and really take it out of me, I'm mentally exhausted for the entire day following it and feel very fuzzy all day. I have also consistently had issues sleeping. Sometimes it takes me hours to fall asleep, sometimes I wake up and have to catch my breath as if I've stopped breathing at night, sometimes I'm just tossing and turning all night and can't stay asleep at all. 

My psychiatrist recommended Seroquel, but I've read some pretty terrible things about it. I've been working out for the past 7 months really trying to lose some weight, but I gain weight easily and it's not easy for me to lose it. This is my main concern with Seroquel, the weight gain side effect. 

Does anyone take medication for hynagogic hallucinations? Recommendations for types of medications or experience with Seroquel? 

Anything experience would be helpful right now. I feel pretty lost and unsure what to do."
254,I'm having a breakdown over ants,So I guess the best way to explain this is I'm very sensitive over my space being clean and more than that over food being clean. Part of this comes with a major fear of bugs. Normally I can clean and leave when they show up but for obvious reasons I'm stuck at home. So basically I wanna rant a bit cause now whenever I'm in my room it feels like everything is contaminated and like ants are crawling all over me and it makes me wanna curl into a ball and peel off my skin. So ironically enough I'm outside under my hanging lavender plant panicing because I already cleaned and don't know what to do. To say the least I hate that I have to go back in there tonight and plan on staying outside for as long as possible. Thanks for reading.
255,I might have driven away the love of my life.,"Hi. I tried posting to r/relationshipadvice, but have to wait for approval to post. I made a throwaway account because I am paranoid, but I really need urgent help.

Last night I (29M) ended up having a huge fight with my partner (28F) of 4 years. I feel I have to tell you a bit about us, before sharing what happened last night. This is probably going to be long, bear with me please. I need your help.

I have been struggling with my mental health for about 13 years after my brother was in a car crash. He survived, but sustained heavy damage to his brain and has been handicapped and basically had his quality of life torn to shreds. He cant do anything on his own, bound to a wheel chair and assistants 24/7. His short term memory is sort of a groundhog day scenario in which it just resets every other day. His long term memory sort of works, but its a strange one. We grew up in a very small town and the health services are very poor, so it was up to my mom and dad to take care of him. It really fucked up our family. I had already moved out to go to high school in a different town (age 16 at the time). I havent really worked through the trauma, and thats all on me, but nevertheless I have managed to lead a good enough (but quite nihilistic) life. I love learning so I have spent the years educating myself, getting 2 bachelor degrees and trying to find myself and friends along the way.

I met my girlfriend in college. We started the same degree in 2014, became very close friends and soon after lovers. Moved in together in the last year of our education in 2017. Since then I have been freelancing and trying to make it as a creative writer while also working on my mental health. She is a very successfull and sought after script writer/director in our city. She is very ambitious and extremely driven. I admire and love her deeply. I have never been envious of her success, it only makes me soar with pride. But theres no doubt that I have developed quite a inferiority complex in the last years (our close friends from college share her strong characteristics of what it takes to make it in the business, so there are a lot of successfull people in my social group). She and all of my friends are very supportive of me, and have always admired me and my writing because I have some sort of ability to pierce the veil between sincerity and irony. Unfortunately i both hate and doubt myself too much to be able to actually write what i want. I can help others with the same fears and problems, but never apply it to myself.

And as I am writing this I'm starting to notice something familiar. This whole text is starting to become about me. My girlfriend is often accusing me of being narcissistic (which my former therapist also told me is a trait I score above average on). I know this, and I know I'm not always able to see it coming, but I am trying to get better. My girlfriend has always done what has to be done in her life. She is the embodiment of a strong independent woman, and never gotten anything for free. Besides that she has lived a very comfortable and priveliged life, both emotionally and economically. This is where we are very different. And these differences are often the root cause of why our normal fights end up in me screaming my lungs off. When my brothers accident turned my life upside down, and the initial sadness was all cried out, I replaced sadness with anger and rage. Against the universe. This is a huge problem, because when I get sad, I actually just get angry, and in the worst moments I cant control what I am saying.

So: Last night, we had a fight. She has been struggling with a career choice for a couple of months, and I have been supporting her the absolute best way I could have done. Encouraging her to continue down the path she wants to go, encouraging her to trust her driven and ambitious nature (and basically fuck the eventual haters, doubters, and hypothetical scenarios she spins up about this decision). I have told her time and again what she needs to hear. She has issues about opening up and being vulnerable to our friends, because her shell is very hard. It has always been like this, because she needs herself to be strong and invulnerable to reach her goals. I have been telling her that she HAS to open up and share with our friends, as well as talking to a professional if she wants to continue growing. And last night she shared her concerns with some of our friends, with me by her side. They told her word for word, in the exact same tone, what I have been telling her for weeks and months.

She was relieved. She listened. After we got home she told me how great it was that ""someone finally told her the right things. Exactly what she needed to hear"". And I told her ""yeah, isn't it strange how things sound different when it comes from someone else?"". I wasn't actually trying to say that she isn't listening to me. But we have had fights before about how I feel she doesnt take me seriously any more, or even respects me to some extent. She knows Im not living up to my potential, and has started to kind of resenting me for it. She has told me how she has started to get annoyed by me being home every day she comes home from work, how my mood and aura infests our home (when I am feeling down, but also on a regular basis, which hurts me a lot). She pounced on me immediately, and when I realized this was going to be a fight, I couldnt stop myself (we were very drunk as well, by the way). I started yelling at her how this is just another example of her not respecting me anymore, that she doesn't take me seriously. Then it was a lot of back and forth about how I am exactly the same to her. How I am a narcissist and everything has to be about me all the time. Then I just completely lost it, and stepped over her boundaries. I was in a rage and screamed at her that she has no clue about real struggles, that she spins up childish irrelevant scenarios that arent real issues. That all she has ever struggled with is the realization that every human being has to die at some point (this was her ""existential crisis"" during her early 20s). I basically belittled her for not having endured any ""real"" pain in her life. She started crying. I knew I was way out of line, but I had no control, and felt no desire to stop. I wanted to hurt her feelings. So I kept going until I could see how much I hurt her.

My mind and physical health has been deteriorating and spiraling downwards for a while. I have been unemployed for a long time, and my inferiority complex has been growing a lot. Last night it just crumbled into insanity. I was actively sabotaging the best thing in my whole life. After we stopped yelling I went out in the living room and punched my fist into the wall until it nearly broke. Sat down, staring out the window for an hour, drunk, shamefull, a sorry piece of shit contemplating how horrible I just had been to the love of my life. And how small she also makes me feel. Then I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up, she went to work, I went to my doctor who contacted my previous therapist trying to get me back in their service (public service, so theres a wait list and certain requirements need to be met to get their help).

When I got home I just slept until my girlfriend came home. I had bought her flowers on the way home, and prepared my apology. I told her how sorry I was – I was way out of line. I crossed a border I understand might be too far, I never want to do this again to you, but understand if this was the last chance. She told me she never wants to confine anything to me ever again, she doesn't trust me anymore.

I understand that. I really do. I know I might have fucked up to the point where we are done. And I dont blame her if this is the end of us. I love her more than anything else in my life. She is unreasonable and makes me frustrated, but that is nothing compared to the love we have for eachother. How much she has supported me, how long she has stood by me in sickness and health. I'm afraid I've driven her away for the last time. I have told her how sorry I really am. I don't know what else to do now.

Can you help me? What can I do? How do I get her trust back? How do I even suggest she can trust me again? Words aren't enough, I need to show her how much I love her, and how sorry I am. I just dont know how. Please help me."
256,Are my thoughts normal?,"So I love to think about killing myself. I like to think about how shocked everyone would be and realise ""oh no she really was suffering"". I fantasise about it several times a week sometimes several time a day but only for 2 mins tops each time.

Is this a normal thing to do? I always had these thoughts but would never call myself suicidal becuase I know i dont want to kill myself. I have a history of self harm but suicide was never a thing I ever seriously considered.

Does eveyone get these thoughts? Are they just a product of the romanticisation of suicide in the media? Should I tell someone I have these despite them not being serious in any way?"

258,Have I been affected by this for too long?,"A person who I had been close friends with for about 11 years ended things via a text message in Fall '18, a single text, not a conversation

They sent me a message saying that they'd found different people since we'd both started at the university we went to and that they'd felt separate from me, and they thought it was better if we kept it that way

Mind you, this was a single text messag,  not a conversation...

I called them later begging them not to cut me out completely, since we had been friends for 11 years at that point, and their only answer was ""Why?"" as in 'Why would I keep in touch?'

I already removed their contacts from all of my accounts, but we have mutual friends, including someone I've had feelings for for a while, so... yeah... and my anxiety has me terrified that they're romantically involved or might get romantically involved soon

This happened in Fall '18... I didn't talk about it till Fall '19 when my mom coaxed it out of me and I started talking to my therapist about it not long after

I'm concerned that I'm not over this even though I've been talking about it for 9 months now... any mention of this person or seeing any interactions between them and my crush causes distress

Were they in the wrong with how they ended things?

Am I wrong for still being distressed by this?

Any advice on dealing with this is greatly appreciated, thanks."
259,Coming to terms with the fact I may have anger issues,"Title says most of it, I think I have anger issues. I just have such a short fuse sometimes and I hate it so so much. I just want to be mellow, but I just freak out and feel like I want to break things and be violent. It's horrible but it just feels so good at the time. 

I need to get back into therapy, but current events are making it nearly impossible and it's terrible. 

I think I know how to work on it, but I want support. And God, I want anti depressants lol"

262,I think I have an irrational fear of falling down stairs after injuring my leg,"Okay I don't really know if this is the right place to post this but I need some advice because it's been months and months. 

So almost a year ago I injured my knee doing something completely unrelated to stairs. I was on crutches for a while and had to have surgery on it.

Physically I'm pretty much recovered. I'm still cautious about my knee and careful with it but I'm basically fine. However, for some reason I now have a persistent fear of going down stairs? Like I will be just minding my own business and suddenly I'm thinking about tripping and falling down stairs. I know this might seem really minor but it happens multiple times a day and it's upsetting. 

I don't really understand why injuring my leg could have brought this on when I didn't injure it falling down stairs, I never thought about falling before I injured myself.

I'd really appreciate if someone could shine some light on why this might have happened and if there's anything I can do to stop myself thinking about it so much."

264,Job advice fast help please thanks,I have been replaced at my old job but now applying for more places I finally heard back from one. My mom is making me get a job just graduating high school and so I applied places. I got word back from McDonald’s and my options are to go in for an interview which I do not really want to do because if I start working I will be trapped in the way that I hated my last job mom would not let me quit until other job secured threatened turning my phone off for good which is the only real thing that makes me happy because I am able to talk to friends family etc. anyways I have some mental health struggles with very bad OCD and compulsive issues along with horrible paranoia and I do not know if I could take the stress that fast food jobs put people through so I have heard. I do not know what to do because my mom wants to know if I hear back from anywhere and I am enjoying the time I have not working because I can relax talk to friends talk to my girlfriend etc. but I do not know what to do. Please leave some advice.
265,Be careful telling yourself things can't get any worse...,They can.. Sometimes you look back &amp; realize you did life all wrong &amp; it's too late... Then you realize that you felt the same exact way back then.. &amp; maybe it clouded your judgement.. Can't expect not to crash while staring in the rearview... But the damage piles up like a wreck on the highway &amp; you can't help but rubberneck... Ha.. Twisted cycle it is I tell ya... Idk if there is any escape for me at this point I'm pretty sure I'm tormented beyond recovery... I hate being this way.. I hate being.. I pray god soon takes me swiftly &amp; gives me a re-doo.. Not sure how long I can wait for such miraculous event to occur.. I don't want to have to take matters into my own hands.. I'm not scared to not exist.. I just hate the process &amp; the idea of what I'll leave behind... Idk why I'm even writing this here but then again why not.. Not like I could express this to anybody in real life heh

267,Social disorder?,Okay so I know I’m gonna tell my doctor about it but it’s been bugging me for a while. I told my therapist about it but for a while (even before my meds) I have a hard time reading and assessing situations. And I kinda don’t know how to feel when I’m in trouble or someone is mad at me or comes to me venting. I know usually people would feel remorse but usually I just kinda act on what I’m feeling and sometimes it’s genuinely me not knowing how to respond or what to say. And it usually winds me up in more trouble. And I come off as indifferent when I’m not trying to but people come to me sometimes woth things and I just kinda feel nothing and sometimes I don’t know what to say or how to feel and I just have a hard time picking up on social cues or understanding what I did was wrong. Like my mom will ne yelling at me and I’ll be staring blankly at her and she gets more mad and yells at me all ‘why are you just staring at me!? You don’t have anything to say!?’ And gets more angry. Or like. Someome woll tell me something important and then I can’t seem to understand the importance of it and my brain will wander to my own things and I have a hard time prioritizing things from importance to non importance. I also have a hard time feeling things? Someone will come to me and tell me what I did hurt them and I feel nothing about it? I don’t feel guilt I mostly feel confusion. Or they’ll vent to me and I don’t feel empathy for them? I just don’t know what to do. Any advice in what this could mean? I don’t want a diagnosis but I don’t see my doctor until July and it’s killing me
268,My wife needs help,"My wife is in desperate need of help. She’s been doing incredibly dangerous things.

She drinks when she’s supposed to be watching our kids.  She once got so drunk that she started beating our oldest child.

She doesn’t make them food while I’m at work. And she forces our two oldest children to watch our youngest (10-8 and 2) while she lays in bed 

She claims that she’s this way because I have schizophrenia and am prone to bad days now and then but the drinking has always been a problem for her. 

I’m not sure what to do, she’s getting dangerous. 

So can I have her committed? What should I do? I love her and under no circumstances do I want cps involved. I just want her to get help"

All that kinda stuff and the more creepy/ scary ask reddit videos. I really need to stop because it’s taking an effect on my mind, I can no longer sleep properly at night and sometimes I just get terrified and yet when I wake up I always go back for more.

I’m also getting a bit of a headache tryna think about this cause it’s kinda stressing me out... it’s not just bad memories it’s just kind of a mixture of everything.. as if I know it happened and I remember it happening but at the same time it’s all just a blur...I’m not sure why this is happening but I really feel like I had a clearer memory of everything before...
271,Feeling Super Lost,"This is the first post I've ever made, and I wish it could be a little happier, but it is what it is. I know there's a huge community out there, and seeing as I don't really feel like part of any community right now, I'm turning to y'all. There's a YouTube video (TEDx talk) that I was watching last night that really made me realize what was happening because I related to it so much: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDPDEKtd2yM&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDPDEKtd2yM&amp;t)

I started crying when I got to the part where he's talking about lying in bed feeling overwhelmed, because he forgot what being happy felt like. That was me right then, right there; it's what led me to watch that video in the first place. I've been dealing with depression for about three years now, and have been in therapy since I was in fourth grade (I'm now well into college). My family knows, my friends know; I've got more support than I know what to do with. Even with all that, I feel more alone now than I ever have. 

If I have a purpose in life, it seems like everything else falls into place. Up until about three months ago, I had the best job in the world. I'm a performing artist, and I was surrounded by a team that became as close a family as they come. I used to spend my days creating things that amazed my audience, and they'd run up at the end of it and tell me all about how incredible it was. It was a pretty fucking amazing ego booster. I used to wake up every morning giddy with excitement, and fall in bed at the end of the day completely satisfied. I started to take it for granted, and right when that happened, it got taken away from me overnight. My city shut down, and my work closed. 

I was so convinced that nothing was ever going to take that job and that family away. Even when they were standing right in front of me trying to explain how toxic putting all your energy into a job is, I didn't pay attention. That job was the best thing that had ever happened to me, it pulled me out of the worst depressive episode I'd ever had and showed me that I could love myself in a way I never thought was possible. I felt worthy of that love, I felt like I deserved it. I cared more about the job than I cared about myself, and that was toxic. I didn't realize that until it was too late. The depressive episode I had before I started seems puny compared to the one I'm in now. I don't know if I'm ever going to see that broken little work family ever again. 

I'm scared. I've been super lucky to never have experienced grief or trauma in the way that I am now, but that means I don't really have prior experiences of dealing with it that I can look back on to comfort me. I've never lost hope that I can get through it, I just don't really know how I'm going to. Back when I first got laid off, I told myself I'd be a much stronger person on the other side of all of this, and I still believe that. Even then though, I was scared of the person that would be on the other side, because I didn't know what they would have had to live through to say they'd survived. 

I'm not the person I was back when I got laid off. I'm jaded, I'm sad, I'm exhausted. I'm still waiting for the job to come back, because I work for a pretty strong company that should be able to survive at least another few months of lockdown. I'm also super lucky financially, and can basically sit on my ass and wait for the job to come back. It was never about money for me. Somehow, I haven't completely imploded, and I've managed to not really make my own situation any worse. It's gonna take me a long ass time to heal from this, and I'm determined that I will. I've got some fucking dark demons though, and they've now been in control for long enough to make me hate myself. I say things to myself that I'd never dream of saying to anyone else, but I can't stop. 

This is my call for help, and I'm pretty scared to put it out there. I've tried just about everything else, though, so maybe it'll lead somewhere. I'm hoping that I can get myself out of this downwards spiral and provide some words of comfort to others on here, but I can't love other people until I learn how to love myself."
272,"""you're on you period huh?""","I feel like I am faking all the time. I have never went to a doctor. I haven't told anyone. I feel like I am invalid and the only reason I seem to have ""mental illness"" is my self harm. I hate it. I hate the way I feel all the time I hate that I can't lay in bed all day and I hate when I do that no one cares enough to enter the room. I am so mad. I have all these emotions at once. It always ""your on your period huh"" I am so mad and sick and tired of keeping it to myself. I have my cuts out with my parents they dont seem to care. I want love. I want support. I was someone to understand. but at the end of the day I still know I am being over dramatic. and self harm don't mean I have a mental illness. I know no one is gonna respond but that just drives the  point."
273,I feel bad but i don’t want to get better,Basically the title. I just don’t want to get better for some reason. It’s been this way my whole life when i have therapists i don’t talk to them and i don’t take medicine. I’m not sure why because living like this sucks sometimes. Does anyone feel this way or has in the past?
274,There's nothing for me,"I wake up pissed off that I woke up, everything I do ends up being major disappointment. Ive looked at careers and tried a quite a few different types of jobs but they all seem useless to me (nothing is worth working for) and the more I realize that the less motivated I become. My mind constantly tells me I'm not meant to live in this world at all, but I can't kill myself until I've fully cut everyone off. How can I cope with living in a society that does not interest me in any way shape or form until everyone I know hates me so I can finally end it. I feel stuck in a constant panic, I have the option to 'fix' myself and become a functional member of society through therapy and drugs but I think id rather just wait till I die hopefully soon because no matter my mental health I think I've always felt this way. I guess the main question is how can I live in this world without having to conform to social structure like everyone else? Attempting to live off the land till I die a quick death is my best option right now. Anything else?"
275,Books about mental health,"Hey, I’m looking for a book to read that goes into detail about any kind of mental disorder (like anxiety to DID). Something non-fiction and goes more into details of the mind and symptoms rather than to cope. 
Any suggestions?:)"
276,Is there anything useful I can do if I think I might suffer from BDD?,"I’ve had insecurities over my appearance for several years, starting in my teens. The resulting activity has ranged from constantly worrying about my hair to crying in my room because I felt too ugly to even go outside. No amount of reassurance seems to help. People have complimented me on my appearance, but it never feels convincing. I’d say I worry about the way I look virtually every day and I frequently take pictures of myself from different angles to try to evaluate how I look. It’s not helped by the fact that, if I were to be try to be optimistic and believe I’m really better-looking than I feel, I’d only be able to push myself to average territory.

I do feel like my appearance has improved over time, at least in part because I’ve taken more care to try to look better. However, I still can’t shake the feeling that even when I’m feeling good about myself, I’m actually just deluding myself and I still dislike having my photo taken. I’ll always find something to dislike about photos people take of me. The worry of being ugly (or sometimes it feels like I just don’t look the way I feel I should) is one that just never really leaves my head. But if I’m honest, I don’t know what I can really do about it."
277,Cried while thinking about suicide.,"I think the last time I had any sort of piece of mind was when I begun 8th grade...in 2013. Since then my life hasn't been the same. It's been a roller-coaster that goes 99% downhill. It's incredible how much worse life can get with time if you just give it the chance. 

I'm in poverty. I can't get a decent paying job even though I'm desperate enough to work 7 days a week. I honestly don't know how I'll make rent next month. My mother and I have no family to lean on, and no friends to ask for help from. We only have one another, and my 5 year old sister to care for.

It has been immensely stressful. I've been losing hair like crazy (I'm a woman btw). I can pull out tufts of hair as though it were nothing. I will cry and break down almost immediately if I stop to reflect about my life. My free time consists of me indulging in things that will completely distract me from my reality. Any of my positivity is obliterated by my mother's depression. 

I have little to no ambition, no desire. Everything costs money and I have none. I feel so hopeless. I've considered purchasing a life insurance that covers suicide and after a certain period just killing myself. I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I see no solution. Every door has been shut and locked. 

Yet at the same time, I don't want to die. I hate my life, I hate living, yet I don't want to die. Suicide feels like the only option for the pain and suffering to end but I don't want to go."
278,"I keep putting myself in dangerous/weird situations, in hopes of being murdered or seriously hurt.","I’m sorry for being blunt with the title, but it’s true. I’m past the depression and anxiety phase. I constantly feel nothing, and frankly want nothing more but to fade away into blackness for good. All my family is gone. No one left. I don’t have any friends (no exaggeration there, I have absolutely no one) because I don’t trust people. I’m on anti-depressants which I’m not going to lie, has been helping but nothing and no one is going to alleviate my strong desire to die.

I believe in God and refuse to die by my own hands (even though I have a gun that I can use at anytime on myself if things get too bad) but I keep putting myself in unsafe situations mostly with random men. I find them on the Internet and always have no problem meeting up with them for sex. A lot of them are weird lol, but I still let them tie me up and occasionally hurt me. The truth is though, the only reason why I’m doing this...is in hopes of stumbling upon that one “crazy person” who will drug me up and murder me then throw my body somewhere in the forest. This makes me sooo ashamed. I can’t stop though I just feel like it’s my way out. I don’t have a question nor am I really starting a discussion. I’m just getting this off my chest. Thanks for reading."
279,Smiling and saying hi to people while walking my dog has had a big positive impact on my mood lately,"So exercise has always been a big tool for me in fighting depression, and lately we've had a lot of nice sunny days where I live. So I've been taking my dog on these big long walks. 

A little background: I'm living with my parents this summer while studying for full-time the LSAT, so I'm back for a few months in this small canadian town that I grew up in.

Anyways, point being --- people are super nice here. It's like the suburbs of a small town, it's nothing like that big city vibe. So I've been making a point out of trying to smile and say hi to everyone I encounter on my walks. 

Well, on an hour long walk I happen to see a lot of people--- walking, enjoying the weather on their front porch,  whatever. It was just a random decision that I should do this, and maybe it sounds stupid that I had to consciously think about doing this, but I just smiled and said hi to all of them. I must have seen like 15 different people at least. 

Now I look forward to saying hi to people on the street basically. Idk why, but it makes me so happy in a simple way, just exchanging a smile and a hello with lots of people. Sometimes I stop and have conversations about my dog, or someone else has a dog and we let them play. Sometimes people make a bit of small talk. 

All my interactions have been digital for a pretty long time because of covid, and just interacting with people in real life feels really refreshing right now! It seems like such a banal and quotidian thing for me to be raving about, but it's been making me really happy so I thought this might be somewhere to share this experience. I know that sometimes those small wins can mean a lot. 

If anyone out there is feeling sad, or tired, or dealing with depression, try going on a long walk and just smiling and saying hi to the people you see--- it feels great!"
280,How do I get help?,"I've had problems with my mental health since forever but it started getting really bad around 2 years ago. Before I could handle it somewhat but it's started to affect my grades and they've been going steadily downhill.

So I realized I probably need some help and I've tried to bring it up a couple of times but my mom is the type to say that nothing's wrong with me and that I'm perfectly fine. And i know that she means well but that just makes me feel worse and like I'm faking it.

And my friend tried to get help last year but the way my mom talked about it makes me feel very reluctant to ask her about this.

How am I supposed to ask her about this?"
281,I can't enjoy music.,"I suffer from major depressive episodes that completely deprive me of all emotion. They tend to pass after a few months, but my enjoyment of music always seems to be the last thing  to come back to me. Does anyone have any advice on how to help? Music is one of my biggest coping mechanisms for my anxiety problems."
282,"Well,","I struggle with anxiety both generalized and social, Bipolar disorder, depression, and ptsd.
I know it's not okay to isolate 24/7 365 days a week, but when out with friends, wether it be a beach, card game, fire... Whatever. I hate myself. I know they love me and love when I'm included but being as I don't drink anymore it just kinda makes me feel blah, even if they're not drinking. Being alone I have my highs and low with it. Sometimes I hate myself then sometimes I'm vibing with the me time...

Anyone else? Open for discussion. 💜"
283,I sometimes feel like I’m being watched.,"I sometimes feel like someone is standing behind me, or that something is hiding under my bed. It’s mostly when I’m alone in the dark, so it’s probably nothing serious. Does this happen to anybody else?"
284,Need help. Too embarrassed to actually seek help with fear that i am the problem,"I'll start with I'm a 31 year old married male (together with my wife for 9 years) with 2 children under 5. I've had undiagnosed depression for a long time but just went about my business burying my issues as its not masculine to talk about your emotions. I feel as though people dislike me (including my wife) and talk about be behind my back and my general days I feel numb to the world as if its not real.

Lately I've been really bad and my wife seems to have no interest in my days, stress or what seems like much of me. I've never once told her about my issues and 2 weeks ago finally told her I'm extremely depressed and need help (which has taken years to even say). I've never even told my own mother of my problems. 

Nothing seems to have changed since asking for help apart from getting a webpage to look at. Today I vented about my bad day and felt like i was mocked and when i called her out she claims to have never even said the words i heard come out of her mouth.

Well i slipped away and cried in the bathroom. I feel insignificant and worthless. I think im losing it

I'm too afraid to ask for help aside from the anonymity of here. I just want to vanish and it to no longer be a bother."
285,It’s gonna rain today.,"I can’t remember the last time it rained, so I kinda look forward to it. I feel like everyone hates the rain, but I actually kinda love it. It’s just so calming to me, and I’m bored of the sunshine (and basically everything in my life). It’s nice to have some change sometimes."
286,Nothing nothing nothing,"Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing.  Nothing nothing!  Nothing...? Nuh-nuh-uh-uthing.

The pointlessness of things is overwhelming at times.  I can see the appeal of cults.  I want to respect someone, obey, and give my life to them.  It doesn't matter the ultimate goal of the endeavor.  All in all, from the cradle to the grave, everything is evenly intrensically useful...or useless.  We're just chemical compounds made out of chemical compounds.  When you look at us under an electronic microscope, you'll realize that we're ninety- percent _______."
287,Advice on excessive worrying and overthinking?,"I'm (25) a graduated pharmacist, currently doing a second degree in Biomedical Sciences. Diagnosed with ADHD at 5 and with dysthemia at 17. I attempted suicide 2 years ago, after years of struggling in school and a head pharmacist telling me I was too stupid to be a pharmacist. I've felt broken and worthless ever since.

(I take Ritalin -comparable to Adderall- and have been on antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds in the past. I quit them after I got over a suicidal episode)

Had an exam today and overanalyzed some right answers to the point of changing them to the wrong ones. I've been thinking about this for hours on end, crying and blaming myself.

I honestly can't stop thinking about matters like this, I seem incapable of letting anything negative/scary/unknown go. 
This week alone I've broken down about 4 times, wanted to quit my major, change my major to another one etc.
I'm also dead scared of the future (especially concerning getting a job) and I can't stop worrying about it. 

Do any of you have experience with this? How do I break the cycle?"
288,I think I have an eating disorder,"I'm 24 and I think I've always, or at least since I can remember, had a poor relationship with food. I binge when I'm upset and unfortunately that's a lot of the time. Food is my comfort, my one access to happiness that isn't reliant on another person. But I punish myself mentally for it. It's all I can ever think about. This is something that has gotten worse as I've come into my 20s. I've gone through so many cycles of restricting and binging and it peaked when I reached my highest weight at 156 lbs. 

And at that point I had had enough, so I lost 23 lbs by counting calories and restricting myself for long enough to get to a point where I couldn't do it anymore. I won't pretend I'm not happy I lost that weight, when I look at pictures of myself back then I am really disgusted. But I'm still disgusted at my appearance, if only slightly less than before. Compliments do not help. Not only is my face disgusting, but the one thing I can theoretically change, my body, is also disgusting.

I've always known how bad my relationship with food is, but maybe never grasped that it could be an eating disorder because I don't 'look' like someone you typically associate with an eating disorder. In my eyes I'm slightly overweight and always have been - except when I was straight up fat. When you think eating disorder, especially as a teenager, you think of a small, skinny girl. And that's something I could never be. And I hate myself for even thinking such a thing - I absolutely dont want to glorify it.

I am also aware that addressing it means I need to get help. And that means I'll have to learn to not care about calories anymore - but in my mind, that will stop me from losing weight. That's my priority, I need to be thin. And if addressing my eating disorder prevents me from being thin then it can wait. What if I am free from the disorder and I put all that weight back on? Or I stay looking like this disgusting in-between, slightly overweight and chubby in all the wrong places. I'm hyperaware of this issue and I know it's unhealthy to not seek treatment because it will hinder my weight loss, but it's how I am feeling. I feel stuck. I hate it."

I logically know that people can’t hear my thoughts, but for some reason I can’t shake the feeling. I’ve tried continually telling myself that people can’t hear my thoughts, but it isn’t working.

Every time someone looks at me, whispers, or goes silent, it feels like confirmation of this fact, even though I know that that’s not actually evidence.

Is there any advice anyone can give to help me? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills."
291,"this is going to be a long and shitty one. i hope someone responds, and if anyone saw the post from two weeks ago, drinking has become a kind of habit for me and i do it semi usually. it's probably deleted so don't bother looking in my profile.","so basically: i'm an envious bitch and it's actively hurting me. every time i see someone i know do anything enjoyable or talk about enjoyable memories or anything it hurts me. it pains me to see people being happy because i want that for me. i also don't want to tell anyone that them being happy makes me sad because it just hurts me even more to see how i hurt people who i know. i don't want to do that again and it feels terrible. but every time i see them it hurts. it reminds me of how i wasted my life and how i could've done much more with the little limited time that i had. it makes me feel like i'm unsuccesful for my age. at 14 i feel like i should be already working in life proyects and solving my personal problems because so many people around me have done it and i just feel like this hideous useless piece of shit who never gets anything done. i want to work on shit, i want to do stuff. i guess i'm kind of doing something like that rn but it doesn't feel like enough. i feel too old to do things and i just kinda feel worthless???

&amp;#x200B;

i hope i had done more with my time when i was younger."
292,I don't wanna go outside anymore.,"A few months ago I was diagnosed with paranoia after my leave at a mental hospital (I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety there as well). 
Before that, my counselor said I most likely had trauma though I've never had it diagnosed. 
I have been tortured, yelled at, screamed at, physically and mentally abused by a group of kids at my school (I'm a transgender male).
My parents have done everything they can to try and sue the school, get police involved, etc etc and nothing has worked. Lack of evidence I guess. 
My life has been complete shit since then. 
For months I've been afraid to go outside, if I step outside even once I'll have a panic attack and break down. 
My paranoia is so severe I haven't gotten sleep, I'm constantly exhausted, I don't take care of myself, and I haven't been outside of my house in months. 
I've tried every meditation/mental health app out there I've spent money trying trials on them and nothing works. 
I even got a kitty as an emotional support animal and that helped a tiny bit.
Life seems meaningless. It's like I've dug myself the deepest hole and the only way to escape is to die.
But I can't.
I'd be leaving behind my family who loves me, my friends who love and need me for support. 
If anybody knows how I feel please comment or anything, my dms are open.
It's such a weird feeling and I don't know anybody who has felt it before. Thank you."
293,Ignore mental health,"Decade long Reddit lurker. Finally made an account. My mental health is atrocious, despite ignoring it. I have denied it for years.

Currently I:
1) Drink heavily most nights
2) Take prescription drugs daily (illegal imports)
3) Take drugs several times a month (through significant self restraint)
4) Hold a 'successful', high paying job
5) Am single
6) Have no close friends 
7) Hold a good number of professional qualifications
8) Am educated to masters level
9) Have aspergers (diagnosed)
10) Have OCD (undiagnosed, silly rituals, hair pulling)
11) Have a terribly unorganised house (started decorating and never finished - did the destruction without the rebuild)
12) Have attempted suicide four times in the last few years
13) Eat excessively 
14) Exercise excessively 
15) Make ridiculous gambles on the markets (which I can currently afford z,)
16) Rarely complete tasks to completion
17) Lie extensively during therapy sessions 

I'm 27 male and feel like I'm just getting worse. NHS (UK) waiting lines are so long that I've been passed from referral to referral since approx 2015. When I finally get something I lie and pretend I'm not so bad and I'm dismissed until I've attempted to end it again.

To most people I meet I look excellent. All of my family and colleagues, and acquaintances think I am doing very well. In reality I live from vice to vice. Depressing. Particularly so when I have no one to discuss with.  I pretend mental health isn't a thing.

Not really looking for feedback just an anonymous forum to vent. It's something I've never done before and believe it may help me come to terms with my own issues. 

Should you wish to reply: what is your consensus on ignoring mental health? For me I go through approx six month cycles of ignoring to have it bite me hard later down the line. I have come to believe it can't be ignored.  I wonder where to start."
294,I'm (M27) finding it harder to control my emotions and I don't know if there is something wrong with me,"It's getting harder to understand my feelings, my feelings towards things and the way I feel. For example, my wife, some days I'm happy to wake up beside her, I'll kiss her good morning, and wanna spend my life with her. Within a few hours, this love for her could turn to hate, a hate where I wish I never met her or wish she would just disappear and most of the time she hasn't done anything wrong to make me feel this way. The day could just be going normal and my feelings would 'click' and I would feel completely different and it's not just 2 different feelings I have, but like 7? It's hard to explain and I haven't spoken to anyone about how I feel. I know I should be able to can speak to my wife about it but she suffers from mental health herself and has her own problems so I don't want to dispose of mine on her. But even how I feel in myself, I haven't felt happy these past few weeks, there's been a few moments of laughter but the joy it brings quickly fades away. And I've been having small fits of rage, my wife could do something really small that would just annoy me slightly and I feel like I lose control, I grab the nearest thing and throw it. I didn't use to be like this.  Most of the time, I just feel empty, sort of like I have no meaning and I just want to feel numb so it doesn't bother me anymore. There's been a few times where I have had break downs, late last year was really bad for me, I was having roughly 3 a week or more and usually I would write how I feel on paper then rip it and bin it so no one finds it and that would make me feel a bit better and get my thoughts under control  but after a while, that stopped working and I would write and write but my mind felt like it had bad thoughts just spiralling around and they wouldn't leave and I just wanted to hurt. It's hard for me to talk about how I feel, I don't feel valuable so I don't want to waste anyone's time especially when they could be using that time to help someone who deserves it. I did try to get help once last year, I called the drs and told them I needed to speak to someone about my mental health but they told me there was no appointments available. It was so hard for me to take that step and when they said there was no appointments, I felt rejected and worthless and nearly broke down in the middle of the street, I had to run home. It's past 3am now and I'll have to wake up at 7am, so I know I should go to bed because I'll be tired in the morning but I don't want to sleep, and I've got work tomorrow but I won't call in sick because I think the way I feel isn't a valid excuse to call in sick. I'm not throwing up or anything. Part of me feels like I should just delete this. Sorry to anyone that spent the time to read it but also thank you for taking the time to read it. Appreciate any advice at the moment."
295,I feel like I don't have the right to feel the way I do,"I have a caring family who tries there best to do everything for me, two best friends, a great job, an amazing boyfriend, but I feel empty. There is no reason to feel this pain but its still here. So many people have legitimate reasons to be depressed and I feel like it's not fair to them for me to express my issues. I can't afford therapy, my family wouldn't believe me, and I feel stuck. Why do I feel this way?"
296,Fear and of being a bad person,"As of late with the recent movement, I have found my ocd compulsions getting worse. 
I have an Instagram account where I post about mental health and because of the community I'm in people are very passionate and most of my timeline is about the movement. I have nothing against that and I agree that there needs to be changed within the system. I'm not a very political person and I wouldn't consider myself an SJW. Just someone who talks about their truth and story. I don't feel that it's my role to tell other people what's right or wrong.

I've noticed a lot of posts shaming people who aren't speaking up and it makes me feel like shit. 
I'm seeing more hate than compassion. 
I've been ruminating about if I'm a ""bad"" or ""good"" person if I don't want to get involved. 
I find that any time you have a different opinion than what fits the narrative people attack you. 
I don't want to be an SJW or an Activist. 
Does that make me a bad person 😭 ?
I grew up being sexually, emotionally and physically abused. I don't have the emotional capacity to be apart of these movements and frankly, I don't want to. That doesn't mean I don't care about people's suffering. I'm working on healing my generational trauma so that my kids can have a safe and healthy upbringing. Is that not enough? Why is it that social media is always telling us that we are never enough. 
Why is it that many people feel it's their right to tell others if they are right or wrong. 
I care so deeply about people and it scares me to think that I can't create a safe space for everyone. 
All I want in life is to focus on my healing, create a conscious family, have a farm, volunteer in my community and travel.  Am I not allowed to do that because it doesn't involve sacrificing my desires for the betterment of those suffering. 
What if I don't want to be apart of the movement at all? ( I have nothing against people who want to be apart of it and I think it's important that there are people who want to be apart of it, we need those people! ) I think what would create more change is if I focus on healing my own trauma and not passing that to my children. If I focus on my own community ( I live in Canada ). That is where my fear comes from because that view could be seen as me saying "" I don't care about anyone but myself "" . Which is absolutely not true. I wouldn't be worried about being ""bad"" if I didn't care about others.

I'm so afraid of being a ""bad"" person and I don't know how to deal with my fears. Is it selfish to care about my life 😢 ? I don't see myself as oppressed and I'm grateful for my life. I see so many beautiful things in the world. Opportunities for change and growth. Am I a bad person for saying that I'm not oppressed? Am I bad for saying I love my life? 
Am I bad for saying that there are lots of opportunities and good in the world?  Am I bad for not expecting white people to do anything for me? Am I bad for thinking that it isn't just a colour problem but something much more nuanced and complicated? 
I don't understand what's right or wrong!! 
All of this just makes me want to hide. 


Also, I ( 21 ) am a mixed-race black woman ( German and African ) 
I felt that it might be important to add. Since it adds to the fears in me as I feel I'm being attacked by both sides."

298,For anyone feeling lonely tonight,"If you managed to do any of the following, give yourself a pat on the back and be happy that you are growing :)

•*Tackled your negative thoughts or even distracted yourself from them.*
 It could just be a stupid little anxious thought or something more serious that you deserve help for.

•*Didn’t leave your room and ate junk while blasting sad music.*
 It’s completely okay. Think of time as a social construct. We have the power to bend rules about how and when to do things right now. It’s okay to have a messed up sleep cycle right now. Don’t give in to the idea of capitalism that has been instilled in us since childhood, don’t let someone else’s idea of productivity, define yours. You can sleep all day if you want to. 

•*Managed to reach out to a friend and take care of each others health.*
By now we all have started realising the fragility of human life and mind. As much as we want someone else to be there for us, we must also be in support for others who are fighting their own battles we know nothing about.

•*Reached out to someone you trust in times of crisis.*
Recognising that you are feeling overwhelmed and feeling okay to ask for help from a trusted friend, family member, therapist, etc.

•*Did something that you find relaxing or cathartic and felt happy.*
Even if you had a day full of happy and positive thoughts, don’t forget to do something that genuinely makes you happy to be alive and helps you manage your stress. It could be anything from watering the plants to singing your heart out to talking to a friend after a long time."
299,I'm not in my right mind? I'm not all the way there?,.
300,My mom is threatening to ruin my life because she doesn’t like how I’m acting.,"So I’m 23 f and I’m living at home to save up for school while I work (yes, I have plans to move out. Please don’t attack me for this). But I’ve been depressed for months and put on Prozac. It’s helped me tremendously and made me wanna hang out with friends and do more with my life. My mom sees that as me being a “slacker” and “only partying” and now she’s threatening to show up at my job and ruin my life, show up at my clubs I’m apart of, and go to my doctor to change my meds. She says she ashamed of who I’m becoming all because I started fighting back against her narcissist ways. I finally opened my eyes to how she treats my brother and I sometimes and it’s to the point she wants to ruin my life to think it’s funny and make a point. I’m a 3.8 gpa college student, I’m applying for grad school, I have a full time job. But I’m still a “disgrace” to her. It’s hard to handle."
301,Serious question,"if someone is not attracted to actual humans but instead fictional anthropomorphic animals, are they mentally ill"
302,Can Body Dysmorphic Disorder focus on more than one flaw?,"I've had body issues for a very long time and a few months ago was finally diagnosed with Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (along with MDD and GAD—woo!). I never fully realized until recently that BDD is technically separate from eating disorders (although they often occur together). I've done some research and watched videos, and I always relate so strongly to interviewees with BDD or to the symptom lists, except for one thing:

A lot of sources seem to define BDD as focusing on one perceived flaw—does this have to be one flaw, like disliking your nose? Can it be just thinking in general that you are overweight when you're not? Or, could you perceive multiple flaws and you kind of cycle through them? For example, one day or week you are especially disgusted with your thighs, and then next week it's your stomach, then next week it's your stomach and your nose, etc.

I would love to hear some opinions on this from experts or people with BDD. I really think that I have it but I struggle with so much shame around my body image issues and eating disorder that I even have a hard time discussing it with my therapist. I also tend to think that my negative thought patterns are realistic, that I really do look this way even though everyone says I don't, and therefore I convince myself that I am actually just disgusting and I don't have a mental illness."
303,My story I guess.,"So today I broke down again this time at work. Talking and getting others through the pain is the only thing im good at. This is for the random people I reply and talk to. 

As of june 15th2020, I am 30k in student loan debt, 5k in medical bills, I have keratoconus and cant afford new glasses or the special contacts. Im behind on my rent and have been for months so probably going to be homeless this month. Im 4k miles away from my family as ive moved to Alaska to be with a girl who never loved me. Im chalked full of mental disorders. And I turn 21 in July. Ive failed many times to kill myself over the years.

Its getting harder and harder to not drive over a railing and into the water, its hard not to just disappear. Im at a point to where I dont see a reason to go on. Ive traveled the world (most of Europe). Ive worked in alot of trades and have a weird memory where I can recall locations and directions from shit 10 years ago that ive only been once. I was recognized by the corps of cadets of Norwich University (17-1-2 Misfit). But still I worry if I have enough gas left in my car till payday.

Im trying. Ive been pushed to my limit in every way. But fuck I will try. I will try. There is no cant. Fuck I Will Try."

difficulty keeping quiet, and speaking out of turn"
305,Is my 4 year old having anxiety?,"Lately my 4 year old has been saying “ I can feel my heart beat, it’s going fast” or something along those lines. I tell him it’s ok it’s because he was running. But a couple times this past week he’s been telling me “I can’t feel my heart beat” I tell him this is also fine he’s ok, but then he’ll say “I want to feel it to make sure I’m alive”. I’m just concerned he’s developing anxiety. It runs in my family and I suffer from panic disorder. I try not to show my anxiety around him, so I’m hoping it’s not a learned behavior."
306,Going back to work soon. Should I tell my boss about my new meds?,"Hey guys! First time posting and I'm on mobile. I'm possibly returning to work next month and I've been looking for a psychiatrist for over a year. I finally had my first appt a week ago and they didn't give me a diagnosis but they did put me on Abilify (lowest dosage possible because nausea ugh). Anyway, since deciding to seek help I had been planning on letting my boss know like ""hey I'm about to be on different meds might have to try a few before figuring it out I wanted to let you guys know in case it interfered with work or I needed time off to adjust. I promise to be honest and give you guys forewarning when possible so that I hopefully don't inconvenience anybody."" I've been working at this place- which is definitely a high stress environment- for 5 years and I think I feel comfortable being open with my coworkers everyone already knows I have anxiety as well.

This was what I was thinking prior to being given an antipsychotic. I thought for sure I would be given a mood stabilizer, lithium, or antidepressant, but now since I know nothing about antipsychotics and I wasn't prepared for that, I'm questioning whether or not I should tell my bosses. Like technically its none of their business but at the same time I've taken more mental health days than physical sick days in my life so I thought it might be easier in the long run to be straightforward. On the other hand I think my oversharing tendencies just want to tell everyone in my life that I haven't seen in forever that I'm on new meds. I'll definitely bring this up in my next appt but its not scheduled until around the time I'll be returning to work so thanks in advance for any advice! Idk I was confident before but now I feel crazy for wanting to bring it up."

308,Am I depressed??,"REALLY long post. Tl;Dr:

I think I may be depressed. I have a hard time caring, not sleeping, paying attention, wanting a relationship, etc. I live my life to the absolute minimum to avoid doing anything but being in my own head thinking about nothing all day. I have passions but I've lost the passion part for the most part. The only times I really feel like I'm alive are when I'm driving recklessly, mainly on my motorcycle. Always thought I was just lazy. Am I depressed?

_________________

I never thought I was depressed until today reading aita and a post mentioned some very familiar habits and feelings. Here goes. 

I (22M) have a hard time caring about most things. I'm also very very lazy. Like a constant fight to not just go sit down somewhere or sleep. Because of this I usually do the absolute minimum in my personal life and my professional life to get by. I've never been a super clean person but since 16 I don't think I've ever had a clean room for more than a week. I just put everything off until it's so bad I can't stand it then I'll clean everything at once, keep it that way for a day or so, decide it's too much work to bring my bowl / wrapper / paper to the kitchen or trash and the cycle continues. Most weekends instead of going out with friends or working on my car I end up sleeping as much as possible. I seem to be incapable of taking a 30 minute or 1 hour nap, so if I doze off for a little bit I'll wake up 4 to 10 hours later wondering wtf happened. Alarms don't help. 

Also I often feel disassociated from life. Not from myself but from my surroundings and find it most comfortable to spend most of my time thinking of absolutely nothing. It's just easier that way. Not because I'm sad or have some traumatic event that is causing me pain, but again, I'm lazy to the core. 

I haven't had the desire to pursue a relationship in a while. Well, I have the desire but every time I think about doing it I just put it off. I've used a few online dating sites / apps out of curiosity and ended up just falling off after a few weeks. 

I feel like I have no motivation for most things, I honestly think I'm mentally disabled most days, and I swear I might have some slow acting neurodegenerative disease. Idk, my family has always been pretty harsh on mess ups and I do that A LOT. So half of the disabled thing might just be from being called retarded / stupid / idiot all my life. But I do mess up a lot and it's half from being in my own head all the time thinking instead of paying attention, but I've done it for so long now it's natural and easier to do than force myself to pay attention. As for the neurodegenerative thing: I swear I used to not stutter as much and was smarter than now. I can't really prove it but it feels like through the years I've just gotten dumber and dumber. Sometimes I fear by 30 I'll be in a bed hooked up to life support because I've lost the ability to do anything.

I always thought depression was extreme sadness and I am not really sad for the most part. Most days I'm pretty neutral, I'll have happy moments and sad moments but overall it's just... Neutral. I just thought I am a lazy pos with no motivation and a stupid streak but... after seeing a post on reddit describing a lot of what I've put here the op was diagnosed with chronic depression. I have no clue if I have depression or not and I don't know if I would even get off my ass to do anything about it, but maybe it would be nice to know. Maybe it would motivate me to do something about it and I can feel like I used to when I was a kid. 

Holy shit I sound like a loser haha. I have some passions including riding motorcycles, cars, art, computer science,  CAD and machining, and aviation. Because of this I have both a car and a motorcycle, a job in CS, and design things with CAD as a hobby (trying to get a 3D printer soon). I usually love working on my vehicles as my dad owns a shop and I've grown up doing it, at least until that first rusted bolt turns a 30 minute job into a 2 hour job. Lately (as in the last 5 years) I just feel kind of ""meh"" about it all. The only times I really feel good and 100% there are when I'm driving fast or riding my motorcycle (usually combined with doing stupid shit). I want to get my pilot's license at some point but a mixture of not enough time and not having the motivation to go and start the first steps has kept me from doing it. As well as money. I don't have $10k just laying around. 

Anyways thanks in advance, I don't know if this is the right sub I just searched mental health and this popped up. If this is against any rules here I can change the post or delete it.

309,I can’t stop thinking about my girlfriend !,"I’m having a long distance relationship and I keep thinking about my girlfriend what she’s doing where is she why’s she’s not txting or calling me i can’t stop that. I’m tired if she didn’t call me i fell she doesn’t love me anymore. Idk what to do. Many problems that is bringing and i feel we’ll break up eventually bcuz of it but i cannot still do much about it!
What to do?!"
310,I’m not sure why I shut down in social situations.,"I (21M) usually shut down in social situations, especially when there are large amounts of people. Like for example, I’ll just get to a point where I’d rather be by myself, and I get very irritable. Then when someone “forces” me (literally and figuratively) to be around these people and socialize, I get very angry and even more recluse. 

Usually it follows being jealous of someone I perceive as more successful/attractive than me entering into the conversation. Or those aspects being brought up. Or if I’m not able to contribute, or are excluded from conversations.

While those certainly make me feel bad, I don’t think that a total shut down and undirected anger/irritability is a proportionate response. Anyone have any ideas?"
311,Seeking Mental Health Resources in KS,"I am reaching because I am at my wits end. I am a married mother of four and I cannot afford health insurance, which means I cannot get two of my children the mental health counseling that they need. My husband and I have good jobs, but make too much money to qualify for reduced programs or anything that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. I want to get my kids the help they need. Does anyone know of any options for people looking for help, but make too much money to qualify for state programs? Thank you."
312,What happens if you call 911 on yourself for having an anxiety attack or panic attack,Sometimes I feel like I’m having a heart attack it’s so bad I thought I needed to go to the hospital but I was afraid they would say it was a mental health issue and they would take me to the Mental Health Crisis center and have me committed 51 50 and over drug me. Is that what happened
313,I think I’m delusional,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was around 7/8, I was bullied by my best friend from 7-10/11, I became suicidal at 10. I’m going to be fully honest here, I’m 13, I turned 13 on March 22, and spent my birthday in quarantine since my mum is at risk. I’ve been suicidal for 3 years now and it’s just really, really, really weird to think about, my suidical thoughts haven’t reared there head in a long time, it’s just an aching nag in the back of my head, just a constant feeling of wanting it to be over. Apologies if my grammar is terrible in this, I’m on my phone and it’s 4am.

I can’t exactly pinpoint when, I think it was some time in May, maybe, all my memories and feelings I’ve felt in quarantine mush together in my head and I can’t really tell when anything happened. I have a mild obsession with Miraculous Ladybug, and I’ve been spending a lot of time reading fanfiction because I don’t really have anything better to do, and I noticed that I began to feel like I was one of the characters, I can never tell which, I just feel like I’m there, and I’m experiencing everything, a couple days ago I read one where one of the characters was pregnant and I had to spend the entire time reading it lying on my stomach to convince myself I wasn’t pregnant, despite the fact I haven’t even started my period yet. 

All my life, as long as I can remember, I swear I even felt like this as a toddler, I’ve wanted to go home, I feel like it in my bedroom, I feel like it in the kitchen, I feel like it at my friends house, at school, anywhere, I’ve never moved in my life and I have no idea where home is. It’s just like, when you first get hungry and there’s just a “oh I’m kinda hungry” dormant thought, you’re not actively thinking it, it’s just kinda there, that’s how my “I want to go home” feeling is.

Whenever I’m sad or watching a show or just existing there’s now a just a feeling that if I think or will or wish hard enough I’ll just be in miraculous or sword art online (show I’m watching rn) and it won’t go away, and when I’m in a depressive state it’ll just be screaming at me to think and then I’ll be in there, and I’ll be in the show, this won’t be reality anymore. I’ve had to remind myself I’m not the characters and that this is real, but it’s increasingly feeling that real life isn’t reality, that the shows are the ones that are real, and I’m the cartoon character watching them. This doesn’t feel real anymore, I don’t feel real. And I’m so so scared. I dyed my hair yesterday and I can’t shake the feeling that I didn’t actually dye it and it’s just stop being dyed in like an hour or something. 

I’m scared to sleep, I’m scared to be awake; I’m scared to be alone, I’m scared to be around others;
I’m scared to talk, I’m scared to be quiet;
I’m just scared to exist and everything is confusing and my head is trying to convince me of stuff I know isn’t true, I’m scared that I’m just gonna completely loose grip on reality and I’m so experienced at covering everything no one will even notice that anything’s wrong, I don’t know what to do, and I’m just scared"
314,I dont know what to do,"Heres how everything kinda started

At first Ive been having issues sleeping i think because im scared of not waking up and im scared of the unknown . This still kinda continues

In april i started having panic attacks and anxiety attacks. The panic attacks finally stopped happening late april but anxiety attacks continued. I dont know why any of this is happening to me. 

Okay so now im June, I'm not really having anxiety attacks thank God, but now i'm just depressed. I've tried everything to help make me happy. I feel empty and alone even tho I know im not. I worry a lot and i fear a lot. I feel so unhappy and everytime i feel happy, its so short and temporary. 

The reason im so confused is because i dont really have anything to be sad about. I have God, my boyfriend, my family, a business thats going well, and other things. I feel so ungrateful for even being sad. people have it worse than me and i dont know why im so sad. I feel hopeless. I dont have any motivation to get up. I keep questioning life. I keep thinking whats the point of doing all this if were all gonna die. I want to be happy . I want to enjoy life. I want to get out of this emotional state im in but i dont know what to do"
315,I think I went insane..and then I came back,"I've never posted on reddit so forgive me for any mistakes. And I've never been to a therapist or psychiatrist, not through lack of trying, I just don't have the money for it. But at this point I need to get this out of my head.

A few weeks ago I experienced what it was like to be teetering on the very near edge of catatonia.
 It was an extreme break in reality. 
Where I couldn't tell if I was sat on the solid floor or hovering above it. I didn't feel anything and my voice was only ever monotone, when I could reply.

I've only just started to research what dissociation is, and I think these symptoms are in line with that? 
I'm so worried that I won't come back from that state of being and I'm not entirely sure what it was to begin with. I have some ideas of why it happend.

I think it stems from feeling like I'm in a repetitive simulation. Not to get too into it but my parents were never shining examples of role models. It's been years of domestic abuse, they fought and broke up then got back together over and over and over. 
Everytime I risked hoping that this would be the one time they would be devorced for good, everything would be forgotten and loving again....and least until next week.
He was an scheming alcoholic and she couldn't stand being alone. So my hope something stable was shattered over and over again.

...And I think my mind couldn't handle it anymore, so it check out. I guess it was the only thing I could do to protect myself. To anybody working in mental health, do you think I'm in danger? Am I going completely off my rocker?

And are there any free mental health tools available?"
316,First panic attack ever?,"Not actually sure if what I had was a panic attack, i'm here to ask about it actually.  


Going to make this short and just say that after a tough conversation, I started crying, which is normal for me, but suddenly my heart started feeling like it was racing, and I started *audibly* crying (this is NOT normal for me, i'm a silent crier). It was like I physically couldn't control the sounds coming out of my mouth anymore, and I had to actually cover my mouth with the blanket because I was making so much noise. And between these weird cries I was breathing pretty fast. It was my first time ever experiencing something like that, so i'm not sure what it was. Was it just a weird crying fit? Should I take this seriously? And does this mean my depression is getting worse rather than better? Since i've never had a panic attack before now?"
317,2020 has been hard on my mental health.,"I'm sure I'm not alone on this but with everything going on across America right now I've been feeling more anxious lately than ever. I've become short tempered, spastic, and increasingly depressed. I'm trying to hold on the best I can but it's getting harder. It's becoming much more difficult to keep myself occupied and distracted. What kinds of things are people doing to hold onto sanity?"
318,I need to vent.,"I've got a lot on my mind and I just need to vent it all out. That's all that this post is, a vent. 


So I was a year clean from self harm until just recently. I am fighting the urges so much but lately it doesn't seem like I'm even living, I feel like I'm just existing which is making it hard to fight the urges. I was really proud for making it to a year clean, I was the longest I had stayed clean in the past 6 or 7 years. I hate myself for doing it, I just felt so hopeless and alone, in the moment it felt like the best thing I could do but now I realise it was actually the worst.


I don't have anyone to talk to about it either, the professionals are all turning me away and saying that they can't help me. If the professionals can't help me then who can?

I've been feeling like this for years now and I can't even turn to my family about it. None of them would understand and I have such a dysfunctional family that would probably make it worse. 

Everything is so difficult now. I can gradually feel myself getting further and further towards rock bottom and I can't seem to lift myself up. 

I guess that's all I have to say. Thank you."
319,Feeling more emotional about fiction than reality,When my grandfather died I just didn't feel anything. Nothing. I knew it was bad and all but it just didn't affect me. Same thing goes when one of my friends committed suicide. However I feel very strong about fictional characters dying and having breakups but almost only in animation. I have the feeling that I can't connect to real humans. I know this sounds weird but maybe someone can tell me more about that.
320,Insomnia due to Cymbalta,"Anybody else experienced same on SS(N)RIs? I slept only 0-3 hours last nights because I just can‘t sleep and I don‘t even want to sleep. It‘s like my head and body tell me I don‘t need sleep and I could still be awake doing things instead.

I would be very interested in reading your experiences! 

And I also would be interested in knowing the effects that insomnia could have. I mean I only slept one hour this night because I passed out listening to music on my couch but I feel awake and don’t get tired or feel down. Then I went to bed and just didn‘t sleep until I woke up now (its 5am here in Germany). 

I think it might be because of the noradrenergic part of the SNRI (serotonine noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor). What‘s your opinion on this?"
321,Suicide is like pizza,"I booked a counselling appointment and I was wondering how I should accurately portray my suicidal ideation to the counsellor in a way that they can understand. I came up with this:

Suicide is like pizza.

Lately I've been craving pizza. When I get hungry I think to myself 'damn, pizza sure would hit the spot'. But I'm not really going to order pizza because I have no money. And anyway, I can use something at home to make my dinner. At least, until I run out of ingredients. But for now, my kitchen is well stocked and I think I can get by without pizza. But pizza still sounds really nice right about now."
322,I guess I am still here... *TW self-harm*,"Had a psych appointment today (telemedicine) and he took me off Zoloft and put me on another medicine (I forget which one) and Seroquil for my insomnia.  


Whee. I am so close to self-harming, which I haven't done for months now. I was watching Prison documentaries on YouTube and reflecting on my recent past. I just want this pain to end already ffs.  


That's all. I am done posting. It is pointless anyhow."
323,(Venting) I am so angry at religious people who try to convert us through our suffering.,"I said it, finally.
I am done with religious people having no repercussions for ignoring medical advice and common sense on illnesses, specially Mental Illness.
I hate how they see my epusodes as an opportunity to preach about their god, and how an exorcism will take away ""the bad spirit"" to create themselves this ego and image of a saviour. With their whinning asses trying to enter into a heaven.

Im done.
I ve been 11 years without diagnosis,without treatment, without medicine. I ve had over 3 months now of non stop episodes of delusions, persecution believes, anxiety, unable to enjoy my marriage, i stoped doing my oassion for over a year. Wanting to be dead but at the same time fucking afraid of death.

And these people, unable of any empathy, unabld to take a book, unable to do some human expressions and communication,only want me as a member of a church. Only want me as a propaganda of a ""miracle"".

They dont see a human being on me.

They see a tool, theyre so insecure they want to prove their faith with dicerse experiments of religion and see what stick on us. So they can hold. 
What a lack of dignity.

324,I don’t really care,"I’m 17m and I am fairly certain that I am not mentally where I should be. Here’s some background information: my familys middle class, divorced parents, I go to an expensive private high school which we can’t really afford anymore and went to a private middle school, I have several step/half siblings, I am very shy and don’t have a lot of friends and never really have or been very well liked, (probably because I assume people I talk to or meet, even my good friends, don’t like me or want to talk to me). That’s me in a nutshell. My life really isn’t that bad. It could be very worse. So I feel bad about this, but I just don’t really care. I don’t genuinely care what happens to me or where I end up. I know people have it worse and work harder than me, but I just don’t have the drive to try. I don’t have the energy to do simple things my parents ask me to do. I would go to sleep forever if I could, I really love sleeping. I increasingly am coming to believe that there is no point to life (not to a point where I would harm myself) but even though my families catholic and they think I am too I just don’t see a point. I don’t really know if i believe in god anymore. I am frustrated by myself because I act very differently all the time, like my personality changes. I want to talk to someone about this, but I don’t want to be one of those people who says they have a mental health issue when it’s really just a problem with who they are. I don’t want to make light of other people’s issues by assuming that i must also have a mental issue when it’s really just my fault. Does anyone else have this problem of not knowing what to do about it? If so how do I know what to do?"
325,What to do if you believe you have been diagnosed with mental health disorder you don't have.,"Hello I'm wondering What to do if you believe you have been diagnosed with mental health disorder you don't have.  I have ADHD and ODD. I told a friend about my mental health problems and she says I don't show any of them symptoms associated with ADHD and odd (i'm not on Meds) and I agree. I've never been on meds my parents said I didn't need them. My parents often lie and are rather manipulative to me. so I'm wondering if I even have adhd/odd. How do I check?? How would this effect my chances of enlistment?   


Thanks for any help you can provide Ill respond to any questions."
326,Don’t say this.,My biggest pet peeve and the worst thing you can say to a depressed person is “Just think of something that makes you happy” ... if getting through depression was that easy I wouldn’t be depressed. If it was that easy no one would suffer from depression.
327,Be a Family,"I have been dealing with mental health issues for a while now and everytime I see someone dealing with similar issues or dying because of it (suicide) it just breaks my heart and affects me. Doesn’t matter if it’s a friend/enemy/a role model etc. At that very time these people are just human beings to me who just need help and I just wish at times that I could be there for each one of them. Because honestly, over time I have realised, that helping people out sort of gives me a high. 

I therefore wanted to share a video with you guys - This video is absolutely not mine but of a YouTube creator in India who did a livestream on “Why do we get DEPRESSED?” It deals with the entire science behind it and towards the end they also speak about the tools and methods that may actually help people to come out of it. It’s not like people in this sub wouldn’t already know the tools and techniques but I felt really sort of empowered after getting to know the science behind it and if it helps anyone out here then my purpose is served.

328,Feeling disconnected from myself,"I don't know if this is due to the whole coronavirus situation and the fact that almost all my days are the same, but I've been feeling really disconnected from myself. I feel like my personality is always changing if that makes any sense and I've lost the sense of who I truly am. In addition to that, I've been feeling numb as well. What can I do to start feeling emotions normally again and connect to myself?"
329,I’m bullied by my own family,"My dad hasn’t really been nice too me for most of my life, he wanted me to be athletic and into sports but I’m just not. I am a gamer and he used the to sit me down and tell me that he’d sell my Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and phone if he wasn’t “So nice”. Whenever he gets home from work he’s always inexplicably angry and treats everyone in the house like shit, mostly my mother. He’ll vent about all of his problems, but whenever someone else has a bump in the road he acts like it doesn’t Matter because he’s been through worse. And then he and my sister use me as an emotional punching bag, they’ll make fun of my hair or the way I talk (I have a weird accent for some reason). It may have started out as a joke but it has gotten to the point we’re I don’t want to leave my room. Once my sister said “I hope you get bullied next year, so that you won’t be so weird anymore”. Which really messed me up because I don’t get bullied, but I do have very few friends at school and am around pretty toxic people as it is. I don’t have any safe place to retreat to anymore. I used to have the perfect friend group that I could rely on, but the middle school we were going to go to was not the best, so my parents moved us to a different house in the neighboring town and told me it was out of their control. Those friends near completely cut me off after that and none of them showed up to my birthday 2 months ago, which left me devastated. My dad is a lair, and sometimes I even hear him lying about stuff that doesn’t make sense to lie about, which really pisses me off because he’s a children’s pastor who teaches the importance of honesty every Sunday. He also bought a 5,000 dollar motorcycle, used my sister’s money to buy himself a new car and leave her the old one and used my cellphone upgrade to get himself the latest iPhone. For a while the only thing preventing me from committing suicide was the fear of him using my death as a conversation piece, because he is incredibly narcissistic and takes advantage of people without any regret."
330,"I dont know if im being abused or not, but my mental health has gone down the toilet","I just have to get this off my chest because i just cant take it anymore.

So my mom kinda went to shit about 7 years ago because we moved to a place she hates. She stopped taking care of me, stopped helping my dad with stuff, and just devolved into a shitty person. Then my parents got divorced 3 years ago.

But my mom treats me like absolute shit. She talks down to me, and to sum it up, basically tells me im not good enough, not pretty enough (compared to her), and that nobody will love me.

She told me that her boyfriend is more important than i am, and when i tell her how i feel, she either doesnt listen, tells me im making it all up, or she’ll ‘apologize’ (but then tell my grandma over the phone that she didnt mean it)

She just treats me like shit, so i try to leave her, but everytime i do, she tries to make me feel guilty/pressure me into seeing her/tell me god is gonna punish me for not seeing her. Shes told me my entire life when i dont want to hug her that she’d “find another kid to love and leave me”.

Honestly i think she is the reason why physical affection freaks me out, because she was always on top of me and when id ask her to stop, eventually crying and screaming for her to stop touching me, she wouldnt and shed say i was being ridiculous. 

I just dont know what to do. Every time i try to cut her out of my life i end up going back because of pressure from her, my dad, counselors, or her boyfriend. And i regret it everytime and end up going to the hospital or something for anxiety. I dont know if this is abuse or not but i just cant take it anymore. Honestly i resent her for creating me just to make me suffer"
331,PTSD: Recovery,"I was diagnosed with PTSD two years ago due to the actions of my abusive father. 

As a little back story him and my mom were in an on and off again relationship all my life. When I was 19 my mom started to see the damage my father was having on me and told him he wasn't allowed back in our home. He left for about a month but then showed back at our house after I stopped answering his calls and emails. He yelled at my mom and me and threatened us so badly that after he left we packed some bags put our cats in the car and left the house out of fear for our safety. 

Thankfully my mom's co-worker (I'll call him A for this story) welcomed us into his home. We stayed there for six months and this is when I started to develop my PTSD. 
 
Now it's been about a year since I've been to A's house but since him and my mom our now dating I tried to put the horrible memories aside and face my fears head on...

And it went well for the most part. I spent my day painting and renovating the laundry room and we had a wonderful lunch. I wasn't strong enough to enter the room that I was staying in or be in the bathroom for too long since I had panic attacks pretty much on the daily in those places. 

But I was able to spend 8 hours there!!

I ended up having a flashback and my mom had to drive me back home. But considering I never thought I would be able to go back there again I was very happy with how the day went. 

It's been a very long and hard life, but this day showed me that I'm strong and I'm able to get better. 

So if any one reading this is going through something similar, know that it gets better with time. I believe in you~"
332,Dealing With Chronic Illness,"How do you guys deal with a chronic illness emotionally. I’m only 16 and I’ve had CKD since 3 yrs old, and now it’s gotten so bad (dialysis)I don’t know how to emotionally deal with it. I’ve lost my body confidence, my goals, and it’s physically draining me. Why me out of everyone I know?Please help, I just want to go to college and don’t know how to deal with this anymore"

334,I don't know what to do,"I'm just so sick of not being able to express myself and like having to hide. Like I still live with my family and I don't want to be here, I hate it. It's bad for me, it really is hurting my mental state. I have next to zero privacy and having to share a room with a edgy fucking 15 year old drives me insane. He doesn't listen to me at all hell, he doesn't listen to my parents. To put it simply he is a cunt and having to live with him is hell. I am 19 and being a broke student I have zero way to leave home. My parents are not any better. They get really pissed off when I mention it saying I don't have the money for it or whatever. I do currently have a almost full time job (I don't work Fridays). There is tons of other crap to like how I'm gay and my family is no to nice to those people. I've been like this for what seems like forever. I honestly remember for the longest time wanted to move out. I seriously can't handle this stress, I've done bad stuff to myself in the past and I really don't wanna go back to that. I just don't know what to do anymore I just wanna leave"
335,I don't know what i want form life anymore,"All this time i've been working towards a goal, but now that im so close to either failing or not, i dont even know if its worth to achieve, but if i dont achieve it i dont know what to do with my life anymore"
336,I'm not sure what to do.,"My best friend's younger sister cut herself tonight and it clearly impacted him and his family. We were on a discord call when he suddenly left and I heard his mom cry out. I asked him about his mom when he returned and he said his sister cut herself, and his mom was crying. I heard him choking back some tears on the call as well.

I don't know how or if I should respond to this. He and his family are both dear to me, and I want to be able to help. My friend asked me to keep quiet about it, and of course I won't tell a soul, but I want to be able to comfort him and help them. He says he is fine, but my brother also suffered from depression, and before he got help I felt very guilty and uncomfortable and sad. I fear that my friend feels the same way.

I don't want to intrude on his family's matters, but I want to offer support. What should I do?"
337,I feel like im losing myself each day,"After journaling down constantly what negative thoughts i had but nothings change since then but only lost more of my emotional attachment to where i cant really understand my emotional state after talking again with my therapist and after 5 hours of trying to figure a way i could get better they're entire advice was 
Try to live a better life from the one im currently in and have my friends support me 
But with my psychiatrist he had questioned wether my past has made me a sociopath or if in just in a constant feel of numbness
I don't consider friends or family really close anymore and its getting harder to feel any emotions 
The more time goes by the more i i lose myself 
I don't know wether therapy is needed anymore and its starting to feel as though i don't recognize myself anymore 
I look in the mirror but i don't see a person anymore just a shell of what was once me 
I feel empty but the emptiness is calming yet alarming but im not scared of it just. Aware of it"
338,You too?,"I don’t know why I’m writing this. I guess I’ve just kind of been in a bad place lately and I feel like me sharing my story and hearing other people that have gone through the same experiences would make me not feel so alone. 

I don’t want this to be some long post but it really is going to be so if you read all of it, thank you. 

I guess I’ll start from the beginning of my life (and try to make it short). Both of my parents were drug addicted teens when they had me, they weren’t together very long and I bounced back and forth for a bit and even lived in a homeless shelter with my mother at one point. My mother and father both have BPD and my mother has a personality disorder as well. They fought for year over me in court and tried using me against one another. I know I suffered a good amount of abuse but I can really only remember most from when I was 10+. I kind of just blocked out the rest but it comes back to me in flashes once in a while. My first DCYF visit was when I was in first grade. My mother has slapped me so hard across the face when I was on staircase I almost fell backwards and my grandmother grabbed me by the arm and caught me (she was mad about some surprise my father had for me and was mad at me for “lying” even though i clearly had no idea what was going on). The second visit was a couple of years later when my mom started dating some really shady guy. I think I was in fourth grade, I had a younger sibling who was two at the time and her boyfriend had two the same age. He started off selling drugs then even bringing me with him to sell them. After a while random people would come to the house to get high and stay the night. One girl even pissed herself in her sleep once. Then my mom and her boyfriend would start sleeping all day. It started as one, then two, then four, then almost the entire week. The other kids were young and I would stay home almost every day to take care of and feed them, change their diapers and sometimes even bathe them. I almost had truancy in fourth grade. One day after my mom and her boyfriend got into a bad fight (she jumped on his back and tried holding a lighter to his face, he choked her up against the wall, a lot of breaking things, screaming) my mom got arrested. My dad ended up finding out and eventually dcyf came to get me within a month after my moms boyfriend came back. I was placed with my dad, who I barely knew (I saw him once a week, but sometimes not for months) and his wife. Things there were terrible. I stayed with them for nine years and it’s the worst my mental health has ever been. My dad got sent to rehab twice and his wife took it out on me, and the fact that she got stuck with me when she pretty much thought her and my father would have their own lives. They also hated one another. She ended up having her own child and my dad ended up adopting my other sibling (my child from my mother and one of her ex boyfriends after my dad) because she had completely gone off the deep end. She was using heroin and living in a car, stripping, constantly getting arrested, missing her court appointments, things like that. My sibling got placed into foster care with my mothers’ boyfriends’ mother (boyfriends mom if that makes sense?). I don’t know what she went through while I wasn’t there, but she was very underweight and traumatized when she came to live with us. That was at the beginning of high school for me. I suffered from an eating disorder and other mental issues throughout highschool and I was in a toxic relationship with a boyfriend for about two and a half years (I was just as much as fault as he was. It stings to admit it but it’s true) that also took a big toll on my mental health. I was also taking antidepressants that were making me worse and j was lying to my therapist about almost everything. I was self harming and doing a decent amount of self medicating at the time. I kind of just wanted to give a quick little backstory to try and fit all the pieces together. 

Within the last two years, my mental health and life has reached an all time low. August 2018 my dad and his wife decided to get a divorce, shortly after my boyfriend and I broke up. On thanksgiving I tried killing myself, I won’t go into detail but last minute I just stopped. In December after my dads ex wife had gotten rid of him, she decided to kick me out as well, this was also after my father had hit me and they both stole a very large amount of money from me. I had nowhere to go and after not speaking to my mom for almost nine years, I called her, she picked up, and I went to go live with her and her boyfriend (who is the same boyfriend as before). They were both clean, and they had been going to the method one clinic for three years. When I asked my mom why she wouldn’t wean off she said it’s because she thought she’d start using again. Everything seemed fine at first but I quickly noticed that her husband (they were technically married by law due to how long they were together now) was an alcoholic and a terrible person and she constantly played victim. I didn’t really care at the time, I was depressed about everything and I was just constantly smoking. I met this kid from my college and began hanging out with him, after a nasty little chat with my ex I guess I decided to pity fuck him and he was stuck to me from thy point out. We would skip school to go to drugs and hangout constantly. To be honest with you I don’t remember about four months of my life because of that (maybe remember isn’t the right word but it’s super cloudy and I can almost never recall anything except towards the end of us seeing eachother). Point being he was abusive. He was very manipulative and would sometimes hit me and I just... put up with it. I never liked him much but i was sad enough over my ex to keep him around. It hurts me to say this, but I ended things with him when he raped me. I don’t want to go into that either but in November 19 (sorry I’m bad at mentioning these time frames this is going to be from December 18 to-November 19 now. I don’t want to put too much detail in case anyone recognizes this) I did have to go to court after he was stalking me. A couple months down the line around Christmas, my mothers husbands drinking started getting very bad. He would start screaming at my mother and whenever I defended her and fought with him he would “kick” me out. He would always forget by morning because he would be hammered. My mom would have me leave the house until he fell asleep so I could come back. After a couple of weeks of him doing this, he got particularly drunk one night and I heard him threaten to kick my puppy, who was five months old and about six pounds at the time. I got into an argument with him and he kicked me out so this time I really left. I took my puppy, my cat, a bag if my things and I left. I was technically homeless for about two weeks but I was able to crash at a friends. I got to see the true side of my mother, who chose a man over me because she needed a place to live (she doesn’t work, and honestly steals his money). Needless to say, after the things she’s said to me I do believe that she is truly a heartless person, and uses people to get what she needs out of life whether it be a child support paycheck or a bed to sleep in. I was able to (by some miracle) get a promotion at work and find an apartment within those two weeks. I had to drop out of this semester of college to work full time at my job. I was able to get a roommate and over quarantine I found an even better job. And to be honest luck is in the air, it’s all over me.

But why do I still feel like shit. I feel like I just want to go home and I don’t know where that is. I want to tell one person about everything that’s happened yet I’ve burned that bridge to the ground and it hurts me everyday. I’m constantly thinking of what that boy in college did to me and I hurt every single day. My life is so good right now and I still feel like I’m stuck in a sad song that on loop. I’ve been going to therapy and I stopped taking that medication that made me feel terrible and i feel like when I was taking it, it changed how I acted. I’m so hurt by the the things that I’ve done to people. I know that I’m the one that did it but I feel like once I stopped taking those meds I turned back into the person I was before I started them (personality wise) and that makes me feel good but I feel terrible about every single thing I did while one them. I just feel empty. Like a nagging, void guilt pain and I know what it is but at the same time it’s like I don’t. I just want to get rid of it and I don’t know how to stop feeling like this when I don’t even have a reason to."
339,For those experienced in hospitalization for mental health issues,"I have never had a hospital stay but I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and Anxiety Disorder. I am on my medication - for three years- and am now coming to accept that I will always think about my mortality daily.  I experience suicidal thoughts three days a week but no attempts- not the answer. I have experienced family members completing suicide and that is a terrible feeling to leave loved ones with. I would never wish that upon anyone but the thoughts are there. My question is this: is hospitalization worth it? I have heard only negative experiences with hospitalization for mental health disorders and am so afraid of being traumatized in a center while I’m trying to get help. I AM not wanting to kill myself but thoughts are pretty consistent and I am not a harm to myself or others. Just wanting some input from those with experience as this may be a treatment option. Please do not harass me or belittle me, this is a serious inquiry. TIA"
340,Managing relationships in 2020,I've fucked up all my relationships.  I live constantly in doubt of myself and others. Always observing and measuring. It's tiresome in itself let alone the decisions you have to make are extremely consequential. Trying to authenticate every human interaction is thee most tiresome job asked of us. In that inquiry bonds are broken so broken the pursuit eats the objective. A futile endeavour yet I can't seem to break the process my mind comes to and brother these are not words my mind is strained. My relationships body soul all strained. I'm worried I can't break free and I wonder what approach is best to take..
341,I have no clue how i feel,"I have had been diagnose  anxiety and depression  this year, i was in therapy with my school and everything seemed so good. But now i feel horrible i here my parents talking about when ill be done going to the doctor (I've had to go to check up on meds and stuff). I know i won't be able to continue with my current therapist so i just gave up and said everything is fine so she dosnt have to worry and i have no clue if i will try therapy again so i just quit therapy.  The docor has changed me on my dose of meds 3 times so far and i know i need a higher dose because everything gets to much but i dont want to get a highter dose because i feel like i want to die for about a couple days and last time it was the worst I've ever felt but i feel really bad for telling anyone in my family because my parents will worry so I've been bottling it up. I almost told my friend but he seemed to be doing good so i didn't. I just feel like a burdens to everyone. Not that i will do anything because i already know how that will impact my family because of my brother. 


Thanks if you read this i just need to get everything off my chest. Sorry if some spelling of grammer is messed up"
342,Does anyone know whats going on with me?,"For the past month i’ve had really bad problems when it comes on terms of forgetting and not processing things. I’ve always had that problem, but one day it just randomly got really bad. It feels like i’m in some mandela effect type deal or something. I can’t remember very main points of my days and still can’t remember them at all even though my parents and friends are telling me they happened. And then I just spent the past hour hyper ventilating because I couldn’t figure out how to change my time zone on a time zone changer website and my brain kept changing the date that was on their and jumbling up words and I still can’t get the date. This is getting really annoying because it just came out of nowhere. I’ve never had this problem before."
343,that thing where you get stuck in an anxious spiral during conversation and can't speak,I hate trying to talk to anyone about anything even the slightest bit serious because I'll get stuck in this anxious spiral where I just recite what I want to say in my head over and over again but can't actually get myself to say it out loud.  It just gets louder and louder until I'm practically screaming it in my head and it drowns out everything else.  It doesn't even have to be anything serious it can be stuff as small as just mildly asserting myself or otherwise asking for things.  I just fucking hate trying to talk when I'm like this because it just makes me feel so much worse and then I just give up because there's no point if I can't actually manage to say anything.

And if you need someone to talk to, even in your worst moments, I’m here for you."
346,What’s Up With Journaling in the Mental Health Community?,Most mental health advocates online advise journaling. Does it work for most people? I’ve tried it before and I’m never satisfied of it. What’s your thoughts on journaling?
347,Zero reasons to be positive,"I've [25F] been rather negative on everything ever since my childhood. Back then I thought that things eventually get better when I grow up and move out of my parents' house - mainly because my mom suffers from depression ever since I can remember, she doesn't believe in therapy so she has left her condition untreated, only taking AD-s for short periods over time &amp; quitting 'em too soon. I guess it has affected me as well, as I've gone to therapy and taking AD-s for almost two years (and counting on...).

I've never had a long-term, healthy relationship. Men I like don't even look at me. People say it's because I'm so negative, but I think it's because of my looks. I consider myself ugly from head to toe - skinny fat, pale skin with freckles, body not feminine enough, hideous face, this list could go on and on. I'm more than sure I'm going to be forever alone and for me - it's sad and pathetic, I don't want to end up like that but I feel like there's nothing to do to help it.

People tell me to be more positive, because ""no one can't love you if you don't love yourself first."" Well, how the hell should I love myself when nobody even likes me. Or, or ""just try to be more positive"" like out-of-nowhere, how? There's absolutely nothing to be positive about in my life - my mom is lunatic, I have only around two-three friends I can trust and my love life is absolute zero. I don't enjoy my job, but at the moment it's really hard to find a new one plus most job interviews I've been to in my life, I've been rejected in the end anyways. I recently graduated masters in marketing, but I have had thoughts of studying completely different field (but I feel I'm too dumb to do it).

I think I have absolutely every mental disorder that exists - severe depression, anxiety, BPD, Asperger etc. I've had thoughts on assisted suicide, constantly, but it's not legal in my country and I'm not sure if it is even possible to get it elsewhere due to mental illness (e.g. The Netherlands).

Sorry for the vent, I just dont know what to do anymore and I feel like I shouldnt exist anymore. Let me know please if I'm writing this in wrong sub. 
Sorry for lousy English, too. Not my native."
348,Nsfw?,"There's a possibility that this post might get removed. But, I'm going to go with it. 
Why was transgender-ism thought of as a mental illness till 2019? And then what changed? 
I'm not against trans genders. But there's a certain part of me that wants to question the system. We're all biologically divided into two seperate genders. 
I am not talking about intersex, but I'm just talking about the trans gender people here."
349,Brain won’t let me express myself?,"I have a lot of things I want to do and say, such as create a Medium blog, or start a productivity channel. But whenever I get up to try and do things, or even just communicate with people, my brain seems to stop functioning. It’s as if I’m stepping hard on the gas but the engine, my brain, just won’t rev. My mind feels stuck in one place. What’s up with that?"
350,My friends unknowingly joke about the night I attempted...,"This post is just a vent. I’m not sure if it belongs on this subreddit but I really just need to tell somebody, anybody, because it’s my darkest secret. 

I don’t want to get too far into specifics. But basically one night I got drunk at my place alone and video chatted with someone who was really bad for me. I was in love with them and they were crying to me about having their heart broken by somebody else and all I wanted to do was pull the pain out so I literally  tried to do it.

And then things just spiraled somehow. Things weren’t about the person I was in love with anymore. I was just bringing more and more emotional pain and poor thoughts on myself and I started to want to self harm. I have trained myself to do something a little goofy instead of self harming (this is where I won’t be specific because if my friends read it they will know). But it’s a kind of thing that my roomate saw evidence of in the morning and thought it was hilarious. I guess it is hilarious out of context but I don’t know it represents a lot of pain to me. She tells it as a funny story to our friends about the time I “got so drunk she _______”. It physically pains me when she brings it up and I want to throw up because all my friends laugh and it’s some sort of inside joke now. 
Later that night I tried to overdose on random old prescriptions that definitely wouldn’t have done the job anyways looking back. But it was my first legitimate attempt that I thought was going to work.  but ended up just puking everywhere in the bathtub.

It was the hardest night of my life and I hate that this is a joke. But I could never tell them."
351,[Advice Needed] Should I take Seroquel (quetiapine) or ask for a different prescription?,"I (18f) have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for I think about nine years. I spent several months away from familial and professional mental health support in the past year during the most traumatic period of my life and was self-medicating during that time with various street drugs (included for some context but I do not want to elaborate). I got back in the height of the pandemic in the midst of quarantine which has made getting back into treatment extremely difficult. Now that I'm doing telehealth with my care team, I'm hearing new ideas/labels for my symptoms, namely BPD, bipolar disorder, and C-PTSD. Still haven't been able to receive an updated diagnosis, however. After like 10 minutes on the phone, my psychiatrist prescribed me 100mg of Seroquel to aid my states of psychosis and insomnia. I haven't taken it yet because I read up on the side effects and heard some experiences others have had on it and at this point I'm incredibly wary of taking any drugs, especially ones known to increase suicidality seeing as I'm already mildly suicidal and have a history of attempting through overdose. I've been on high doses of Abilify in the past which zombified me and made me gain somewhere around 30lbs as well as a few SSRIs that didn't seem to do much other than make me more suicidal. Therapy, specifically DBT, has been the most helpful factor for me but I just can't get sessions as often as I need them. But my mental health is pretty bad at this point and it's becoming increasingly clear I need to be medicated at some level. If you have experience with any of the aforementioned conditions and/or being on Seroquel, please share if you're willing. I'd also appreciate suggestions for other medications to ask my psychiatrist about that might be able to help without such awful side effects. Thank you!"
352,"Is there a disorder for talking in circles, forgetting what you're talking about, not hearing what people are saying, accidentally repeating yourself, not keeping your attention on whomever is speaking, and being unable to willfully focus on things or keep still?","I have the verbal communication skills of a kid, well into adulthood, and can't not multitask jumping between tasks and steps. People think I'm on drugs, I think I'm broken.

My strongest communication skills is saying the most nothing with the most words.

To this day, I don't understand how study groups can function. I can't read while people are talking. I have a hard enough time with my eyes glazing over paragraphs without distraction.

Google says physical head trauma, or several years of recreational drinking fucked me in the head, or any other variant of classic brain damage."
353,How to deal with emotionally distant parents?,"I am blessed to have been born and raised with both of my parents in my life, but sometimes I feel as though it would be easier for me mentally if my dad wasn’t even in my life. My mom and I are pretty isolated, with us only having two or so real friends that we talk to on a regular basis. My dad on the other hand, I could be having a conversation with him and the doorbell ring or his phone goes off, and next thing you know it’s like I never existed and all that matters is him, cars, and his friends. 

I know he has every right to hang out with his friends and I know we have nothing to really bond with, but for fuck’s sake, I feel like he doesn’t know who I am and I feel like he’s never around; always trying to do something productive, pacing talking to a friend, or falling asleep after watching TV for 5 minutes. His work hours vary to the point where some days he leaves at 4am and gets back at 5pm, and other days he can’t work... but he’s still nowhere to be found.

I just want to sit down for dinner and talk about life and laugh about all the weird things that happen in life, but instead we sit in silence, sometimes with the Big Bang Theory or Home Improvement on to make it less awkward.

I feel as though my mom just makes me feel worse about all of this, because there’s always something to complain about him. He gives orders instead of asking, he suddenly disappears, he prioritizes friends over family, he spends hundreds of dollars on collectibles but complains when we go out to eat too frequently... 

I wish my family was happy."
354,Is therapy worth it,"posting here because I don’t know where else to go. i am a college student who has been living at home since the start of COVID. before quarantine happened i was living in a different state for college and i was the happiest I have ever been. i was super social and productive and creative. when I moved home and began quarantine everything changed for the worse. I’ve never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses or been to therapy but i have never felt worse mentally than I’ve felt the last few months. I feel lethargic and numb and I’ve lost so much respect for myself. I’ve always been a pretty introverted, shy, not very social person except for at school and this just all hit me so hard since I began isolating, especially since the pandemic is making it impossible to be social and I do not want to be careless and irresponsible by partying or going out right now. im thinking of seeing a therapist so that I can try and get some clarity and have someone to talk to. I’ve never been to therapy before and I feel a little guilty considering it when i don’t have a hard life and my home life is good. I am most likely just feeling this way because I am lonely and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time so I’m not sure if i should try it out or if I should just wait til quarantine passes. I was wondering what therapy is like and if anyone recommends it. thank you"

358,Daydreaming about binge eating,"Long Post Alert!

Hi guys!
I'm on a weight loss journey since the past 6 months and have lost 17 pounds (my weight is 174 pounds now). Safe to say I have a really unhealthy relationship with food. I used to live alone so there was a lot of binge eating involved, spent most nights just watching stuff and eating all sorts of junk food, like chocolate, fried stuff, etc. I finally started following a diet and working out. But I gave in to my food cravings a couple of times. I would follow a diet and work out for say 2-3 weeks, then I'd go back to binge eating one night and feel like a huge failure. I'd have no control for the next few days. It will take a lot of motivation to start working out again and follow a diet.
I got married almost 3 months ago to my boyfriend of 2 years. I'm in a country where living with our parents, even after getting married is very common. I used to live alone but my husband lived with his parents, and now after the wedding, we all live together (I have absolutely no problem with that, I love my in-laws). My husband never knew that I had a binge eating problem while we were dating. I never told him because I feel so ashamed of myself for not having any control. He on the other hand, is a fitness enthusiast, so it makes me feel even worse to tell him about my problem. I'm scared of being judged. 
I always knew that my binge eating was obviously an obstacle to my well being, and have tried my best to avoid it, by following diets, working out. But I can't figure out what my triggers are, what makes me want to go back to it again. Also, I used to binge eat when I was alone, never in front of my husband, family or friends. When we got married, I thought it's going to be great for my binge eating problem since we all will be living together and somehow I do so much better when there are people around me. I know it was naive to think that. What's happening now is..I work out, I cycle 15km every morning which makes me feel great, I eat healthy home cooked food, all this makes me feel so good, but it doesn't last. I've been starting to crave junk food A LOT. So much so that I find myself literally thinking about food all the time.. I think about it while I'm working and I feel cranky. For example, when I go grocery shopping with my husband, I want to pick up all the junk food, but I feel like my husband will judge me, so I don't do it. Maybe a small piece of chocolate or something. But it makes me frustrated because all I want to do is binge eat. Just put on my favorite show and binge eat. My husband and I love each other SO MUCH, he knows everything about me except this. I don't know how to deal with it anymore and I think I'm going crazy. 

Thanks for reading this huge confession (it feels like a confession, and I've never shared it with anyone before). I'd be grateful for some advice and insight on it. I think therapy is the only solution now..  "

362,I need some guidance or advice,"(CW: Self harm)


Hey,


I've been struggling to sleep for the past few nights but I've kept telling myself that I'll ask Reddit and you lot will give me a hand - it's been a weird couple of days and I just need some validation (or not if you think I'm wrong) and advice.


The best way I can explain this is via a quick story of how I figured out I should maybe look for some help.


I'm 18M, I was at a party w/ some friends and started talking to a kind of distant friend of mine about how hard it is to stay in contact with people you really care about from countries you've emigrated from (we'd both emigrated) and kind of feeling trash and guilty. After some more alcohol was consumed we had a bit of a deep and meaningful where she told me about some stuff I won't go into detail about (out of respect for her) so I felt comfortable talking to her and getting something big off my chest.


Recently I've been going out with a wonderful girl and there's a possibility of clothes-off intimacy that comes w/ that. I've never been that close with someone, but I'm scared that when the time comes the scars on my thighs from me cutting myself will frighten them off (I understand that). So recently I've been holding off and not cutting, but it's been really difficult bc I'm going through my first finals period of uni and it's been completely wild bc I don't really have any other way to stabilise my emotions and I feel things really strongly so it's almost like one day I feel so so horrible and want to cut myself and whatever and the next I'm fine and the weather's gorgeous and I'm really enjoying this song or whatever.

I just feel like I feel things really deeply and I cut myself to bring order back almost, or because I think it will make me feel better. At points if I've been totally in a weird place emotionally and I've got school work due I'd cut just to return to normalcy so I could be productive. It's not an all the time thing but the frequency changes, it's been kind of sporadic over 2 years.

So she was saying that she was the same, but just coped with things slightly differently but went to a doctor and they sent her to therapy and they worked out medication and other stuff and she feels less all over the place now.

Then someone else piped in just generally about therapy and how it's good for everyone (luckily he didn't catch the rest of the conversation)

So my first friend said it's more normal than I think and I should go and see a doctor and go from there. Basically the next day I just kept thinking back to loads of times where I felt really awful and hated anything and thought back to what I thought were the best days of my life but if looked at through a lens of ""maybe something is different about the way your brain is and you just felt great for that day for no reason"" seemed pretty ordinary. I've never thought anything about my mental health might be worth seeing a doctor about but I rang up and arranged to get my HPV vaccine (which my mum had been on my back for) and then asked for a GP appointment. I haven't spoken to my parents bc they would be appalled and very disappointed so I'm going to try and sort this out myself as best as possible, but I'm super apprehensive. 

I feel like it's my responsibility to see if anything's going on and get it fixed and I'm proud that I sorted out an appointment but the thought of speaking to the doctor frankly frightens me.

What do you think? Am I doing the right thing?

And if so how should I approach it with the doctor?

(Also I'm in Aus so it's entirely bulk billed thank goodness)

If you've read this thank you so much"
363,[vent],"I’m so anxious and awkward. I hate my personality because of it. I never know what to say. I don’t even like to talk because I don’t know what to say ever.

I don’t have the same natural social cues as other people. I just didn’t get that memo. Other people are so cool and chill. I have a weird twitch at the back of my neck because I’m so damn anxious and nervous. I blame it on the people who called me ugly and weird everyday of my life in my childhood until I left them after high school. I blame myself for letting them. My twitching is getting out of control I can’t help it. Sometimes I think I’m retarded, I apologize if that’s offensive.. it’s just that I feel that a handful of things are off with me. I don’t feel normal like the average person. I know I’m so mean and critical to myself, but I can’t help but believe it’s all facts! I know me best. and I’m an embarrassment."

I like my major but I can’t help feeling inferior to others. Anyways I’ve been having dark thoughts and that’s fine but I usually feel the need to hurt myself to basically relieve me of feeling inadequate. I never actually do it because I’m too scared..but I keep feeling the need of hurting myself I usually go to the gym because it’s pain but it’s good pain...but now that gyms are closed and all that shit I’m feeling less adequate then normal and I always feel like I need to hurt myself for disappointing myself in what I feel I could do but simply just ended up failing at. Idk what to do I feel that if I start cutting I won’t be able to stop but i can’t get rid of this feeling of punishing myself."

369,Using Mindfulness for Depression - How do I deal with my Emotions?,"In mindfulness practice regarding my emotions. Given that the thoughts that generate the somber emotions are skewd and soured because of my illness, are they actually valid and should I accept and allow them like mindfulness teaches? The thoughts aren't my true thoughts but a symptom of the illness is what I've been learning and trying to work on. So what do I do with the emotions when it would seem they are skewed and trigured by my depressed thinking? Are they still seen as valid?? Sometimes it's hard to differentiate between which emotions are the depression and which are normal aswel. Thanks for any viewpoint. Or maybe some insights or advice in advance."
370,I want to watch someone die (trigger warning),I want to look someone in the eyes as the life fades from it I want to see someone suffer great physical pain and anguish as the scarlet river flows from there body gleaming in the light. I watch things no reasonable person sould I've developed a disgusting obsession with blood and death as of recently I over analyze and think to much about others and obscene  details I send entire days or weeks obsessing over details and questioning what they mean I get in these moods where I do and say things that aren't anything like me I don't want to kill someone!

371,Is this normal?,"

I often have arguments with myself. audibly. Not usually around people, and I wouldn’t say it’s very erratic. I often set myself at two points of an argument and seemingly debate with myself, in times of great stress or when I have anxiety about certain situations. I rarely even notice until after the fact; once the resolution is found and I come to a head with the outcome, and it’s almost as if it puts me back in peace with my torn sides that were just butting heads. I do not do anything during these episodes that could be a harm to myself. I just want to know why I do this. Why it can happen without me expecting it and I don’t realize it’s happened until it’s over. Is this something that can happen to lots of people, or could this be a symptom of possible mental illness that hasn’t gotten as bad as it could?"

I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD but it's hard to believe I don't have it. I hate when triggers pop up out of nowhere or when people talk about my trigger it's so fucking horrible. If it shows up on a social media feed I have a split second to get away to avoid getting as little triggered as possible. I wish I could say ""put a TW"" but people are so fucking rude about it.

Hey, my first time posting anywhere on reddit, but I just feel so hopeless I need to tell this to somebody. I'm 16 years old and I don't know if these things are normal to feel but I feel so overwhelmed in any social situation, no matter if it's in school or if I'm sorrounded by close friends. I just have this crippling fear that I will do something wrong and they will all laugh at me and think of me as a weird and awkward person. That's why I tend to avoid any social interactions, even texting my classmates from how scared I am. I'm even trembling while writing this post.

 I thought about telling this to my parents even though they know my behaviour and just shake it off as shyness and me being a horrible and lazy person but I don't want to feel this way. I don't want to go to school everyday thinking everyone is looking at me and judging me, I want to talk to my classmates and socialize without being scared and stuttering in every sentence. I don't have no one to tell this to except my parents, and two friends. i met one online and the other lives in my town but I feel like she wouldn't take me seriously. I don't know if my parents will ever take me seriously and I feel like only way they will take me seriously would be if I hurt myself. And I have hurt myself in the past, never told that to anybody.

My mental state has been getting worse over quarantine, so much that I've been thinking of ending it all multiple times, and one time I almost did it. but I feel like if I was gone my parents would be so much better, they wouldn't have me as a burden and wouldn't have so much  financial issues because of me. but I'm too scared to do it, and I'm even more scared of future. How am I going to get a job unable to talk to people like this? how am I going to do anything on my own when I burst out crying in every social situation? 

because my inability to socialize I spend most of my days in my room alone. I am introverted and enjoy some alone time but I feel like I am going crazy from everyday going the same. I almost never go out, and when I do it's with that one friend from my town I've mentioned, and after being with her I feel like garbage because she always talks about how she's hanging out with her friends and how much good time they have and I feel jealous for not being able to do those things and being this emotional wreck I am.
I just feel like everyday is the same and I'm stuck in this neverending loop of self hate and pity. the more I look in the mirror, the more I hate the person staring back at me. I just hate who I am, such a coward and a useless person. Like there is no purpose in my existence. 

could my odd social interactions be connected to the fact that I was bullied in elementary school? and I've recently had frequent dreams about being back in my old class and they would make fun of me again. It started happening over quarantine and I don't know why. 

does anyone here know what's wrong with my social interactions and if I should tell my parents or someone else? I've read before about social anxiety and I feel like I might have it but in the same I don't want to self diagnose, maybe I'm just too shy. I feel more hopeless everyday i just needed a place to went to. If you've come this far, thank you for reading... it means so much to me."
376,need advice (tw),"
I lately do not know how to feel. I have struggled with self-harm and multiple suicide attempts but have gotten through it. I no longer feel that bad but I get intrusive thoughts of my conscious just saying to kill myself. I also tend to do this thing that may be something like a disassociation, it’s where my eyes gloss over or I just can’t focus, it feels that I am not really controlling my body but I’m still conscious. It normally happens when the situation is bad or relates to something bad. I’m confused on what is happening to me. Please help, thank you.

I have never been to therapy or reached out like this before."
377,My personal shame....,"Growing up I was my parents first born. My dad wanted a boy. He ended up getting one but not before he threw me head first into the garage with him. Because of this, I would say I'm a huge Tom boy. Even now into my mid 20's. I love comfy clothes, I'm a diesel mechanic, and honestly I cuss like a sailor. I was from the Midwest. When I was 8 my parents moved us out to the southwest.

My issue with this was growing up everyone thought I was a lesbian. Come to find out my best friend even spread a rumor around that her and I made out. Which basically ruined my chances with any boy's in school and crushed my self confidence. This rumor was so wide spread the school counselor tried to get me to ""come out"".

I feel like because of this now I have an aversion to being around gay people. Not because of who they are, but because it could cause other people to assume I am also. 

I have a 7 year old daughter and am now getting married to the man of my dreams. Him and I have had several conversations about this. Many late night conversations. Alot of my friends criticize me for this but I just don't know how to stop it."
378,I don't know...,My sister (16) drank sleeping pills after a breakup to try and end it all (Unsuccessfully)  after i tried to tell her its not the end of the world and she still young.. Its breaking up the family and my dad (divorced from my mom) and my brother blames my mother for the incident. I've been living with my mother for my whole life and i know it is unfair to blame her. I don't want to see my sister or talk to her because she doesn't listen to anything anyone is telling her but she keeps lying to everyone and i can see it drastically  impacts her mental health because she has so much to hide. In the past I've opened up a lot to her but she doesn't seem to feel anything. I know this is is a weird post but any help on this will help a lot.
379,Need advice,"Hi.. I (22F) have viewings this week to move in to shared accommodation basically double bedrooms not too far away from where I live now with my mum, older brother (24) and younger brother (17). The house is quite toxic and cramped.. my mum treats them who don’t work or contribute btw differently to me who does favours pays rent and helps anyway I can. I’m feeling very nervous about leaving the dog behind also I know a lot of people will say he’s just a dog but he is a lot more than that to me.

I suffer with anxiety and depression and it’s really playing up I just don’t know what to do, am I making the right decision? Once I leave that’s it I can’t come back, will I be lonely? Will I feel isolated and stuck? 

I’m going out of my mind I know I should get out of this house because it most of the time makes my mental health worse

380,Sport,I love sport health and fitness and have ever since I was little. I’m 20 now and starting to realise it isn’t everything. Sport that is. I still love health and fitness. For the last few years I feel like my love for footy has kind of dropped off and I’m only doing it for something to do. It’s hard to explain. I can keep my self fit and healthy with out playing footy. I love playing cricket as well but right now it’s summer and there’s no cricket comps. My problem lays with footy. I love it but the people invoked in my club are dick heads and they don’t give a fuck. A lot of jealousy hatred and negativity and I just don’t feel like being around it. I also don’t want to stop doing something I like doing and feel that it helps me mentally and physically but I also can’t be bothered with other people’s toxic behaviour. Majority of them live shit life’s and they try to bring other people down. Footy to them is everything. It gives them purpose. Footy to me is something that helps me keep fit and it also clears my mind. I can’t make a decision if I should stop all together or just keep on doing what I’m doing. I’m happy but for a split second after footy training I always have negative vibes. This doesn’t happen if I don’t train but then I don’t get that good feeling that training gives me. It’s a weird one and this post might seem off but it’s just the situation I’m in.
381,Mental Health since working from home.,"I’ve always struggled with stress and anxiety working in an office. 

Since lockdown I’ve been working from home for almost three months now. It’s easily the most calm, stress free and completely not tired I’ve been. 

I’ve always wanted to be able to work from home because I knew that I’d feel this way. Especially being an introvert, being in an office tires me out having to put a face on all day.

My company - and I’m sure others - keep talking about mental health while working from home. While I appreciate it’s difficult for people, they thrive being around others. I don’t think people are going to talk about mental health when going back into the office.

If/when it goes back to normal, I’m going to request working from home at least a few days a week and explain it’s for MY mental health - especially since I’ve been functioning normally working from home.

Sorry, just a little rant."
382,I get so anxious when someone likes me that i feel like throwing up and it lasts for days, It's really bad feeling. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't study. I just stop functioning normally. It exhaust me. It once lasted for like three weeks while i was talking to a guy and i lost like 7kg in that time period. Lots of times i just have to stop talking to someone because i can't handle that feeling. This bothers me so much because i can't form a romantic connection with anyone and i just can't figure out what's wrong with my brain. I can't really talk to a therapist rn so if anyone can tell me what this might be and what i can to about this i would be really grateful.
383,"I'm positively sure I have depression, how do I get my psychologist to point me to a psychiatrist?","I'm a 23 yo male from Italy. This is not a throwaway account.

I've been struggling for years, with people around me either not noticing or having their own problems I didn't want to add to. I actually don't remember a moment in my life I can define as ""happy"", or even serene.

The situation became harder and harder. I feel like I can't focus on anything which lead to partially failing my studies and blowing the few career opportunities I found. Even keeping in touch with people to maintain friendships is hard, like every minute I spend talking is draining my energy instead of ""recharging"" me as pleasant activities should. Forget about romantic relationships.

With the lockdown I reached an absolute low and finally reached out for help. Honestly, I've only been able to because my mom and younger brother are also seeing therapists for problems connected to my parents' divorce. 

It's been over a month since I started taking appointments with this doctor. The problem is that I feel like he's focusing on the wrong stuff. I told him I think I have depression and he belittled the notion. I told him I had problems before the divorce but he still brings it up from time to time.

I've always been wary of trying to self diagnose through information found on the internet, but I fit the symptoms of clinical depression to a T. Symptoms I talked about in my sessions with the doctor to no avail. At the very least I think this is a thing to look into and I'm not sure if he's actually doing that.

I feel like I need to have faith in the doctor for him to be able to help me but at the same time I can't help but wonder if he'll make me waste some more months or years. If I finally asked for help is because I can't take it anymore.

So, uh. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to tread going forward."
384,I’m having a lot of issues with actually making plans with people and don’t know why( sorry this is a little long),"So, for backstory, about 2 years ago I had a lot of trouble making plans with anyone due to the fact that every time I would make plans, I would regret making them, cancel/try to cancel, or change them completely. This includes friends or family. I just didn’t really like being around other people and I liked having my own space, all to myself, and not worrying about someone else. When I started regretting the plans, I would feel super anxious and get an urge to pace and take deep breaths. It got to the point where I wouldn’t hang out with anyone, and overall kept to myself out of school. This lasted about 1-2 years and I was able to start making plans by not allowing myself to stay long, made sure I always knew who I would be with, and where. Granted they were someone I knew well, I would feel fine. 

Flash forward to the Covid-19 lockdown. I took the lockdown seriously because I knew multiple people who would be very much at risk if exposed to Covid. I stayed at home completely, not even going to stores or anything, for about 3-4 weeks. I decided I’d go stay with my sister, we will call her ‘Cassidy’, for a little while as my parents stress me out a lot and we don’t get to see eachother much. I love hanging out with Cassidy and always have a great time and she told me I could stay for a few weeks and I was ready to stay for awhile. My mom drives me to meet up with her and I stay there but after a few days, I get the anxious feeling and I just wanted to be in my own space. I’m pretty comfortable with Cassidy as I’m able to talk to her about a lot and she is very wise and gives good advice. I had no problem staying there and loved being with her, but I still got that feeling. I felt very guilty as I genuinely wanted to be with her for awhile but it made me feel so uneasy that I had to leave early. I should have been completely honest but I didn’t want to hurt her feelings so I told her my mom just wanted me home, though I know she would not have cared and she would have 1000% understood. I figured it was just due to me being a little farther away then normal and not having a nice, clean room as she is slightly messier even though that didn’t even really bother me. After the lockdown was lifted, I hung out with 2 of my closest friends and we all had a great time as we hadn’t seen eachother in months. I’ve been trying to make plans with them again but every time I think about hanging out with them, I get super anxious. There have been a couple times that I said we could possibly hangout and then I would change my mind and kind of sabotage the situation by not answering texts which makes me feel guilty but I am too nervous to actually make the plans. I’m not completely sure why I am starting to get this feeling but I believe it’s because I have been in lockdown and mainly just in my own space and the thought of letting someone invade that space, freaks me out. That’s really the only thing I can think of. I am super conflicted on what this is/what’s causing it, how to handle it and help others understand and overall  just how I can get over this."
385,Advice on drugs and alcohol,"So roughly how much xanax and alcohol is going to kill you? I know an overdose is different for everyone, I just wanted to be very careful since I am on a high dosage of xanax (4mg) but I would also love to enjoy some wine."
386,An urge to be horrible to someone,"I've had issues controlling rage for a while. Random flair ups of intense rage and legitimate hate have caused tensions in my relationships between friends and family. I keep feeling an urge to make someone's day a little bit miserable, and when those feelings fade I'm wracked with intense thoughts of a self destructive nature. I've rationalized thermal as just something that happens, but I want to break free of the cycle.

I don't know how to describe what else I'm feeling, so if anyone could give me a hand to give me a head start I would be rly grateful. I don't want to be bitter and spiteful anymore and I fed up of being the villain."
387,No other choices,"I (20) have no other choices besides suicide at this point, like long term. I’m too stupid for school and I’m way too depressed/lazy ig to work. From my around August to I think 2 months ago maybe less I didn’t leave my room besides to eat and go to bathroom. The only reason I have been more is because I just moved, now I have no privacy to just lock myself away. The more I think the more I think this is my only option. I can’t imagine myself past 23 at this point. I can’t do anything I’m fucking stupid"
388,Feeling murderous/violent tendencies from bad memories?,"I’m finding myself constantly feeling high off the idea of beating someone so bad that their face is unrecognizable. I think it may be due to the fact that I was surrounded by violence my whole life. 

My mom used to beat the shit out of me and my sisters, my uncle beat the shit out of my mom when she was beating the shit out of me, my grandma tried killing my grandpa with a butcher’s knife, etc. I was also picked on at school every day, so it’s very tough to reminisce my childhood without feeling very sad/angry. 

I struggle throughout the day with these memories and my blood pressure spikes and my heart starts pounding. I become very angry and it makes me want to give someone brain damage. 

At the moment, I’ve been feeling this high for almost 10 hours now. I can’t go to sleep because I keep fantasizing curb stomping the heads of my mom and other bullies until their face is unrecognizable. I’m not a violent person, but this “high” completely alters the way I think and feel. It makes me hate those people so much that I want to kill them and make them feel a very slow, painful death. 

I’m scared because I don’t want to ever resort to violence, but I can’t get help because I’m broke. I’ve tried other outlets such as meditating or working out, but I don’t think it’s been very effective. 

What do I do?

390,Confused about where I am in life and how it can ever be brought back to normal,"About 7 years ago I had a major burn out from shit going on in my personal, social, family life and working far too much .

Mental health went to shit , quit my job , and was unemployed for a couple of years and lived off savings.

Lost contact with people and pushed people away . 

Over the years I got back to work and did various jobs , but my social life is virtually non existent, haven't been in a relationship in years , haven't even flirted with any girls in so long .besides online 

Been so preoccupied with my finances and job that my life has become virtually empty.

No one's knocking on my door or calling on the phone anymore.

It's kinda my own fault, I had everything and pushed it away because of depression

Had some beautiful GFs in my life , I haven't so much as kissed a girl in a few years.

Don't really know how my life's ended up this way , and why did I just stop caring , to the point friends, relationships , social life are alien to me. And my social skills aren't what they used to be .

It's like huge chunks of life have just evaporated , but yet I don't have a strong enough desire to actually do anything about it or how

At the height of it , I go to work , pay my bills , come home and spend my evenings and wkds alone . 

How have I become so crap 

I feel completely detached and dissociated from normal sometimes. 

Not sure how it will get better."

For about six years I have been going up and down with my self-esteem but recently it’s been really low. I constantly think about how other girls are are prettier than me and hotter and that makes me think my boyfriend thinks the same way. I compare myself to every female there is and I get sad about myself. Because my relationship is kinda in a bad place( that’s because of me) i make things worse with my jealousy. I ask him to delete girls from snapchats and Instagram because I feel like he does not know then and they are prettier than me and that the wants them. I get that I’m that crazy girlfriend and I do not want to be that. I just want do stop comparing myself to others and stop worrying that he will fall in love with somebody else because I’m not enough. I also know that I should go to therapy but it’s not possible right now. Hope somebody can share some light how do make myself a better person.  Thanks!

Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

I'm keeping the sub active mainly through posting mental health news articles but eventually hoping it can be a more varied sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy.

395,Toxic friendships,"Disclaimer: please don't take this post too seriously. Toxic friendships aren't a problem for me personally, I'm just writing a series where one of the plot lines is related to the topic and was interested in advice so it's not unrealistic. I guess it could the replies could be helpful to someone who's looking for advice about what to do with a toxic friend though. And if this post is inappropriate, feel free to delete I guess.

Anyway so when Tallulah is first introduced, she's just a typical bully who makes fun of those she considers beneath her, especially Tesni, whose methods of dealing with her are more pacific than those of her friend Aventurine, who pretty reasonably has a massive dislike for Tallulah not long after meeting her. But Tallulah is motivated to change afterwards because when she's in need, Tesni can't help her but stays with her anyway until help does arrive. Long story short, Tallulah is able to earn the other's trust after being given a second chance.

Now Tesni and Tallulah are both good friends. However, albeit unintentionally, Tallulah shows signs of being a toxic friend. She does Tesni one little favour and then dumps a whole lot of work on her ""to repay her"". She pretends to be nice to Peter, this new guy who's the brother of one of their existing friends, but talks about him behind his back because he's kind of a bitter person (these characters aren't humans but whatevz lol) even though she herself used to be bad. Tallulah also gets kind of jealous when Tesni is spending time with new friends. Peter is the one who points out Tallulah's weird behaviour to Tesni. Tesni's ""breaking point"", however, is when Tallulah refuses to help Tesni with a situation because it's affecting a new friend whom she's salty towards and doesn't affect her. So Tesni feels as if she should take a break from their friendship, but does feel guilty because she's not one to stay bitter at someone but doesn't get the chance to talk to her again because soon after she has to travel away for a bit during the Christmas holidays.

Tesni and Tallulah's mutual friends are very annoyed though because they're now basically back to square one with Tallulah. During their time apart though, Tallulah becomes more mature by taking on responsibilities, making new friends and they are able to talk out their problems respectfully. At the end of the arc, the main characters reconcile and they're friends again because they (including Tallulah herself) know that she is more emotionally mature and her pride is less likely to get the better of her.

So what do you think? Should you give someone a ~~second~~ third chance? Should you reconnect with a toxic friend when you know for certain they have changed? Should you even leave them in the first place if you know ""they didn't mean to""? Let me know what you think and once again I'm sorry if this is an inappropriate post, I just didn't want to fake it and say ""oH YeAh pLS hELp mE UwU I hAvE a tOxiC fRiEnD ToTalLY rEaL"" because then the replies would be so genuine and yeah. thx for reading uwu"
396,Broke down after someone gets angry at me,"Hhaha i've been doing my best to keep up and bottle things up but just as my dad gets mad at me for not washing the dishes i finally broke down. Fuck, anytime someone gets mad at me, i always feel shitty so whats the difference. 

I dont know anymore. Everytime I feel shitty, it makes me upset why im not normal. Im 19 yrs old, havent finished senior highschool. Education is so hard for me. I dont know if its because of my depression and anxiety or my incompetence. Even if i finish highschool, where will I even go for college? I dont have anything for my future. I dont have any passions anymore. All I wanted was to take a break from school but my parents think 3 months of no school was enough to let me collect my thoughts and be free from my depression and forced me to do online class. I cant even finish it because I feel like crap and useless. I cant do shit. I cant even focus on the subject. All I can do is feel bad being alive. I wish I was born normal. I wish my mental health never got in the way of my education. I wish my mental health never got in the way of my own life. Why do I have to keep struggling when I am beaten up enough."
397,I'm worried for my brother and I need advice.,"My brother has been dealing with mental health issues and depression for quite some time now.
He was on medication and was going to therapy about 2 years ago. But he stopped taking his meds shortly after that and even stopped therapy.

Anyway, I study in a different state and I'm not home that often to really know what goes on with him. 
With the pandemic and college being closed, I came back home and a few weeks in, my brother broke down in front of me and said he's been feeling depressed again.
I told my parents about it and confronted them as to why he stopped taking his meds. I thought HE DIDN'T want to.
But apparently, my parents said that the doctor advised him so idk anymore.

After that day, he seemed to be back to his normal self.

Fast forward to a few days ago when my other sibling said he saw marks on his wrist.
I was worried but I didn't confront him about it because I wanted to be sure."
398,My parents fighting has made me very traumatized and I don't know what to do anymore,"First of all, I'm 23 years old and still living with my parents (moving out is not an option right now), maybe after graduation I might be able to live more independently.  


My parents have been fighting a lot ever since i was a kid and it has affected everything in my life. I've tried confronting them many times but it has made things worse because it hurt me so much that they know that this is affecting me and still they can't control it. It's not just the fighting, the environment is stressful and it's stopping me from being able to do anything. I can't take a step forward because of them. I know that I should try to ignore it and do things that make me more relaxed (artistic things for example, or work for my future) but most of the time it's even hard to do these small things. Like when you know the solution but you can't mentally or physically do it, you just can't. I keep breaking down and scream and I hate myself when I do this.   


This has turned me into a very weak and fragile person, I hate myself and my personality. I'm not a bad person,I've just been stuck for so long. And I can't wait anymore until I get out. I am afraid that I will harm myself or worse harm them.  I guess I have severe anxiety and depression.

And as I'm writing this, We're quarantined and I can't get out much so you can only imagine the hell I'm living in.

400,I'm worried for my brother and I would like some advice!,"My brother has been dealing with mental health issues and depression for quite some time now.
He was on medication and was going to therapy about 2 years ago. But he stopped taking his meds shortly after that and even stopped therapy.

Anyway, I study in a different state and I'm not home that often to really know what goes on with him. 
With the pandemic and college being closed, I came back home and a few weeks in, my brother broke down in front of me and said he's been feeling depressed again.
I told my parents about it and confronted them as to why he stopped taking his meds. I thought HE DIDN'T want to.
But apparently, my parents said that the doctor advised him so idk anymore.

After that day, he seemed to be back to his normal self.

Fast forward to a few days ago when my other sibling said he saw marks on his wrist.
I was worried but I didn't confront him about it because I wanted to be sure.

It was only a few hours ago that I actually saw the marks. They were vey prominent on his right wrist.

So now I'm scared if he might do something to himself.
What do I do? How do I talk to him about it without him freaking out? How do I tell my parents about it and how should they talk to him?
I'm scared and confused! What do I do? 
Can someone please help me!"
401,What’s going on with me?,"I have moments where I feel nothing at all, to moments of intense feelings. One moment I can feel numb, in a way that even though I love those around me, Im not capable of “feeling” this love. I know for a fact that I love those who I care for, but I feel like that passion warmth is gone. It’s like knowing that you feel an emotion, but not really “feeling” it at all. Yet the next moment, it comes crashing at me, and I feel intense emotions, not just towards family or my relationship, but anything and any range of emotion. It’s like my feelings are either 0 or 100, black or white. This isn’t in the span of a day. It can be days or a week. I am capable of feeling self aware of my emotions compared to my past. Another thing is how I have this habit of detaching myself emotionally from issues. If I see the potential of someone betraying me, I distance myself emotionally and pretend as if I never cared for them at all, and that’s when the numbness kicks in as this mean person who will hurt you if it means protecting themselves, or just someone who will act as if you never existed to them. It’s as if sympathy left the table, even if the person won’t actually hurt me, the threat is still there. I don’t want to be this person, but It happens without me even realizing. Same way with my anger, I’m such an angry person and lash out to those I love without even meaning to, and I do it subconsciously. I sometimes view myself as a ruthless person who wants control over every aspect of their life and wants things their way no matter what, but this side of me knows that not every aspect of life can be controlled. This ruthless side is mostly expressed through anger. I realize these actions after I do them, it’s as if I subconsciously do them, yet instantly regret getting mad at someone I care for over a petty thing. I don’t know if this should also be included, but along with detachment, there are situations where I go into autopilot, if that makes any sense? It’s as if I’m not in control. During conversations, I’ll speak ,smile, etc., and ask myself, “why am I even doing these things?” It’s like my brain and body disconnected. It’s as if in the moment I realize what’s happening, yet can’t stop it at the same time. This doesn’t happen as often, but enough for me to notice. 

Can someone please explain to me the random shift of emotions, as well as the petty anger and detachment? I want to know if other people go through this as well and if this is just a normal thing. I should also add that teachers with psychology degrees have considered me a perfectionist and say that I may have anxiety. Thank you for reading, your insight will be very much appreciated.

TL;DR- I have trouble regulating my emotions."
402,My parents fighting has made me very traumatized and I don't know what to do anymore," 

First of all, I'm 23 years old and still living with my parents (moving out is not an option right now), maybe after graduation I might be able to live more independently.

My parents have been fighting a lot ever since i was a kid and it has affected everything in my life. I've tried confronting them many times but it has made things worse because it hurt me so much that they know that this is affecting me and still they can't control it. It's not just the fighting, the environment is stressful and it's stopping me from being able to do anything. I can't take a step forward because of them.

406,Why am I never listened to/taken seriously? But I HAVE to for others?,"Everyone in my family like loves to criticize each other, except me. I don’t see a need for it because no one is perfect &amp; who are you to tell someone their wronging anyways?
Anyways, since I’m very sensitive anyways, I don’t enjoy reminding others of what they haven’t done, which would be the cause of their future stress. But since I hear my family complaints daily, and a lot of them would be fixed by dedicating a bit of time to something, I feel the need to give them advice on what to do to fix their stress because I see the cause of it that I don’t think they can see. 

Example that just happened:

My mom was just getting upset with our new adopted dog because she was too excited for her to put her harness on her to go walk. My mom was becoming impatient and was like “Ugh! C’mon dog! Don’t you have to go pee?! Come here so I can put this on you!” (Not in aggression, but just like being impatient). So I told my mom that if she’s expecting the [untrained adopted] dog to listen to her, that she would need to take time to train her to listen I obey, because clearly she has not had any of that-the dog is constantly stressing my mom out with getting things on the counter &amp; what not. So I mean, I’m not wrong to tell her that she needs to train the dog if she expects her to listen, right?
Anyways, when I said that to my mom, she was like “Yeah well I haven’t had the time to.” (..we have been in quarantine, and she’s been working from home this whole year..) then she mumbles to herself &amp; changes the subject &amp; starts going for a walk with the dog.

I’m just so tired of this because I’m constantly nagged by her to do all of her chores, which I do, but then the second I criticize/give advise back, I’m immediately disregarded &amp; ignored, not taken seriously. And I know I’m not taken seriously because of the advice I give, it’s never taken! It just pisses me off now because my whole life (quiet shy kid) I’ve thoroughly listened &amp; obeyed to all tasks, and now that I’m old enough to let others know of things, I’m just ignored if I give my thoughts on something ? It’s just so messed up, and I don’t know what to do.

408,How do I stop feeling abnormal?,"I’ve been feeling pretty horrible these past few weeks.

I’m 30 and had to move home because of the pandemic and issues with my apartment. I’m not able to work currently because my jobs are closed.

I feel bad because it’s given me so much time to feel abnormal. I have a lot of mental illness that I am being treated for. I have social anxiety so I don’t have many friends. I was violently raped when I was 19 and haven’t dated or had sex since that event so I feel bad that all of my siblings are dating people and I’m not. I’ve struggled with really serious cutting and suicide attempts over the years. 

I see my therapist once a week.

I just feel so abnormal. It’s hard because my trauma makes me feel so different from others and my anxieties make it worse. I’m kind of a hermit at this point. I’m going back to school in the fall. Eventually, I’d like to get my own place again when I have money saved.

410,Vent: woes of people pleasing for autism,"21 F. So I'm becoming more and more convinced that some of my symptoms reflect autism.

I'm lucky that the field I'm working in is my special interest, so I feel happy I'm getting paid to do something that I could go on and on about.

But I feel this constant pull between wanting to focus on my career and being distracted by people pleasing.

I bend over backwards to do everything for people. I've recently realized that part of my self esteem or my purpose in life is to please others. I don't want to feel so intensely about this. 

I want to be able to say no to some things so I have more time to take care of myself, my illnesses and my goals. ( My handful of official diagnoses need regular maintenance outside of autism.) I always end up with two to three part time expectations on top of a full time thing.

I just feel like I'm so hardwired to want to make everyone happy. But I find situations where that's impossible too with a narcissistic mother. Like I know sensibly that it's unreal to juggle so many tasks and pleasing strong/difficult personalities, but I keep finding myself in these situations. I'll say no to one thing, finally feel relief, and then I'm there again because someone else needs help.

Like goodness. I need help and I need to pay attention to that."

I sometimes think of ways to hurt people. It can be and oftentimes is because they’ve done something to piss me off, but sometimes it can be for no reason and I just don’t like their face or something they said or did or a noise they made. 
I think of stabbing them in the eye with a knife, crushing their chest with a large rock or whatever and sometimes even laugh about it. I also laugh if I hear or read about someone doing something violent to younger people since they can be annoying as fuck. If I say something and people don’t laugh, I get mad and think of ways to hurt them as well. 

I wrote a horror story for a school project and when the clown in my story cut the little girls head off I nearly burst out in laughter. 

Someone in my class was playing a video about Jack the Ripper and I laughed again. The thing about him cutting their guts is disgusting though, but I’m kind of inspired by him and other serial killers. The ones that put people in acid seem cool and if I found out how I could do that I think I might try and do something about it. 

I feel I have some OCD since I sometimes force myself to do something a specific number of times before I stop doing it, or lay something in a specific position on e.g. the floor. I don’t want everything to be clean all the time though and isn’t that what OCD is? Something is wrong with me."
413,Is anyone else suffering mentally from isolation?,"I am writing this post to share my experience with anxiety/mental health problems in case it helps anyone else.

Ever since COVID 19 put us all in isolation, I have been studying from home every day (am a science student), and haven't been working on my weekends like I normally do. So I basically haven't left my house for months, and have probably overall been doing a lot less exercise and a lot less of the usual stuff in my daily routine. About a month ago I started getting dizziness every night, then I started getting these weird 'episodes' I'll call them when I would feel my heart doing something weird (palpitations) and then I would feel weird other sensations (like fingers tingling, my mouth was dry and numb, just to name a few) and after this happened 3 times I thought I was going to have a heart attack or something and couldn't get to sleep, I went to the ER at like 12:30 am in the morning. Basically they checked me out and found nothing was wrong, except for having a resting heart rate at 130 bpm. Anyway, all this weird shit has been going on for weeks, I can't sleep for fear, I can't concentrate and keep worrying I am going to pass out or have a stroke or something. So far I have had multiple blood tests, an MRI on my brain, a chest x-ray, and an ECG, all showing nothing significant. I am also mostly pretty health too,  I never smoke, I'm not overweight, I haven't been that stressed lately (other than feeling concerned about my health and not being able to sleep for the reasons described) and I basically never drink, I am also pretty young. I have seen a few different doctors and basically they all seem to think this is all psychological. Up until now, I was in denial, this whole thing has been embarrassing and not at all like my usual self.  One of the GP doctors gave me a bit of crap for going to the ER, I have only gone to the ER one other time in my life tho, which was because I genuinely did have appendicitis. I kept thinking something physical has to be wrong with me because I wasn't stressed or worried before the symptoms came on.  I have never had this happen to me before, and pretty much have never felt this much fear about my health, I have never had a panic attack before either. Anyway, I couldn't believe up until basically right now as I am writing this post but I finally have accepted this whole thing has to be psychological, even though it's all been happening without my being particularly more stressed than usual, which has made it hard to believe, especially since my physical symptoms are very real.  There have been other times in my life that was more stressful and in which  I think I would have had a valid reason for having some kind of mental breakdown (like when my Mum died) but that didn't happen then.

I am putting all this stuff down to the fact that my daily routine has changed significantly, I haven't been sleeping the same, or doing as much exercise or socializing as much ever since being in isolation.  But honestly, I am not even normally a very social person,  I am normally more introverted. Anyway here's apparently some of the crazy physical symptoms I have personally experienced, and is a result apparently from my poor psychological health right now. Some of these symptoms have happened at times when I felt that I was perfectly relaxed, and not stressed really at all, so here goes:

\- tingling in hands/feet/actually pretty much anyway on your body

\- heart palpitations

\-feeling like your head /or the entire body is vibrating/moving

\- feeling your pulse, having a forceful heartbeat, feeling it make your whole body move

\-feeling like your going to faint/feeling lightheaded

\- chest pain

\- buzzing in your ear

\- feeling like your face /nose is being squeezed

\- numbness in my mouth

\- back pain/back twitching painfully

\- muscle twitches, face, back of the neck, fingers, sometimes legs

\- feeling like your heart is fluttering/weird sensations that I can't even describe properly

\- rapid heart rate, slow heart rate sometimes?

\- feeling like my neck and face is swollen sometimes, sometimes stiff

\- feeling like my head is stiff, as the bones in my neck/head are grinding or cracking weirdly

\- pain in shoulders

\-the worst one for me, feeling randomly like your falling or going down in an elevator

\- pressure on my teeth

&amp;#x200B;

That is just some of the weird shit that has happened to me."
414,"I don't know if I like my psychologist or not, just cause its currently over the phone appointments","My doctor has referred me to a psychologist, I've been seeing this psychologist for 12 weeks now with an appointment every 2 weeks.  It just feels like my psychologist just doesn't listen to me, I'm not sure like i said if its cause its over the phone. 

It's for a concussion where I am having an extremely difficult time controlling my mood, concentration and attention span.  

Additionally over the phone I just don't feel confident in saying whats wrong out loud in case my neighbours or parents hear it.  I understand this is something that can have a significant affect on my progress with the psychologist. I just don't know what to do or say."
415,Testing poison effects on my own right now,"May kill me, likely will not. Is this some kind of selfharm or why am I doing this?"
416,Lost 2 of my best friends and now I don't want to spend time with anyone.,"I dont know if anyone else feels like this but I really struggle to connect and feel comfortable around people, I've tried to see people on a regular basis to try and get that connection but it never happens and feels like a task. 

Background on what happened If interested: I had two best friends (they aren't friends with each other) friend one ghosted me for a second time for and full year again, I cant put myself through it again, been friends with him for 17 years. We had gone through so much together even got our own sense of humour probably seemed to other people we were speaking another language. Friend two, friends for 11 years couldn't get it in his head that there wasn't a chance of a relationship with me and it would be a constant cycle no matter how clear I made it. He started to shout at me on nights out in front of people sometimes if a guy spoke to me or he got something in his head, even though I've been in a relationship for 15 years.. I gave him numerous chances to see a counsellor and sort out what is going on with him which I think was a bit of narrsasisim, low self esteem and delusion, so I had to cut that off. 

With both of these friendships I had such a laugh not fake laughing which I find myself doing around most other people and I could just pop over to friend 2's house and sit and chill whilst he played computer games it just felt like family but I actually also feel uncomfortable around my family so naturally I'd spend time with those two more than family.

Just after we stopped speaking I found out I'm pregnant and now I just feel down and lonely, and not sure what to do. I keep meeting up with friends but I can't wait to get away from them and it is getting me down feeling that way, I just want that feeling I got around those other two friends where I felt completely comfortable and had such a good time. Anyone else like this?"

I've never been on meds my parents said I didn't need them. My parents often lie and are rather manipulative to me. so I'm wondering if I even have adhd/odd. How do I check??

After that I started having psychotic symptoms and eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar/depressive (different doctors keep changing it). So, psychosis was my life for a few years.

I was eventually diagnosed with cPTSD. I have been in remission from schizoaffective for about two years but my cPTSD is hitting me extremely hard, harder than when I was depressed or psychotic.

420,BPD Confessions,"Hi. Very new to Reddit. Tried the Tumblr thing for awhile but it basically became a platform to post my nudes when I was sad.. and if that’s not an introduction to the world of BPD then I have no idea what is. 

I really wanted a place where I could confess and discuss my life choices. I’ve heard there are tons of trolls on Reddit so I’m excited to cry over anything bad that is said towards these, but very relieved that I’m not alone and can discuss something that’s a lot more common than I realized. 

I’m a 22 year old Star Wars Enthusiast. Dog mom. Bisexual. I suffer from BPD, Anxiety, and Depression. Specifically? Panic attacks, manic episodes, impulsivity, lying, erratic sexual behavior, memory loss, suicidal ideation, a history of self harm, trauma induced episodes, crying spells, heightening thoughts of spontaneous wants and desires.. honestly? So much more but it’s too much to list in one post.

My plan is to post at least once a day to seek out advice and support in the mental health community. I’ve been feeling very alone and it’s hard to find any kind of common ground with others who do not suffer from BPD. So.. hi. This is me."

I get so extremely distraught when I see an animal on the street, I rescued a dog who was injured last year and ended up having to have her put down which absolutely destroyed me, my cat has a scary disease and was sick last November and I was convinced he was going to die (it’s serious) and I’m still feeling the effects from it, and they’re bad. Every time I imagine my cats dying I get a horrible pain in my whole body, bad anxiety, and absolute devastation rushes over me. I can’t deal with it and need help.

I have been on these for a long time, benzo for the longest (15yrs on/off)

To help me with symptoms I have: 
-melatonin/passiflora/valerian/California poppy tablets

423,I don't trust my psychologist,"I've been having minor hallucinations (like floating dots, walls and the ceiling ""breathing"", voices saying stuff I can't make out/making sounds like whines or something, shadows moving in the corner of my eye, etc.), paranoia and sensory issues (rough material and tight clothing, textures in food, loud or weird sounds, certain flavors, smells, textures, etc. bother me a lot) for pretty much as long as I remember (so since I was like 4 idk) and I have mentioned none of them to my psychologist because I don't really trust her. She knows about my social anxiety and depression but not about the things that have been bothering me for longer than those (the things she knows about started around when I was maybe 8 or 9) and I'm freaked out that she'll hospitalize me because I'm underage and I could do nothing about it. It's not like I'm a danger to others or myself but I just don't trust her (I sometimes freak out when people touch me because the touch lingers and makes my chest tight with anxiety but I usually just push people away and snap at them)

424,Possible Dissassotiation??,"I've had depression and Adult-Child Syndrome my whole life and I'm managing it decently, but theres been something on my mind.

I frequently have moments where my entire body locks up, my vision goes completely fucky and I can't move or respond properly for a few seconds or minutes. If it try to speak it's usually a bit slurred or stilted and takes a lot of effort. I can bring myself out of it by talking to myself internally, but I often just let it pass. I don't feel entirely disconnected, but theres a part of it. I become more calm and relaxed when it happens, despite what's actually happening. It happens in conversation or when I'm working and it's never been a full issue.

More or less I'm just confused as to why it keeps happening or if it's a symptom of something else. It's been happening for around 9 years now and I'd just like to know if this is normal or whether it's a cause for concern."
425,Social Disorder? Help?, Okay so I know I’m gonna tell my doctor about it but it’s been bugging me for a while. I told my therapist about it but for a while (even before my meds) I have a hard time reading and assessing situations. And I kinda don’t know how to feel when I’m in trouble or someone is mad at me or comes to me venting. I know usually people would feel remorse but usually I just kinda act on what I’m feeling and sometimes it’s genuinely me not knowing how to respond or what to say. And it usually winds me up in more trouble. And I come off as indifferent when I’m not trying to but people come to me sometimes woth things and I just kinda feel nothing and sometimes I don’t know what to say or how to feel and I just have a hard time picking up on social cues or understanding what I did was wrong. Like my mom will ne yelling at me and I’ll be staring blankly at her and she gets more mad and yells at me all ‘why are you just staring at me!? You don’t have anything to say!?’ And gets more angry. Or like. Someome woll tell me something important and then I can’t seem to understand the importance of it and my brain will wander to my own things and I have a hard time prioritizing things from importance to non importance. I also have a hard time feeling things? Someone will come to me and tell me what I did hurt them and I feel nothing about it? I don’t feel guilt I mostly feel confusion. Or they’ll vent to me and I don’t feel empathy for them? I just don’t know what to do. Any advice in what this could mean? I don’t want a diagnosis but I don’t see my doctor until July and it’s killing me. I tend to struggle with understanding context and things and I feel overall lost a lot of the time. Its really hard for me to tell whats appropriate to say and when its appropriate to say things and it ends me up in the hot seat a lot.
426,I'm losing it but I feel incapable of reaching out,"I'm a couple months past a suicide attempt, I've been having this mental health decline for around 8 months now, I've been constantly paranoid, I'm constantly having some sort of hallucination, my brain is so muddled I can barely talk, I've been sleeping more than I'm awake but my dreams are so fucked that I'm terrified every time I lie down, I'm either completely numb or I have so much rage and despair bubbling beneath the surface that I feel like I'm on the verge of doing something bad, I haven't got any drive to do anything, I haven't looked at my uni work in weeks and when I do the words mean nothing to me and I can't process any information, my body feels so exhausted and I'm in constant pain but I don't know why, I'm 19 and healthy but every movement causes my whole body to ache, I barely know where I am and I don't know who I am, I can't feel empathy anymore and everything feels incredibly disconnected and confusing. I don't see myself in the mirror, my self care is nonexistent. I'm under a somewhat careful watch from my parents and medical team following my suicide attempt, they're all aware that my symptoms are getting worse but there isn't anything they can do. I haven't spoken to any friends or anyone about any of this, I don't feel capable of doing so and I know that I would be burdening them with information that they can't do anything about. I'm not sure where to go from here, my psych ward stay did nothing other than make my paranoia skyrocket, my medications are doing fuck all and increasing my doses does nothing. I feel like I'm going to be trapped in this state until I eventually succeed in suicide, but another attempt would destroy my family. I wish deeply that assisted suicide was legal for those with chronic severe mental health issues who are treatment resistant because this is just fucked, I shouldn't be forced to live a life full of waking nightmares that I can only escape by drinking myself unconcious."
427,Feeling too low,"Noone is actually there to hear from me!
I feel really down, all i do is play few games and look series whole day and night.
Ny gitlfriend broke up with me because of me. But i love her. Everything has been too hard lately.
I just wish... Idk....feels so blank"
428,How could I help my friend deal with me?,"I have a lot of sporadic mood swings and a bad habit of talking to my friend during them. i’ve tried to stop talking about my emotions and all that, but I always do it impulsively and I feel really bad. I’m putting reminders on my skin like “don’t talk” and “youre fine” to see if I can just not talk about it. I’d rather bottle it up then bring my friend down with me; I truly think I’m hurting them and I feel really guilty"
429,My mood changes so quickly is this normal? Why am I always in a bad mood ?,"Can someone please tell me if this normal?? I’ll be talking to someone and we’re having a normal conversation and Im enjoying the convo then a second later it’s like a switch just goes off in my brain and I start feeling angry and irritated then I start to yell and get mad, I feel like such a bad person because they aren’t even do anything wrong and they shouldn’t have to put up with that. Im always feeling so shitty and down but I don’t know why"
430,I constantly lose motivation and interest in my hobbies,"I really like drawing, watching TV shows and movies, reading books and playing video games (so I guess pretty generic stuff). But I can't do any of those things for too long or I lose interest. I want to get better at drawing, but I can't motive myself to draw every day or even once a week. 
I love playing video games, but if I play everyday or for too long at a time, I start to dislike it and I'm really tired of it.
It's really annoying, because I can draw everyday for a month and be really happy and motivated and than lose interest in one night and don't draw for another couple of months.
Is this normal? Because I don't feel like it is.
I have a lot of problems with motivating myself, so maybe someone has a similar problem and has a solution?"
431,"Not being able to see my partner due to COVID takes a huge toll on me, is this normal?","I haven't seen him in almost 4 months and I am not sure when I will be able to (he is from Australia and they prolonged the travel ban, I am in Denmark). Every bad news connected to our case put me in the worst state, where I cannot even contain myself and have self harming thoughts. I've been through things in my life and didn't expect this to hit me so hard... Nothing makes sense anymore and the thought of not seeing him for another 3 months literally makes me not want to wake up. Do you think it's normal?"
432,Why do I get sad when my mum gets angry?,"I don't know which other subreddit is more appropriate for this question but I just want to know why I feel like crying everytime my mum gets mildly annoyed at me. Just today she berated me for staying up until almost 3 a.m. but I was doing homework and finally feeling productive and I thought she wouldn't care. I started tearing up and had a viscerally heart wrenching reaction to my mum scolding me for not going to bed (I am 18 btw and she has never cared before). 

Why did I cry when my mum scolded me?"
433,Sick of letting my boyfriend down,"I'm so useless and pathetic. My money is a disaster, I have no job and my mental health is stopping me from doing anything with my life. I honestly mess everything up and I can't express how angry I am at myself all the time because I'm so useless.

My boyfriend however is the complete opposite, he's so capable and amazing. If something needs doing, even if it's hard or difficult he just does it and gets on with things. He suffers from anxiety and has his own struggles like everyone does yet he copes so well.

It's killing me that he tries so hard all the time and I feel like I'm just laying back and failing at everything. I feel like I should leave him bevause I'm sick of feeling like a blooming chain wrapped round his ankles stopping him from spreading his wings. I can't even drive, I'm too scared to learn and I have nothing. We're never going to get a place together, I'm gonna live with my parents forever or at least till I run away and become homeless. I'm done with it all. Depression is hard enough as it is but how am I supposed to cope when everything I do effects this wonderful person who I love so much and loves me.

Just a rant, I don't know. The only person I can talk to is him so I'm stuck"
434,I feel so alone,"I’m moving out in to a double room in shared accommodation, I’m in the middle of a break up, I don’t have any friends really and my depression and anxiety is at an all time high. 

I can’t get over the fact I have to leave my dog behind as I’m moving out of family home which is way too toxic. 

My dog is my everything and to not be able to see him everyday the thought of it makes me feel sick. 

I feel so alone in the workd and wish I had somebody to tell me what to do."
435,Anger issues and living with a ticking time bomb.,"I (M25) live with my partner (M24). For years he's always been quick to lose control of his emotions.

He gets very nasty and can be very self centered. He's aware to what extent I don't know but his anger does come with feelings of guilt. He talks about being not liking being angry and doesn't feel like that's him, it's almost to him, a separate person. 

It's not easy in the U.K talking to G.P's to evaluate his mental health. I haven't found a stable source that I can easily talk to and that is willing to listen or provide real help.

He's co-dependent and suffers with social anxiety. Trying to get help while it seems I'm doing most of the work, doesn't come off great to a professional. 

I live in a block of flats. My neighbor has been very loud with his music and his car which angers my partner to no end. He's had a spat with a different neighbor due to his outbursts directed at the floor which is difficult because it's two adjoining flats. 

He's broken my phone buzzer and smashed many things as well as punched holes in the walls. I am struggling with my own mental health after losing my birth mum to suicide last year as well as a friend. But he can't communicate with me about it because it makes him feel uncomfortable to talk about difficult things.

I was adopted at a young age, my birth mum was a heroin addict. My adoptive family are very clueless and old school when it comes to addressing real issues.

He's fully addicted to smoking weed and will not let himself run out. (if he gets low on weed he is even more quick to temper and it's just a major dependency that I escaped from in my teenage years, but he's very much controlled by it).

I've been trying to diffuse the situations we get in but I have lost my patience (which I have an abnormal amount of) . It's difficult to be calm and helpful when he really knows the way to bring out a rise in me. I feel very disrespected by his behavior and the way he treats my stuff. I am the sole tenant in the flat, whereas he has flitted about here and there, not being comfortable anywhere he goes. The last time he made his way here just before lock down in the U.K, it was by putting me in a position where I had to ""rescue"" him from the situation he's in. Basically he was begging to come back here.

He's really not coping well with living in a city and prefers wide open spaces and lots of woodland (which is of course normal and healthy). But I've always been one to just adapt to each situation and focus on what matters, like staying healthy, exercising and being grateful for everything I do have. 

It's so much harder to stay positive myself while also being unemployed and not having anyone I know in the area apart from a few neighbors who I try to shield against this situation. It's very difficult to make friends, especially as to the outside world, my partner comes across in such a bad way.

I've heard passing homophobic comments and my partner doesn't realize how much attention and fear he's bringing into my space. I get panic attacks when he loses control and it's hard to communicate with him and other people when my hearts racing 100mph and I can't breathe properly.

He thinks that by not standing up for myself when it comes to noise, that I'm letting people bully me. I don't get as worked up about it as he does. I was always taught that if someone is trying to antagonize  you, the worst thing to do is make them know you're antagonized because that leaves you open to more abuse, I've been told this certain individual is difficult and will argue. Being gay also makes it harder to deal with hetero men twice my size because I'm fully intimidated by them. It's not that I'm a weak individual, I just prefer to keep a low profile and avoid confrontation. Like I said the noise doesn't bother me as much as my partner losing his temper does. He hears a noise and then looks at me with great expectation that it's my responsibility to make other people be quiet. I know what people can be like and I don't want to make my life harder by letting someone in to my mental space, giving them more cause to antagonize. I don't trust that my response would ""make"" someone be quieter.

It's 100x better to not let it affect me than to respond like my partner does.

I have been aware that people on the spectrum get very anxious and angry with excessive stimuli. He has mentioned how he feels sick and very anxious when it comes to noise. With his social anxiety and all the other issues I have wondered if he does have an underlying condition but that's not something a doctor is willing to go through with us. I have mentioned it a few times and it's almost like it's being scoffed at.

I just want to find out if there's any free therapists in the south west (Plymouth) that would be willing to talk to him or both of us. I'm really losing any sense of order and feel deeply troubled and suicidal (because of my own issues and the fact it's being exacerbated by his behavior).

I really worry for him and we're sort of stuck together with no financial freedom to move or find a nicer place to live (or pay for any form of help).

Kindest regards."
436,Ranting to u random strangers,"Hi, I am a 16 year old boy. I am scared about the future, I hear people killing themselves and nowadays, I have become insensitive to it, it feels normal to me. I always have these impulsive thoughts about me making the leap of faith from the balcony and just ending it. I don’t even have a bad life, I have a family, I have friends (tried speaking to them about myself, but that just doesn’t work). I am very introverted and I am scared about how I will function in the future, when I am alone. I am scared to speak to people about this because I am scared people will think I am attention seeking, in a way I am through this post. I have never gotten attention, sympathy, empathy of anyone. No one has ever gone out of their way to do anything for me, while I always try my best to do what I can for them. When I speak, I always mess up, my socials skills are so bad and I am so weird. One of my closest friends, who I spoke to, got tired of my rants and my stupidity that she just stopped speaking to me. I am scared people will leave me if I reveal myself a bit. I don’t want to go to my school counselor or a therapist because for them, I am one more patient, I am no ones priority. I am sorry for this rant, I hope this is read by the right people. Don’t mind my English."
437,should i hit send &amp; ask for help?,"I want to reach out for help but feel scared

i have this note typed out on my phone 

""im sorry for offloading my feelings like this, especially in the early hours of the morning! ive been feeling very mentally unstable the last few days &amp; i dont know how else to ask for help, every other time ive seemingly tried to explain my serious feelings to others in the past, it has left me feeling unheard and miserable because of a seemingly impossible ability for me to maintain healthy relationships in which other actually might want to stick around &amp; im spiralling in my own negative thoughts at the moment &amp; i dont know what else to do bc you seem to have you're own worries &amp; problems but i dont know who else to talk to:/""

but the person who i want to message also has heaps going on in their own life &amp; i dont want to add to their stress or feel like im just doing it for the attention..

should i hit send? every other time ive trying to reach out for help its ended badly.."
438,Breakdown about language,"Using a throwaway. Whenever someone brings up language (syntax, grammar, pronounciation, accent, tone) I get majorly uncomfortable and I feel a anxious breakdown coming. 

I’ve had arguments with parents about speaking my native language, and (not going into detail) I’ve felt too anxious speaking it.

Last night I had a mental breakdown when I had a completely normal conversation with my dad about the origin of different languages and the development of a person’s ability to speak languages. 

After that conversation, I started crying uncontrollably and hyperventilating. I then curled into a ball and screamed and cried for about 30 minutes, and I didn’t have the will to move. After, I pulled myself together and went about my night. Is this normal?"
439,How to deal with paranoia?,"So I have a problem that has gotten worse recently where I get paranoid and put myself at the center of situations at which I know I am not a factor. For example, I recently have been thinking a lot and researching jealousy in relationships. This morning someone on Twitter I follow was talking about it and I started thinking something like ""oh the world is so connected I bet God brought us together"". And this type of shit happens a lot. Where I get feelings of ""synchronicity"" where I feel like I am having a larger impact on the universe than I know I really am. Rationally I know it's not true, but I keep having this happen and it is scary/bothering me.

Or another example is like I see my girlfriend listening to music on Spotify and think she is thinking of me when she listens to music. Like she listens to a song about cheating and I think she's gonna cheat on me. Or she listens to love songs and I imagine her thinking about me. How to I break this pattern?"
440,I dont know whats going on with me i was fine till Sunday,"I've working from home since March, given the current coronavirus situation, i live with my family so i dont feel alone plus they help me cooking or doing other house related things. Everything was ok, maybe a little boring at times but nothing serious. On Sunday i smoked a little weed at night (i do this most nights before going to bed, i like it and makes tv more fun) but suddenly i couldn't sleep. I spent the whole night staring a t the celling thinking how hard is to sleep and started feeling dread over the idea of no sleeping again. I finally was able to sleep around 5am, have to get up at 8 and started working. Ever since that i been feeling awful (emotionaly) and i dont know why. My family is good, work is fine and i chat with friends every now and then, but i cant shake this dread felling, I want to cry all the time and im angry without any reason. Dont know what to do and started to worring that this feeling wont go away. Please any help is welcome, at the moment we are not allowed to leave home so going to a specialist is out of the question. I just want to feel happy and normal again, i hate the anguish and dreadful feeling."
441,Can people become an emotional trigger?,"Sorry if you think “trigger” is a cringe word or whatever, but I’m always put into a state of distress when a certain group of people are around. I constantly think of what could go wrong, as past visits from them are primarily negative. I’ve had my first panic attack from being around them, and one during each visit since, as well as being physically harmed before.  Whenever they visit I just stay in my room, but I’m constantly anxious and scared. I’m scared to bring this up to anyone, as they are technically family, and I can’t rip them from my sister and parents."
442,A mini victory?,"Currently there's some thunder but my windows still open. If it gets closer maybe i'll have to close it but I still feel proud.

One of my first and worst panic attacks was because of a thunderstorm. It was incredibly close and the noise was almost deafening. It was setting off car alarms from the force. I remember my window was open but I felt paralysed, way too terrified to go near it to close it, I was curled under my duvet with my fingers in my ears but it was still so loud. I was crying, hyperventilating and my limbs started tingling. That was about 5 years ago and it's still one of the worst ones I've ever had. I'm lucky that my panic attacks are usually quite minor compared to what some people experience."
443,My girlfriend “wants a break”,So today my girlfriend told me she wants a break and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been suicidal for a long time and she was the only one there for me and I just feel lost now and alone. She claimed it was for the both of us even though it was obviously for her and I’m really upset because I know my mental health pushed her away and I feel undeserving of anything now.
444,Friends - Comparison is the thief of joy,"I've been caught in a circle of convincing myself I have no friends and that nobody likes me (when I know that, in fact, I do have friends). 

I have been comparing my ""closeness"" to my friends with that of, say, how close another friend of mine is to her friends (e.g ""she has more best friends"" ""she is closer to her friends"" ""I wish I had as many girlfriends as her"" ""I wish people liked me as much"" etc). 

If any of my friends arrange to meet up without me the blood drains from my face and I feel utterly ashamed, left out, hated. 

A friend of mine received a text recently from another friend of ours and all I could think was ""why did she think to text her instead of me?"" ""Does this mean she likes her more?"". 

It's ridiculous because other people are entitled to see and text whoever they wish. 

These constant negative thoughts and comparisons are impacting my life to the point that I can barely function. 

I have also had an old childhood friend, whom I haven't spoken to in a number of years, make regular appearances in my dreams and find I'm comparing myself to her ""friends"" situation also (""she has more friends than me"") and I am finding it hard to forgive myself for us not being friends anymore (a mistake I made when I was 18 - this is now nearly 10 years later). 

Does anyone have any suggestions on books / YouTube videos/ websites I can research to help me overcome this strange obsession? My mental health is suffering as a result and I'm sick of it. 

Any help welcome."
445,App: Check on me,"One of the things I really struggle with is vulnerability and opening up to my friends and family. I know that there’s people around me who would check on me if I reached out and said I needed help, but I feel guilty and don’t want to burden them with my on and off fluctuations. I always assume they’re busy dealing with their own shit. 

But I just had an idea for an app that I know i would definitely use. The app would have a place to check in for my daily mental health (maybe rate my emotions, have I eaten? Have I slept enough?) and I would be able to share this check in status with my friends. I would be able to see their check ins too so that if I was feeling stable on a given day and my friend wasn’t, I could reach out to them (and they could do the same for me on my rough days). Doing this would be less scary than overthinking what text i want to send to a friend when I need some support and would also probably set up a stronger connection between my support group. 

I have no coding experience though so if anyone makes apps and wants to pick up this idea, please let me know."
446,"Is it wrong for me to be desperate for a diagnosis, just so I have a reason that I am the way I am?","Is it wrong for me to be desperate for a diagnosis, just so I have a reason that I am the way I am?

I just want to be able to say ""I have this or that"""
447,It is very difficult to go to a job I no longer love. Anyone else?,"I use to love my job. I use to wake up excited to go to work. Since the corona virus shut us down for a while, I was able to slip into a depression during my time of reflection in lockdown. I realized how meaningless my job is. It doesn’t matter how hard I work, it makes no difference. It is a dead end job. It might actually be keeping me back in life. 

And then recently, I had a supervisor mad about his own personal life go off on me. He approached me in the break room and LET ME HAVE IT over something he THOUGHT I did. I didn’t. But I didn’t get a chance to say so. 

I guess my boss is in agreement with my supervisor without even talking to me. 

I’m not mad at my coworker who “bad mouthed” me because I’m suppose to trust my higher ups to talk with me/DO THEIR JOB before reacting. 

But it has absolutely killed the very last bit of momentum I had to keep going.  

Being at work now is anxiety inducing. Increasingly depressing. And I fantasize about chucking my apron into someone’s face and running out the door. 

Hoooowww do we get through hating our job 

(Is the economy in my small town sucks for getting a different job right now)"
448,Sliding farther into depression,"Hey, I dont really know where Im going with this but wanted to reach out somewhere. 

Over the past couple months, Ive really been noticing myself slide into anxiety and depression. Not like, the sad stereotypical depression. Its more like listlessness, no energy, never excited for anything anymore. And then my anxiety comes and makes it so I dont even know how to function around people anymore. 

Ive always had anxiety but never to this extent and I really dont know whats wrong with me or how to get out of it.  Everyday feels a little bit harder to wake up and get moving. Should I see a doctor?"
449,My anger is getting out of hand and I need advice,"I'm a generally short tempered person but I manage it well enough. Especially with my significant other whom I love immensely. I never used to take any anger out at him and always had been extremely patient with him but lately I've been very snappy and anger prone. 

I feel I'm treating him badly now. I get angry at him for the smallest things and for me today was the last straw when I snapped at him when he was just trying to help me out. I've been losing my temper with others too but I feel most terrible about treating my s/o badly. 

How can I control my anger? I want to get to the bottom of the reason why I'm acting like this. How can I feel better and be a better person to others in my life?"
450,Mental,"What’s a flair ^

Growing up around drama and constant yelling and fighting I’ve realized I have had enough of it, Constant talking shit behind my back 
That I’m useless that I’m a headache that I’m a nobody 
If it wasn’t for my dog I would have slit my own throat a long time ago 
I just wanna move away &amp; start a family of my own

451,IM MAKING PROGRESS,"usually when i do something that isn’t apart of my daily routine i get really nervous idk why BUT TODAY i went out of town for the first time in awhile AND I WAS OKAY like i enjoyed it! i remember going there around a year ago when. i was in this really deep hole n the whole time i felt so nervous, it feels like i was gonna throw up BUT NOW I ENJOY IT! LIKE IM ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD AND IM MAKING PROGRESS!!

ik this isn’t that interesting but i feel really proud of myself for the first time in a long time n i didnt know who to share it w :)"
452,How can I best support my spouse during depressive episodes?,When my spouse has depressive episodes they end up in bed for days and are totally out of it when they are awake. Their psychiatrist sucks and I haven’t been able to find a new one for them that is taking new patients. Any advice as to how I can be helpful when this happens?
453,Is There Something Wrong with Me?,"For background, growing up, I had a rough childhood emotionally. I used to be physically abused too, not anymore. I would be gaslighted a lot, and manipulated. There was a lot of screaming and anger. No stability or consistency. 

I have developed severe trust issues, and can’t trust anybody. I can’t open up to anyone emotionally, and I have an abandonment fear. And when it’s triggered, I get anxiety attacks. My hands will start shaking and stuff. And I’ll start having nightmares of being abandoned. Sometimes if I feel like somebody is trying to hurt me/has hurt me, I’ll distance myself. Sometimes I’ll even treat them poorly if I feel like they don’t care, or are gonna hurt me.But I don’t want to be a bad person, it just kinda happens, and I always feel guilty after. One time I treated my friend poorly because my one other friend was treating me poorly. And I felt bad.

I have a lot of built up anger, and I just contain it all in. I stay mad/sad for hours. Sometimes when I get super mad, I’ll pinch myself, and have thoughts of punching people, as bad as that sounds. And I can mad at people over little things, but it depends. Like I’m still mad at this one girl for correcting me.  I’m still mad over that 6 months later, I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I can be happy with people, but if I feel like they hurt me, I can like them, but I may start to not like them again if I think about what they did in the past or something. 

At one point of time, my self-esteem was horrendous, I used to call myself stupid, worthless, etc, and be upset every day. I’m not really like that anymore. But sometimes my self-esteem isn’t really good at all. Sometimes I start thinking about how I may not be good enough for certain things, or blame myself. Sometimes I can get sad out of nowhere. I’ll start thinking of sad stuff like death, and start crying, but sometimes this only just last days. Like I only feel empty/sad for days. Usually something triggers it. Sometimes I feel empty a lot, but maybe I’m just bored lol.

I have Asperger’s, so that already comes with some of its struggles. I get anxiety a lot. Over little things, but I don’t know if I have other problems too. And this may sound stupid, but that’s what I’m worried about. Having other problems. I’m still fairly young, and I can’t really get a therapist on my own"
454,Is life worth living?,"I used to suffer from depression and was suicidal. I did not feel alive and I wanted to die. I was empty. It was like I was watching my life unfold before me in a third person perspective. I was sitting inside my skull with my brain on auto pilot, unable to control what I do and feeling despair over my failures. I tried to cut my arm till I bled to death once and I overdosed on anti depressants the other time. 

In this period, I found that solving coding problems online helped in distracting myself from the unpleasant thoughts. I lived my next two years drinking coffee, listening to music and coding. I landed a job in Microsoft and now I'm waiting for my first day in the office. 

All set right? Successfully beat depression and got my shit together? 
Nope. 

I don't think I can say this to someone in person, especially to someone I know. So I'll get this off my chest. For years during my childhood, my cousin sister who was around 20 at that time used to make me touch her private parts. She did that everyday. Took me to a room, took of her clothes and made me touch her. I don't want to go into the details but it was essentially her using me as a toy. 

That messed with my mind. Every now and then I used to have intrusive thoughts which disgust me and make me uncomfortable, to the point where I'm unable to talk to girls normally. That combined with educational pressure to get into the best universities slowly started to kill me from the inside. And once I actually got into one of the top universities, I exploded. Everyone around me was performing better than me at studies and I eventually decided to kill myself. Then, as I mentioned at the beginning, I ""pulled myself together"".

During my depressed phase, my parents weren't very helpful. They had no knowledge of how to deal with a depressed child. I remeber this one day vividly when I was crying and my dad said "" Stop crying and man up"". 

After that incident I was never able to accept my parents. Everything they did seemed fake. 

My dad is very forceful and wants me to things he thinks are right for me. Before depression struck me, he used to openly force me to do things I didn't want to. Now he harasses me by pestering me everyday to do what he wants me to do. I hated him and always will. 

Now everything seems empty once again. I don't feel a sense of accomplishment or self worth. I just do things. I survive. It's been like this for a couple of months, since the corona thing blew up. Now I'm stuck in my house with my parents and my cousin sister who abused me. 

With every passing day slowly driving more and more into 
insanity and hopelessness, I've gone into auto pilot again. 

Why do I have to live. I honestly don't think I'll ever be alright. It's been around 7 years and my view of the world has only gotten bleaker. I don't mind powering through another day, only to lay in my bed at night and contemplate why I have to keep on doing this till I die naturally. But I'd be the happiest person not alive if I just died."
455,Nobody cares for me! So I decided to take care of myself.,I thought I should take up the opportunity to care for myself.
456,"If it's just going to make one feel bad as opposed to educating us, what is the point of staying in school?","I have two more years. Then there's uni, probably three years of an acting course. I really don't know. I also want to be a writer. But no one ever got cast in a tv show etc. or published a book because they had a diploma. my main problem is maths. I know it's supposed to help you with ""critical thinking"" and ""problem-solving skills"" but since when was that the reason we're taught it? We're only taught so we can pass an exam and move on to the next year. You either pass and move on or you fail and get chucked out (or something), unless there's a social hierarchy in your school and the cool, smart ones get special treatment. school is just kind of depressing."
457,I made a counseling appointment for the first time and I sobbed afterwards. Why?,"I'm not an open person by any means and for the first 19 years of my life never opened up to anyone. I figured I'd try therapy and I gave a counselor a call to schedule an appointment. Literally just talking logistics and I started crying, I kept it together because I didn't want to seem weird, but after we hung up I just bawled. Why? I didn't even talk about any feelings or anything like that"
458,Is it a memory?," 

How do I tell if I(F23) uncovered a memory?

I have always had really bad reactions while being held down or confined, and never really knew why. I have terrible anxiety and depression. I recently have been told about a situation where someone who has been very close to me/ my family my whole life has assaulted a young girl.

Well last night while in a situation where I had someone on me (consensual of course) and I completely freaked out and had a flash of a memory with this person. How do I know if it was really a memory or am I just nervous because learning of this man assaulting the young girl has upset me so bad?"
459,Looking for a second opinion on whether I have OCD,"First off, I haven't seen a psychiatrist, so this is mainly on my own assessment, and I'm looking on an outside perspective on this. This post is less of an ""I need help"", and more just a curiosity of mine.

Anyway, since I was a kid I've had these, well, the best way I could describe it is compulsions, where for example I'm walking on a side walk, and I notice that the top of my left foot is touching a crack, and I end up trying to walk where my right foot touches the next crack, and so on so forth. Kinda like I need for things to be even, and if I'm paying attention to how I walk, I just end up doing this for the rest of my walk. If I clench a muscle on my right side, I feel the need to do so on my left side.

This hasn't effected my daily life in any serious ways, just more of an annoyance, but sometimes I do notice when I'm conscious about it, that I need to do it, I can resist it, but it's like an itch that needs to be scratched, it's present, and I'm aware that I want to scratch it. I don't have many issues with messes, but if I am going to order something up, I tend to like symmetry a lot. Tbh this could just be that I like symmetry, and not OCD, but idk. 

When I read a text on my computer, I like when the top of the text on screen is the beginning of a paragraph, and the bottom the end of one, and I tend to go out of my way to make it so that happens, like just reading one paragraph and scrolling down, hoping that it will fit the next paragraph perfectly. Again, this could just be that I just like how it looks, I mean, who doesn't like it when a texts fits on the screen, but yeah.

Again, it's not something that consumes my whole life, just something that's present as an annoyance. If I'm not thinking about it, it rarely comes up, but it is there.

460,Advice on how to manage obsessive thoughts and behaviour,"I have issues with checking again and again that all appliances are off/shut in the kitchen (oven, stove, kettle, fridge...) and in my bedroom (laptop, tv, wifi, charger...), that all the doors and windows are closed and that my flat is safe. In my mind, the problem with the appliances is that they might be on, and cause a fire or a leak while I'm not looking. The issue with the doors/windows is that if they're not locked someone could break in and hurt me. I do it before going to the bathroom and to bed, because that's when I'm the most vulnerable and not in control.

I'd say that checking that everything is in order affects most aspects of my everyday life, but I struggle the most when it's bedtime, going to sleep without checking that everything is safe is simply impossible. I tried many times but my brain keeps thinking that if I don't do it something it's gonna happen because of my carelessness. I'll admit that being on high alert and constantly aware of what's going on around me is something that's always been an issue for me (but not on this level). I need to be in control to feel safe, whether I'm outside or not. 

In general I feel safe in my flat but when nightime comes it's a completely different story. This bedtime ritual has become unbearable but I can't stop myself from doing it. Even if I really want to sleep or even after I get physically tired of checking multiple times, my brain doesn't switch off. I try to rationalise and tell myself that I just checked, the door is locked, no one is outside waiting for me to be asleep to hurt me, but I just can't stop myself. And if I somehow mess up the ""ritual"" or I hear a random noise that ""distracts"" me I have to start all over again because since I was interrupted it's not valid/safe anymore.

I'm aware that this kind of behaviour can be linked to OCD, but I've never been diagnosed so I'm not sure. I do see a therapist for depression and anxiety and trying to get over unresolved past trauma, but I've not brought up this particular issue yet. I think it's because I can't make sense of it. I can understand how my depressed brain work, that shit the happened to me in the past messed me up, but I don't understand this behaviour and I don't know how to control it because it doesn't make sense. I'm rational but my brain makes me think that I have to do these things and I don't know how to fight it, or if I should fight it because I don't trust myself.

So my question is: do you have any advice on how to manage it? Any coping mechanisms? My go to is always avoidance (unhealthy I know, my therapist agrees) but in this particular case it doesn't work and I can't win. Help?"

462,DAE say things unconsciously??,"I'm terrible at trying to explain myself but this has been bugging me for years.

I have these moments of dissociation, and by moments I mean, seconds. I don’t even notice that I’ve checked out, it’s that quick. But when it happens… I say things completely unconsciously. I think sometimes I say things that are offensive, rude, or completely unfiltered.

I know this happens, because once I’ve snapped out of it, people will ask me to repeat myself and I had no idea that I even said anything. Or in other cases, they will have an uncomfortable look on their face like I’ve just insulted them. One awful example of this… My now ex boyfriend told me that I once said out loud to him that I didn’t love him.

The first time this was brought to my attention was in high school. I’m now 29 years old. I thought it would stop, but I think it’s getting worse. As someone who is very reserved, cares a lot about what people think, it’s incredibly stressful knowing that I could at any moment, unconsciously say something to offend or hurt someone.

I’m just curious if anyone else has experienced this, and if anyone can give me any further info. Google hasn't been that helpful."

464,I don't understand how CBT is different from the gaslighting I've had all my life,"I've asked therapist after therapist after therapist questions like this and it's ALWAYS been dodged. Never gotten a straight answer, but I've been accused of being uncooperative or not wanting to get better a lot if I pushed.

CBT just sounds like what I've heard all my life to make me think I was crazy. My family was heavily abusive. But the message wasn't really ""you deserve this"", it was always ""this is what normal loving families are like and if you'd just accept that you'd be happy."" Like if I tried to call my mother out for saying something but acting in the opposite way, I'd get mocked for talking like I could just read her mind. Or if I tried to bring up a bad incident I'd be told that I was just focusing on the negative, there were all these nice things they did for me, why was I just insisting on being so black and white all the time?

When I've done CBT in the past, it just reinforced that message. I came in at a point where I was hurting and confused; I had a lot of strong emotions running through me that I didn't understand why I felt that way. When I couldn't adequately explain my feelings, the therapist would start talking about the CBT triangle and encourage me to look for the distortions. The truth was that my feelings were an accurate reflection of a reality that I'd been gaslight into not being consciously aware of.

I don't understand why it's somehow bad and abusive when my mother does it, but then ok when a therapist uses the exact same arguments.  And I don't understand how we can keep ethically practicing a therapy like this when there don't seem to be any safeguards that we're not just gaslighting a client because they can't explain all the evidence in the way we're looking for.  (I suspect a major issue in my case was that most of our society considers it ""unrealistic"" for a woman who acts like a caring mother to be abusive or predatory towards her daughter.)

There doesn't seem to be any real mechanism to CBT to tell what's a cognitive distortion and what's just a rational thought. Especially in cases where the person might not fully understand what's bringing them to that conclusion, or in cases where other people might want to push back on it. Am I missing something here? I know it's supposed to involve comparing your thoughts to reality, but whose view of reality do you use?  Because in practice the ""reality"" we're working with is heavily influenced by our society, personal biases, available information, and so forth."
465,CBT for social anxiety. What to expect?,"I wasn’t always socially anxious, it developed at 13 due to life situations, what can I expect starting CBT finally at 21? I want to have a realistic expectation so I have a goal to aim for. I’d like to say I have no social anxiety, but to be honest even if there’s some anxiety I’d just like to life a normal life in spite of it instead of it controlling my life as well as not believe the thoughts I tell myself and stop being self conscious"

474,I need a second opinion on this,"I want to talk about something that I feel like has been troubling me for the last few weeks. Since the start of this summer vacation, I have decided to fill my free time by getting a full time job 5 days a week. The company I work for is actually a startup and there is only 4 employees at the moment including the CEO. The other employee is a sales manager who supervised my training since I got the job. I've just never really had a job before but I just hate the fact that I have to take orders all day from my supervisor. It's like every two minutes he tells me to do something and I just hate being ordered to do anything and I feel so belittled when he tells me I have to do something. Is it okay for him to just order me around or should I tell him that I don't like this way of being ordered? I really don't feel good at this job because I don't feel free.

I’ve been to a total of 20 doctors/psychologists and about 8 therapists all who have told me I’m faking my problems or don’t believe my traumas.

Feeling like all you can do is ride it out, but you know it’ll be another few months, or even years, before you get another slight reprieve.

I spend a lot of time alone and it’s really starting to get to me. I’ve been feeling really depressed and isolated.

Why the fuck do they have to be so rude like these are people coming into the ER, be more sensitive."
483,i feel like i have poor mental health but don't fit into any particular diagnosis,"i struggle a lot with mental health in general. but the weird thing about me is i feel like i have symptoms of different mental illnesses, but when i look at the DSM for each one, i can never tick off ALL of the ‘obligatory’ symptoms. 

not depressed enough, not ocd enough, not anxious enough, not bipolar enough. yet certain symptoms of depression, ocd, anxiety and bipolar have been enough to have significant negative impacts on my life throughout the years. EXTREMELY significant negative impacts that mess with my head. 

it gave me great relief when i saw someone write “it’s valid if u struggle with mental health in general but don’t fit into one particular diagnosis” but i'm not sure if this is a common feeling. 

i’ll take bipolar as an example. sometimes in the span of ONE DAY (esp during my high school days when i was even worse than now) i would sometimes experience a ‘high’ (euphoric mood, increased heartbeat, laugh like crazy, overly ambitious, super loud, feel like i can take on the world) -  and 12 hours later i will be ‘low’. overly sensitive, miserable thinking about life, questioning my existence, weeping like mad. 

does that fit into a diagnosis of bipolar? nope, not even the mildest one (cyclothymia). because moods are supposed to last for days/weeks but it doesn’t change the fact that those symptoms affect my life

the worst period of my life was strongly affected by particular symptoms of ocd. and i am traumatized until today. but i would definitely not fit into a diagnosis of ocd. don’t think i’ll ever be able to open up 100% to anybody about it lol it’s too painful 

i guess for now my mental health is stable enough to not need meds or a psychiatrist (which is why DSM symptoms exist in the first place i'm sure). and i'm aware that millions of people go through worse mental health issues than i do. but i just want to know if this kind of feeling is common / has been discussed anywhere / any research about it / if there's a term for it. or just hear from other's experiences. thank you."
484,Partner thinks everyone is out to get him.,"My (38f) partner (38m) thinks there are rumours being spread about him and people want to kill him. Neighbours are in on it, his work collegaues are in on it. Even my adult child, who lives with us is apprrently in on it. He hears and sees things that only he does.This has been going on for at least 5 years as far as I can remember and I am at breaking point. 

I have tried to reason and support, now I just empathise, but i cannot believe the things he says, i would be lying if I said that. 

I see when he is stressed. My son feels awkward with him. We have an 8yr old together so I want to the best for her too.

I have told him I cant live like this anymore, the negativity is killing me with stress. I have said he needs to speak with soneone. Counselling his parents and the police(to report these people) have all been mentioned.

I dont know where to go or what to do from here. I am on the verge of breaking up for my own sanity. 

Our relationship has had its ups and downs but this has overshadowed alot of it. We have been together 10 years in all.

485,My boyfriend doesn’t understand but he thinks he does,"So I’ve never been diagnosed with anything because my mom growing up didn’t want me to go see a doctor who would possibly prescribe me medication for depression or anxiety because she said it makes  you feel worse sometimes, and she’s had problems with depression since I can remember. And now I’m in the military and I’ve been scared to go to medical for it for a while, but I think I might once I get to my new command and see how that all goes. But right now I just say that I get sad a lot and sometimes it lasts a long time. The problem I have right now is, though I do think he really does have good intentions and thinks he’s helping me, the way my boyfriend talks to me when I’m sad either makes me more sad or pisses me off. I’ve tried telling him every single time, when he has a calm voice, listens to me talk, and is just generally more gentle when I’m feeling down, it helps me calm down so much faster than his way of doing it. His way to make me stop being sad is one of two things: 1. Make me mad because he has told me that I will calm down faster from being mad than sad so that’s like the easy way out, or 2. Tell me to “stop moping around” “stop feeling bad for yourself”, “you’re fine you just need to chill out”, “maybe if you got out of bed and go do something you would feel better”. Which I understand that it is all true, I guess it just hurts when he tells me because then I feel worse because I’m just crying in bed and I need to get over it. Am I upset about the way he “tries” to make me feel better for no reason? Or am I right in thinking that he just doesn’t understand? If that’s the case then how do I get him to understand? He tells me that his sister “went through shit” before but he won’t tell me like if she had depression or anxiety or harmed herself, which I guess I understand that’s private I just don’t know if our situations are as similar as he thinks they are. Also I hate that he compares me to her in this way because everyone goes through things differently and maybe that way worked for her but it makes me feel worse. He’s determined that it’ll work on me someday and I just need to be more tough and he’s trying to make me more tough but I think it hurts more than it helps. :("
486,I need help understanding,"I guess you could say really it's validation in my frustrations, or really just knowing I'm not the insane one as she put it.

My mother (F56) doesn't have friends, at all, no real life friends that is. My father is a recovering alcoholic and has been doing well as of recent. He usually is my support system but for the past few years he has stopped letting me vent about my mother and I don't want to burden him and force it on to him so I hope you don't mind me unloading and looking for some help. Anyway I will get on with it.

My mother has a habit of being a victim. She brings up how hard life is, even telling me when I was 14 that she wanted to drive me and her off the road, while I was in the car. She often claims me and my father treat her like shit. I'm not by any means perfect in fact I do lash out, but after 17 years of this, wouldn't you?

My birthmother was a drug addict and alcoholic and my father (who I should clear up, is my uncle. No incest) is a recovering alcoholic, his brother was addicted to gambling to the point of embezzlement and she is fighting with my father guess what gets brought up? His family. If I need to take some sleep medicine so I can sleep, my birth mother gets brought up. She even brought up his dead parents. (My father was very close to his mother, she died in her late 40s early 50s of a brain aneurysm, his father passed a year after and then his brother with the gambling issue) she says she was justified for brining up their deaths because he was fighting with her because while he's sober and there's a pandemic with all bars closed, she thinks if he has extra money he will go into a store and get beer, keep in mind he's been sober for 1 year now and never when he would go shopping that he came back drunk. His argument was that it was in his wallet, and she without telling anyone went into his jeans when he showered and took out all of his money and put his wallet back. She of course brought up his parents and said ""you treat me terribly, you didn't tell me about the money! Your mother is looking down and probably is disgusted."" Meanwhile she literally stole money. It had also been less than 24 hours since he got the money. 

There's also the times that I spend with my father, we get along well and often watch TV, either in my room on the floor or downstairs. Part of it is that I have special needs, so he's pretty patient with me and spends time with me due to separation anxiety and it's just nice to have some time with someone when my mother tell me she wants nothing to do with me. Anyway I'm getting off track, normally she comes in (the door is always open and the living room don't have doors) and she will make a comment like ""of course you're in here with her"" or ""stop watching that and help me shave my legs"" both of which I feel are inappropriate. It's weird but like it's almost like..she thinks of it as compitition I don't know.

There's also no privacy. My father will never open the door if there is the slightest chance I'm in the bathroom, but my mom walks right on in when I'm naked in in a glass shower. She then makes comments about me like ""look at all those pimples"" or ""that's a lot of stetch marks"" and then walk off like nothing happened, however if I even enter her room she flips out.

Somehow I'm the problem child. In public she always plays the part of the overworked mother of an adopted child with special needs and mental health, she always makes sure to list EVERY issue I have, like I'm an accessory. If I go to a therapist she spends out 40 of the 70 minutes talking about how hard it is to raise me. My CAS workers are noticing it too, but strangers always say how good I have it. 

Whatever I get from her, I know I'm going to have that held over my head. It always gets brought up, everything from the past is brought up like I'm supposed to not take it. 

There's more but I think I've probably given you all a headache, I just need to know if I'm in the wrong if this is normal for a mother to do, and not allow her 17 year old to get a license, not let her have privacy in the bathroom, scream at her, hit her and give rules that apply to everyone but herself. I honestly don't know if I am the one in the wrong anymore."

489,How to use your social media for raising awareness etc?,"Hey guys! :) I’ve been wanting to use my social media (mostly just Instagram) to raise awareness about topics concerning mental health and mental illness and maybe be a platform whereby the things I post can make people feel less alone. I was thinking of starting by sharing my story (I wrote a piece about what it was like to be hospitalized after a suicide attempt) and what it taught me, how mental illness has made me stronger and the lessons I’ve learnt if that makes any sense haha. The thing is, I don’t know how I would go about this whole thing? Like I don’t know what I’d post about and how I would take steps to raise awareness and all of that apart from sharing my story you know?

490,"When you hear ""self harm"" what comes to your mind? Is what I'm doing self harm?","When I hear that people are \[X time length\] free from self harm, I usually think of cutting.

I was talking to my one friend when we were talking about what we do during mental breakdowns, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, the whole shebang, and I mentioned that I try to choke myself, I punch walls and the ground, hit my head against things, and feel like I have to flail my arms and spasm and shake my body. I play with knifes that I have, wanting to do something but mainly ""teasing"" my mind with what I could do with it.

Is this considered self harm? I understand it's harming myself, but I guess like, I'm asking the gravity about all of it? If my therapist asks me if I self harm, do I answer yes to this or no? Are they looking for the answer to if I cut?"

I crave the overconsumption of food. My face is flushed most of the time.  
I have thoughts. They wriggle in like faint echoes. As if someone was calling my name, but I can't quite be sure and then as I turn my attention to it I find myself doubting the original sound more and more.   
However, these thoughts are not my name.  
They are violent, traumatic, real and imagined, and wholly upsetting thoughts.   
I feel like I have no control. Dragging blades across my skin, eating too much, growing my hair, stopping hygiene. These all help me feel like I can affect things in my life. I feel better when I can do what I want. Mostly, I dream of suicide.   
I would never do it, but the thought makes staying here a little easy. The idea it could be better so quick.  
I have periods of energy, hope, and drive. I run long distances, do hours and hours of work in things like uni, or even just be a better person.  


Then all of a sudden can't focus, can't get out of bed, I don't eat or drink...   


Hate it."
495,Are These Signs of an Underlying Issue?,"
For background, growing up, I had a rough childhood emotionally. I used to be physically abused too, not anymore. I would be gaslighted a lot, and manipulated. There was a lot of screaming and anger. No stability or consistency. 

I have developed severe trust issues, and can’t trust anybody. I can’t open up to anyone emotionally, and I have an abandonment fear. And when it’s triggered, I get anxiety attacks. My hands will start shaking and stuff. And I’ll start having nightmares of being abandoned. Sometimes if I feel like somebody is trying to hurt me/has hurt me, I’ll distance myself. Sometimes I’ll even treat them poorly if I feel like they don’t care, or are gonna hurt me.But I don’t want to be a bad person, it just kinda happens, and I always feel guilty after. One time I treated my friend poorly because my one other friend was treating me poorly. And I felt bad.

I have a lot of built up anger, and I just contain it all in. I stay mad/sad for hours. Sometimes when I get super mad, I’ll pinch myself, and have thoughts of punching people, as bad as that sounds. And I can mad at people over little things, but it depends. Like I’m still mad at this one girl for correcting me.  I’m still mad over that 6 months later, I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I can be happy with people, but if I feel like they hurt me, I can like them, but I may start to not like them again if I think about what they did in the past or something. 

At one point of time, my self-esteem was horrendous, I used to call myself stupid, worthless, etc, and be upset every day. I’m not really like that anymore. But sometimes my self-esteem isn’t really good at all. Sometimes I start thinking about how I may not be good enough for certain things, or blame myself. Sometimes I can get sad out of nowhere. I’ll start thinking of sad stuff like death, and start crying, but sometimes this only just last days. Like I only feel empty/sad for days. Usually something triggers it. Sometimes I feel empty a lot, but maybe I’m just bored lol.

I have Asperger’s, so that already comes with some of its struggles. I get anxiety a lot. Over little things, but I don’t know if I have other problems too. And this may sound stupid, but that’s what I’m worried about. Having other problems. I’m still fairly young, and I can’t really get a therapist on my own"
496,A shout out for the loved ones of the people with depression,"Everyone talks about depression and their struggles , but no one talks about what the loved ones of those people go through. 
It’s 12am as I sit here typing this with mind boggling anxiety. I m a doctor (and an empathetic person by nature. I care too much and I help too much ) and I have a 22 year old kid live in my neighbourhood. The first time I met him I sort of knew that maybe he needs someone to reach out to. It took him sometime to reach out to me because he could (and we were perfect strangers who hardly knew each other for hours as I had just moved to the neighbourhood). He reached out to me in his very little way and I sensed it and I told him that it’s ok to reach out and seek help. We met after 3 months. We connected and he told me how he hit the rock bottom , attempted suicide (3 months ago) but finally got the help he needed. Ever since after that i help him whenever he needs. Last night (I casually checked up on him as some celebrity recently committed suicide) , we had a brief funny conversation which was incomplete (my guess that he probably slept off early). It’s been 24 hours and I haven’t received a reply (he replies every single time he sees my message). My mind is running in all the possible directions. It could be something minor (phone battery discharged or phone isn’t working and there s actually no way to know it because he doesn’t have a WhatsApp account - only iMessage and Instagram for him and I m not active on any social media other than whatsapp and iMessage ) or it could be my worst feared nightmare (I have legit reasons to believe - 1) young Male 2) history of previous suicidal attempt 3) history of depression 4) unemployed 5) lockdown and points not in favor of it is only that he lives with his family and he seemed ok last night and was busy posting pictures on Instagram). I cannot be neurotic and paranoid to trace him (besides I don’t even know his apartment number). I have no idea what to do and my anxiety is eating me up. He s a good kid. So yes my point being that yes you guys go through something dark (I v been in depression for years and fought it hard and came out as a winner) and we are all here for you , but please the next time u want to choose to end your life think about the people who care about you and what they will go through if you choose to put them through this. Stay happy stay focused and keep fighting. Nothing in life is too big worth ending your life !"
497,What the hell is going on with me?,"SOrry if there's grammar errors and such I'm feeling really shit right now. For as long as I can remember I have been in a constant battle to understanding my feelings and thoughts. For a few years now I've been stuck in extreme apathy. However I get such intense bursts of emotion inside like every time something minor happens. It never shows externally. It's so bad that I start thinking about suicide over something like my friend answering me in a disinterested tone. This is just so weird to me and I don't understand because once the emotions settle I go back to my apathetic state and literally can't do anything. I can't focus, I can't think properly and can barely bring myself to move because I feel so tired of life without even having a reason. I know I have depression but I feel like something else is going on with this because this just doesn't seem right. My friend doesn't know but every time we see each other and talk I can see how happy she is about the future and she has hobbies and what not and when she asks me I just kinda... change topics. I don't have any motivation, I don't know what my dream is and I don't know anything about what I want to do because I just feel so disconnected from myself and the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the main reason for my lack of motivation is the fact that I have extreme problems trying to focus on literally anything. Yet sometimes I will have intense moments where I can concentrate for hours but it goes away and when it comes back it's not really frequent. However I know that I could also be having trouble focus because of the lack of motivation so it's just confusing me. It doesn't matter what I do to try figure it out because I always end up coming tumbling back down over any slight problem that others might not even consider a problme. I know that I get stressed too easily but it makes me feeling hopeless about trying to get better because this happens every time. On top of that I can't even keep a conversation going on for more than 5 minutes because I lack any care to and have trouble being outside for a few hours because everything just feels like too much. The sounds, people being everywhere and like everything sensory is just too much and it makes me feel pathetic and it makes me want to rush back home and hide away forever. Because of all this I resort to daydreaming to cancel out everything and this further makes me ignore my problems. At this point I'm pretty sure i daydream for over 7 hours a day. Even when someones talking to me I just space out and sometimes not intentionally. Like yesterday I was with my friend buying a drink and the lady at the counter was saying something to me which my friend said was something about a discount but the entire time she talked to me I completely zoned out because at the time interaction and basically everything felt too much and so useless. And well, I'm useless too so it doesn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw idk if it matters but im 18. I don't hurt myself or anything, I dont have problems with that and I guess I just dont have energy to even bother If I felt like it. I keep feeling like Im just being so lazy but I really can't control it because I keep spending hours trying to understand what i should improve on and such but I just can't. I cant. I dont know what to do anymore because i feel like im floating through life in a lifeless body. Suicide is always on my mind and I always fantasize about it but at the same time I don't think I have any plan to actually do that tbh, because i really want to live but just not in this brain. I dont want to live and I dont want to die. If i could briefly describe most of my life, especially in these recent years, it would be the feeling of being trapped in a complete state of nothingness with random quick periods of intense emotion. Btw I know Im not bipolar so incase you mistake this for that it's not. But anyway if anyone could help me try figure out what I might be dealing with here or if anyone relates i might be able to ease myself by a little. Right now im really stressed idk why but anyway if anyone even read this entire thing which i doubt it well thanks thats greatly appreciated."
498,The feeling of being completly lost is literally destroying me.,"I used to be a really selfish kid. Lazy as fuck, no discipline. I created an external image of being smart, and having no flaws. Inside, I was insecure and hid a lot of hate and fear.

Always lying to people to make them think I was perfect, always trying to get my way with things. Always talking about things I was going to do, and never doing them because I didn't know how to work, I relied hardly on my ""intelligence"". In the back of my mind, i'm always thinking what the others feel about me, and that shapes my world. 

Its sad to say but I think I never had a true friend I could be open with or respected. 

I was very perfectionist, because I guess that all the value I could see from me, a person with no morality at all was doing the things better than other people to fill that void inside. Shit, my humor was terribly hurting. I laugh at things that I know I shouldnt and I even got some kind of relief of knowing I was doing things better than other people.

&amp;#x200B;

One day that exploded, 4 years ago, when someone I cared about left my life.

I started to focus all my attention on me. On every single interaction I had with the world. 

What i found was a lot of flaws, a lot of flaws that made me feel even wearker, to like me even less. I felt a terrible person for being all the things that has been written here, creating on me a feeling of guilt, and specially shame. 

I continued throught life, now with a lot of anxiety caused with the fact that I felt like a terrible person, and that I felt that there was no fix to it because I had always been perfectionist, and I was broken. There was no good in me. The more I tried to not be a bad person, the more guilty I felt because I couldn't do it. I had these patterns rooted deep down. The fear, the need of control, the love or hate relationship with myself, the impossible mission of sticking to plans to the plans I made to fix the situation or to the values I wanted to have.

I failed every single time, for years, for many years, in studies, relationships, exercising, everything. And whenever I found good people around me or thought I could be a decent person because of how much I had suffered, my manipulative and selfish patterns reappeared. I just hide all those things with addictions.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to leave the place where I was and try again. I went far away, in an exchange program. I tried to do everything fine. It was for a while, then I met someone who made me feel things I hadn't feel in my whole life. But, I was depressed, with anxiety, and for what I said before, not good for her. She is a pure soul, kind, loyal, and works for the things she wants. Then there is me, lazy, selfish, evil, and with no self control.

The situation has become impossible to keep up. The relationship is being destroyed by my insecurities, by the need I have to analize everything around me, those questions... those questions that wont go away, that hit my brain whenever I feel a bit of hapiness, and that keep pulling me down and taking out of me all the hope for changing. These questions are based on all the things that I mentioned before. I will write some of them, just to vent a bit: 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Will this last? Does she really love me? Why would she love someone like me? What did she see on me?

 I am not a good person, I will fail at being loyal or respect her. Do I really love her or am I just using her as an scape mechanism? If thats the case, I dont want to do that because she really doesn't deserve, but I cant leave because she is all I wanted in my life. But what that is contradictory.

She is really suportive and strong. Is she doing that because she feels like she have to do it? How could she love someone who cries and needs so much attention, who can't do shit with his life.

You are selfish. You don't care about her, if you did, you would break up. She doesn't deserve to be in this situation, and if you don't break you are being a bad person and selfish again. 

You will never change, and if someday you finally get rid of your depression and anxiety you will become the same monster you were before and she will be the first one to suffer you. 

I really don't know if I'm a narcissist, Im scared as fuck of being one because they say it cant be cured and because of the aversion I have of the concept of hurting people. Then I start thinkin if I have empathy and I can't feel it. Then I start thinking maybe I'm scared of the label of narccissist. 

Maybe all these questions are just a way of getting what I want and not actually fixing the problem. Maybe she is the focus of all my problems and I'm expeting her to solve it.

But i fucking want to solve them to be with her, I want to feel worthy, I want to fucking feel like I can love her for what she is, I want to fucking believe in a future with her, I want to stop fucking analyzing everything and trust someone for the first fucking time in my life, I want to fucking believe in something and stop feeling so much pain every single day. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 Shit. This is a normal day in my brain. Thanks for reading.

Got to say I'm currently in therapy but I feel as lost as I was before it, my therapist sais the problem is the thoughts but, I cant stop second guessing things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck to everyone."
499,"I need help, I cant tell whats wrong with me","so in the past week ive been having “dreams” about the next day where i see stuff happening throughout that day, that i suspect arent actually happening because pretty much everything that happens throughout the day gives me an intense memory of that dream but i know it didnt happen. im delusional and i know these delusions arent real, but im scared that i have schizophrenia or something. 

edit: i’ve had smaller delusions for around 2 months prior id say, but i never fully believed them. the thoughts are getting more intense though and i have no idea what to do. im trying to force myself to not believe them. these delusions again were the “dreams” and i also believed i could change certain ways of thinking with my brain. but the dreams would only include like one moment of deja vu throughout a day, or even a week. i feel like what makes me, me is dying and im becoming a completely different person. please help me"

503,Jackpot of mental disorders,"One of my siblings is schizophrenic while the other has DID, ED and a few more. Our father is extremely abusive and used to beat the shit out of us and his abusive nature has turned our mother into a mentally deranged toxic person. I went to multiple therapists for my chronic depression, traumatic past, and suicidal thoughts but at the end of the day the environment at our home makes one wish for death.

I cannot move out and neither can my siblings. What should I do?"

505,Moving is making me feel very derealized,"My family’s in the middle of a big move and our stuff was all packed yesterday, so now our house is completely empty. We’re getting temporary furniture tomorrow, so I’m hoping it’ll make the house feel more full, but seeing it like how it is now just gets to me. It doesn’t feel like I’m in an apartment anymore, it just feels like a holding cell. Idk how to describe. I thought I’d be ok because I was fine the other times we moved, but after spending the entire day on an air mattress sleeping and daydreaming, I realized that I’m not ok. It just hurts knowing that I’m not gonna see my stuff for at least another month and a half. I hate having to see everything so empty, and nothing feels real right now."
506,I am really struggling with isolation.,"I am a stay at home mom of two. My husband works a good job, for which I should be so grateful, but every day when he leaves I am so resentful. I am home alone with two kids (7 and 1) five days a week. I have NO local friends or family. I go weeks without speaking to anyone outside my household, and this is just my life, this isn’t because of covid. But now, we cannot go to a library, McDonald’s play place, playground, etc. 

I feel really dire about my life circumstances. I feel like my life is pointless, I am lonely, I feel constantly under some invisible duress, the stress and terror of if something happens to me what will become of my kids, the anger and rage I feel at “family” I have thousand of miles away who practically drove me away with being abusive and controlling.   


I know this is a season of life but I am in agony. I feel like no one in the world knows about, cares about me. I feel insignificant and worthless, like an outcast. I feel like a burden on my husband and like I’m going to warp my children. I feel like they are cursed to have me as a mother. I feel like I cannot give them anything, not even social interaction. They don’t have friends! They don’t have family. They have nothing but me and my husband and by and large, we suck.   


I spend most days feeling in a stupor. I go through the motions and I wonder if my children are scared, angry, lonely. They only know what they know I guess but I feel like their lives are so empty and deficient. I feel hopeless and like I have failed them."
507,Don't really know how to sort out my thoughts after making mistakes.,"I a lot of mistakes these past few months; a lot of stuff just happened at once and Covid has just made everything worse. I've learned my lessons and apologised to whom I need to, but I still feel awful. I know I shouldn't wallow in self pity, but I really don't know what else to do. And I'm afraid that if I don't think about what I did, I'll forget and do the same thing again."
508,Was this typical childhood behavior or abnormal? ** trigger warning for parental neglect and illegal drug usage**,"I’m currently [17F] my memory of childhood isn’t super vivid, but I think that’s normal. Anyway I just remembered this incident that happened when I was most likely three years old, definitely not four yet. I remember being up in my bedroom, I was definitely supposed to be asleep; however, I wasn’t. Anyway somehow I accidentally bit down on my tongue really hard so I naturally started hysterically crying. (btw I didn’t bite through my tongue I’m assuming it just really hurt) My mother was downstairs and when she realized what had happened she responded maternally. I think I ran downstairs crying and I remember my uncle was there, my father has told me recently he lived there along with multiple other people though I don’t remember that at all. Anyway after that event I remember thinking I need that to happen again so I can get that response basically. Is that weird forthree-year-old to think? The very idea that my three-year-old thought process was I need to hurt myself for my mother to act towards me maternally really throws me off. I don’t really remember that time frame because I was literally three years old, so I’m questioning if that could be a sign of abuse or neglect. I know for a fact both my parents were using cr*ck coc*ine around that time. I’ve heard some stories about my great aunt filing a CPS report though I know very little about it, all I know is that my parents never lost custody of me. I remember another incident around the same age I had stepped on glass that was just randomly on the floor, my mother responded in a way I think is kind of odd now. My mother took me outside and we sat on the steps, it feels like she almost talk to me as if I was a friend or a colleague not really the way I imagine someone would/should talk to their child. It’s not as if she didn’t calm me down or anything I just think it’s kind of weird. I have so many problems in present day I can only wonder what used to happen back then."

515,Male 19. Had one of the worst breakdowns in a long time.,"The quarantine has done me as worse as it could. I've had 3 episodes of breakdowns by now, which have occurred after a really long time. Today was the worst of them all. I lost total control and became very violent.

My father was primarily the cause, because he spoke things which really hurt me emotionally. He's been abusive towards the family throughout my life. I have a sister who has gone through pretty much the same as me but she is fairly mentally stronger than I am.

It was all really bad but it turned into the absolute worst when my sister hopped in to project her anger on me, for whatever reason she couldn't stand me being aggressive. She wouldn't stop saying the most hurtful words because she knew it would hurt me. So it triggered all kinds of ptsd for me, and I ended up grabbing her neck and later slapping her once.

I regret it heavily. I've vented out to my mother about my depression and suicidal tendencies for the first time in my life, which I've been battling since I was around 12. But she really doesn't know how to help me. She doesn't even want to split with my father who's the main cause for every single thing that's happened to us. 

I just don't know if I'll ever be okay. I'm sure that I'll end up committing suicide very soon if not now then in a few months or years. Just hoping that it doesn't project more pain on anyone than what already exists. I really don't wanna be trouble to anyone."

517,I am starved for any kind of connection,"I noticed this, I seek out so many different connections even if they last for a moment or are only sexual, I try to talk to people online, offline, at work, anywhere, my heart gets excited if someone shows interest in me. 

I want to stop it, I read up a bit on it, I am a victim of verbal and sexual abuse, didn't have much affection given to me as a child, had too many responsibilities at a young age and then just gave them up.

I don't know what to do, I want to stop this chaotic pursuit for any attention or affection, like I was straight a few years ago and then a gay guy gave me some attention and I started approaching gay men too, which in itself not a problem but I just want to stop relying on others for my own happiness

What is loving yourself even, I take care of myself physically and respect my time but I can't control my emotions

I was finishing my last year of school, I should be going off to university in september, however I’ve got a huge predicament that’s been eating me up inside. So idk how much you guys know about the U.K. education system but I am doing my second year of College and should be going off to university, now the entry requirements for your university needs to be met by your final exams, however our final exams were cancelled, and our grades is based off of class work we’ve done throughout the year. And there’s the problem, I was the class clown all throughout the year, making jokes at my own expense and never getting any work done. So I’ve had barely anything to show for myself. Once the schools were shut and I was stuck at home, I lost it. Being locked in all day, was horrible. Especially when I still live with my older sister who is the golden child of the family, she goes to Cambridge (the best university in the U.K.) and I’m basically always stuck in her shadow, anything I do she can do better. And I’ve been stuck since mid March just pondering and pondering, i get my results in August and I’m dreading it so much, depending on how this goes it is basically the defining moment in my life as far as I see it. And I’ve all ballsed it up because I wanted to impress people. I’ve had serious thoughts of running away Into the woods near me, the woods just calm me so much. I just don’t really see a future for me anymore, I Hope life throws something cool at me pretty soon. Cos idk how much more I can take"

And when my fathers father died there was a huge family feud because one sister stole all the money. Also important my father has also been very narcissistic. Fast forward to when I’m in my twenties; 

We’re all living together (my father, me, my daughter, and my brother had just moved above us) my dad finds out that his very serious alcoholic mother was in the hospital because she had fallen and laid on the floor for about a week and the people that we’re supposedly taking care of her just left her there and apparently stole her boat and most of her money. 

After this my father decided he was going to up and move within a weekend. Me and my daughter had to find to find a place to live within that weekend because he told his friend at work he could come take everything he left including my stuff if I didn’t get out. (This all happened in a weekend) and I couldn’t pay that high of rent myself. 

About a year goes by and I’m in a terrible environment but it was the quickest I could find in such a short notice. But as the situation gets worse my dad offers for my daughter, boyfriend, and I to move in with them for a location change while we find a place around here. He says he’s her legal care taker because she has dementia. 


Every since we moved in they have been absolutely ridiculous and makes us go to bed by 8pm (I’m in my mid 20s). They started saying my boyfriend couldn’t stay randomly after he had been (most respectful man ever) and since were knew to the area looking for jobs he started sleeping in my car. They wouldn’t even let him use our bathroom and made him go outside. We get jobs and they start acting as if I was stressing her out because her dementia and that I need to get out immediately  (keep in mind i just got a job and Ive just been work my ass off to get out) 

It would take forever to name all my reasonings. But long story shortened my father make ridiculous rules, act ridiculous, and every time his excuse is because her illness. Which knowing my dad he only wants her money when she passes. He’s made that very clear I have pictures. He only uses the dementia to enforce something he wants, he uses it out of selfish gain. 

His mother (my grandmother) constantly is calling me a bitch and bringing up stuff my blamer narcissistic father over exaggerated and tried to make himself the good guy. I could be very sweet or not even say a word and every single time I leave the house even to get something out of my car she gets up and locks it and says she tried to keep me out. She doesn’t want me here. I’m a bitch. But I could literally do nothing but it’s because certain things my father will blow out of proportion to manipulate her into hating me too. (He’s always compared me to my mother who he despises) one incident I literally got out of her way so she could take her walker down the hallway and she says “god you’re such a bitch” I’m completely shocked it was common respect to let her go by and my father continues to thank her for calling me a bitch and in front of my daughter to. 

Anywho the actual point to this is. 
I think my father is manipulating her into thinking she has dementia. And using it as a strong use in their legal case trying to get all the money back that the people stole from her. My dad wants her money. I think she signed the stuff over them drunk and didn’t remember. She drank the moment she woke up to the moment she passed out. I think sge did it while she was drunk and after falling and then realizing the stuff is missing. My father stepped in to try and get that money he feels belongs to him back. And he’s using the dementia as a case because it looks bad if she was drunk. And that was on her. So they wouldn’t get the money back. 

Other reasons to back up my theory;

- she never ever goes to doctors visits 
-no hospital papers or medical papers of diagnosis
- the only medicine she takes is over the counter and vitamins 
- the only people my father is ever on the phone with for her is insurance people trying to get the money back (not doctors) 
- she remembers everything he says to her about me enough to where every time I leave she tries to lock me out
- She got a stimulus check and older citizens legally being taken of by others did not qualify for a check so there’s no proof he’s her legal care taker
-she never has doctor letters of bills in the mail 
-she gets a social security check my dad freaks out over. He hates me checking the mail or grabbing their mail with my own to be helpful because he doesn’t want me to see their mail. 
-while on the phone with the insurance people he makes sure to tell them it’s Alzheimer’s that she has not dementia. And that’s why she can’t do it herself. But always tells me it’s dementia. 
- she’s in very good health. She can take care of herself, she moves around by herself, puts her own clothes on, showers on her own, washes dishes fine. She has no symptoms. 

My father uses it as a clutch so I have to obey because he’s very controlling of every aspects of my life. And if he feels like I’m my own person, he does things to knock me down so I know I won’t ever be anything without him or ever be better than him. I think he started being so terrible to my boyfriend who is like a super human and very respectful because he was threatened by him because he is everything my father wanted to be man wise. 

anyway I’m just mainly trying to get some opinions on this subject. Do you guys think she has dementia / alzhimers? Or can you compare how someone you know that has it acts? I’m curious. Because something is very sketchy around here and I just want to get away from them."
521,How do I access mental health services?,"So I’m 19F in the UK and my mental health is declining. I have never accessed mental health devices before despite a history of poor mental health. Due to my age I can no longer self-refer to any CAMHS and my GP has been very uncooperative in the past when I have asked for help. They basically just told me I was probably just sad because it was near Christmas, even though I told them it had been going on for years. So I’d be nervous to try going through them again as it came across to me like “yeah sort it out yourself soz”.
Now I feel like the only way to get help would to be to seriously harm myself and go to hospital. Obviously I don’t want to do that, I’d rather get help before it gets to that stage.
Any suggestions?"
522,I wish i was a cute girl so people would at least pretend to care when im sad,"Im really confused and I don't know why to feel, most of the time my self esteem and confidence is really low because i simply don't feel like I'm good enough for anything or anyone in this world.
I have a lot of fake ""friends"" that just act nice to me when they need something from me. 
I started making new friends online in a hope that i would find worthwhile and meaningful friendships but all of them end the same. I am always nice to them and we are having a great time taking but eventually they stop talking as much and then they ignore me. Id be happier if they told me they hate me rather than this bs. 
literally the one time i open up to my friend about why I'm sad and express my feelings, i get called a fake depressed attention seeker. I feel really lonely and feel like I have no one to turn to in the world.
I really didn't wanna make this post but im on the verge of giving up hope of ever having a nice relationship with anyone."
523,What does being happy in your body feel like?,"I dont wanna sound teary and sad but I think the days I felt okay in my body can be counted on my hands. I'm trying to work on myself and change something because hey nothing changes if nothing changes. 

But god I am so curious. What does it feel like being content in your body? What constitutes your body feeling like home? What is it like looking in the mirror and not seeing countless things you wish didnt belong to you? 

Maybe if there are some feelings I can identify, I'll start seeing them in myself. I want to be hopeful. So please tell me, what is it like to not want to be anywhere but in your body most of the time?"
524,I kind of hate what being bullied and ostracized made out of me ...,"Hi reddit
I just joined to find like minded people on here for what I am interested in and mental health is one of those things

I feel like considering for how long all of this went on, I ""fixed"" myself pretty well, meaning I managed to get out of my toxic behaviour towards food myself and also found music that helped me deal with everything, but I still don't feel normal and probably never really will?
I now have a good amount of friends, a loving boyfriend, but I still feel like people think I'm weird and that I'm different. I still criticize myself a lot even though I don't really hate myself anymore..

It's just all a mess sometimes

Does anyone else feel like that? I'd be happy to talk about it

525,Sertraline - how to come off it?,"I have been on 100mg of sertraline a day for about a year after almost having a breakdown in early 2019. I  wasn't sleeping, eating properly, or really engaging with the world.
This, along with a short course of therapy has literally changed my world as I went from wanting to leave my partner, quit my job and just hide from the world to getting a small promotion in late 2019 and getting married in January. 
I have tried a couple of times to reduce my dose but each time have noticed an almost immediate resurgence of my anxiety symptoms that I can only control so much with techniques I learnt in therapy leaving me terrified to come off them.

Can anyone advise at all? With experience or other and thank you in advance!"
526,I had kept my pasts traumas tucked into my head for most of my life. It wasn’t until recently where they finally boiled up and I really can’t handle them... 21M,"I’ve had these problems, bottled up in my head, for years, and I always kept them down. I started writing my problems and traumas down for the first time. I never confronted them, and I regret that. Its completely ruined 2 of my relationships so far and its ruined most of my life so fat, I’m still extremely broken from my last relationship over a year ago. I’m so young, 21 years old, but these traumas are so much to deal with. Idk what to do, I’m currently in therapy once a week, but I don’t think thats enough and I’m afraid. I’m heart broken, traumatized and emotionally drained. Is there a place where I can go to rehab for depression or past traumas? I don’t think I can really handle this anymore and need a big support system?"
527,"Help me please, maybe someone has similar situation. I don't know","A little background: happily lived until 17 yo, since then until now struggling with desire to kill myself because I feel like I don't belong to people and have autism or something and have been almost always self-isolated for 6 years now

I noticed that there are two states of mind in me that stand out among the others. 

I have the first state is when I am alone and don't see anybody around. I then feel myself quite normal. Though sometimes lonely.

And the second state is when I read about someone's relationships, friends, parties, or see other groups of friends have fun I then instantly want to smash my head against the wall. Because I didn't have it at all and don't believe that I will.

It's like I want to have and feel everything that other average people have and feel naturally. For example, to meet with friends, find a partner. I just don't know why it doesn't happening to me. For others it seems to happen naturally, for me it's like a great effort. And because it's like an effort for me I can't behave naturally and relaxed among others, I often become a weirdo.

I visited therapist and she said that I'm fine. But I'm not fine! Something is broken in me! I don't want to be always alone :'("

How do you stop your thoughts from taking control of you?"
530,I haven’t stopped thinking about something that upsets me and I think it’s become a bigger issue.,"I remembered something about a comic book, it upset me, but the issue is that’s it’s been about three days now and consumes most of my thoughts. I tend to think about things that upset or disturb me that I’ve read or seen for a reasonably long time. The more I thought to myself, I began to think that maybe there’s something else going on. I do this often, think about something for days and feel a sadness and disturbed. I’ve read that something I could do is come up with a solution, but I can’t control what is written or what will be written in the future.

I feel like it’s such a small issue that shouldn’t warrant such an impact on my head. The more I began to think that this was something possibly up with my mental health, I began to get irritated and the thoughts only got worse. Any help or ideas is much appreciated. Thank you."
531,Communicating about sexual abuse with an “elder “,How do you politely tell someone decades older than you that you don’t want to hear them talk about their previous abuse because you haven’t come to grips with your own previous abuse and you’re extremely uncomfortable?

I was just diagnosed with anxiety, OCD, BDD and depression. I start therapy in July. I’m on venlafaxine and buspar. I was wondering if anyone else has a similar diagnosis. Any advice? Good books to read- specifically on OCD/BDD? I’m just looking to feel less alone. 

Thank you!"
534,"MADD, depression, etc? I don't even know anymore.","TW: Cutting/self h-rm, one (1) mention of drug ab-se

So hey. I'm a minor, I'm required to live with my parents. 

My mother's a former social worker, she's seen some sh--. My father deals with drug ab-se cases, and he has a pretty similar personality to me- he's very introverted and doesn't like to talk about mental health stuff.

I don't know, I kinda would expect my mother to be supportive when it comes to me talking about mental health- but she just tries to blame everything on different things. I told her (after summoning a *lot* of courage) that I'd been depressed for a while, she blamed it on my *gender.* And she said that it was probably because I was ""stressed out.""

*(Yeah, I guess I've been stressed out constantly for at least five years, maybe that's a problem?)*

I feel like I might have something called *maladaptive daydreaming disorder.* I mean, everything really does fall in line. I create excessively complex plots in my mind with characters, I get lost in them and they're so vivid I feel like I'm inside those worlds (called *paracosms.*) It's not just ""regular"" daydreaming, it really impacts me in a negative way. It's like I'm addicted to daydreaming, and whenever I kinda go into a phase where I can't really think of anything- I get really, *really* depressed and anxious. I actually feel depressed quite a lot, but I hit new lows when I can't daydream.

A theory is that it develops from childhood isolation. I have several problems with my legs, and my mother homeschooled me (because I had to go to physical therapy and truancy laws in my state are really strict.) My only real, close friend was someone I met when my brother went to school (for the one year he went to public school.) I made friends at church and such, but it really wasn't the same. I only really saw and knew my immediate family and my extended family. My way to cope with that was- yeah, daydreaming. And that all began.

I thought it was normal, until I began learning that I wasn't supposed to have these... Extremely vivid, complex ideas, and as I grew older- that became more apparent. I've tried to stop, trust me, but I can't. 

MADD is apparently linked to severe social anxiety/clinical depression, which were both things I've suspected having in the past. I've never went to a psychiatrist/therapist because my parents never really listen to me? Now that I'm quarantined, it's even worse because I can't talk to anyone about it, and I feel like I'm getting worse. 

Last night, I was tempted to start cutting. I've never really cut or felt a strong urge to cut- but last night, I did. I don't know why, but this is just getting worse and worse. I've been getting more impulsive- so I have to hope I don't end up getting up and actually cut myself. 

I've just recently been in the worst states I've been in for a while. I feel depressed for no reason, I've been acting ""hysterical"" (I cry at things that aren't even sad, I laugh at things that aren't funny- or things that aren't funny enough to be laughed at to that degree,) I keep having even more vivid daydreams and I'm having flashbacks to certain events in my life (not traumatic events, I just have a very vivid memory, and I can't get certain events out of my head.) I'm oversensitive and for the past few months, I've refused to get up at a normal time because I don't know how I'll feel throughout the day- I either feel alright, or I just feel plainly awful.

Just... Things just keep getting worse, and nothing seems to be getting better."
535,What is wrong with me?,"Okay so I should I start off by saying what is “wrong with me”, I get severe anxiety and a adrenaline rush taking to people I know. You might think this is somewhat normal but I should explain that this never used to happen to me. I look Forward to talking to people but it’s like my mind sends the wrong signals. I can sense the old me when I talk but it’s always drowned out by this new anxiety infested me. It all started after I took LSD. I had a extremely bad trip. A week before that I had a near death experience choking. And add to that stress from school and other personal matters. Other things to note. The week I was the new me I was hallucinating slightly. I would work out in front of a mirror and see my face distorted very creepily. In that same week I moved with family to another apartment and while eating with people I’m super comfortable with I started hallucinating and I saw my dad and he started getting a distorted face. Lasted like a second but it was their. This is now 4-5ish month into that climax and I feel like 60-70 percent more old me. What can I do to gain the rest of the old me back. Exercising has been making all the progress in getting the old me back and I figure I’ll be back to normal in a few months time. But what can I do to keep that me in check, I never want to experience this ever again."
536,Recent developments in my Mental health.,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but over the past year and a half, I've been going through some mental stuff. They got more serious since January and I convinced my parents to let me talk to a psychiatrist. He told me that I probably have depression, anxiety issues, and that I may have psychosis as well. He recommended I go be hospitalized overnight, but I'm scared to shit about the prospect of that. Can anybody tell me what happens there because right now I'm not sure if I should go? I live in Canada."
537,Hi All!,"Just another reminder that I am always here if you need to talk to anyone. That’s all you have to is PM me. If you need to get anything off your chest, to vent or rant - I am here for that. 

Thank you, and remember to keep positive. :)"
538,"Fr, what is actually wrong with me","Ok so I’ll explain 

Whenever I’m alone for periods of time, I descend into another mindset that I wouldn’t previously even consider if I was with people, I’d probably describe it as evil 

Thoughts usually include 

- acts of violence, including murder towards those I consider enemies 
- acts of plotting violence against others who I’m jealous of 
- acts of entering of a sexually depraved nature through masturbatory fantasy, e.g violent sexual contact that I’m not normally into 
- a fantasy world were the enemies of mine are all dead/ going to die and I’m a gang member part of a non existent gang 
- severe depression and thoughts of self harm/suicide 
- low self esteem 
- some nightmares of random things (different everytime) 

Background: I suffered from bullying from when I was very young, constantly picked on, left out, etc. In one incident I was stripped from the bottom down and left stuck up a tree, as I got older I began to get into fights but was still constantly bullied by everyone else, afterwards (with a different group of friends) I began to become involved in petty escalating criminality such as vandalism, drug use and robbery with a weapon (robbery is the most 
serious charge I have faced) 

I have also been in a series of unstable relationships with equally unstable girls who have suffered their own trauma, mostly sexual abuse or abandonment, for some reason I always attract girls with those issues. I never feel I can commit to a long term relationship and lack self esteem and often cover it with a ‘gangster’ lifestyle 


Please don’t judge, but seriously what is wrong with me"
539,I've lost myself,"Im going to make this as short as i can to not ramble but this problem i have probably started around middle school id guess?

Im in my twenties and to be blunt i don't know who i am as a person or who i should be. Since middle school I've always caught myself imitating parts of other peoples personalities that i admired or seemed more successful or popular than me and as a result i feel like i don't know who i am. An example would be i feel like im always conscious of what i am doing when interacting with people, am i making to many jokes, am i being to quiet, am i coming off as mean or aggressive. Sometimes none of this bothers me and i convince myself i don't care what anyone thinks and other times it creeps into my brain and makes me feel like shit. People have also told me things such as ""you complain to much"" or recently ""your like the most judgemental person here"". 

So all in all I've always tried to better myself as a person including my personality but i just feel like im a mess and don't know how i should act sometimes. This may come off as confusing or unrelatable to some people and i understand that but if anyone has a advice on things to think about or about mindsets id love to hear it."
540,Nobody will probably read this,"For the past 2 months it's been brought to my attention that I've been talking down on myself constantly. Like any small mishap is horrible and I should've known better then to mess up like I did. Not only that but my own father hasn't visited me in months, he was 7 miles away 2 days ago. I feel like I'm a jerk because not only was a bringing myself down but I released that negative attitude on the girl I've been talking to, so she probably doesn't like me anymore.  I just want to stop being so hard on myself and to actually love myself for once."
541,I need help.,"This morning, police came to my house with a search warrant. They did their thing and left. After they left I was told that my brother had uploaded child pornography onto his phone to masturbate to. I was not only grossed out but devastated. I had just actually gotten close to him, and then he had to be a pedophile. He had also just graduated and was got into a good school. When asked why he did it, he responded with, “I’m not sure if I even liked it. I just liked the thrill of doing something wrong.” Now he’s probably going to get at least 5 years in federal prison. This just sent me into a whole mess of emotions and I have no idea what to do. I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this. I really dont know what I’m asking for here, I just need help."

So I’m 29M, 325lb, have controlled high blood pressure and anxiety. I medicate with citalopram 20mg, and have for years. I still have very frequent bouts of intense anxiety over anything that feels seemingly off with my body, especially my heart. It skips a beat or flutters maybe once or twice a day and I just dwell wondering if I’ve got afib or if something is going wrong. Do you all experience this? How do you cope? I feel that it is a manifestation of my subconscious anxiety and that dwelling only makes it happen more often, so it’s seemingly self inflicted."

My mental state has been pretty bad in the past but now it's taking over everything. I'm not at the point anymore where I am willing to end everything but I just don't feel alive. I feel like my entire last school year, I wasn't even present. I made decisions and choices but it's like someone else completely took me over and I was just asleep and now I've woken up. I realize how insane this sounds. I don't know. I'm absolutely desperate. And there's more but I don't want to burden anyone with that. Does anyone know what this could mean?"
545,Rant/vent.. I guess.. (I’m kinda complaining about multiple things),"So my mom is pretty abusive.. a few weeks ago she stopped physically abusing me but she could do it again any moment.. and also threatens to sometimes.. she’s always acting so passive agressieve towards me... and then afterwards she just expects me to act like we’re the “perfect family” she has psychosis and I really used to try to keep on being positive but she kept on hurting me or insulting me for things I didn’t do and couldn’t possibly ever control.. so I just stopped caring about anything at this point idc she can hurt me again but il just probably tell someone if she does again...because I’m done with this...
we always get in lots of arguments.. i try to stay in my room alone most of the time to avoid people it’s like the only safe space I have...I lock the door and I stay in there..and I don’t have to hear or see other people..one of my siblings even broke the doorknob off so I could only open it with my keys... and now today my mom took of my lock so I can’t lock my door or even close it anymore....I’m seriously upset about this it might seem like I’m complaining about nothing but she only took it oof because she says I’m in my room too much I know I am in my room a lot but it’s not like I have anything else to do and she knows that even my older sibling is always in their room and she never complains about them.. i might sound overdramatic saying this but my room and the privacy I had there was the only thing I had left.. I could always just be me in there without worrying that anyone might walk in and upset me..(they already do that enough when I get outside of my room) I literally have breakdowns in front of my mom and she just doesn’t care at all.... I’ve told her twice today that I was gonna kms but she ignored it once and the other time she just said something like “stop gaming me” (it’s something she always says talking about something it’s a long story but it basically revolves around her thinking that people can read her mind or almost anything she sees anywhere turns into something about her that she uses to victimize herself about things that didn’t even happen/aren’t real) and she made it once again about her... I wouldn’t actually do it because I’m too afraid to...but this time I really felt as if I wasnt anymore I just wanted to quit life.. but I don’t think she’d care if I did.. my stepdad did and she used to abuse him too but then after he did it she just pretended like she never did and blamed everyone else for it...
I’m so tired with all off this... I just wanna not exist at this point.. but then comes the part where people probably have it worse than me right now who am i to complain...and I feel awful for even complaining... so now 
I’m done with everything and everyone at this point.. I’ve been done even before this always sad or mad or just feeling numb but at least I was alone and could try to relax and I guess feel peaceful now I’m just....this
Well I’m probably being overdramatic again and il get over it...or I won’t but it’s not like anyone will care...."

547,How do I get put on medication?,"I’m so fucking tired of everything, I just want to sleep all the time. Everything just hurts. I saw a psychologist today about how I wash my hands too much and stuff, and I really wanted to tell her about how I’m often feeling down, but I just couldn’t do it. I’m seeing her again in 5 weeks. Any advice on what I should do?"
548,does anyone else have weird internal mood swings? could this be something more serious?,"i have anxiety of some sort, it mostly revolves around health and socializing. idk if that has anything to do with it.

if im happy, and the slightest thing happens, (for example, my parents want to stop watching tv with me and go to bed, a friend accidentally leaves me on read, etc) i instantly spiral into absolute sadness. i start thinking about everything bad in my life, which seems normal but like it happens in a weird way. i show none of this on the outside, except maybe tears in my eyes but ill usually go to the bathroom and secretly cry. 

so basically every time anything bad happens, i immediately get super upset and feel depressed for a few hours, and usually nothing can make me feel better. is this normal? im scared its some disorder"
549,I just cut off ties with my toxic dad and I'm really paranoid,"Last night I announced to my mom that I want to stop seeing my dad every other weekend and I'm doing just that. He's always been manipulative and toxic, resulting in mental trauma and anxiety. Today, I blocked him on everything I had him on and he texted my best friend to try to contact me. He never talks to her.

Now I'm afraid he's going to show up at my house and raise hell. I'm scared. I'm paranoid that he is gonna roll up in front of my house and we're going to have to call the police to get him away. I got up in the middle of dinner and locked the door, I checked the window every time my dogs started to bark just to see no one.

My anxiety has been high all day but I've never experienced paranoia on this level before. Any help? I'm nearly trembling. It's very unlikely he'd do that because of the police and such, but the slight possibility is eating away at me. I've been a mess all day and the paranoia is just making it worse."
550,Psychiatrist prescribed a new med every time I see her.,"I’ve been going to this group for 2 years now. Initially I saw one psychiatrist that just prescribed me Lexapro. It worked well. Then he left and I saw the new one...who tries to push a med on me every visit. I’m now on something to help binge eating which I did need, but then she prescribed one to stop nightmares I was having. We had a tele-appt today and she prescribed two new ones, basically trying to find reasons for me to take it. One for mood stabilizing and one for anxiety. I’ve turned down other pills in the past.

Does anyone else go through this? I didn’t mind being on two prescriptions (lexapro and appetite suppressant) but these are adding up and I don’t think they do anything. If I tell her that, she just ups the dose. Is this normal?"
551,"I want to say I have tried everything, but I am still not satisfied.","To begin, I am an [old soul](https://lonerwolf.com/9-signs-youre-an-old-soul/). If you go through that article, almost 90% of it applies to me.

I am a male in my 30s and I feel... Empty. A lot of it has to do with me being an old soul and a lot of what I'm mentioning below can be explained by me being an old soul, but the feeling of living an aimless life is bothering me.

I have no ambitions, no goals, no emotional attachments to anything or anyone. So you can imagine I have no motivation to do anything what so ever. Don't get me wrong, I work 2 jobs (55 to 70 hours a week), have 2 hobbies (soccer and video games), am religious, and have a healthy relationship with my family. I have no friends to speak of and no girlfriend/wife - but that's a personal choice being an old soul and an introvert.

I have tried everything: 

1. I tried making friends, but found myself not wanting to hang out with them often. I enjoy being by myself more than being surrounded by people.
2. I picked up a new hobby: playing the piano.
3. I thought making a lot of money might change me: I make 6 figures now, bought a house and a Porsche.
4. Tried occupying my time with more work; hence my mention of me working 2 jobs above.
5. I read self-improvement books and watched videos.
6. Started going to the gym.
7. Did some volunteer work.

Nothing has changed. I still have ZERO interest in anything. I still have no goals, nothing to chase after, and no person I'm emotionally involved with. I feel empty.

I admit the one thing I have yet to try is to be in a long term meaningful relationship/get married, but I REALLY don't want to go down that route because if I feel like I made a mistake half way through, I don't want to break that person's heart by leaving. It's not something I can simply jump out of.

Anyone with insight?"
552,I don't know how I feel,"I don't really know what I'm hoping to gain from this but I just want to spill it all out and this seems as good a place as any.

Life doesn't feel real. I know its a really stupid thing to say but it feels like a video game. It feels like there's a world outside of this one but I'm trapped here, and the walls keep closing in. I've always been a scientific person but it feels like now all the rules of the universe are rules, and there's someone pulling the strings. My body doesn't feel like my own- just a meatsack thats gradually degrading and will one day fail me.

That's the worst thing- death. The whole concept terrifies me and makes me feel physically sick. I haven't been sick yet and thats even more frustrating, I just want it out of me. I'm not religious and I don't believe in an afterlife. The thought of just ceasing to exist makes me sick. I know there's that whole thing of before you were born but I exist now, I don't want to stop existing. And I know I'll never exist again once this is done. But how can you conquer the unconquerable? I can't avoid death, or tell myself its never going to happen. I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster, dragging me further and further to the end, while I can't stop it. I just want to get off.

I first had the realisation I was going to die two years ago, and I had the worst two weeks of my life. I was unconsolable, I broke down crying constantly, food had no taste. Eventually I got prescribed pills. In October last year those pills stopped working. My depression kicked in. It wasn't the fear so much, that was still held at bay. I became permanently tired, unmotivated, angry. I lashed out at friends and moaned about everything. I stopped going to lectures. I feel like I wasted a year of my university life. I've just done my exams and I completely flunked it, since I never learnt 90% of the content. I started a higher dose of medication, that didn't do anything. I switched to a different medication. That didn't work. I developed an allergy to coffee, more precisely the caffeine, so my regular treat started making me sick. Eventually came off the medication. The depression got slightly better, but the fear has gradually started to come back. It's getting stronger and stronger and I don't know what to do. I have had therapy, but that was for the depression, not the fear, and I've finished my allotted course now.

I just want to get off this ride. Which is stupid because it sounds suicidal, but thats the fear I have most.

So yeah, I'm just spilling my story, but not even the full story I guess, to strangers on the internet, using a throwaway of course, I'm not a complete idiot. Feel free to judge and criticise but I just want it off my chest."
553,My ocd is getting so fricking bad,"I cannot deal with this. After being in an abusive relationship every day I get extreme obsessive thoughts of being a bad person. He convinced me it was me, not him and now I've believed him. I am struggling so much, these thoughts are too much for me.

I'm not suicidal just at a cracking point"
554,Mood Swings,"The past few weeks I’ve been experiencing the worst mood swings ever. Like every hour or two I go from being in a great mood to just being down. I had my first therapy session yesterday, but we haven’t gotten into how to fix it yet. Does anyone have some advice on how to deal with or stop my mood from changing?"
555,What is reality if reality isn’t clear to you?,"May I ask you all about schizoaffective? I’m mainly just curious about when/what triggers an “episode” or lasting hallucination/delusion. What is the difference between hallucinating and having a delusion? What would some examples be besides seeing fire or thinking you’re god. Is it constant or can it be intermittent. As far as comorbidity, how likely is it to happen during a bipolar manic/depressive event. And most importantly how severe does it have to be to be considered part of schizoaffective?"
556,I think I'm a psychopath. How do I fix it?,I need to do something asap.... I need help. I don't wanna be sent to a mental hospital.. but what can I do to fix it
557,I need some help,"Hi Reddit i have a very severe case of anxiety, and also get very angry and aggressive fast. I have been supporting others mental health my whole life but never my own I feel like I am a failure because of my grades, whenever i try to talk to someone other than my therapist i always get shut down because they say  ""that I look to happy all the time to have mental health problems"" all I do is help others but i am slowly going crazy in the head and need some advice from Reddit I know you might think I am saying this for attention but i am not please someone tell me how to help myself before I try again"
558,I basically already know I'm going to commit suicide. I just don't know when,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons

I just don't know. My depression has returned after about a year of improvement. It just really sucks. I feel incredibly lonely and am so full of self-hatred. I don't enjoy any aspect of being alive. I just want to be done with it. The only reason I never did it before was because I didn't want to hurt my friends or family. But I feel like nobody really cares anyway. Nobody ever checks on me. If I don't reach out, it can go months without receiving a single text or call from anyone unless they want something. Last year I didn't even talk to my parents for around 4 months straight. I just feel worthless and incapable of living the life I dream about living. I'm so tired of this routine and working a job I hate just to barely scrape by. I graduated college but can't do anything in my field until I go back and get my Master's degree. I am so bad in social situations that I'm afraid of any job where I have to interact with people. For this same reason, I've never had any kind of meaningful relationship. I've only come semi close once but it ended up being very toxic and only worsened my depression. I just feel so tired of it all. I don't know what I'm doing and just want to die. I'm probably going to hang myself in the coming weeks."

560,I’m scared to tell my therapist so I’ll say these here..,"Ok first off, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in 2017 and I was given meds, mom thought using unnatural medicine was wrong, she took me off it (i was on lexapro and seroquel), I was put on seroquel in the psych ward when I wanted help and told my counselor I was suicidal and had homicidal ideations. My family guilt tripped me about it, it made me feel bad now I keep completely to myself. But anyways, anxiety, I keep having panic/anxiety attacks almost daily, I’m lucky some days and don’t have any, but I don’t know what triggers them or why they happen, it’s just all of a sudden my hearts beating fast, I can’t breathe and I feel like I’m burning up and start hyperventilating and crying. I can’t figure out why they happen or what caused them but I need helping getting them to stop. How do I find the trigger of them?

Second, I keep, I’d say blacking out for hours on end and I come back a few hours later and I don’t remember what I was doing or where I was and it freaks me out cause last week it happened again and my mom asked me what I was doing in my room cause I was making loud noises and she said she checked in on me and I was sitting at my desk listening to music, and I don’t remember any of it, and my mom told me she was sure I wasn’t asleep and my friend made the joke of being possessed and that made me paranoid and now I’m paranoid rn and idk what it is, idk how to stop it, I don’t want to self diagnose so once quarantine is over and I go to my therapist I’ll talk to her about it but I just need to know why this happens and what it is. Thank you if you read this, I’m struggling and I need help, thank you."
561,Suicidal thoughts getting out of hand,"Hi, I'm not sure how it ended up getting so bad that I need to ask for help but here it is. 

I'm a stable, loved and cared for guy with a great gf, great friends, good job and whatever else you might imagine that you'd tag a smile on. I was abused/tortured by my dad as a kid but that's it and lately this is getting to me.

Suicidal thoughts have been with me since as early as I was 5 or so I kind of grew up with them and never really took them seriously cause I just thought everyone has them. Recently I've had them everyday and there is absolutely no reason to have them in my situation. I presume I misunderstood the whole idea of being mentally healthy and that a good adult life doesn't necessarily mean that you are happy.

Should I see someone or talk about it? Or maybe I am just paranoid and it's totally normal?"
562,Does anyone know a way to make a bipolar parent seek treatment?,I’m 15 and I’m 90% sure my dad has bipolar disorder. He has always been stubborn and short tempered. I’m scared that if I don’t do something now he’ll never get help. Does anyone have any advice?

I am 17 years old and I need to talk to somebody who will understand me as a boy and not talk all of this crap about mental health and say we are here for you etc. I just want to be happy and make sure that I have a good life. I am currently going through a lot of stress right now, I am being recruited for the army my assessment doesn’t start till about 3 more week and my basic training is much later in the year. Mental health within the army has to be the best, but at the moment it currently isn’t good at all, I simply don’t want to be alive I need advice on how to speak to a parent/s my family is falling apart, I just don’t know what to do, a concoction of confusion and having no emotion but at the same time, wanting to carry on for the benefit of myself and my family.

564,Used cannabis every night to help my anxiety and depression. I’m trying to quit. But I feel so dependant on it.,"I’ve been smoking weed for a few years, and I’d say for the past 2 years or so, I’d smoke weed every night, all night until like 2 am. I’ve been on cipralex for about 3 years for anxiety, but it’s destroyed my libido. So my doctor added Wellbutrin to help in that department. It didn’t do nearly enough. I was smoking weed to help boost my libido and my appetite, as without cannabis, they are pretty much at zero. My doctor decided to try and taper me off the cipraex, to see if that worked. I was on 10mg, and I went to 5mg, which I’ve been on for about 2 weeks. Everything’s been going smoothly, until the other night. I smoked my regular weed, masturbated, and after I was done, I started feeling weird, and ended up having the worst panic attack of my life. My speech was all fucked up, I was slurring my words, couldn’t form sentences, was shaking, I thought I was having a stroke. Ended up calling an ambulance, and the paramedic said it was a panic attack. So now, I’m wondering if it’s the weed. I’ve been smoking the same amount and the same kind for a while now, so it’s weird it just hit me now. But now, I’m too nervous to touch cannabis, and I also would like to take a small break. But I’ve grown to be very dependant on weed. I have OCD, and weed was part of my night time ritual. Now that I don’t have it, I feel...empty, bored, hopeless, and depressed. I’m so used to smoking, and doing the same things every night. Now I don’t know what to do. Everything is boring again. I have no energy, and my depression is the worst it’s ever been. I’ve been almost at the brink of wanting to self harm. The only thought which brings me peace is suicide. That thought scares me, as I pretty much have nothing to live for. I know I have a hobby and stuff, but my depression has made everything just...meh. Weed helped boost that, and now, I have nothing. What the fuck am I supposed to do now?"
565,Emotional Detachment Issues?,"Hello! So I have a problem that I feel has been blooming for a number of years now. I have no genuine empathy or compassion. I can feel pity and obsession, which I have mistaken for the former two numerous times, but I cannot feel (or even fake) compassion most of the time. It pains me to say the phrase “I love you” to the point where I ended a relationship over it, since I could not tell my s/o that I love them. I can, however, feel compassion towards animals, babies, and elders. It’s strange. I genuinely cannot wrap my head around this. I wonder if it has something to do with human instincts and finding those groups to be cute or something. My guess for this issue is that my grandparents showered me in so much love that I became over saturated and numb to it. My family does tend to throw the phrase around a little more than the average family, my grandparents especially.

My other dilemma with empathy I feel is related to the compassion issue. When I was younger, my grandmother had anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, AND depression. She was VERY emotional because of this, and I took the blunt of it most of the time. I feel like her excessive sadness has not only been passed onto me (be it nature or nurture) but has also made me entirely numb to other people’s sadness. I will stand like a deer in headlights when someone starts to cry, my only thought being, “Damn. I hope they don’t cry on my shoulder, that would be nasty, haha.” I also have issues with feeling bad for current events because of this. If I see a news story about people dying or otherwise suffering, I feel... you guessed it.... Nothing! I realize this is absolutely despicable, and I find myself to be quite an awful person because of this, but I literally cannot help it. I WANT to change. I need to know how to help this. Is there any treatment available? I read that identifying the trauma is a big key issue, but I have no trauma. None. It’s not repressed- there is nothing TO repress. I’m literally just a person who’s spent way too much time in the clouds and can’t find a way out. I daydream quite a lot, as I am an artist and I enjoy thinking about my creations, so I feel like losing touch with reality so much has worsened my mental health. But I can’t help it. With the world crumbling around me, why wouldn’t I want to live in my little dream world?

I don’t necessarily need a diagnosis for this issue (though one would be appreciated) but rather a solution. If anyone has any suggestions for reconnecting with my emotions, I would appreciate it so much. Thanks."
566,I'm a mess. This is just scratching the surface.,"I'm new to Reddit, this is my first post (reposted and rewritten). Please be gentle. It may even be prudent to say ""trigger warning""  even though I'm not going into details.
If I'm in the wrong place, please let me know.  I originally posted this in dating over 40, as I'm 42, but this really has more to do with mental health than dating. 

I'm seriously damaged sexually.  Multiple assault survivor.  Beginning At the age of 6 to the age of almost 8... when my best friend's dad got ahold off me... At 19 i was drugged by my boyfriend. At 22 i was beaten and stripped but not raped. With each event, my boundaries disappeared a little more. Promiscuity became the answer, can't rape the willing.

I'm the girl that dates the r/niceguys.  I've accidentally dated multiple pedophiles, multiple perverts, and many sweet losers. I seem to have no standards that i require anyone to live up to.  I spend all my time trying to make everyone else happy.  For years i was proud that my existence was justified by my willingness to please

I married a man that was excited by my promiscuity, and for 18 years we've been the best of friends and happily in an open marriage. We've always been perfect for each other. I'm a loyal, caring, loving, can cook, and am a decent provider (now that I've gone to school). He was a fantastic provider and encouraged me to go to school and get an education. 
Along the way, I ended up in an almost 5 year relationship with a man that I'm still in love with, despite it being over now for nearly 2 years, and the boyfriend not really being that good of a guy.  The chemistry was right, that's about all.  

That man, spent the entire time teaching me that who I've always been is actually ""broken"". He spent all this time showing me that while it doesn't have to be about sex, that sex can be extremely passionate, mutually gratifying, and enjoyable.  I've described him as ""the best vanilla ice cream anyone could ever have"".

Then, almost 2 years ago, when my husband retired for medical reasons and needed constant care, my boyfriend decided to end things. Said that he respected my husband too much to steal his wife, and dumped me even though there had been no talk of such things. 

Hubby and i rarely have sex, because of his health issues, but our marriage is still very open. I am welcome to have a boyfriend.

However, I no longer know who i am.  Promiscuity has always been a defining feature for me. My mindset change is affecting my marriage, and my search for a new boyfriend because I'm no longer am happy with no foreplay, no passion. 

Because now I'm educated, have a professional, respectable job in a small judgemental town, and spent the majority of 5 years being told to respect myself more i just don't want to be passed around anymore. I'm craving so much more that random, disconnect sex with no intimacy.

However, now, as i look for a new boyfriend, all my old habits and hunting grounds have stayed the same.  Tinder, POF, okcupid, all result in nothing but so called ""nice guys"" who, in the end, are looking for the Old Me.

I don't know where to go or what to look for to find another one that encourages me to respect myself, but will accept that my husband isn't going anywhere.

Maybe it's not possible?


Edit: i have started therapy with a therapist i have high hopes for, unfortunately, I've only had my first appointment with her. 

I'm a firm believer that therapy only helps those willing to help themselves... I just don't know where to start"
567,Nickocado Avocado,"*I am not trolling, I just don't know a lot of science about mental health.* 

Nickocado Avocado is a mukbang Youtuber. A mukbang is a South Korean trend that started in 2010 and it is where people record themselves eating ungodly amounts of calories. 

**I have seen videos about Nickocado Avocado**

* Abusing fellow mukbanger (Stephanie Soo)
* Verbally and physically abusing his husband (or ex-husband. They keep splitting up and getting back together so it could change when this post is posted.). Nick's husband is Orlin. When Orlin fights back, Nick acts like the victim. Nick puts the blame on Orlin.
* Mental breakdowns (he said he liked the attention)

Nickocado also says that he thinks junk food rots his mind and attitude. Is that true?

*In my opinion, I think it would just not give you enough energy. I doubt that it would be so extreme to be manipulative, narcissistic and abusive. I don't think it just changes someone's morals and norms.*"
568,I might be giving up dance because of body image issues," Goddammit, I can't believe I'm actually considering letting go of something that used to make me so happy. I've been taking dance classes for almost ten years, but I've been taking a break for several months now because I can't handle how anxious it's been making me. My body image issues go beyond just thinking I look ""fat"" (although that is part of the problem as I am currently recovering from an eating disorder). I literally am repulsed by my body, especially anything ""sexual"" such as my boobs or any ""womanly"" curves. I can usually manage my issues if I wear SUPER baggy clothes and avoid mirrors; however I can not do this in dance class. I spent my last few dance classes just trying to hide that I was having an anxiety attack. I managed to keep myself from crying and hyperventilating until I was able to get to the privacy bathroom, but I'm scared I won't be able to do that every time.

I really want to go back to dancing, but it's torture for me to have to wear a form fitting dress and look at myself in the mirror for an entire hour every week. I also don't know what to tell my teacher. I am not comfortable sharing my real reason for quitting, but on the other hand I have known her for almost half my life, and I don't want her to think I've lost interest if I don't come back because that's not the case at all.

Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated"
569,I usually have weird nonsensical dreams that make sense. But recently I’ve been going through a hard time and my dreams have been more bizarre and creepy.,"If you consider nightmares as a horror genre I would say my dreams are more of the thriller variety. I’m still creeped out and sometimes a little scared by them. But they aren’t horrifying like my nightmares were when I was a kid. For example, had a dream where I bought a new face from a guy and didn’t have the money to pay. So I ran and he chased me and tried to get the $400 I owed him. I only had $60 so he said he would be back. Then in my dream I went home, and the front door was being knocked on rather hard, I ran upstairs to grab my gun. And loaded it, screamed into the void “identify yourself” but the void revealed two shadowy figures. I couldn’t pull the trigger, as they came closer it was revealed to be my brothers with creepy smiles on their faces. I woke up after they revealed their faces. I have continued to have weird dreams like this that put me on edge. I wake up in a weird mood too. Could this mean anything since it started out of nowhere."
570,A weight of my shoulders,"Like many, for me this year has been a turbulent time for my own mental health. I have come to the decision to go actively come off all types of social media and have messaged the important people in my life how they can contact me for the foreseeable future. 

It may only be for a few day’s or could be a long term decision but I feel this is will be beneficial for me  with all that is going on at the moment. 

I have found social media beneficial to keep in touch with people and get back in touch with people I haven’t spoke to in years due to lockdown but feel this is the right time to reflect on myself and how I can move forward in the future.

Have any of you had social media breaks and has it helped you in some way?"
571,I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me.,"I’m too tired to write a long text, so I’m just gonna use bullet points:
- I’m almost always tired.
- I go to sleep too late and I wake up too late. I usually go to sleep between 2-5 am, and I wake up between 12-5 pm. 
- I hate everything about myself.
- I didn’t ask for this life.
- My grades are shit, but I don’t have any energy or motivation to change it.
- I’ve always hated school.
- I don’t have any motivation to do anything. 
- It’s exhausting to be social.
- I can’t do presentations in front of the class because I just freeze.
- My life is boring.
- I don’t have the energy to do anything about it though.
- My mom hates me.
- I cut myself (RIP to my right leg).
- I wash my hands too much.
- I have to redo stuff.
- This text takes a long time to write because I have to rewrite it.
- I have one close friend (who isn’t my brother).
- Life is useless to me, we’re all gonna die anyways.
- It feels like I exaggerate my problems.
- I don’t know if it’s all because of mental illness or if I’m just a dumb fuck. 
- I’m tired now, so sorry for sounding mean.

Any advice on what I can do?"
572,Why don’t I care about relationships?,"Didn’t really know where to post this. Basically I put working on myself over everything (gym, money, education, books, fashion). It’s like all day everyday I just think of how can I be better the next. I feel like I’m very self centered.I don’t care really about anyone’s opinions of me and don’t focus on getting a girlfriend at all really. I hookup in college but that’s about it girl wise. Everyone around me gets upset over not dating or is in a relationship and I just don’t see any benefit to one. (M21). Is this abnormal for my age? Should I focus on myself less? 

TLDR: I care a lot about myself. Not much about others. Am I an emotionless robot or something?"
573,I’m just lost man,Idk what to do with myself. Can’t get over my ex. I left her. Regret it immensely. Moved out of state. I feel helpless and can’t get out of my head. I’m already on meds for anxiety depression sleep and anti psychotic but fuck I feel like shit y’all. Idek what to do. Want to talk to her but don’t wanna make things difficult for her. She doesn’t hate me. But idk. Literally it’s all I can think about. It’s been almost a year and I’m still this way. I don’t feel like I can ever forgive myself. Don’t feel like I can ever get past this. Ijdk. This sucks
574,Here for anyone who needs it!!,"All my life I've struggled with anxiety and depression not knowing what it was. I was the happiest outgoing kid but yet sometimes something would come over me and Id push everyone away and get depressed. Eventually it all hit at once and the past 2 years of my life have been the worst, I was the complete opposite of who I was and no one seemed to care. I haven't even been to school or talked to people I knew for years in 2 years and everyone I meet I assume is gonna hate me so I dont give them any chance. However!! I think Im finally coming out of it and just living my life as its short and doing the things I enjoy with people I can be comfortable with and trying to let new people in. Having no one was really hard because everyone loves you at your best yet wants nothing to do with you at your worst because they dont want to deal with that negativity and maybe thats just how life goes. If anyone wants to talk about stuff or even just wants a new friend to get their minds off things I'm always here and open to everyone I'm a very non-judgemental person. Mental health is a very common thing and yet so hard to see so don't think its not normal or be discouraged. For a long time I thought I was weird or didnt belong here just because I struggled with mental health and self esteem but trust me thats not the case. Its also normal to not want to or know how to speak about things which is fine aswell just know things get better lads and the right people and things to make you realise that are out there for u!! Keep trying everyday consistency is key. I wish you all the best in life stay up :))"
575,Experiences with therapy as an African American?,"Hi there, Im just looking for responses here for my own knowledge. I started therapy a couple weeks ago and it has been life changing. Wondering if any of my fellow brothers and sisters have gone or are considering going? If no, why? If yes, how has the experience been for you thus far?"
576,My therapist passed away on Sunday,"I got the call today, it was very unexpected. My therapist passed away this last Sunday after having complications from giving birth. I am ripped apart. I don’t know what to do because the person I normally go to for this type of pain isn’t there anymore. Life sucks. We used to sit together and say that a lot and it brought me comfort. I miss her so much. I’m so sad. I keep thinking about all the progress I’ve made since our last session that I won’t be able to update her on. This is so traumatic. I’m sad for her family, coworkers, newborn. Idk why life is the way it is."
577,It always feels so hard to let people in.,"It comes from my family if origin. It was a mentally and emotionally abusive household. I developed addiction. I’m over a year clean of substances. Much less for behaviors though. Sex addiction has been my biggest downfall. I’m married and it’s often hard for me to even let my wife in. When I want to let her in and I know I need help, I don’t know how I’m feeling because I still subconsciously shove down my emotions. And when I try to look for them, I feel numb. I have a history of suicide as well. I tried about two weeks ago and talked to my counselor about it. It’s easier for me to manage dangerous situations because for some chaotic reason it’s comfortable. I don’t really even feel any attachment to this post. I just feel numb right now and beat down."
578,Do I deserve psychiatric help?,"I’ll start with a little bit of background information;

For the past 3 or so years I’ve dealt with very intense and abrupt mood swings, a growing fear that people can hear my thoughts and are watching me (this started about 7-8 years ago, it first developed when I had a fear over it and it’s spiraled into paranoia? I’m not sure if my fear would be classified as paranoia, I don’t want to be insensitive towards people that deal with actual paranoia), as well as an unhealthy amount of thinking (and crying/getting angry) about a traumatic experience I had almost five years ago. 

Less severe symptoms would include a lack of interest/motivation to do things I used to be so passionate about, lacking an emotional response to what people tell me (which happens quite often but not all the time, I don’t understand why sometimes my emotions are so intense, and other times I feel nothing at all), and me involuntarily acting like a little kid when I get really angry/sad/stressed. I try to hide the little kid one when I’m in public tho, I don’t want to be a freak. 

And now back to my original question; Am I deserving of psychiatric help? I want to see a psychiatrist because every time I have a mood swing that makes me sad, it’s always overwhelming and I feel so desperate for help, but whenever my mood switches back to being content, I feel so stupid for even thinking I need or deserve help. I’m not sure if I should see a psychiatrist or not, I’d appreciate some outside opinions."
579,Best friend/roommate. Need advice,"Sup everyone.

So my buddy who Ive been living with for a few years now seems to have some sort of tick/cumpulsion. 

It started a few years back when it looked like he ate something sour all of a sudden. His eyes would kind of flutter and then close and he would stammer for a second or two before continuing as normal. 

Fast forward a few months and he would start making this snorting kind of noise every few minutes or so, replacing that stammer/flutter I mentioned above. That snorting noise (although still there) for the most part has graduated to a gulping/grunt sound, usually in rapid succession. It seems compulsive and random, but I've never wanted to bring it up in fear of not conveying my concern correctly or making him feel self conscious about something he might not be able to control. Whatever this is seems to be developing and changing over time. Should I mention something and talk to him about it or just continue to look completely past it as if it isn't happening? He has a girlfriend who I live with as well whom I assume notices everything I do, but everyone acts as if nothings happening as far as I can tell. Should I approach her about it? Maybe it's just not my place?

Any advice appreciated. Thanks."
580,I feel guilty for having had an eating disorder,"Throughout my teenage years, I struggled with an eating disorder. Ultimately, it go so bad that I almost had to withdraw from school. I am grateful that I was able to seek out therapy and recover. 

I don't really talk about my struggles with anyone because I feel guilty that they exist. I have a normal , loving family. I'm privileged (white, middle class), and I have a strong support system. So, I am reluctant to be part of any conversation about  trauma/mental health/resilience because I feel as though me participating in the conversation silences those who actually dealt with adversity. Thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I feel guilty for struggling with my mental health because I have not experienced any outside adversity."
581,I just don't want to celebrate my birthday next year.,"Okay, this is sort of a half vent half advice kinda post? A throwaway account because I just don't want my main account to be linked to this post, even if someone people that find it will in fact know who posted it.

Okay, first thing first, I've been talking with a friend and half-jokingly said about how I really, really think that I won't live past 30, nothing like I have concrete plans to end it right then and there, it's just that I'm constantly tired, I already think the age I've reached (24NB) is pretty good as it is. And the prospect of living a long, constantly exhausted life just doesn't seem all that enticing.

Once again, there are no serious plans on ending my life before I reach the 30s, this is all me just being plain and honest, I don't see myself living much further past that age because honestly I just haven't planned much for it. The problem comes that after saying that, I had a small realization for myself.

I kinda don't wanna celebrate birthdays anymore. I just don't feel like it's a celebration cause for me, they don't cause me any stress and I'm happy to see my family whenever my birthday comes around, but I just don't feel happy pretending that it's been yet another happy year and that this one will be better.

It hasn't been happy, and it hasn't been much better, not for a long time anyways. I just don't know how to approach this new feeling? Should I talk about it with my family? Close friends first? I just need something so this stupid thing doesn't eat me inside the moment my 25th is approaching.

Uh. Anything to say, reddit? Any advice? Judgements? General shitposts on my expense? At this point, anything is appreciated, I just needed to get this out somewhere and have someone to talk to."
582,My mom died,"So, my mom passed away 3 weeks ago. She practically grew me up by herself - my dad left our family at some point. She went through cancer twice - and the second one was IV stage, she managed to get proper treatment and she seemed like she was getting better, but she didnt. She couldnt get chemo because of covid quarantine and during these three months she got really bad. I was with her the last few weeks, because she could barely do anything by herself. The day she died she had told me that the cancer is finally getting her and we all know it, including herself. I saw her last breaths and i think that shit is burned straight into my brain and i keep rewinding that moment even though i obviously dont want to. Im left with no family, mom’s bank credit debts that equal to a large sum and im just 18 and i havent even finished senior year. Shit got tough real quick and im just so fucking disoriented and confused, like, i dont really know where life will lead me now. Dont want to sound like a wimp, but man, im not handling it"
583,I'm in recovery from burnout but can't decide whether to re-start my career,"I'm a 50-ish male who has held various high-level engineering positions in the tech industry. Unfortunately a combination of life events and over-work led to stress, anxiety, panic attacks and finally exhaustion, I suppose what could be described as burnout, in 2017.

I sat in a Starbucks one lunchtime and decided I'd had enough and needed a career change. I started training to be a counsellor (psychotherapist) - I've still got a couple of years to go before I'm fully qualified. And here's my problem; Money is running a bit low at the moment, and I've been approached by a headhunter about a well paid opportunity in a tech company. The usual high-level position with loads of responsibility.

Taking the position would mean giving up on the counselling course, as I doubt I'll be able to take time off to pursue it. And my wife would be delighted with all that money coming into the house. But, I can't think clearly enough to make the right decision here.

I'm terrified that taking a position like that would be a major setback for my mental health. But I'm tempted by the money.... if I could hold it down for a year even it'd be a nice amount of cash.

Has anyone had any similar experiences?"
584,please help me,"am i a bad person?

(tw: briefly mentions rape &amp; suicidal thoughts)

about a year and a half ago, potentially more, i was in the most horrific and toxic relationship of my life, with a manipulative and controlling person. 
I was 18 and coming out of the worst point of my life having just gotten through dealing with a lot of childhood trauma, rape, anxiety, depression and suicidal tendencies. this ex was aware of this and almost seemed to use it against me. 
this ex frequently called my friends and i sluts, would shame us for body counts and dressing in any way other that completely modest. i’d have to approve outfits if i was going out, id have to tell him who i was with, where and why, and there’d be a multitude of conditions. 
i’m not saying this makes what happened excuseable, but i think this is what led me to do something so out of the ordinary. 
i drank copious amounts that night with my friends, to the point i remember very little of the night. 
i woke up the next morning in a strangers bed, still in my pants but in a t shirt that wasn’t mine. i didn’t feel like i’d had sex, but i was terrified none the less. i felt overwhelming fear, and horrific amounts of guilt. i immediately left and have never contacted this person again. 
i don’t believe i’m the type to do anything of the sort, however my drinking when i was with this person would get out of control the few times i was given permission to do so. 

I’m in a loving and happy relationship now, and i don’t even look at anyone else, but i can’t help but have anxiety over this situation, am i a horrible person and is this relationship doomed to fail? i couldn’t bare to hurt this person, and i don’t think i will, but sometimes late at night these thoughts keep me up and i spiral. 

thank you in advance"
585,A second wave of depression,"I don't know what to do anymore. I am 19 years old, I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 15 or 16. I went to counseling and got on meds. I moved away for school last year and was the happiest I have ever been in my life; I was finally in control of my brain and kicking all of my worst mental habits. Life was fantastic and the future looked even better. I was completely off my meds by March and I was so proud of myself and my progress.

Then everything happened. With COVID-19, I had to move back home and I have been here now for 3 months. I miss my friends, I miss my life, I miss my city, and I miss my happiness. I am back to square one with my depression and anxiety, but this time it seems so much worse because there are actual tangible things in the world to be upset and sad and distressed and scared about on top of my regular brain things. Being back in this depression is my worst nightmare. I find myself just constantly wishing I didn't have to exist right now. Existing is painful. I'm so lost. I just had to get this out."
586,"i cannot and will not do anything, not that i don't want to, it's something else...","i've been feeling like this for about 3-4 days, and it's gotten bad enough to where im starting to feel kind of insane.

before this started i was just living my normal, boring quarantine life. i was talking to friends on discord, playing minecraft, drawing, browsing twitter, and watching youtube.

i ended up doing this on a daily basis, which seems unhealthy. i dont know if it is, but that's my guess.

one time, i was in the bathroom on my phone. and then my mind put this question in my head, ""what the hell are you doing with your life?"" i stopped doing what i was doing and sat there, on the toilet with a blank stare on my face. i was like this for about six minutes.

i got up, and went back to my room. i tried shrugging it off. it worked, kind of. i felt this again the next day. 

later that same day, my mother and her boyfriend got me dinner. it was my usual order from taco bell. three meat and cheese burritos, and two cheese rollups. i could only eat two burritos. normally i would eat the whole thing. but this time i couldn't.

my mind felt empty and numb. i felt like crying, but i couldn't. i even felt like collapsing, but i didn't.

i don't know what emotion i feel. i understand people have routines and habits. this doesn't feel like that though. it feels like a cycle. i don't want to do it, but my body has gotten so used to it that when i try and do something else, i stop after only 15 minutes.

i want to do something else. i always think stuff like, ""oh, i forgot, i really want to do this"" and ""i want to do that, it'll be fun."" but it never happens

i feel like i can't even control my own body. like, it's gotten so used to my daily habits and has developed a mind of its own based on that.

i want out.

i want to be free."
587,I don't recognize myself,"Today in the morning, while I bathed with my eyes completely closed so as not to see my naked body. I realized how miserable my life has been since the quarantine began, I have no way of sustaining the expenses of having a disorder. I know that my disorder is real because there are days when it is very obvious. I don't look like I perceive myself in the mirror, I know, but sometimes it is very difficult to differentiate what is real from what is not. That girl is so fat and horrible, but I can't stop eating, I don't want to stop doing it. I have broken the scale and cannot measure my waist again. I want to feel better ... my life is being consumed. I've finally stopped wearing clothes to tie my fat. Sorry, my English is not very good but I am ashamed to tell this story in my native language."
588,My Best friend doesn't trust me,"Hey Reddit, 

My best friend in the world (also my only friend in the world) has fallen into a sort of... depression/body dysmorphia.  She hates her body but I love it, shes perfectly healthy... possibly underweight already even. (shes really skinny and smoll) Yesterday, she posted something on her snapchat story along the lines of ""why cant I be happy with my body? Why am I so stupid? Why am I not society's definition of beauty?"" 

When I asked her what was wrong, she wouldn't tell me so I had one of her other friends (one that shes never met irl, an online friend) talk to her. She told him everything easily while i barely got a &gt;!damn!&lt; answer out of her. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm not a real friend to her. Like I'm dirt to her. My own anxiety has been going up because of this Corona thing, etc.  I feel like she doesn't even like me, like im just a burden to her that she doesn't care abt. 

I asked her again today ""whats wrong, plz tell me"" and she told me ""popcorn"" she's obviously not taking me seriously and shes taking her internet friends really seriously.  I feel like she never liked me and is only now showing it. 

Am i to blame? Is this my fault? I was only trying to help..."
589,A Short Film About Real Issues in the World,"Hello everybody. My name is Cole, I am a filmmaker and writer. I am currently working on a new short film concept and I need some help for my character development. This concept of this short film is as follows. *""When a worldwide outbreak hits a small town, the whole town goes into lockdown allowing no one to leave their homes. Five friends are restricted to just video calls to keep their very tight friendship strong. Only thing is, each friend has a different issue at home from domestic abuse, drug addiction and suicidal depression. The fight of keeping each other safe while not being able to be in contact with each other shows the struggles this lockdown has put upon their friendships and personal lives.""*I am looking for anyone who is willing to come forward with their stories to help me write my characters correctly and well. I fully understand that these are very sensitive subjects and I will keep all posts or messages confidential if you want me too. I would really appreciate anyone who is comfortable and willing to come forward to me and help me out. The story for this project is a very real issue that has happened during these lockdowns and quarantine. Thank you again for anyone who is willing to help me. This is what I am looking for help on this particular character,  *Jaimee is quiet and to herself around others besides her friends, she suffers from depression and self harm.*"
590,Feeling disconnected... what’s going on?,"Okay I came here to talk about some things I’m experiencing and have experienced for as long as I can remember. I generally feel very disassociated from the world around me and find it hard to focus on the things that are actually relevant to my life, but get so lost in activities that allow me to escape. For example at school, I know I’m very smart and creative and could do well. I just find it so hard to apply myself, same at the internship where I work. I just can’t find the motivation to care about things that involve people other than myself. This has manifested itself in my relationships as well. I have a lot of friends, but (and this may sound bad) I don’t really care about or particularly love them a lot, and I don’t feel like I can tell them about my problems or the way I feel. I don’t even talk to my mom about my problems. I used to self harm, and to this day nobody knows. A lot of people want to be around me and live vicariously through me since I do a lot of exciting and reckless things, but there’s nobody around me who I feel like I can sit down and have a talk about my feelings and shit (which is why I’m on reddit for help lol). And I don’t think this is an issue with not having found the right people, since I’ve been friends with a lot of different types of people. I feel that I have to keep up this exterior of a fun party girl who’s a little bit kooky but not too kooky or people will be put off. It’s just very draining for me. I used to think I may be a narcissist, since I tend not to consider other people ever lol. But I don’t think that really fits me since I have times where I have extremely low self esteem and even see myself as evil. I’m not really sure if any of this makes sense at all but I’m sure someone else feels this way. It’s really hard for me to live a normal life since I’m just so wrapped up in myself, I tend to behave irresponsibly and recklessly. And I know that what I do is seen as wrong by others, but I just can’t see it as wrong myself. Another example of this is shoplifting, i steal something almost every time I go to a big chain store. And I know it hurts the workers and most people see stealing as morally wrong, I just don’t see it as a problem and I know that’s a problem but I don’t want to change. Anyways this is a lot but if someone could try to point me in the right direction that would help?? I just need to be able to function and have a career and maintain relationships but right now I just cannot."
591,"Felt bad, but here's some truth","So I (26f) self harmed again, last Monday. Before that it was... 4 years I think. I didnt think about it for a long time. I dont talk about it with people, I think its generally a hard conversation to have about how my brain reacts with overwhelming panic to stress triggers when there's people with real problems working hard to overcome them. My mental health is a real problem for me, but I'm working on it. 


I'm proud of me for every day I didn't, and I'm proud of me for not giving in to that urge more often. 
I'm proud of you for every day clean you have, you're doing a great job. Keep up the good work, &amp; don't forget that its going to be okay."
592,I have a problem with lying.,"Maybe lying isn't even the right word. As long as I can remember I have always had this need to have secrets - things that are just for me. 

As a kid it was things that I knew i wasn't supposed to have. For example, when I was about 8 I had a jar of peanut butter in my closet and would just use my fingers to eat a big huge bite every couple of days. I took it because my mom got mad at my sister for dipping her fingers in the peanut butter jar, so I decided i wanted to hide the jar. I liked that it was something I wasn't supposed to be doing, even if it wasn't even a big deal. My mom eventually found the jar and I got in trouble, but then I just found a new secret. 

As a teenager it became porn, and when I got to college it became me telling small lies about my life to my roommate, or sometimes I would just go a week without doing homework or going to class without saying anything to anyone. Small things just to get the rush of having done something wrong and it being a secret. 

Eventually I met a girl and we got married and then eventually divorced. One of the first things that we would fight about was my little lies and secrets. My ex-wife was pretty religious when I met her (she eventually mellowed out and became an atheist but that is another story) and she was VERY anti-Game of Thrones, so the first secret I had from her was reading all the books and then watching the show when she wasn't with me. It was never anything huge or relationship shattering, but it was little things that I knew she wouldn't like. I had to have my secret. 

I have now been divorced for 3 years. I live alone and I am very depressed. I have gained like 40 pounds this year, I dont really have any friends, and all I do is sleep, watch TV, and go to work. But honestly one of the things that has been nagging at the back of my mind is that I don't have a secret. I havent had a secret in a long time now and it has been just sitting in my head taunting me because I don't even have anyone to have a secret from. All of my family live mulitple states away and I dont talk to them much. I literally can't have a secret right now. 

I am not really sure what the point of this post is, just to vent I guess. I know I need therapy but I can't really afford it right now. Sorry to ramble so much, this was just something I needed to put out into the void. Thanks if you read this far."
593,I’m having dark thoughts about hurting my mom.,"I love my mom, but these thoughts won’t go away. It’s driving me crazy. Is there something wrong with me? 

I have an urge to go downstairs to my mom and grab a kitchen knife and stab her. I’m trying my best not to and taking my mind off of it. What can I do to stop this?

I’m currently taking one pill which has rare side effects such as suicidal thoughts and depression but nothing that matches what I’m thinking."
594,"Everytime I am a bit happy, my brain keeps on thinking that I am forgetting something upsetting","Everytime I am happy, it feels like my brains puts a lot of effort to dissuade me from it. It keeps on bringing back past memories that hurt me. Some embarrassing moments, some things that I can't forgive myself from, somethings where someone hurt me, just anything that makes me feel anxious and sad. I don't know if it is a symptom of a mental illness or not, I have never gotten myself checked but I find it very hard to stay in a stable mood since 2018. Can someone please help me out here in how to cope up with this kind of thinking?"

596,whats wrong with me,2 years ago I broke up with my ex and regret it ever  since. When I did it I didn't feel anything untill hours later then I broke down driving to her place to get my things. I have had opportunities to be with somone yet I choose not to go any further then friends. I want to find somone but when chances arise or I get a match I dont act upon it. Im a very charismatic guy and im always out and about with my friends. Everyone says they enjoy my company and when my homie says he love me (no homo) i blow it off and feel uncomfortable. I just don't know what step to take to help myself. I think about my ex every other day but it isn't me loathing in what I had. What can I do?
597,Why do I feel like this sometimes?,"I've never been diagnosed with anything but I'm fairly sure I have depression and anxiety and I think its the anxiety that is causing this, as it only happens in situations where I feel the most anxious.

Simply put, for about 10 years or so now I've felt like a passenger in my own body, I have control but it just feels like I'm watching someone else control it, everything feels surreal as if it doesn't exist and there have been times where I've felt like I've lost consciousness but I didn't. I know its not a physical illness or at the very least something physical that I could potentially die from because not only have I experienced this for 10 years but I've also had an ECG to check my heart as well as tests to make sure my lungs are good as well as all the other generic check ups you get.

I don't always feel like this too, and times when I'm generally happy I don't experience it at all, I don't experience it when drunk too. I know I should see a doctor or psychiatrist about this but I don't see the point if it does happen to be what I think it is."
598,Emotional outbursts/anger/anxiety,"I’ve been in and out of therapy for over ten years now. I started in highschool because I was actively trying to take my life and reached out for help.
My story isn’t unique, I had a challenging life growing up but I didn’t realize it wasn’t normal until I was older. I’ve also repressed my emotions as I wasn’t allowed to express myself emotionally, and would often be punished for it.
I’ve been doing the work, got away from home. For good jobs. Learned how to drive and bought a car. Stepped out of my comfort zones. Learned to say no (kinda wip) , exercise often weekly. done everything I can to improve my quality  of life . I’m getting older and I feel myself getting angrier inside . I’ve had trauma . I’m still working through those I guess but it’s taking a toll on me emotionally and mentally. I’m angry every day. It’s to the point I want to be left alone when I get home. It’s not fair to my spouse, we have our own issues but I know I play a part of it .
I try being present and letting things go but I feel so overwhelmed and stimulated I want to start pulling my hair out and rocking.
I’m so shut off emotionally I don’t find joy in things anymore at all. This COVID has been a real strain too bc my spouse is working from home, but the whole time I was working out in it w very limited staff so overworked and overstimulated . I feel like I try to explain myself. But I just get hit with “how can I help?” I can’t answer that question. Or I get hit with “I want to avoid you.” I don’t want that either I just want to be respected when I’m feeling drained. 

I will be going back to therapy , because at this point I don’t see much of a choice. But does anyone have advice ? I am having a hard time sharing my space with someone at home and also dealing w work. I feel incapable of fulfilling my job at work and my role at home.
I also feel like I’m not understood when I do try to explain it. I’m pretty verbal so I do try to use my Insight to express how I’m feeling and grow from it I just worry I’m doing more damage to myself and my home life. We’re also overwhelmed as new home owners and I am not at home enough to provide help with tasks around the house and when I am home I just could care less.  I also feel like when I’m venting people take it personally even tho I keep saying this isn’t about you I’m opening up. So I don’t feel comfortable opening up anymore 

I dunno , I’ve recently opened up about my last abuse and trauma and it’s freshly outed . I just want to be at peace and not bring people down around me.

I’ve been diagnosed w extreme anxiety disorder but they also tried to diagnose me with bipolar which they ruled out. Mainly I get overworked when too much is thrown at me I become overwhelmed and cannot focus and get angry . I am a perfectionist too and I also feel like I don’t pick up well on social cues so I need direct answers or I won’t get it, just didn’t know if anyone else could relate ? And if they had advice"
599,All hell broke loose today.,"Hello I’m really just on here to vent and talk. Me and my wife are veterans out of the army. Which is great we both hated the army and are much happier. My wife has history of suicidal tendencies and such. Well this weekend she got super paranoid they I have been watching her and stalking her threw her apps and such. Well I got her calmed down and thought everything was good

Well today I woke up she says I went threw her phone and shit which I never did. I couldn’t control her and I left and took myself out of the situation. Well she drove to my dads house and almost took a gun. I ended up calling the cops because we didn’t know if she actually took one. So I finally talk her into going into the hospital. She hasn’t called me or anything and I’m super worried she hasn’t really been this bad in a while 

Also my dad and brother just want me to turn my back on her and I refuse to do this. I’ve known her since middle school and I love her. They told me if she really wanted to do she would have done it. They said I’m just being used. So I left there house and came back to my apartment."
600,No point in anything,I just don’t feel like there’s a point to anything. Everything I do doesn’t feel right there’s always something in the back of my head that doesn’t let me function. I laugh all the time but after I’m just blank. I don’t know how to explain it. Every interaction I have with another person feels like I’m just not there. What’s wrong with me.
601,My best friend helped me in a strange way.,"So my best friend today took my to a local gift shop that his girlfriend was working at and took my to the knives section. Which I though was a bad idea as he knows I relapse on occasion. But what he did next shocked me, he got one with the girl I likes name. It's one of those knives with the name engraved on the outside. Now this may seem weird to most of you, but what he told me was borderline genius. 

He said ""Namrood if you ever feel like self harming and dont want to talk to me about it, fine. But I want you to have this one because you'll think of her whenever you're feeling that low and you'll at least get a bit happier"" My best friend basically is forcing me to whenever I wanna cut, I gotta think about the girl I love. He also took me to the lake and made me throw my old knife that I used away so that the only real knife I could use without destroying my own kitchen knives was that one. He is probably the best friend anyone could ask for and used a creative way to help my when I relapse."
602,i have no motivation to do anything,is it something that might be fixable or is it just my personality and i cannot change it?
603,Tired of the stereotypes rant,"I’m gon apologize for the rant here in advance, I just am frustrated. There are so many other things in addition to this I would like to talk about, but this is it for now I guess. Sorry in advance, you can’t say I didn’t warn you. 

I have been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses (Anxiety disorders, clinical depression, PTSD), and each one has its own painful stigmas and stereotypes. But one that stands out to me, that has been given little effort to understand by many, is social anxiety. I feel like it’s largely swept under the rug as being “all in your head” and “your fine, you are overreacting” etc. when in reality it’s much worse then a bit of normal anxiety. In reality It’s like everything I say, every small movement, even how I breathe feels like its being judged constantly. I feel like people are watching me or ignoring me on purpose. It feels like everybody has some malicious intent with me 24/7 and there is little to no things I can do to ease it. It makes me feel like I’m missing out on my own life, but I’m too afraid to try. I hate when people tell you they are “socially anxious” because to a degree that is normal anxiety and that’s okay, but they downplay those with severe anxiety. They say you’re overreacting, they don’t understand your habits and mannerisms you’ve developed, it’s annoying. When I say “they” I mean even family and close friends, well especially them. They don’t stay up until 6 am wondering if that thing they did last year hurt somebody. They don’t avoid their own best friends that they’ve had since fourth grade and family because you don’t want to lose them once they find out about certain parts of you. You hide your interests and hobbies and don’t joke around in fear that someone will judge you for it. Talking comes so unnatural for you yet you crave interaction. You cut yourself off from the world and come off as shy, and when you do try people call you an asshole for not responding to them right away/responding in a way they don’t like. It’s so much worse then being anxious for a big event or a family get together. Its so much worse then being anxious about going to a new school or social situation. I get that that is a thing, and it is also very real, but this is deferent. It’s constant. It’s paralyzing. It’s debilitating. It, along with the other aforementioned illnesses, have ruined my life so far. I’m tired of the stereotypes."
604,Sadness,Why does life seem so pointless like everything I do is meaningless except for what I do wrong but I can't vent to anyone because nobody would really care about it and well I'm questioning the point of living I'm sick of life and having 5 mental illnesses isn't making it easier and I feel like just ending it all it would just make everyone's life better.
605,How do I help my friend who wants to commit suicide?,"A little background: I’ve know my friend “Landon” (25M) for a few years now. We met at our college theatre department. He’s in school for playwriting, and I think he’s pretty good at it. He’s straight out of a Leave it to Beaver episode. Pretty old fashioned when it comes to dating (saving himself for marriage, treating girls to proper dates, pretty chivalrous), and presenting himself. He’s super sweet, and pretty good looking too. At first we were really just acquaintances. I had a small crush, but I got over that. We somehow became best friends, though we’re pretty opposite. I(26F, btw) am a little more “rowdy” than he is, but I bring him more out of his shell, and he keeps me grounded and humble. 
After we became really good friends, he went through some troubles. Girl troubles (hasn’t really been in a relationship, and has had trouble dating in general), feeling like he wasn’t worth it, always feeling like people were criticizing him, a lot of stuff. He’s has suicidal thoughts before, and I’ve helped him through those. But now it’s getting a little tougher. 
He’s been good for a while, more happy and joyful, but today he was hit with some news, and now wants to kill himself after he graduates from grad school. He learned that he has a disease that pretty much prevents him from ever having sex. And to top that off, not many people liked his new play, that was basically his thesis. I haven’t read all of it, but it didn’t seem as good as his other plays. It wasn’t bad, but I know he’s capable of better. Well now that this all has happened, I don’t know how I’d be able to completely help him. What advice could I give him, or how can I best console him?

TLDR; My best friend wants to kill himself after learning he has a disease that will prevent him from having sex, and after no one liked the play he just wrote for grad school."
606,Uncle killed pet parrot.,So apparently my uncle got mad/frustrated and grabbed his pet parrot by the legs and hit it until it died. He doesn’t want to go to a doctor and is refusing to talk about it. What can my aunt do? Will it only get worse? I believe it will.
607,Need encouragement,"Hi been feeling really hard on myself. I haven't been exercising for a week and I try to stay active for my mentalhealth but just been feeling super lethargic. Not happy with myself been binge eating too. 


Just hoping someone else feels the same. I felt like I was making progress and this week its all going down the drain."
608,How to find happiness,"I use to enjoy life so much more when I was in college around people all the time. Now that I’m in the really work I feel like my happiness has decreased dramatically. I’m having a hard time being happy with my life and can’t fine the source of why. I think I may be depressed, but don’t really understand what it is. I want to be happy but I’m afraid I lost that person and be coming someone I don’t want to be. Any advice on how to find yourself?"
609,I can't open up,"I can't talk about anything personal. I will shut down, retreat and avoid it at all costs. If I ever dare to say one personal thing, it's the end of the conversation because I will not be holding a QnA and that's it. What's that? You wanna talk about that very personal thing I opened up to you about yesterday? Well I don't so let's not, and while we're at it let's forget it ever happened. Wtf is wrong with me. Why can't I just aaaaahhhhhhhhh i wanna fucking die."
610,Is this normal?,"Im just wondering if theres other people in my shoes or in the same place. I graduate this coming December with a degree Im now regretting. I feel like I have sort of wasted my time in college getting this degree and instead of training my brain to be what it could have been and now feel not just useless but hopeless. Like Ill never be able to have a decent job or afford my simple dream of having a family one day (inflation and all). On top of that it feels like who would want to be with someone who has so little figured out. I dunno, should I talk to someone or is this just growing pains?"
611,Why am I always sad when I’m alone?,"The one time I’m not down is when I’m not by myself but I feel like none of my friends actually care about me to begin with and I feel like I care way more about them compared how they “care” about me. I feel like in every single friendship I’ve been in besides one it’s been like this. I feel like I could just go mia and they wouldn’t even notice or care. And I used to spend a lot of time alone because of this but I can’t do that anymore because when I’m all by myself I get seriously sad and just self destruct. Things I used to love like video games aren’t fun anymore I just seem to sit around and mope when I’m by myself. And even when I’m with “friends” I feel like it’s not genuine ya know? Like I feel like they bring me around because for someone reason they feel like they have too. It feels like no one wants me and looking back at it, it’s always felt like this with everyone. Idk if I’m just a bad person or not fun to be around but it just sucks ya know? Like I always feel like I’m a burden to be around and I’m never wanted and that hurts and always make me sad idk what to do guys:,("
612,I don’t know what’s wrong with me mentally,"I’m 19 and a college student, and my mind is out of control.

I know I’m depressed. I find it hard to get out of bed and motivate myself. I hate myself as a person, my personality, how I look. I have anxiety a lot too and I have self harmed

But I also can’t control my thoughts. I feel like my mind is out of control. I see mental images of me breaking down and becoming psychotic even though I am not currently psychotic. I am afraid that I will one day go insane without knowing. 

I feel like I am on autopilot a lot of the time.

I can’t read people and I don’t know if they like me. But I’m very clingy and desperate for people to like me because I can’t handle being alone. The loneliness makes me suicidal. 

I hit myself in the head when I’m upset and I don’t know why. I make so many mistakes. I don’t feel like I’m coherent at all right now and I’m sorry but I am desperate because I don’t know why I’m like this."
613,someone please tell me im gonna be alright,"ive battled with mental illness since day one. and ive gotten to some really low points and recently, despite being in the best damn shape ive ever been in 6 pack and all, having that loves me more than anything and that i love more than anything and making more music than i can keep track of, ive fallen down a hole i cant seem to get out of. Its gotten to a point where i just want it to end. its so hard to fight this day in day out i dont know what to do"
614,Animal abuse OCD,"I'm so fucking scared right now, I'm afraid that I'm a fucked up person. I keep remembering cruel shit I did to my dog when I was younger, and I just keep remembering bad shit from when I was younger in general. I remember I would do fucked up things like choke my dog when I was a kid but not really overly cruel, I think out of curiosity or when I was angry, and I'm fucking scared that I'm a psychopath.

And even recently I remember just being sort of mean to my dog a bit, but not as excessively as when I was a kid, but now I'm afraid I'm some kind of evil psychopath, like I remember I think feeling a bit of guilt for just like not letting my dog out because I was tired but then like saying in my head something like ""it's okay you're just taking a bit of stress or anger out on the dog"" or something like that to rationalize it. Oh my god, I don't fucking want to abuse or be mean to my dog, but I'm so afraid like what if I am an animal abuser or a psychopath??? This is so fucked up.

Ugh, even recently I remember doing stuff like pinching my dog's ear or messing with him by using my flashlight on him, now I'm really scared that I'm a psychopath or something. Is this normal or am I evil??? :'( I don't want to hurt my dog or anything, but I think sometimes I just do cruel things and I'm really scared and disgusted. I don't want to hurt my dog, what is wrong with me?!?"

I had a wonderful two minute conversation with her where she had told me her background, and I am very excited to work with her. However, as the director of billing, you can suck an egg.

Any tips..?"
619,ive noticed ive been acting very weird recently,i act normal throughout the day but at night ive been staying up late just sittin in my thoughts gettin really sad or choked up from it sometimes and pullin my hair really hard a lot. ive also been having bad daily headaches for a while now. am i depressed? ive never really struggled with depression before
620,"Im slowly dieing, 19 male and no future ahead",How do you stop over thinking and the creation of scenarios that havent happened? Im losing my shit.
621,I Want to Stop Feeling Like This but I Can’t,"Throughout the year, I often get extremely upset sometimes over small things and stay sad for days at a times. Throughout the quarantine it’s gotten a lot worse. I get thoughts and urges of hurting myself which make me feel guilty and gross. I find myself getting bored but not wanting to do anything but lie in bed. I get bad nightmares and I get very anxious. I don’t want to talk to anyone because I feel like I’m faking this for attention or something. But I feel horrible a lot and I don’t want to. Is there any ways I can deal with this without too much outside help?"
622,Has anyone been fine their whole life and then one day you just snap ?,"Tell me your story , this happened to me and I would like to hear about everyone else . After 23 years of nothing, one day everything took a turn for the worst and I just want to hear about everyone else’s “day”"

I usually make 18 cuts on my underboob where the skin is relatively soft and thin. But tonight I only made four cuts on my legs instead! They were bigger and took a lot more effort but I was satisfied after only four cuts. I know cutting no matter what is not healthy, but I’m pretty happy that i didn’t have to cut as much to be satisfied and that I might be working towards a healthier future."
626,Is it really depression??,"I already posted this on the depression subreddit but I could use some more help and advice. 

So I've been feeling really down for past few months. It's the feeling of emptiness. I have no motivation what so ever to do stuff. Before going to bed I always stay up with my phone to distract my mind,  because I know I will end up crying before sleeping. all the time I'm distracting myself from real life with the help of my phone. It's the reason why I'm always on that phone. 
Even talking to few of my friends feels like a distraction nowadays.
I always feel worthless, like there's no meaning behind my existence. My mom always jokes that it would be better if she died since she's so old. I always end up thinking, its not that bad of an idea to die. But I know I'm way to scared to actually commit suicide,its the process that I'm scared of. Also I'm scared to cause any suffering to my family if somebody dies. 
Am I depressed? Cause I don't think I have any reason to. I mostly have everything, I never really had to ask for anything.
I will be starting university, but I have no goals whatsoever. Is it just stress? I dont know."
627,I’m having a complete breakdown.,"I can’t login to my Roblox account and I’ve never experienced a flurry of demented aggression like this before, I’ll be ok but I’m having a hard time coping with this unfortunate matter."
628,I just want some validation...,"all my life, people I've talked to have been telling me that my trauma and my moods were 'normal' and a 'phase that everyone goes through', they labelled me as 'lazy' and 'unappreciative'. I have been trying to keep my head above water, when it just felt so easy to let go and drown. it's as if I _wasn't allowed to_ seek help because I wasn't suffering bad enough.

_*after all, the broken cup is mended, but the chipped cup is chipped forever.*_

this led to me postponing help-seeking for 13 years. I've grown used to the torture of my mind. people around me see that I'm still alive, and think that I'm coping, but I'm struggling to hold on. I don't have the courage to take my own life. 

sometimes, I myself am unsure if I really deserve help, because I think I'm faking it. I'm unable to pull myself out of a depressive episode, even with meds, so maybe I'm the one intentionally creating it? 

I just need someone to tell me that I'm not faking it, because everytime I tap onto mental health resources, I feel like I'm wasting their time because I don't want to get better. I'm waiting for my psychiatrist to slap the malingering label on me and discharge me, because I just feel so invalidated, like my struggle isn't real, and it's just part of life."
629,Are My Behaviors Normal?,"For background, growing up, I had a rough childhood emotionally. I used to be physically abused too, not anymore. I would be gaslighted a lot, and manipulated. There was a lot of screaming and anger. No stability or consistency. 

I have developed severe trust issues, and can’t trust anybody. I can’t open up to anyone emotionally, and I have an abandonment fear. And when it’s triggered, I get anxiety attacks. My hands will start shaking and stuff. And I’ll start having nightmares of being abandoned. Sometimes if I feel like somebody is trying to hurt me/has hurt me, I’ll distance myself. Sometimes I’ll even treat them poorly if I feel like they don’t care, or are gonna hurt me.But I don’t want to be a bad person, it just kinda happens, and I always feel guilty after. One time I treated my friend poorly because my one other friend was treating me poorly. And I felt bad.

I have a lot of built up anger, and I just contain it all in. I stay mad/sad for hours. Sometimes when I get super mad, I’ll pinch myself, and have thoughts of punching people, as bad as that sounds. And I can mad at people over little things, but it depends. Like I’m still mad at this one girl for correcting me.  I’m still mad over that 6 months later, I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I can be happy with people, but if I feel like they hurt me, I can like them, but I may start to not like them again if I think about what they did in the past or something. 

At one point of time, my self-esteem was horrendous, I used to call myself stupid, worthless, etc, and be upset every day. I’m not really like that anymore. But sometimes my self-esteem isn’t really good at all. Sometimes I start thinking about how I may not be good enough for certain things, or blame myself. Sometimes I can get sad out of nowhere. I’ll start thinking of sad stuff like death, and start crying, but sometimes this only just last days. Like I only feel empty/sad for days. Usually something triggers it. Sometimes I feel empty a lot, but maybe I’m just bored lol.

I have Asperger’s, so that already comes with some of its struggles. I get anxiety a lot. Over little things, but I don’t know if I have other problems too. And this may sound stupid, but that’s what I’m worried about. Having other problems. I’m still fairly young, and I can’t really get a therapist on my own"
630,I don’t know how to get better.,"I lost my best-friend. He and i were in recovery before i asked him to get some for me. I couldn’t meet him the night he scored and i get to know later that he oded.

Ever since then, the guilt of causing someone i loved his life has been an absolute torture. I believe i should have been the one to go, not him; since i was the culprit to suggest going back to it after we have been clean for so long- but instead he takes the fall. 

I haven’t touched heroine since that day.. its been 2 years.  But my drugs addiction to marijuana has been helpful in calming me down but has also caused me to lose my job, my health and my sanity and my relationships... i am too depressed all the time to do anything. Somedays I don’t even get out the bed... its like i have no control over my life, 

Is there any way i can break free of this cycle?"

632,A message to all of you who feel lost within yourselves - there will be rest.,"Oh you beautiful, beautiful person. Did you know that somebody loves you? 

Somebody is waiting for you to shine, to gather you in their arms and hold you. And maybe you haven't found that person yet. Maybe you're still in the dark tunnel, and you have nowhere to go. Maybe the light flickered out a long time ago, and you were left in the dark. You're scared, and you're hurting. You're searching for someone, anyone, to love you. It's lonely in that dark tunnel, isn't it?

But that person is there. They are waiting around the corner, waiting for you to take a deep breath and take just one more step into their arms. They could be anyone - maybe it's me, maybe it's the friend you were never really close with but would like to get to know them better, maybe it's the man you saw walking down the street who smiled at you with joy.  *Somebody loves you.* 

You are beautiful. You are amazing. You are so strong to have stayed in that tunnel without collapsing. It amazes me! You are brave to wake up every day with this weight on your shoulders and keep on marching. And it's hard, isn't it? I know just how hard it is, my friend. Shivering in that tunnel alone, hurting and there's no one there to take the pain away. But I see you. We all see you. And we love you! I love you. You are not alone, no matter how much you may feel that. There are so many of us in our own separate tunnels, searching for someone who will love us - we know how hard it is. And it's okay, my friend. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to cry. It's okay to let yourself be vulnerable. Because I love you, we all love you! We love you no matter what. No matter how alone you feel.

I have a poem I want to share with you, by Sara Teasdale. I want you to take a moment, wherever you are, and take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth. And again, another deep, deep breath. Yes, that's it. I want you to see us outside of the tunnel, all of us who love you. And then I want you to know that there will be rest, my beautiful friend. There will be rest.

**""There Will Be Rest""**

&amp;#x200B;

*There will be rest, and sure stars shining*

*Over the roof-tops crowned with snow,*

*A reign of rest, serene forgetting,*

*The music of stillness holy and low.*

*I will make this world of my devising*

*Out of a dream in my lonely mind.*

*I shall find the crystal of peace, – above me*

*Stars I shall find.*

\- Sara Teasdale.

Pretty much as long as I can remember I’ve cycled through random sort of tics I would do, which I didn’t recognize as probably being tics until very recently, for example tapping things over and over or widening my eyes over and over and continuously clearing my throat. 

In recent years I’ve developed a problem with consistency. For example I’m an artist but I can never keep any of my art for longer than a year because I always end up throwing it all away because I feel like the style/subject isn’t consistent enough.

When I’m listening to music the volume ALWAYS has to be on a certain volume. I also follow routines, especially before going to bed. I have to walk through the entire house making sure all doors are locked, all blinds are closed, jiggling door knobs over and over until it feels ok.

OCD also runs in my family, as my grandma has it."

Ive always had a very busy mind that thinks about everything. Ive always suffered from OCD and intrusive thoughts and attempting to keep them out.

It's now affecting my sex life. I get horny as hell, but then when it comes down to business, i get stressed out and lose my erection. It's frustrating for both me and my girlfriend. No amount of trying brings it back. My mind stresses about losing it, and as I try to distance my mind from it, I lose it.

Its happened multiple times multiple days in a row and its severely embarrassing. I just can't get my mind off of it now. Now instead of stressing about college and family, I'm stressing about going thru the humiliation of losing my erection, which causes me to lose it. I didn't even go through this during my first time ever.

Ive only been able to have sex while buzzed on alcohol because my mind isnt as active and im less stressed. If there's a way to solve it without booze or ""blue pills"" Id be thankful to hear it."

639,Couples Therapy Programs – Focus on the Emotions,"Being in a healthy marriage or relationship is a lot of hard work. It obviously requires efforts from both ends – parties involved in the relationship. Every time your relationship hits big rocks, you can turn to couple counselling or [couple therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/). There have been times when emotionally focused couples’ therapy has worked wonders in finding issues that lie beneath your emotions. Emotionally focused couples’ therapy is known to be one of the best therapies opted by many couples. Most of these therapies are only seen to restore the relationship to where it was before. However, the theory behind emotionally focused therapy programs is to make the relationship even stronger that it was before.

The emotionally focused [couple therapy Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) practices applications of the New Testament linked directly to how we should treat and act towards one another. There are times when we forget what our roles are. Psychotherapy is the best practice used to perform emotionally focused couples’ therapy, which can be done through conversations, artwork, drama, music, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy considers a number of philosophical approaches during therapy.

The term psychotherapy is interchangeable with the term counselling – commonly used by most of the people. One of the most important benefits of psychotherapy is the client and patient confidentiality. This is important because there are many personal details that are shared during these therapies. In today's world, thanks to the advancements in the technology, the therapy sessions can be conducted face to face, over the phone as well as over the internet. The thing with these therapies is that they work differently on everyone. There is no limit to time as to when a person or in the case of couples’ therapy people, will be cured and feeling better. If couple A finds their solutions in a month, couple B might take 2-3 months, depending on their ability to seek help and will to understand the troubles. As the name talks for itself, the emotionally focused couples’ therapy is ideated for a man and a woman; in short, a couple. Emotionally focused therapy can also be taken into consideration for the entire family. For people who see their family falling apart and are smart enough to do something about it, it is a must to sign up for a [family therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) session in which the whole family can participate together.

When seeking a therapist to counsel you, it is extremely important to make sure you do not just focus on the cheapest therapist just because you do not want to spend a lot on the therapy. You must find a therapist that has been in your shoes before. Somebody with a good experience and who can help you talk, listen, and understand. An experienced therapy would be better than someone who has no idea of how you are feeling. However, before everything, you need to remember to set your priorities in line and live up to your role. This way your spouse will assume their role in time."

I said I didn't want one, mom got me one anyways, and I cried like a little baby...ugh...    

And tomorrow, we're going shooting at an outdoor gun range. I don't want to go because I am very sunburned, but both of my parents were bitching that I haven't gone shooting with them in over 2 years. Maybe it's because I DON'T WANNA GO! But I can't *tell* them that because then I'll feel shitty and I've been trying not to feel shitty.    

Now don't get me wrong, my parents are not terrible. They just don't understand what goes on in my head. They know I have depression, but at the same time, they don't know how easy it is to hurt my sensitive-emotionally-fragile-fucking-excuse-of-self-esteem."

Like my mom forced me to go to a friend’s house and I was nearly about to commit suicide because I didn’t want to go. And like a month ago I accidentally broke my sister’s charger and I almost hung myself because I wanted to avoid telling her and I thought it was my only solution.
643,My boyfriend is breaking up with me because I’m depressed,I’m sorry I just have to yell out to someone right now. I feel so helpless. My bf and I have been on and off for about 4 years and every time my emotions and lack of ability to control them has destroyed our relationship. God I love him so much but I fear this is the end. Especially if I can’t figure myself out. I don’t deserve him to put up with me so much. I hate myself for putting him in this situation. I have no formal diagnosis have tried therapy and meds but nothing really seems to work. I fear even he thinks I’m broken forever.
644,My Life is Meaningless,"I'm 18(M) and have dealt with depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia for quite some time now. But lately, I've been feeling so lost and hopeless. I can't find any meaning in my life. No matter what I do I have this sense of impending doom and I can't shake it. Throughout all the year's suicide has never been something I've ever considered until now. I feel as though I am secondary to everyone in my life and that they only bother talking to me when they need something. I've been writing in a journal as a means of getting out my pent up feelings and thoughts and almost exclusively my mind wanders onto the subject of death. I can't help but feel like no one would really care if I just didn't wake up one morning. The last couple of weeks have just been the perfect storm of pain and misery. Left and right, 24/7 something happens that makes me question my worth as a human being. Frankly, I barely feel human at all. I look in the mirror and all I see back is an empty and pathetic shell of what was once a person. 

I know that I am lucky to have parents who provide for me and a roof to live under but I've just run out of the will to live. Every last ounce of motivation has left me and I just sit around wasting away all day. 

Sorry to whoever read that mess of a rant. I wish you all well in dealing with whatever may be ailing you."
645,I don’t really know...,"The last few weeks were really rough, I struggled really hard with my anxiety and all the pressure I put on myself, I thought I felt better yesterday because i sorted some things out and got to talk to some people I needed to talk to. So I went to bed at 12am, what’s not really late because I took a nap before and it’s a normal time for me to fall asleep, normally I don’t have any problems with falling asleep and than waking up in the middle of the night. But tonight was different, I was extremely tired but my mind was extremely loud. So I woke up at 2 am, I opened my eyes and somehow everything felt different, somehow not real and my brain was louder than ever. I couldn’t go back to sleep till 4 am. 
Has anyone an idea what could have happened? 
And yes I had a history with depression and panic-/ anxietyattacks."
646,How do I get back on track after a psychotic break?,"I recently had a psychotic break. I was hospitalized for a week and just got home today. I followed my therapist's advice and already removed all the reminders of my episode and used it as an opportunity to acknowledge the episode and cope. I'm discussing medications and what might have caused things exactly and I'm optimistic. 

But what do I do now? I never had a history of mental illness. I never dealt with depression or anxiety or anything of that nature. I don't know what to do with myself, and it's the first time I've lived alone. 

It was a very humbling and almost embarrassing thing. I feel humiliated. I was babbling and covered in my own feces and harming myself. I've never experienced anything so scary as the episode I endured. I'm not sure how to pick up the pieces and carry on. My family doesn't know what happened but they aren't very understanding of mental health so I can't tell them. I want this separate from the rest of my life completely. But overall I'm not sure what to do with myself. What do I do?"
647,I quit,"I promised I’d work in communicating when I need help. But “I’m not in a good mental place and need you” “I’m sorry princess, can I get off the phone? I’m really excited about the new season of R6” no. I’m not going to communicate my needs anymore. Fuck you."
648,Just.. how? How do you get better?,So I've been feeling.. I don't really know what I feel. Just generally not good. It's been suggested to me in the past that I have anxiety and I didn't really think it was worth looking into until these past few weeks. I think I had an anxiety attack?? I was breathing really heavy and my heart was pounding and tears everywhere. It was awful and the first time I've had an experience like that. So ever since then I've decided to get more serious about my mental health and actually do something about it but.. I just have no idea where to start. Should I join a group or something?? Therapy of course but I am poor so whatever free or low cost options are out there please let me know. I do find it extremely difficult to talk about things even if I want to tell someone something I always stop myself. Which is obviously something I'm going to have to work around so if anyone has any tips for that also please let me know. Thank you for taking the time to read my post and whatever information/advice you can give me. I gotta do something. I don't think this is just gonna go away like I thought it would.
649,Living with unresolved problems,"I struggle with things being incomplete or unresolved. Most of the time it's okay, but sometimes it interferes with living my life the way I want to.

Examples:
 - Computer programming: sometimes I stay up all night trying to fix that one bug that seems just 5 minutes away... then it turns into 5 hours. It's difficult for me to leave it unfinished until later.
 - Sometimes I can't fall asleep because my mind is racing about something I'm worried about. There's no immediate solution, but I struggle to let it go for the moment.

It seems mostly an in-the-moment, emotionally-driven thing. Often I wonder the next day why my obsession the night before seemed so important, because it has already lost its potency.

Who can relate? What are some possible neurochemical factors? I have read that serotonin can play a role in such behaviors, which is why SSRIs are sometimes used to treat OCD, but for me it seems the reward-seeking behavior is a larger factor, so I suspect dopamine is somehow involved. Maybe I have too much dopamine?"
650,I need help identifying what's wrong with me,"Bear with me because I have a hard time explaining my emotions. 

So lately I have been on edge. I seem to be easily agitated. Angry at times. And sometimes I blow up. I also feel fustrated at times. I am easily offended. I take almost everything personal. I am usually very petty. I feel like everyone hates me. I am cynical at times. I am negative at times. Sometimes I want to cry but I can't actually cry. I assume the worst in people. 

I know that's a jumbled mess but that's how I feel."
651,Wrong Diagnosis?,"Hey everyone! So when I went to college and consulted with a therapist and doctor there, the therapist hinted that I might be lowkey bipolar, while the doctor said I just was severely depressed with chronic anxiety.

Since the pandemic started and BLM gained momentum again, I have been caught in this weird sort of limbo. My dreams terrify me (I was on Lexapro up until last week since I couldn’t get a refill) and they’re garbled messes of really anxiety-inducing situations like me being in school, and etc. Then, I’ve been doing this thing where I will reread things like 5 times if I mispronounce it in my head and I keep checking the locks on my doors.

However, through all of this I started a jewelry business randomly and have been known to stay up all night just making jewelry. And I’ve signed up for many programs just to keep my brain busy. I keep going YOLO and buying a lot of stuff and I am obsessing over my weight too.

I don’t know what the heck is wrong with me but I would like some stability because I have a lot on my plate and I can’t stop moving it feels like ugh."
652,Im too afraid to die,"The only thing that has kept me alive sometimes is a fear of death. I want to kill myself, but im yoo afraid of death. A pussy, as the person I love put it. They didn't knoe what effect their words would have. But no matter what, I want to kill myself but im too much of a coward to do so."
653,Sharing my perspective on how I deal with my anxiety and waves of depression.,"Hello everyone! Im fairly new to reddit, so please be kind. Over the years I've learned that speaking about my mental health has helped me tremendously, so I recently made a video on things that I do to take control of my mind. I hope this video helps someone or gives them hope! If anything please share ways you personally manage your mental health because I'm always trying to be better myself. Thank you everyone!

654,I can tell that my mental health has been slipping recently and I'm not sure what to do,"Recently, I (18) think just because of everything happening in the world, I've started to feel myself slip into a depressive episode. I've had depression, at least since I was aware that that was what it was, since I was 15 because of a medication, but I wouldn't be surprised if I had it longer.   
Today was a new low for me, recently I've been feeling depressed because I feel like I am losing my friends, even though I don't fully think I am, I can feel myself distancing from them, and I feel very alone because of that.   
Today, my mom and I also got into a fight, and it was so stupid because it was over butter, but she started to randomly yell at me about how we were out and I had used the last of it (I did not) and because of that I kinda fought her because I didn't understand why she was yelling at me. So I went down and got butter, and she followed me, which kinda annoyed me cause what's the point in her following me down when she just yelled at me to get the damn thing, and as I was taking things out of the freezer to get to the said butter, I put something on top of it and something fell, and then she started to yell at me saying I threw something and that it fell off of the freezer. I got mad that she said I was throwing the stuff when I didn't, and yelled at her about how I didn't do that and how I didn't need her to hover over me, which then pissed her off more. We got into a fight about it, and she ended up telling me that she didn't care if I went to college of not, and that she didn't care if I learned how to drive. She also said she wasn't going to do her taxes for me to apply for fasfa, and wasn't going to give me documents my community college needed, and that she wasn't going to take me to my driving lesson that was supposed to happen tonight and that I had to figure it out myself. When she said this, I just broke down because I already feel like I'm a useless adult because I can't drive and don't have a job, and I feel so helpless because I have no idea how to get myself out of it. After she said that, I just started to ignore her and she went back upstairs, and got her stupid butter and put everything away I took out, and I looked behind the freezer to see what had fallen off, and saw that nothing had.   
After I put it in our kitchen, I went upstairs to tell her, and I apologized for what I said because I said some things that I shouldn't have said, and I also tried to tell her how I didn't like how she just started to yell at me for no reason, and how she should have just asked me to get it, and how it hurt my feelings that she said those things to me. I wasn't able to say very much of it though, because she started to yell at me again saying that she had to do a lot of things and how she didn't do anything wrong and how I was in the wrong. I just went into my bedroom and cried for at least an hour, and I just wanted to disappear or sleep for a long time, and at some point, during that time she also made it so that my phone didn't have data.   
Later I again tried to talk to her about it, and how it isn't ok for her to just lash out at me like she did and yell at me for no reason, and how what she said was very hurtful. She again just tried to defend herself and said that she is very busy and doesn't have time for my crap, and ironically said that I needed to stop playing the victim and realize what I did wrong and move on.   
From the events of today, I feel really drained and honestly more depressed than I felt before. Also, sorry this is so long, I just needed to write out the whole thing that happened."
655,Is there a name for this?,"Hi on tik tok I found this video that described a mental illness but I forgot the name. 

It’s the insecurity of thinking that the people around you believe that you have a disability (mental disability of some sort) and that’s the only reason they are nice to you even though you do not have one. 

Does anyone know what this is called? Or anything similar?"
656,Memory,"I remember I was in 2nd grade. A new kid with asthma said if he cried, he would die. One day during circle time, when we were all crowded together, I got up from the front to go my desk and accidentally stepped on his finger, and he started to cry. I then started crying because I thought he was going to die. My teacher sent me outside the classroom to go sit in the pod. When she came out to get me, I refused to go back in, because I was so guilt ridden and I was afraid he was dead.

She grabbed me by my ankles and she drug me across the floor all the way back to the classroom while I’m crying and flailing around.

No one did anything about it. Lol"
657,Seeking advice (touch aversion),"So, to keep this simple, I'll just say I (17yo) have been put through regular sexual harrassment at age 15. After I got out of that abusive relationship, I realised I am now uncomfortable with most touch I do not initiate myself.

Fast forward some time and I recently got a boyfriend. And that's good! The problem is that he insists he will touch me (hugs, caressing, spooning, that kind of stuff), but I don't really like it. It makes me nervous and I'm super conscius whenever his anything is near my private areas, I freeze and can't focus on anything else and I just want to move away. 

I told him that it makes me uncomfortable, but he insists he will do it anyway and also that it'll help me get used to it again.

Should I let him, or tell him again to stop this?"
658,My brain is broken,"I have anxiety. Particularly health anxiety.
I have some medical issues that are being investigated. Of course, I've Google and my symptoms pin point exactly to cancer. Every time. I'm convinced that's what it is. There is no other explanation.
I have been in a state of panic for about a week now. Like a very prolonged panic attack. It eases a little at times but it's still there. I spoke to my GP and they prescribed diazepam (valium) which I have taken before. It helps a tiny bit, for about an hour at most, I feel euphoric, I feel like I'm powerful but also evil but I like it. Then I'm back to square one and I'm pacing, shaking, paranoid, twitching, talking constantly, like I'm wired but exhausted. I can't go on much longer. I feel like I'm in a crisis but organisations don't care unless you want to kill yourself which I don't.
I just feel like I'm losing my mind. I feel like I'm in this bubble in my own world and there's no one else here and sometimes I let someone in but I'm not sure if things happening are real.
I can't see how this can stop until I've had my medical tests done and received a diagnosis.
I just want to be sedated until then. I don't want to be awake until then."
659,Can i get alittle help?,"I’m sad and my emotions are all over the place there mostly sad emotions though, it feels like i’ve tried everything but i’m still sad, so i’m wondering if simply crying to the point were i cannot cry anymore is the only way for me too get better.  I guess i feel guilt, shame and perhaps that i’ve betrayed the other person involved even if she isn’t mad or angry at me.  I still feel like shit"
660,Having a identity crisis and I can’t calm myself down,"I am starting to believe in things I hated, idk what the hell Is happening to me. This is impossible I don’t get it my head hurts so bad and I am literally shaking. How do i calm down, like I’ve never had this feeling before because I’ve only believed in one thing. I can’t calm down"
661,ADHD forgetfulness,Hey guys so I’m kinda drunk right now so idk how great my spelling or grammar is going to be. So When I was younger I separated ADD for ADHD and I knew I had it. Anyways that’s not the point. The fact of the matter is I have inattentive ADHD and the biggest struggle that I have been dealing with is the forgetfulness. I haven’t been able to go see a therapist or get on medication due to it being to expensive/not having health insurance. It makes me feel like I am going insane I don’t remember any details of conversations that I am paying full attention to. I can’t remember what I did that morning. I can’t remember points that I wanted to bring up with someone during a conversation. I literally feel like I’m going crazy. So to anyone who has ADHD or any psychs who want to help how can I cope with and stop the forgetfulness? I can’t handle it anymore.
662,How do I stop feeling overwhelmed and having obsessive compulsive thoughts?,"I feel like I can't focus on anything and my anxiety has hit the roof. It's mainly having OCD thoughts that I can't shake it off, it's ruining my happiness. How do ya'll cope?"
663,I snapped for the first time today,"Growing up, my sisters and I would be physically abused by my mom over small things. There were very strict rules set on us. My mom was so obsessed with keeping me inside the house, that I could never step foot outside alone. She was also an extreme hoarder, so I would spend hours of my free time walking back and forth in my hoarded house. I would have to listen to her yell and rant for hours, and I couldn’t escape it. 

My mom would take her anger out on us quite a lot, and I would have to sit through or witness my sisters being beaten, because I was so small. I could never hit back or call the police when things would go too far, because my mom would threaten me saying she would beat my ass even harder. She would try to also guilt trip us by pulling out bible quotes saying that we would burn in hell if we hit her back. What made matters worse was that I was always picked on at school until I graduated, and I felt like I was never happy growing up. 

Once I grew bigger, she stopped hitting me and my sisters, but I was left feeling so distressed over these memories. I would act out when I was alone, and instead of displacing my anger and frustration onto others/objects, I would self-harm by punching myself in the head. 

I dropped out of college because I was feeling very depressed and struggling with these flashbacks. I’ve had the luxury of staying with my parents for a gap year, but my depression and these flashbacks have become much worse. 

I’m typically a quiet person and I don’t like talking to anyone (especially about my feelings), but one day I went into my mom’s room and started telling her how depressed I was. I was telling her about all of my flashbacks, and all she did was tell me to get over them because she had it much worse as a kid. She started saying how I was selfish and how I was going to burn in hell for thinking such things. 

I felt worse than before, so I left and went back to my room. She ended up barging in and splashing me with holy water, pinning me down and trying to perform an exorcism on me. She was chanting prayers and telling the ‘demons ‘ to leave. I felt horrible because I don’t think she actually listened to what I was saying. 

When my dad came home, my mom told my dad everything that happened. He suggested therapy, but she started screaming at the top of her lungs that I was tearing the family apart, and how a therapist would just “drug me up” and make me even more depressed. She then started to threaten my dad saying she would divorce him and take all of his money to spend with her new boyfriend, and so on. 

It’s been a year since this happened, and my headspace has probably been in the worst condition it’s ever been. I was punching myself all the time, I kept having flashbacks and uncontrollable tics. It just drove me crazy that I was living with the same woman who ripped chunks out of my sister’s hair for not being able to swallow a pill. 

Yesterday, I was feeling angrier than before and I tried letting it out in my workout. I practiced piano, meditated, etc. I did anything to keep my mind off of it. I even tried sleeping on it, but my mind was still racing even in my dreams. 

When I woke up, I was angrier than before. I did the same things to keep me occupied, but my flashback was more vivid than before, and my blood started boiling at how powerless I felt. Instead of punching myself, I smashed my head through my door repeatedly until it was broken. 

My parents walked out of their room and tried asking what was wrong, and all I did was start cussing out my mom for all of these years. She denied that she ever touched me, and I was so angry that I proceeded by smashing my head through a window. It took my dad hugging me to calm me down. 

I don’t know why I snapped like that. I’m not a violent or aggressive person, but this episode was so bad it made me act like one. It was very dumb of me, yet I still did it. My parents probably think I’m crazy now, so crazy that my mom is finally willing for me to go to therapy. 

I feel very ashamed of myself and I don’t really know why I lashed out like that. I feel horrible because my dad already has enough problems to deal with. He just sounded tired and disappointed in the aftermath. 

Why did I snap? I’m very confused and I just wish I could escape from this all."
664,Can't move forward,"ive been stuck thinking about my recent girlfriend as of late. our relationship was toxic and she was a manipulative narcissist who *literally* got off on giving me panic attacks. the particular memory which i have been stuck reliving is the day i attempted suicide. 

quick note, i have anxiety, depression, and adhd. i also have panic disorder, and was diagnosed with it while in this relationship. she would coax me into panicking, use the panic attack to leverage her power and make me more dependant on her, then gaslight me into believing that it was all my fault. this caused panicking to become my gut response once my anxiety reached a certain level, causing a ""depressive spiral"" as i call it. back to it then

when she was mad, and if i had bought her something, she would give it back to me without looking at or saying anything to me. whenever this happened (quite often, might i add) i knew that i had fucked up in some way, and it would instantly send me into a panic attack. usually she would give me some of her attention, just enough to keep me thinking i could fix things (i never actually could), but this was different. i remember crying and begging and pleading for her to just acknowledge my existence. her friends were with her and so eventually she decided that to lighten the mood for them she would make fun of me. i remember seeing her and her friends laughing at me on the ground, i dont remembed the words but i remember the image. a symptom of my panic attacks is self harm, i dont do it consciously, its just really hard for me to control my hands when im panicking and so they sometimes try to hurt me. so i was cutting myself with the edge of a wristwatch in front of her and her friends out in public, i know thats my fault, but she couldve done anything but what she did next. i remember asking her if she wanted me to die, then she said ""theres a bridge right over there, why dont you do it?"". after that i just remember falling to the ground with tears in my eyes, then i remember being on the railing of the bridge with three people pulling me back from jumping off it. i remember very vividly how it felt to be fighting back, it was really scary because i just knew that i wanted to die. for a moment, all that i had ever wanted in my life was to die, and in that moment this truth was almost fulfilled. i didnt get why the same people who were laughing at me just moments before were trying to save my life now.

after being pulled down, i could barely see straight and i had noticeably reduced control over motor function. essentially drunk, but with suicidal depression instead of euphoria. i somehow got onto a bench with her, i put my head in her shoulder to cry because i just wanted comfort from the person i loved most in the world. she pulled away im disgust and asked ""who said you could put your head on my shoulder?!"", she then proceeded to call me dumb and make me feel like a moron for everything that had happened. later when i was in the hospital she msgd me saying she was dumping me, then she stopped responding to all messages. they had to give me so many drugs to get me to go down, i was fighting i wouldve done anything to see her. fast forward a week and we're back together. sad thing is, she keeps messaging me every month or so, i cant hold off forever and ik eventually ill crack and see her

idk if this will get taken dwn or if its against the rules or smth, i just wanted to share it because its really hard to deal with all in my head"
665,I don’t have friends and don’t go out much...,"One thing I’m paranoid about is go people perceive me. I’m a decent looking guy who’s 19, but I’ve had some mental health issues and this has left me with really no friends. I play video games with ppl that I know IRL but we don’t do anything IRL. I excercise, play video games, watch tv until I go to college. But I’ve never had a GF and I have trust issues with people, but I’m not ugly at all I’m tall skinny and I’m good shape I just don’t feel comfortable with people. I always think that people don’t like me or think I’m weird even though I never even talked to them, I just assume things and this is why I don’t have friends. What do you think? Idk I’m just in a rough spot having no social life and my self confidence is low just need some advice or someone to talk too."
666,Relationships between people with mental health problems - Wondering about any success stories?,"My boyfriend and I both suffer with some mental health issues. For me, it's anxiety and obsessive thinking (I say this rather than OCD because I don't have obsessive thought patterns but without the compulsions). For him, it's depression.

We both love each other very much and in many ways are a great couple. However, lately we've hit a wall and it's like our mental health issues just clash. We have decided to take some time apart to try and work on our own mental health. He is upping his therapy sessions and I am going to go back to mine and see if we can get ourselves into more positive head spaces so we can support one another rather than exacerbate.

I don't really want to know if people think this will work or not - every relationship is different and every person is different and so it's kind of impossible to know. I'd like to know though, if anyone has any success stories of two people in a relationship with these sort of issues? How do you get through? What's worked for you? Does it even BENEFIT you in some ways (eg. empathy)?"
667,Consult with therapist?,"I havent been in any traumatic situation, I get along with others so no one has ever bullied me, and I have a great relationship with my parents. But for some weird reason, ive been feeling sad, lonely, and especially empty for the past few years now. I dont think I’ve ever felt actually happy within those years and I dont know how it started. I constantly feel numb to world events. I feel like I’m dreaming and I hear random noises while Im awake, or I feel like people’s voices are being muffled during conversations. I know people are going through incredibly more terrible things than I am, So I further invalidate my own feelings. If a therapist were to ask me why I feel this way, I wouldn’t even know how to respond. Should I still consult with one?"
668,Telling someone youre suicidal,Will reddit trace a suicidal post?
669,Cuck OCD is this possible?,"I don't know if this is really OCD. I can get this groinal response like other people do but it's only associated with thoughts of other people with my girlfriend. Sometimes I get it when I just think of something that reminds me of the fact I might be a cuck, do i get this because it's actually making my feel inadequate or it's making me think of the fetish which turns me on? i have moments where I have a constant groinal response that never goes away because this is literally on my mind 24/7 it doesn't. even stop in dreams. It feels like actual arousal with my dick tingling to the thought of this being true. I used to lose an erection I had from something else when thinking about these things but now I keep that erection. There were moments where I was confident that I wasn't a cuck and I think that the groinal response made it go away but maybe I'm making that up. Was I just actually suppressing these feelings which is why they went away? Can I cure this fetish? Sometimes I get it looking at other guys which makes me think Im gay but it could also be the fact that they remind me of this fetish or make me feel inadequate. If this is OCD can i uneroticize this fear? I get this in dreams and I've almost came. I feel like HOCD isn't real if you get a groinal response then its actually just suppressing your sexuality. If some people don't get the sensation and others do then it has to be real right? Please don't tell me that I'm actually a cuck I will not be able to live with myself it literally makes me sick. Why does it makeme aroused though???"
670,Family Member Talks to Himself,"I have a close family member who has conversations out loud, which in and if itself is a normal phenomenon. 

But when repeated back to him this person doesn't recognize the dialogue, and states that it doesn't match any of his inner thoughts from within that moment, so much so that he questions that I've heard him correctly.

For example, he got out of the shower and started a conversation with himself after singing for a bit. He went on as if he were two people about the how he shaves, and then started mentioning how good ""you look"" an uncharacteristic way. When he came out, I said his little self-hype routine sounded cute, and he politely insisted he was singing. I told him that I also heard singing, and that maybe I misunderstood the lyrics, asking if it was a song about shaving or looking good, and he was confused, stating that the song was about anarchy. 

I wouldn't normally be worried, but he does have at least one family member who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and he exhibits these tenancies during times of extreme fatigue, illness, or high stress, leading me to believe it is something he normally has the capacity to manage. 

Not to mention the textbook adult ADHD.

I've mentioned to him that he may want to speak to his physician the next time he has a physical, but he seemed unconcerned. Which is understandable because it isn't affecting his life to a determent at the moment. 

I speak aloud from time to time, but I always realize I'm doing it, and anytime someone repeats what I've said, I recognize it as part of my inner dialogue. But he doesn't at all and it's always about weird shit that doesn't match his outward personality.

Don't know if this is normal or what steps he should be taking to manage his mental health."
671,im having a hard time reading and doing stuff,I'm a 22F in college. i had trouble concentrating before and i blame my depression. I recently changed my psychiatrist because something doesn't sit well with me with the one before. I was again diagnosed but now the other dr says im bipolar. Everything was good after changing my medications but i realized I'm still having a hard time studying especially reading. I'm an engineering student and i prefer solving equations more but i still need to read stuff yk. I remember one of our professors sent an article for us to read and make a case study. It me about an hour before finishing a 3 or 4 paragraph article. Is it still because of my bipolar disorder? I feel consistently motivated but I'm still having hard times doing school stuff as well as daily things to do. I've been worrying too much and my doctor is still not having appointments due to the lockdown. It's really hard for me I've been asking my self what's wrong with me.
672,My boyfriend is worried about my mental state.,"I missed my doctors appointment so I wasn’t able to take my prozac for a week. By day 6, I became very suicidal and depressed and it was my boyfriend’s first time seeing me this bad. I think I really really scared him and now he’s very worried for me. 

He’s supposed to be going army and he’s getting very stressed because he is going to be away from me and won’t be able to take care of me. I know my boyfriend likes to have his own personal space but now he wants to spend time together. I know it’s burning him out. 

I can tell he’s just very worried about my mental state and is sacrificing his own happiness to be with me. I can’t stand seeing him this stressed. I’m back on my meds right now and I’m doing much better. Anyone has any tips to make my boyfriend less worried?"
673,I don’t understand why,For years people have always hated me and it hurts so much but when people get to know me they like me and laugh at my jokes but then say for example a friend of a friend comes to me and  completely talks rubbish to me for years I have been a victim of bullying and someone who has been harassed for no reason in a Xbox party with my friends a friend of a friend called me a faggot and laughed at me then kicked me out it made me so upset because it’s happened it the past people have always picked on me it may be small but it still hurts people also talk rubbish behind my back they make fun of me I have always been hit randomly people have gone as far to threaten to ddos me because they hate me people have told me to die how I am worthless and it dosent make it better when they joke about family members who have past away which already makes me hurt people have always treated me like I am worthless and somebody who deserves to have pain in my life I have always thought about harming my self and I have and when I open up to one of my ‘friends’ that I have depression and anxiety they laugh at me and tell other people which makes it worse for me I could go on but I don’t want to trouble anyone
674,Anxiety during testing,"No mater how prepared I am for a test, I always manage to be anxious out of my mind to the point that I shake. Even though I know that I’ll end up with a passing grade,normally I do, I can never seem to shake this anxiety and stress off of me. I want to get 100% on every test, and I always do, but I believe this perfectionism is causing the anxiety. Can you please give me any advice on how to cope with the anxiety and maybe make it go away? It’s draining my mental health since this anxiety has been constant for a little over 6 years."
675,How is psychotherapy meant to help? How has it helped you? I can't seem to get much from it.,"I'm curious to see what other people have gotten out of psychotherapy, especially for depression. What was the single biggest benefit? What were your goals and did therapy help you achieve them? How? 

&amp;#x200B;

Read on if you'd like, but that's my main question. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been depressed on and off for my whole adult life, and the past four years have been particularly bad. Without boring you with details, it is mostly cliché existential-type things that get to me, like death, the passage of time, the absurdity of life, etc. I am also mega stressed in my day to day life, but can't see a way out of it for the time being. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from taking SSRIs (which I still take), I've seen several counsellors/therapists/whatever over the years (in more than one country). It started out with on-campus counsellors (the kind your university tuition covers), public health care counsellors, an online CBT program, etc., and most recently a private paid-for psychotherapist. I've never really been sure what I'm meant to get out of it, aside from feeling like I must ""need"" it. But it hasn't ever really helped much. At most, I liked the person and was able to ""vent"" a bit with a stranger, or they've given me a bit of food for thought about something. At worse, I felt awkward and obligated to make it seem like I felt a bit better.   
I'm in a place now where I genuinely don't know what to do next. I'm a husk of my former self, and my life is suffering more and more every month. I am not suicidal, but feel like I am at serious risk of losing my family, job, etc. My doctors know I feel this way. I take antidepressants. I just spent a load of money on another therapist. I feel like I'm at the end of the road. What do I do next? I don't have the money to keep looking for the ""right"" therapist. Is it something I am doing wrong?"
676,"Please help - can I ""restart"" the taper off process that I skipped?","Quit cold turkey. Been about 3 weeks. Going through hell.

Can I go back and restart taking the SSRIs and taper off over 6 to 8 weeks?"
677,Advice? My boyfriend exhibits symptoms of depression and anxiety and I obviously handle it wrong and it always turns into a fight cos I don’t know what to do,"My boyfriend is exhibiting some serious symptoms like: getting really stressed when I mention college work or when I work on anything college related, procrastination with his own college work, staying in bed too long, refusing to talk about feelings, constant bad mood, occasional outbursts of anger, not wanting to go places with me, always saying things like “I’m always overlooked at work”, “I’ve no idea where I’m going in life” 

But every time I try to help or make any suggestions I get ignored or brushed off, then I get upset that he’s ignoring me and he says I’m aggressive and he can’t talk to me about anything cos he gets shot down. 

I’m obviously handling this wrong so I’m wondering if anyone in this thread has advice on how to help or deal with this?"
678,"No matter how this pandemic ends, I want to leave a positive footprint in this world.","I’ll be honest, we’re dealing with more than covid in this pandemic, people are fighting all sorts of battles and it all goes down to one thing: the fight you’re willing to have against your mental demons. Because in my opinion(feel free to critique), if you’re mentally weak: people, situations and yourself will steal your energy until you have nothing left. 

I started volunteering during the pandemic, but I don’t feel like that’s enough. So I started a YouTube channel and my first video is “tips on how to improve your mood”. Furthering my mission to impact people positively.  I’m a young dude but I’m certain even I can have a Mr. Rogers level of impact on people if I have the right intentions and say helpful things."
679,"I have constant, violent nightmares? Any advice?",
680,How do I get out of this depressed slump?,"I have schizoid personality disorder and generally don’t feel much when it comes to my emotions but nowadays I spend the whole day in bed because I feel too low and tired to do anything. 

I know I’d feel better if I were more productive but I just need an extra push to get out of bed. I’m not allowed energy drinks and coffee makes me paranoid. 

I just want to get up and get things done, and I guess wanting to get up is the first step but... bleh. I wanna nap."
681,how do i know if my eating disorder is cured?,"I(m18) have been insecure about my weigh since i can remember, and when I was little i puked everything i hate on purpose. At the time nobody knew and i kinda got over it on my own after a year or so. Then last year it started again but this time I told my friends and with their help I stopped (i also had a therapist but didn't help too much in that because it isn't his field). Okay so the thing is, I haven't puke in almost half a year, but it's true that I'm very insecure about my weigh and my eating schedule is very irregular, and lately I have been habing almost no appetite. Talking with my friend the other day he told me that maybe I'm still not over it and that i should get the help I need. Do I really still need help? I just want to be able to love myself as I am."
682,My failed suicide attempt,"Then I was 10, I failed in a scholarship exam. The reason for the my poor result was the video games from the 90s. I knew it. I was stuck to the video game for a year, all that produced a sudden depressive thoughts in me. What would I do to kill myself? I plugged the power connector of video game into my mouth. Yeah, the DC connector. I didn't know that DV, 2Amps society won't kill me. So stupid of me. I still remember the day and the exact spot.  I was scared as fuck when I inserted the connector into my mouth. But nothing even happened. I came to know that this much current won't do a thing to me when I was 13. By then I had my friends and my gang, so never had those feelings again. Poor 90s kid, couldn't even sure alone!"
683,I am lost in my head,"Recently for whatever reason, I’ve been feeling super down. I don’t feel motivated to do school work that I would normally just chug through. I’ve found myself sitting in class not paying attention, and just thinking. Thinking about what exactly? I don’t really know. There haven’t been any recent events that might’ve caused any of this, but it’s getting to a point where I won’t sleep not because I’m not tired or sad, but because I just don’t want to. I feel like being alone and away from everyone and everything. Is there anything anyone can suggest to just help me feel a little better? If you need more info just ask. Thanks to anyone"
684,Going for disability was the best choice of my life,"I'm 25 and was diagnosed with depression when I was 15. When I was 18 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm in some form of treatment about 70% of the time these 10 years, if I also count wanting or looking for treatment it's about 90%.

My quality of life has increased a lot, but I still suffer from dramatic mood shifts and spiral sometimes. But honestly, I'd say I'm at an average health level. But when I feel pressured or have to work I completely lose my shit again.

Caution: I live in Germany, the system is a bit different here, but you will get the general idea.

Crisis after crisis happened whenever I tried to get into work, so finally the government labeled me as unemployable for 12 months.
I could go for full on long-term disability and long-term disability, but I don't want that yet. But just knowing that it's possible and that it's always an option for me is so relieving. Now I can look for jobs with much less pressure.

Is this also possible in the US?"
685,Taking A Break From Social Media,"With everything going on in the world it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and to let current events cloud your mind, so sometimes you need to get away from things and that’s okay, take time away to take care of yourself. If you need to take a break from social media, do it! If you believe it will help! ☺️ 
If you do, here are some ways you can keep in touch with family and friends:

- FaceTime/Text: Schedule times where you and your friends can FaceTime each other or just casually text them, talk about how their day was, what they’ve been up to, etc. It may seem like an obvious thing to do, but it really helps in the long run!

- Discord: Discord is a great place to keep in contact in with friends and family! You can create servers and chats for specific topics or planned events, you can do anything from talk and send funny images, to video chatting, to role-playing games like DND with custom roles given to each person on a server. 

Things to do while away from social media

Unfortunately, with everything on there isn’t really much to do outside because of the virus, but there are still ways to stay entertained while stuck in quarantine.

- Go on a bike ride 
- Catch is on your favorite TV show 
- Play some video games
- Cook
- Learn a new skill 
- Watch some YouTube
- Binge movies 

Remember, taking a break from social media for your mental wellbeing is not selfish in the slightest, and you want to do everything in your ability to be happy and healthy!"
686,Dissociation/Flashbacks?,"Okay, so I already know this isn't going to get a whole lot of replies but I was really curious if anyone knew maybe what the fuck is happening to me lol. For the past 6months-yr I will occasionally get this weird feeling of debilitating anxiety, nausea and dissociation along with flashbacks (sounds like PTSD, right?) but these flashbacks always contain like... 

-Cartoons I can almost remember, it's like this constant feeling of ""I know this... I don't know the word for it or anything about it... but I KNOW this.""
-Memories of people from when I was really little
-dreams I've had throughout my whole life
-random shit that I can ~almost~ remember. 

So I will be sitting, watching TV and say like... a draft comes in or a certain noise happens outside my room, my brain will sometimes just shut down and go into this state of nostalgia, nausea, anxiety, and dissociation through these random flashbacks. I would chalk it up to PTSD if the flashbacks had any relevance to being traumatic but they never are. This isn't to say I don't have PTSD from other circumstances but those flashbacks have a very different effect on me. 
BTW this all started after I dropped out of college 4 weeks in, my dad evaded the FBI in Mexico for 3 months, my uncle was creepy asf and paying my tuition but also holding it over my head and verbally abusing me over it, I had a lil mishap with a man I didn't know in college-moved back in with my boyfriend's family, his whole family was splitting up bc his moms a cheater lmao, and my whole life was 100% falling apart. It very well couldve been my body being unable to handle the stress I was under and just deciding ""here bro you haven't seen this in a minute chill out"" 
Like a form of dissociation just 100x worse? 

TLDR; PTSD but minus the PTS..? bro idk"
687,I want the judgment to end.,"My mother never liked anyone that I was in relationship with. Noone was good enough for me according to her even if 4 out of 5 of them were absolutely perfect in the way they treated me. I had thousands of argument with her and my father asking them to let me live my life the way I want with the people i want by my side. I even ended up having panic attacks and psychical symptoms because of stress.
I'm 28 yo (f) and I am going to graduate from medical school hopefully after these last exams. This is my second school,i  graduated from nurse school too. I am very anxious and i feel very pressured. 
So this morning i said that I hope I could have someone to help me out during my exams and my mother said that if I was in a relationship with a doctor I would have someone. This might sound like not something special but consider that 1) I am already stressed with my exams, 2) we have history in arguments for this specific reason about all of my relationships (my present one is an engineer student) and 3) My boyfriend has proposed, so he is not even my boyfriend any more, he is my fiance.
She knows that he has proposed and i said yes but she never considered us as engaged. 
I write this because I'm too stressed and I think that in case I fail in some exam, I wont be able to start my job, so I will not be independed ,so I will keep hearing all that stuff. i want this to end."
688,How do you remove forced negative links between two things and/or wipe your memory?,"Before you say anything, yes I have spoken to a doctor and a few therapists/psychiatrists  and unfortunately did not make much progress. (Also as per subreddit rules, I mention that I am living in the US)

The reason I post here is because I am hoping to make progress on this internal problem of mine I have had for several years. Maybe even receive advice from people with the same problem as me.

The things I like are forcefully associated with things that disgust me so whenever I think of one, I think of the other.

I cannot enjoy much in my life anymore because of this and the memories of these associations are permanent almost. I have to be careful about setting aside time to enjoy hobbies because they may be ruined by a stray thought or a random incidence that disgusts and gets forcefully/permanently associated with it.

Can't like ice cream because every time I think about it, my mind forcefully conjures feelings, thoughts, and images about....disgusting things I shouldn't really state here but you get the idea.

I've already visited therapists and looked for self help but I seem to have bad luck when it comes to these things. I am unable to find helpful information on this.

I am hoping someone here is able to offer advice on this specific situation. Is there a subreddit that can help me with this? Books or videos or anything?

I would appreciate the help."
689,Extreme paranoia? And how to get help,"Hi guys, i hope this is in the right place, i need advice but please deleteif im in the wrong form.
Ive always been a bit of an anxious person but in the last few months my paranoia has gotten extreme and is destroying my life. I constantly feel people hate me and are speaking about me badly behind my back, i worry one day ill realise its all a sick joke and no one actually ever liked me or that im really just a crazy person they talk to to be nice and my brain just makes up the rest and its not all really there, people assure me this isnt true, but i can barley sleep or eat from the stress it causes me, its damaging my relationships and exhausting me, i feel like im at breaking point, my brains so loud and busy and full of intrusive thoughts and ive stressed myself out enough to be experiencing some hallucinations especially when im tired (people running out, or standing behind me or hearing my friends talking in sentances i cant understand when im home alone). I want to speak to a doctor again but im scared they will lie to me or not bealive me, a bit of a year ago i was given depression and anxiety medication but i got scared they might be placebos and threw them away. Has anyone experienced anything like this and can offer me any advice on how to deal with it myself or how to overcome my fear of the doctors?
Thank you so much in advance, i just really need help knowing if im just paranoid or if I can go to a doctor without them just sending me away."
690,What happened to me?,"So I’m still shaken up from this experience. Last night I took a hit of weed (I’m a seasoned smoker, I smoke daily) and instantly became extremely paranoid. I couldn’t tell where I was, my vision wouldn’t stay straight, my heart was pounding. I couldn’t stop shaking. I can’t explain the way I was feeling. It lasted hours. I had to have my friends walk me home I was so paranoid. When I finally got home, I tried to calm myself down but I couldn’t do it. At one point I convinced myself that my teeth had turned inwards and my jaw broke. I’ve never been this paranoid before. Can someone help me figure out what this could have been? I was exhausted but I couldn’t fall asleep bc I was so paranoid. I guess at some point last night I just got too tired and fell asleep. Ugh pls help"
691,Signs of Problems?,"For background, growing up, I had a rough childhood emotionally. I used to be physically abused too, not anymore. I would be gaslighted a lot, and manipulated. There was a lot of screaming and anger. No stability or consistency. 

I have developed severe trust issues, and can’t trust anybody. I can’t open up to anyone emotionally, and I have an abandonment fear. And when it’s triggered, I get anxiety attacks. My hands will start shaking and stuff. And I’ll start having nightmares of being abandoned. Sometimes if I feel like somebody is trying to hurt me/has hurt me, I’ll distance myself. Sometimes I’ll even treat them poorly if I feel like they don’t care, or are gonna hurt me.But I don’t want to be a bad person, it just kinda happens, and I always feel guilty after. One time I treated my friend poorly because my one other friend was treating me poorly. And I felt bad.

I have a lot of built up anger, and I just contain it all in. I stay mad/sad for hours. Sometimes when I get super mad, I’ll pinch myself, and have thoughts of punching people, as bad as that sounds. And I can mad at people over little things, but it depends. Like I’m still mad at this one girl for correcting me.  I’m still mad over that 6 months later, I know it’s stupid, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I can be happy with people, but if I feel like they hurt me, I can like them, but I may start to not like them again if I think about what they did in the past or something. 

At one point of time, my self-esteem was horrendous, I used to call myself stupid, worthless, etc, and be upset every day. I’m not really like that anymore. But sometimes my self-esteem isn’t really good at all. Sometimes I start thinking about how I may not be good enough for certain things, or blame myself. Sometimes I can get sad out of nowhere. I’ll start thinking of sad stuff like death, and start crying, but sometimes this only just last days. Like I only feel empty/sad for days. Usually something triggers it. Sometimes I feel empty a lot, but maybe I’m just bored lol.

I have Asperger’s, so that already comes with some of its struggles. I get anxiety a lot. Over little things, but I don’t know if I have other problems too. And this may sound stupid, but that’s what I’m worried about. Having other problems. I’m still fairly young, and I can’t really get a therapist on my own"
692,Just trying to pass the time,"Hey, so lately I've been feeling really ""meh"" about things. When I was severely depressed one of the main things was not enjoying anything and not wanting to do anything and I'm a little worried I'm falling back into that. 

My financial situation is quite bad so after being declined any kind of government help I have contacted an agency about being a TA. They love me and my experience and educational background but the problem is many schools around are still not opening yet so I'm kinda just waiting for that to happen. I have my own business that I started in January but that went to hell as it involves close contact with people :( 

So I am basically just passing time at the moment, playing a lot of video games. I try and keep my flat clean and tidy to make me feel like I'm accomplishing things but even that has kind of worn off a bit and there isn't much to clean now. I like to write and stream but I haven't written much in a long time and find it difficult to start &amp; get in the zone. I have barely streamed at all for the last month or so as I just haven't felt like I'm in the mood or that it wouldn't be fun or that people wouldn't enjoy watching or what I'm playing. I don't really know what to play anymore because the games I do play in my own time I don't think are worth me streaming (Destiny 2 I play but I don't know much about the weapons etc, I mostly just play it to run around and shoot things, and Sims 4 I'm a bit all over the place with my saves). As for social stuff I live with my partner and we play destiny together pretty much every day and then he goes to work in the evening for his night shift so I kind of go to bed and watch movies. I have some close friends that I often message on facebook/discord since I can't really hang out with them in person at the moment. 

I don't really know what I'm looking/hoping for with posting this... I guess I just wanted to vent a bit that I'm sort of losing a bit of meaning to my life. I have some creative projects that I work on rarely. I think I tend to find reasons to not do things and then finding motivation to do things gets difficult."
693,My mum is moving to Spain😭,"I suffer with severe mental health and I have for years. I didn’t have a great relationship with my mum so I moved in with my dad at 14 and after a year of not speaking to her our relationship began to repair. We still have our arguments but I began working with her on our family business in December. Yesterday she told me she planned to move to Spain with my grandma and my dog. She told me I would run the business from the UK with my alcoholic and racist uncle who was employed with us just this week. My heart broke. We ended up having a massive argument, I had a panic attack and couldn’t stop crying, I felt as though my life was being pulled apart. She called me selfish for acting like this saying she needed a better life! I called her selfish for moving abroad! She then kicked me out of her house. I spent the night contemplating killing myself as I was so overwhelmed, emotional and angry but my dad calmed me down. I’ve come back to her house (to work) this morning and we sat in silence for hours, my other family, aka my grandma and my uncle have both slagged me off over the phone. Eventually we ended up talking and my mum told me my behaviour and attitude was horrendous, she said she understood but I’m sorry she clearly dosent! She said I was making it out to be her fault which I said it was, and when she asked why I told her she was ripping my life apart. She then said in a very spiteful tone “there we go it’s all about you again”... I should point out I’m 20 years old and live with my dad, but due to my mental health I’ve created this safety bubble and now I don’t have that😭 

My mum currently lives next door to my dad, which is how it’s been my whole life! I go over every day and watch tv, work, go for lunch and days out with my mum and play with my dog. But if she moves to Spain I can’t do that, my life will literally change so much and I’m scared! I don’t want to lose my dog, she’s the only one that keeps me happy when I’m very depressed! I just. I don’t know what to do😭 

If anyone could give me any sort of advice I’d really appreciate it 😭"
694,I made someone commit suicide and now I can't sleep at night.," A few months ago, a Reddit user by the name of [u/Auroraglint](https://www.reddit.com/u/Auroraglint/) wanted a painless way to commit suicide. They posted it on [r/Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/) and I gave them a painless method by using a bathtub and razors. Shortly after my comment, they replied with a thank you message and said they will return if they decided not to commit suicide. They never returned and the user was deleted. Even the post was deleted by the moderators so that it could go unnoticed unless someone uses an internet archive tool. They were an active user on Reddit with a lot of posts over a long period of time so it was definitely not a throwaway account.

I am posting this to warn people not to suggest ways to commit suicide to someone so they won't suffer like me. I am seeing a therapist now but its not very helpful."
695,Smart gifted kid - miserable adult,"After my siblings passed (I was 1 at the time) my parents divorced but both dotted on me big time. I was the golden child - whatever I want I got, my shit didn't smell. The slightest effort was rewarded with praise and hero worship. Constantly told I was smart, it was drilled into me that I was smarter then everyone else my age.

I'm not a psychologist but being 40 years old now looking back I can see that it setup this mindset, which was reflected in my report cards ""can do excellent work if he applies himself"". As school got harder I just applied myself less. I developed a fear of success *and* failure and just went middle of the road I guess.

To this day I talk to people like they are dumb, I have this feeling of superiority, that is totally unjustified. I know it, I see myself doing it, I know I don't have anything to back it up. In fact in skill sets outside of playing video games I am severely lacking in every aspect. Weak at math and so on. 

How the hell do I break out of this toxic behaviour that has been my goto for 40 years?

Not acting that way is a sustained effort and easily ""forgotten"" the next day or even the next hour.

The sad part is (maybe I am delusional) but I found weed use is helping my mental health but certainly killing my motivation in the office. I've been thinking alot that shrooms might be some sort of catalyst to crack my toxic ego but that can go south if I have a bad trip.  I havn't smoked weed since high school and never tried shrooms.

I just want to be a likeable guy but I feel like I'm watching the majority of my brain be an asshole on the regular and I can't help it. I see the problem, I acknowledge it, but there's no change in sight. I've been craving a good friendship since my last friend moved away 20 years ago and at this rate I'm setup have maybe 5 people at my funeral, out of sheer obligation."
696,First day in years that I feel good about myself. (M18),"Last night I was just watching YouTube instead of sending out job applications, when I realized something. I’ve made mistakes in my life, mistakes that I’ll remember forever, but I think it’s time to forgive myself. I realized that I’ve been on a path of self destruction fuelled by guilt and general self loathing for years, using my past mistakes as an excuse to stop caring about myself and those around me. If you read this and are in the same situation I was, give yourself time to feel shitty about what you did, then never make that mistake again."

698,Is it something more?,"For a bit of background: I am 21y/o female with anxiety, depression and ocd. These issues all came about when I was 10 to 13 years old.
 
For the past year, I have been going through these weird ‘moods.’
There are 3 moods: 

1)I feel impatient, irritable, and act on impulse. If there’s something I want or that I think will help me, I HAVE to get it. I need to find a way to make it possible. This mood makes me worry a lot about the future. And with the impulse that this mood gives me, I make rash decisions. For example, applying to a job, or considering moving to a different town, looking at houses and applying for different courses without a second thought or any consideration. Sometimes I will have dark thoughts in this mood e.g.: self-harm or suicidal thoughts. No intention of acting on the thoughts, but they come up out of nowhere.

 
2)The Second mood is a bit nicer. But still intense. It’s sort of childlike, carefree, and free spirited. When I’m in this mood my attitude is ‘screw it, I’m young, I want to be free and have fun.’ During this mood I can be a bit reckless. For example; quit jobs without a second thought, etc. I wouldn’t say I’m on top of the world when I’m in this mood, but I’m definitely able to think more positively about everything, and actually get things done like daily chores.

 
3)The third mood is how I want to feel all the time. I just feel like… Me. I feel balanced. If I feel ok that’s great, if I don’t feel ok, that’s ok too. I accept the feelings as they come up. I feel more like my true self. I’m calm, collected and balanced. I can finally hear myself think.

 
 
I know no one can diagnose me. But I was wondering If anyone could tell me if they think this might be something more or different to anxiety and depression. I’m not sure whether to talk to my doctor or not. I guess the fact I’m aware of the moods is good, but the problem is they are so intense that I make decisions based on them, and then when I come out of those moods I’m stuck with the consequences. Can anyone give me any advice? Is this normal for my condition? Or should I speak to my doctor? Any help would be really really appreciated. I’m struggling with these mood changes and just want to feel balanced.

699,not sure what’s wrong with me,"okay so, i don’t really post stuff on here, so if i suck at explaining all of this i’m sorry. 

i have dealt with mental issues starting at age 11 due to a lot of issues with my parents. father left when i was a baby, mother has been a drug addict my entire 18 years of life. 

at age 13, i started dating a guy who was 2 1/2 years older than me. we dated on and off for about 6 years and he was extremely verbally abusive; sometimes physically. i was in therapy from age 13-15, where i was diagnosed with manic depression and general anxiety disorder. they prescribed me prozac, though i couldn’t tell you if that worked at all because i hardly remember. 

i’m now with my current boyfriend of 6 months and living with my grandparents. recently, though, i’ve felt my mental health has been dropping at an alarming rate. i have dealt with self harm since age 11. i have been incredibly irritable, lashing out over the smallest things, feeling suicidal, you name it. my moods go from 0-100 in a matter of SECONDS. 

i will make up the craziest shit in my head. slenderman is watching me, my boyfriend hates me and is going to break up with me. and these things i fully convince myself of. 

something new, however, are the voices i hear late at night. weird shadows on my walls. i constantly feel like i’m being watched and will even talk out loud to whatever presence is there. i really feel like i’m going crazy. i told my boyfriend this, and he mentioned paranoid schizophrenic. he’s really into psychology and studies it religiously - could that be a possibility? 

i’m writing this on no sleep, so i’m sorry if it’s a bit messy and all over the place. insomnia has been a bitch lately and i haven’t slept in a little over 24 hours.

i would really appreciate if someone could shine a light on this. my grandparents are highly religious and against therapy and medications. even though i’m 18, i don’t have my license because i’m too scared to drive, and they would probably kick me out for “rebelling” against them."
700,Can’t tell what’s real or not anymore,"TW: sexual assault, mental health

TLDR: had a mental breakdown and started hearing voices that revealed trauma I was not aware of. I can’t tell if there’s something truly wrong with me or if there’s some truth in my madness.


I recently had a mental breakdown. It started with ringing in my ears and feeling like something was crawling into my ear while I tried to sleep.

It got to the point where I couldn’t fall asleep for 3 days. By the 3rd day, it was the full moon and my spiritual group was facilitating a meditation ceremony. I joined in and at the end of it, I felt compelled to continue my spiritual journey.

I left my partner that night to move back home where it’s closer to like minded people. My partner, being the sweet and caring woman she is, allowed me to stay and rest at her place before I left.

That’s when it started. I tossed and I turned, but I couldn’t fall asleep. Then I felt a wave of pins and needles wash over my body from my head to my toes. I felt vulnerable so I started chanting to try and get even just a wink of sleep. A little after I started chanting, I started to hear chanting coming from my partner’s bedroom and I assumed she was watching something or listening to chanting to sleep.

By 4am, I heard someone moving around and I thought her mom had come home so I left to avoid the awkwardness.

Bear in mind, I honestly felt that I was being called for a divine purpose so I drove in silence and chanted in my mind.

Not long into my drive, I started to hear classical music. I thought maybe some wires got loose and my radio was malfunctioning. The radio was off but the music kept playing. I could even change stations but again- the radio was off.

Then I heard voices. It was my dad and step mom talking. He was annoyed that I was calling him at 5 in the morning. It was so faint but my dad was saying something about how my signal is so much clearer. I glanced at my phone and it was off. He hung up and soon later, I had called him again. With my thoughts. It couldn’t have been. I honestly thought I was either hacked or it was 5G.

I kept accidentally calling him with just my thoughts to the point where I had to actually use my phone to call and see if this was real. Guess what? It was. I actually called my dad with my thoughts and heard his voice through my car stereo. It didn’t even register that I called him in my call history.

I freaked out and by the time I got to my mom’s place, I had accidentally called some stranger who was trying to help me change frequencies on my phone but I could barely hear him.

Every thought I had was being projected into phone calls. I ran into my mom’s place shaking and panicking.

That’s just the beginning. So much more happened. I have to summarize at this point.

I got tricked by what ever spirits and pranked. They tortured me mentally and made me look like a fool. They said it was my karma because I killed somebody in a different reality and that I will have to kill myself. If I told anybody, then those who I care about will die. They wanted me to isolate myself away from love.

I ended up at my sister and her boyfriend’s place. It was my sister’s boyfriend who I killed in that other reality and his friends were out for blood. However, I am not that person. I am a different version. I felt so much remorse and desperately wanted to end the pain, anger, and hate.

I found a loophole and ended up staying. I asked if they knew anybody who could exorcise me. I don’t know if my mom said something or it just organically happened, but they ended up having a ceremony (I did not ingest or smoke anything) and I was shown truth. That I’m truly an asshole but I have the strength in me to break the cycle and be humble and more caring towards others.

In my visions I saw that for many many life times I was an evil person who killed, raped, and did atrocious things. Those versions and past lives didn’t care to repent and just pushed it to the next incarnation until all of that karma landed on me.

They called me the benevolent one. The one who could stop this cycle. Thousands of voices started swarming in my mind, fighting with each other and trying to control me. I started talking to myself and tried to take control.

They said some horrible things. By the time I went to bed to try and sleep, they told me I had a golf sized tumour in my brain and that I had to immediately go to the hospital or I will die.

By 2am, I woke up in sweats and panic. They told me I needed to call an ambulance immediately. I worried my sister and got her to drive me to the hospital where the voices panicked me into raising my voice at one of the hospital workers.

They gave me Ativan and left me in a room. I overheard the nurses trying to find reasons to lock me in the psych ward. The voices filled me with paranoia that I won’t ever get out. Then they laughed at me and revealed that they wanted me locked up so I’d kill myself because they thought I was too weak to be their leader. 

They pushed these awful thoughts in my head about everybody I care about.

Okay that’s enough back story. Some of the things the voices said to me were very disturbing. I want to explore these revelations but I’m not sure if it was just my imagination or if there could be some truth.

The one thing that is really bothering me is that they told me my first girlfriend drugged me and let someone fuck me while I was passed out for money. I was only 16-17.

I don’t know if this is true or the voices wanted me to feel completely alone and that I couldn’t trust anyone. This is just one example of the horrible things that they said happened to me.

At this point I really want to believe that they were just playing tricks on me but I honestly feel like it could be true and I don’t know what to do with this.

I’m really confused and want to explore these thoughts and “memories” but my psychotherapist won’t see me until I’m stable and on meds. I started medication but I’ve been trying alternative methods of grounding myself back to reality because I don’t want to be dependent on pharma. I don’t know if this is even something I want to put my energy towards.

It’s been bugging me because the more time passes, the more I try to make sense of what happened and I feel like I’m dismissing an important message.

It could be schizophrenia or some other mental disorder, but I don’t know how to explore this in a healthy manner without seeming crazy and being pumped with medication.

I believe that there is some divine truth in this experience mixed with my own mental instability and that’s where I’m confused.

The voices are gone now and I have managed to ground myself but I still think about what the voices told me and it’s really bothering me.

I don’t know what to do at this point. I can’t talk to anybody close to me about this because it’s very disturbing and I don’t want to worry them but it’s eating away at me."
701,"Emotional abuse happens when a child is repeatedly made to feel worthless, unloved, and alone or scared. Also known as psychological or verbal abuse, it is the most common form of child abuse.",[removed]
702,I lack empathy and I'm afraid I will never be able to feel it. Need advice.,"I (M21) have been taking a long look at myself lately and I think I lack empathy. I've felt this since I was a kid but never really understood what is specifically wrong with me. There are so many memories from my childhood that I remember feeling bad because I was not feeling what I was supposed to feel. Whenever I saw something on the news/media/real life that was awful or sad for other people, I couldn't feel anything, even when it happened to people really close to me who I really loved. When some of my close relatives died I felt so bad I couldn't feel anything inside me and that I had to forcefully bring myself to tears and act like I cared in front of others. This has been a recurring thing in my life when I see people caring or feeling sad about something, I started acting like I did too just to fit in. I know this makes me sound like a terrible person but I was a kid and I didn't know any better. For the better part of my life I just brushed this off to the side thinking that I was just burying my feelings, that I was just looking at life in a very objective point of view, or that I was just not that emotional. But as I got older I knew this was not normal, that hinding my personality and acting in front of everyone in my life is unhealthy. But I also recognised that people categorised this as a bad thing, and when I tried to research about this online, I saw that lack of empathy usually stems in sociopaths/psychopaths but I don't have the other tendencies of these diagnosis. I don't feel the need to hurt anyone or anything, I don't feel joy when someone is hurt, I just feel numb. I might sometimes put myself first and think about or do things that would benifit me over others, but I never did something just for the sake of it. People don't like someone or feel comfortable around someone who doesn't feel empathy, so I just continued doing what I have always been doing.

Now I started realising that this is a big disadvantage in my life. I'm afraid I won't form any meaningful relationsips with anyone, and even if I did I don't want keep acting fake my entire life. It's exhausting for me to keep up this charade but I fear that if I don't, I will lose all my current relationships with not only my friends but also my family. I've been taking some phylosophical classes recently and apparently ethics can be learned by ""practice"". So I started thinking about my own situation; is it even possible to learn empathy? If so, how can I do it?"
703,I know there is something wrong with me but I can't seem to get there in reaching help.,"I've always been emotionally all over the place. I remember clearly being told I was way too emotional for my own good. I was also a wierd kid. I would sit for hours staring st a spot on the wall but I was really inside my head playing. I could create whole stories and play characters while my toys lay on the floor in front of me. 
I digress
I have been trying to work out what's happening. I know I get anxious, also depressed. I do this thing with anything that is worrying me where I run it over and over in my head and can't think of of anything else and I get upset first that can last days, then frustrated and angry when this happens I will get irritable and short tempered and sulky but needy and unable to reach out to my partner because I don't think they want to be near me. Then I get angry and flat I put on a mask that is stone faced all day and in private or at night I can't stop muttering to myself angrily. 
The only way I can escape it is to either distract my brain with something which works for a while or sometimes I can turn all my feelings off but then I am cold and like a robot and I want to sleep all the time and can't talk to anyone. It's ruining my relationship and hurting my daughter. I think she thinks I'm ignoring her when I'm shut down and can't anything.
I've tried to go to coucelling a couple of times both times I was in the middle of obsessing over a problem so I couldn't see anything else at all so basically all I did was tell the therapist how m7ch of an arse my partner was because it was a relationship issue I was currently stuck on. I came out the other side feeling embarrassed at my ranting and anxiety kicked in and I couldn't go back to that therapist. 
The last one I just couldn't call back to book a second session and I don't know why and now it's a 6 month wait to see someone there as they have a waitlsit so I blew that too. 
Fuck me I just need someone to pick me up and put me in front of someone who can fucking help me not feel like this anymore."
704,How do you stop yourself from overthinking all the time?,"I'm in love with a guy and he is in love with me, but I keep thinking he is only with me our of a sense of duty. I know this is true but I feel crippling anxiety when he doesn't call at a time I expect or if he gets busy at work, I convince myself that I am the reason he isn't calling.

Sorry if this doesn't make much sense."

Evanston Hospital,1973-75

As a young lad I spent time there as a guest, after suffering a major trauma in my life.
This place and the people I met there saved my life.

706,Family gives me anxiety,"My family, my extended family (cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents) they give me so much anxiety for no apparent reason. What should I do?"
707,Can anyone explain why it is that I never get better no matter how much I practice?,"Of course I can't expect anyone to do a reliable analysis over the internet but I'm struggling so hard with this.

It seems as if I can't get better at anything, as if practice doesn't make perfect in my case.
I've tried multiple hobbies, I've tried being specific and trouble shooting my self to see what exactly it is that I have to practice. I've tried being methodical and keep my expectations low and just enjoy myself but nothing helps. No matter how much I practice I never get better.

People tell me to stop comparing myself to others and just do what I enjoy but I've found that never feeling like I'm at least decent at something takes away all the joy. What's the funin doing something that I suck at? What's the fun in doing something if I can't see any progress? I want to feel that I'm good at the things I do. It seems as if the usual way that works for normal people doesn't apply to me, whenever I try to set goals and practice there's never any achievement.

And yes, I've tried different things to try to find what I'm ""naturally good at"" but it turns out I just suck at everything and it breaks my heart. 
I also know that sucking at something doesn't make me any less of a human or unworthy of love. I just want to be good, for me."
708,"Am I a terrible person? My mom gives me so much anxiety and I feel like that anxiety will only be gone, once she's gone.","I moved out of the house 10 months ago. The main reason is my mother and our toxic relationship. I never realized how much anxiety she's been causing me, until it was gone. I felt free.
But every now and then, my mother would text me and guilt trip me into coming back. And that's when I realized the anxiety is not totally gone. Even though we're thousand miles apart, the amount of anxiety she's causing is the same. And i thought the only time I could get rid of it is once she's gone. I don't wish for her to be gone soon, but i have strong feelings about it. Am I a terrible person?
I don't have anyone to share this with because I know i'll be judged. All my friends have great relationships with their mother. And I come from a place with close knit families. These thoughts will sound horrible to them."
709,i don’t know what to do,"hi guys,just finished the most important exam in my life. I already know i won’t get a good result,and my parents will be disappointed. All my life i’ve been trying to make them happy, proud that they have a good child,but i ve always failed. I just disappoint them,and i try my best.They always gave me everything i wanted, but i never gave them a reason to be proud of me.This exam decides my future. I just don’t know what to do.I’m always sad . I used to cry everyday,because they told me i’m a failure,that I’m always disappointing them.I promised them that I will get a good result and I will make them proud,but this won’t happen.The results come on Monday.Any suggestions on what should I do?

710,Excessive sweating,"Hey guys, so I have a problem.
I have a Panik disorder (agoraphobia) and as soon as I come in contact with people (in real live or over the phone virtual meetings etc.) I become extremely tense and start sweating.
I slowly started getting better with handling the panic inside my head that I can basically have contact with people. But I am still sweating so much...if I have to talk to a friend I will be mostly fine, because they know of my problem( I can change shirts, and in general I sweat less around them but still), but once I have contact with someone that is not one of my 3 closer friends my shirt is drenched in sweat after a few minutes, which makes it almost impossible to work on my phobia/ makes it worse . Obviously I don't want to/ can't stay around people whilst I'm soaking wet and because of this alone I am extremely uncomfortable.
Has anyone dealt with something similar

Any help ist appreciated"
711,Never been to a psychiatrist before,"I've never been to any type of mental health specialist/therapist/psychiatrist even though I have a lot of issues ranging all the way from anxiety to depression to behavioural problems. I've managed to convince my mother to take me to an actual psychiatrist, not a therapist because I'm very well aware therapists don't do much, they cant diagnose you with anything and it would be a waste of time, what I really need is to understand my brain and the root of my issues so I need a diagnostic of my mental health problems and possible treatment options. 

At the same time though, I have never been to one and have no real idea on how these types of things work, what do they ask you, how they give a diagnosis and etc, it would be really helpful to know from anyone whos obviously been to one before, thank you."
712,Is depression/sadness contagious?,"I don't think I am depressed, but, both my friends are severly depressed and I really try to cheer them up and make conversation happy and funny. Thing is the more depressed they have been feeling, the harder for me it has been to feel happy with them. I dont have other friends and I feel like their moods have been affecting mine as well. I have started to feel more and more sadder, the more I listen to them. I have always listened to their problems and tried to help them out and I don't know what to do anymore as they are quite dependent on me. If one of them suddenly stops talking I get extremely worried thinking of the worst, so I have to keep talking to them. I don't know what to do anymore, I cant not talk to them and I also worry about my own mental health."
713,Quarantine worsening my anxiety,"I can’t sit through Zoom calls in class without fidgeting. I can be in a really good mood right before the sessions, but then I log on and my heart begins to literally thump in my chest and I can’t breathe, and it’s sooo difficult for me to talk when called on in discussions, or especially when my classmates are just joking around and having fun in the chat.

What do I do? I’m suffering sooo bad, I always keep my camera off and feel like crying even though there isn’t really anything particularly wrong. I feel like even though I hated and dreaded interaction in physical classes, my anxiety was a little better back then."

717,Anyone else feel like music makes their mental health worse?,"I know a lot of people use music to cope, but personally I think my mental health would be much better if I did not have access to music. I’ve noticed that it can affect how I feel in extreme ways and could potentially even be dangerous (i.e some music puts me into a rage with violent thoughts and severe adrenaline rushes that nearly make me act on them, some music makes me unbelievably sad to the point I get sick). No way to escape it though."
718,I’m sick of seeing my face everyday,"I never was so insecure but since the start of year 11 it got worse and now lockdown happened it became so life consuming.like before lockdown I’d stress about GCSEs so my mind wasn’t really on my appearance but now I don’t have them,all I think about is how ugly I’am.Maybe I’m overreacting and being the typical insecure girl but it’s so overwhelming for me. I’ve kept it all to myself and everyday I look in the mirror and I hate what I see and Ill want to cry but I can’t because maybe I’m just used to seeing how ugly I’am that I just feel empty.Even if I don’t want to look in the mirror I still do and it makes everything worse but I still do it,why? Well because maybe I think I’ll look better or my face has changed ah how stupid am I to think like that.Id always look in the mirror at school and my friend would always say ‘stop looking in the mirror’ thinking I was so full of myself even though that wasn’t the reason.I know I’m overreacting but it hurts so much like theirs not one part of me I like whatsoever and that’s from head to toe and I don’t even like my personality.sometimes I’ll wake up in a good mood or be happy when I listen to happy music but I never last long ,no distraction ever does.However this week is just worse like I enjoy going to sleep so I don’t have to think or worry but I hate waking up because I’m sick of repeating the same day and I’m sick of seeing myself. I mean I don’t even go outside anymore and refused to go shopping with my mum and she thinks I’m being lazy but I’m not I just don’t want anyone to see how ugly I’am.Lately I’ve been thinking that if I died then I wouldn’t have to feel any of this I wouldn’t have to feel ugly and worthless and disgusting and I really have thought about it and how I wouldn’t suffer and have to think about the future and worry about it and me being a failure.I mean I’ve though about how I would die well is just overdose cos I’m too much of a pussy to do anything else I mean I attempted to self harms and that was unsuccessful and the forth time I did it,it was a bit deep and I instantly felt sick and nauseous. But then I’m scared to die and one of the reasons being that because I’m religious and I think I’ve not done any good deeds and I believe in heaven and hell so I know I’d go to hell and I’m scared and sometimes I think it might be a phase I’m going through maybe things will get better but I can’t see it happening I’ve lost any hope and faith and just want to give up and I don’t even want to start college. I hate everything about me."
719,Did someone experience similar things and can maybe help?,"Yesterday I finally to my therapist about something that was on my mind for quite a while. I'm somewhat scared of my father. For example: I get really anxious and panic when he's close to me in the kitchen and when I'm somewhere with him I do this weird shuffle to make space. I also get uncomfortable when I notice him eating something (which is a problem in general) and when I hear him breathing. In last three to four years I kind of remembered weird things from my earlier childhood I'd forgotten (I'm 17 now).
I learned how to shower and bathe alone really late. In primary school my dad still bathed with me and washed my hair, both naked. I remember touching his, you know what, but the context is blurry and I think he told me not to, but I'm really not sure about anything regarding that besides that not much happened.
There was also this thing about 'fondling'. He often wanted to run the back of his hand down my face, which I wasn't comfortable with. When he took me on day trips or got me something that made me happy I let him do that because I wanted to give him something back, show I was thankful. I was brought up showing graditude and being respectful towards you elders, so i felt like I had to. Same goes for a goodnight kiss on the lips. My therapist told me that even little kisses on the lips from parents to children were weird, which never occured to me.
Despite being brought up without many restrictions I always felt (and sometimes still feel) very dependent and homesick whenever I was at a sleepover and I still feel the need to label myself a child. Sometimes I just feel like i need get out of here, my parents' house and I'm nervous typing this right now. 
I feel guilty and stupid for my feelings and for making a fuss about these things, but I know that won't help the situation. I'll meet up with my half sister in a few days and talk to her about this and some other family matters. Maybe she knows something I don't or has similar feelings about some things. 
Did anyone else experience similar things or has any thoughts? Sorry for this super long post and possible typing errors. Thank you for reading."

721,"I'm 25, and my mental health has severely spiraled downhill due to COVID-19. I'm afraid I'm going to kill myself, and I feel like I can't do anything about it.","A little backstory:  


I'm 25 and live in Manhattan, and have been without a job since December of 2019. I was a contractor who's contract ended and I was to join another firm in March. However, due to COVID-19, the role never came to fruition and it was involving an industry that became decimated due to the pandemic. Since then, I have applied to more than 175 jobs, have barely gotten any responses back, and haven't had any social interaction in person other than my roommates.  I've reached out to more than 100 people on LinkedIn, edited my resume more than 20 times, and have been desperately trying to find a role every single day, for hours on end. Since gyms have been closed and that was the main release of all my pent up energy and stress, I haven't been able to workout properly since March. I've lost more than 30 pounds of fat and muscle (and now I'm scrawny and thin), my hair is starting to fall out, white hairs are appearing, and my depression and anxiety have gotten so insane to a point where I will have full-fledged nervous breakdowns on a weekly basis because of my inability to get a job.   


I've screamed at my parents multiple times asking if I can kill myself because I no longer can deal with the constant rejection and feeling like a failure, I've lost control and collapsed in tears in the fetal position and cried myself to sleep at least once a week, I've lost the motivation to take care of myself, and all I do now is sit on my computer and focus all my time and effort into applying to jobs.   


My worst tendencies such as self-harm have resurfaced, I have bruised myself and caused bleeding, and the more I get rejected, the more I feel like a failure. My antidepressants are no longer working, I am unable to sleep properly, my skin has aged, and I feel like my body is falling apart because of all this stress. I don't know why my friends are able to handle the situation better, but I feel like I'm losing my purpose. I'm tired of the false hope that every job posting I apply to provides, to only be ghosted or have no clue if I'll get a callback. 

What should I do? I'm thinking of going to see my parents for the first time in three months, but they live in an area where I have no friends, nobody to hang out with other than them, and I feel like I'd be just as miserable. What should I do? If this continues for the next 4 weeks, I know for a fact I will probably jump off my apartment's roof. I can't deal with this anymore. I need a fucking job, I'm tired of feeling worthless, I'm tired of not being able to work out, to see any of my friends in person, to have a routine, and I am seriously afraid I'm going to end up doing something that's not reversible. 

I'm putting all my effort into getting a job at this point, and I will do anything it takes, regardless of how detrimental it is to my health just to get a job."
722,What's the point of a social site if no one will ever communicate back?,"I've been having some depression problems the past year and that has caused me to stop talking with people but within the last couple of months I have been trying to improve myself. I have been trying to get a hold of people and they all keep ignoring me. I will text them, nothing. I will message on Facebook, nothing. I made a post a month ago about working on improving myself and getting back into contact with people. Many comments on praising me for trying to help myself but when I go to message some of them right after the comment, nothing. I'm just so frustrated. How can you tell me, ""Hey, I'm here for you! If you need someone to talk with,  hmu."" Then when I do, I get the silent treatment. Ugh... I'm trying to reconnect with people I've been friends with for years and apologize for being so isolating and nothing. I feel like my ""friends"" never actually saw me as a friend....."
723,Need help/advice looking after partner,"Hey, just wanted to get some advice with taking care of a depressed/anxious partner. Sorry if I'm not disclosing enough but what can you do once you've tried therapy, medication and counselling? I do understand that there's no linear path to healing but I don't know how to comfort their daily suffering and seeing them go through this every day just breaks my heart. I really want to help them get out of this but am just lost and I don't know how else to do so."

I’m having a really hard time at work which is negatively affecting my depression and anxiety.  I feel like I can’t do anything right and that my boss doesn’t understand where I’m coming from. I have to take my anxiety medicine (klonopin) every day just to get through the day without anxiety. It makes me sleepy and not motivated to do anything after work. 

I just feel like I must be a horrible employee based on my interactions with my boss and it’s spilling over to my personal life. I have no self confidence in myself or my abilities.

725,Escape from complicated tasks,"Hello,

Recently, I got shocked to realise how my brain changed the way it seems to work/respond to certain situations and I was wondering if I can find any advice here. I have been struggling with my job for a while now, feeling demotivated to do anything and finding it so hard to get myself to do any tasks. To describe the feeling it was like any task is overwhelming to me and my brain loses focus and starts racing and stressing which just makes it worse. This feeling causes me to not want to even attempt the task and makes it constant battle with myself to even start working.

I thought it was because I was just not interested in my work and that's why I was finding it so difficult to focus but today I played a computer game first time in a long time. I used to love games and could spend hours reading the theory, which builds would be best, what the characters do etc etc. Since this time it was a game I never played there were a lot of unknowns. And the game was quite complicated. I instantly started feeling the same feeling of being overwhelmed at the idea of learning all those things, got stressed and couldn't enjoy the game at all. It's as if my brain wanted to escape the complexity into something simpler. But I don't understand why, since I used to love to explore the games and they would only bring me joy not stress. I used to love complexity to some extent too. Learning difficult things would bring me joy and I used to be a very good student.

I have no idea why I changed like that... Does anyone have similar experience? Is there a name for that? And what are some ways to fight it?

I'd love to go back to just calmly approaching complex and challenging things whether they are games or learning new things. With my current state of mind it seems impossible to learn anything new, even if I'd like to."

733,What is wrong with my father?,"Dear Reddit,

Due to the sensitive nature of this subject: I decided to make this a throwaway account. I am not a native English speaker, so excuse any sentences that are sloppily put together.

The reason for this post is due to the escalating decline of my father's mental health, and we as a family are not sure what exactly is going on. My father is unwilling to try out any medicine or seek out any professional help, which leaves us powerless and confused in an ever-worsening situation. His general profile would be:

*59 year old male*

*Blue collar job*

*Married for 35 years (36 years in a relationship)*

*In nation of origin together for 5 years, in current country of residence for 30.* 

*Oldest son is 32, youngest is 21.*

*Everyone in the family is alive except grandfather, grandmother has early signs of dementia.* 

My father has become increasingly more incapable to lead his life as is, and to treat the people around him normally. This started about 4 years ago and has been steadily growing worse. Four years ago, or ever since, nothing specifically happened that I could define as a 'genesis' to this problem. I will list the issues that are escalating below:

1). My father becomes arbitrarily enraged and verbally aggressive over a variety of events happening in the household. From the thickness of cut tomatoes, the decision to watch another episode, to the cleanliness of the kitchen or the leaving behind of a glass. He has no history of OCD or any cleanliness-related specifications. He is not shy to demean or insult relatives over their incompetence, lack of intelligence, spoiled-ness or uselessness as mother/son/uncle, etc.

2). If he is addressed or spoken to, regardless of tone or timing of the day: most of the times, my father becomes enraged as well or shuts down. He either starts to loudly exclaim to leave him alone, or he completely ignores everyone in the room. Especially when there are situations that involve guilt or mistakes, such as forgetting a grocery item or a deadline, he loses his temper. It makes no difference whether you address this in an accusatory fashion, or merely mention it in passing. 

3). For all affairs pertaining to the household and family, he feels blamed or wronged. Without mentioning a party, he'd immediately jump to yelling or insulting as if he is a blamed party. He has a strong tendency to make every situation about himself, hijacking conversations about other family member's tragedies to complain about his own current sad situation. He has a strong victim narrative and a constant sense of being attacked. Something cannot go wrong, without him either partly feeling blamed or attacked implicitly by others around. 

4). My father has an obsessive tendency to describe fantasies of departing from his current country of residence and to return to his homeland, leaving everyone behind and going off the grid. Whenever situations escalate, he would resort to threaten his family that he would disappear and depart tomorrow because he can't take it anymore. He ignores the imminent birth of his grandchildren, his existing children (one still requiring his support to finish his education) and his (house)wife. He uses these threats against his wife primarily, trying to subdue her in fear of her longtime partner/chief financial contributor departing. Since 3 years, he no longer can guarantee being around his family in times of need. Changing his explanation from ""I'll be far but close"" to ""You'll never see me again"", from ""I will drag my child through college"" to ""He is old enough, he can handle himself"". These constant changes to the narrative makes life seem unstable. He also mentions divorce, suicide or abandoning his family a lot. Same for his decision to stay around for his upcoming grandchild. Sometimes he's important enough to stay, but later that day, he is going to leave us all anyways. 

5). He forgets appointments, promises or conversations entirely or partially: changing his perception or substance of his words within a couple of days or even hours. Long-term agreements regarding debts, payments, housing, education, family or their marriage post-children have changed almost consistently. He has sold items, destroyed important items (a tree in remembrance of our deceased dog, or old material from his children, etc) or sold family items (our boat, a model gun, etc) without any consultation or even in defiance of agreements. Even though he forgets them, he has a tendency to accuse his wife and my brother (eldest child) of manipulating him. You cannot hold him accountable without a total meltdown happening. He forgets and changes past events so much, that we suspect that dementia might also be a factor. His mother has it too. See point 3.

6). He has increasingly radicalized perception of the world and hostile opinions about other countries, his current country of residence, the people, the culture, etc. He is comfortable wishing death upon entire groups of people in relation to 'cosmic karma' for geopolitical events that hurt his homeland in the past. He furthermore expresses hostile ideas such as scratching a car with his key that is parked too long in front of our home, that X person should be hanged, etc. Any nuance previously held in his worldview has been entirely evaporated. 

7). He obsessively demeans the hobbies and interests of his relatives and friends, from insulting the quality of the media we consume, the music we listen to or the activities we have. He does not support any (creative) life decision nor respects different opinions, actively seeking out opportunities to express distaste.

8).  He sleeps in marathons in both the weekends and workweeks. He goes to work at 6:30, comes home at 5PM. After dinner, he usually sleeps between 5:40PM - 11PM, and then from 12AM to the time he wakes up in the morning. Sometimes during weekends, he'd in addition also sleep in the afternoons.

9). He expresses a consistent unwillingness to go out or meet any people outside of the house, and does this as well. He complains about guests, friends or family visiting aggressively and rejects any proposals pertaining to family activities or visiting other places. Every time his presence is expected to a degree we cannot leave him home, getting him to join us requires excessive convincing or fighting. He has been losing friends consistently by simply not contacting them anymore, this includes friends from his homeland or in other countries.

10). He is increasingly unable to maintain normal conversations without his attention fading onto something else, him getting enraged or him repeating the same point excessively. Sometimes this also turns into him ignoring you, or changing the subject entirely. If you demand an answer or state that he has already told something, he would also grow mad. His friends are starting to complain about this, expressing openly that he is becoming annoying or repetitive. 

11). He no longer does anything physically affectionate to his wife and children (hugging or sexual/tender activity to his wife, etc) and sleeps in a separate room. Whenever anyone wishes to touch him, he roughly removes your hand/arm and expresses that he needs to be left alone, that he is being suffocated, etc. His lack of affection prompted his wife to accuse him of having an extramarital affair, which he reluctantly denies. 

12).  He no longer listens to music, watches any media or has any hobbies of his own outside of working, sleeping and 'existing'. Any initiative to do what he was previously interested in is met with rabid opposition (see point 9).

While this situation is too complex to describe in bullet points, the general backdrop of all this is that we see a man that no longer communicates and behaves like he used to: and acts with increased aggression and incompetence at adhering to basic social norms or father-related expectations. He has been through a lot for sure. But relative to others and his former self, his inability to normally converse and behave is disproportionate. 

On the other hand, he has not filed for divorce and has refused to do so even though we've all told him we'd accept it. He has been repeatedly told to leave if he really wants to, but stays. He is the figure in the family with the financial means to entirely abandon us and sustain himself, yet he does not do so. The fact he sticks around and refuses to *actually* leave, makes us suspect other reasons than just ""an unhappy marriage"", etc. And for the record, there is no history of extreme marital conflict/cheating or fallouts between family members.

**Any clues on what might be happening to my father?**"
734,Advice on Self Image - Currently Struggling,"I'm struggling with having a remotely positive self-image.

A bit of background - young(ish) adult, currently living overseas in the EU. Graduated from university, but never really found anything in my fields of study for a variety of reasons (can explain more if necessary). Currently practicing everyday to improve in language and one of my fields. Trying to take a step every day for future prospects (e.g. email to a grad school, work on a job application, etc.). Have struggled with some depression, but I've remained functional (showering, having a job, etc.).

The problem is... I virtually never feel proud of myself. I never feel like I do enough. Last night, I worked like a dog to finish up a couple of files so I could submit for a job application. It seemed like they turned out alright and I submitted everything. Then after that... I just broke down in tears out of shame that I knew I wasn't good enough. I had just worked hard, put forth my best work, have been improving, but I just broke down in pure shame.

Technically I had a little formatting... not quite error, but something I could have done better (with about the same importance as... idk, putting the date on a letter) and I could have further refined some things. But we all know that speed is important when applying to jobs as well. And... I don't think that's really the problem. I think even if I could have corrected those two things... I would have had the same reaction. I would have found something else to be ashamed over.

Does anyone have any advice for this? Stepping back, I don't think shame was the right response to have, but I don't know how to be proud of my self or happy with myself.

Thanks."
735,"Something's with me, but I don't know what","I don't know how I'm going to voice this out, but I'll try.

Quick backstory on my previous therapies:

- I've been to therapy twice in my life, the first one I don't really remember, because I was really young then, though my aunt told me about, which is why I know, and the second time I remember, because it happened back in 2018. The first one happened, because my aunt was concerned that I washed my hands way too much (and I mean like every few minutes), and while I don't do that any more (though I still wash my hands a lot), I do remember being in second grade, and taking an hour or more in the shower, because I was showering in the highest heat possible, and repeatedly soaping my self at least 5x, because I wanted to be really clean. I don't take long in the shower anymore, but I do take my time when it comes to my post shower routine. The second time I went to therapy was because I was suicidal ever since I was 10, and early 2018 I slit my arm to know what that feels like, and because I felt a rush in my body, which made me feel like doing it, though the slits weren't deep enough to the point it would scar or anyone would notice, because I was just after the quick feeling. I stopped going to therapy that same year, because I felt like I didn't need it anymore, because I wasn't suicidal anymore (I still don't feel suicidal, but I'll go on about me later).

Me:

- Ever since I was a little kid I've never felt emotion/empathy for others, and I don't know why. I just could never see myself in other's shoes, and even though my Catholic grandmother raised me to have empathy for others, I still can't do it, and end up lying about having empathy for others. I also lie a lot, and even though I don't have to lie about something, and even though I'm not hiding something when it comes to certain things, I still lie about it, and I couldn't stop myself from doing so, though I can be honest from time to time, and the only reason I'm confessing right now is because I'm confident no one I know irl is on here.

I also could never be authentic to anyone, and I couldn't hold a long term connection with others, and I meanconnections in general, I've never been in a relationship (I don't want to), but I find myself not having friends, because they're temporary to me, and will eventually leave. I actually don't even know what the ""real"" me is like, because of all these ""masks"" I show to each different person I interact with. I have my own hobbies, and this ""mask"" I speak of is a different version of me to fit in with different people when I'm outside (mostly school), and though I hate talking/socializing I still do it, because I feel like I have to, and it keeps me from looking like a nobody. 

I have been described as ""vain"" by some of my family members most notably by my grandfather (dad's side), because I apparently spend too much time with my grooming. I do find that I like myself more above everyone else, and I do find myself constantly manipulating others for my personal gain (also to make my self look good), and I know don't have to do these things, but just couldn't stop myself from doing so, just like with my lying. I don't know, but I guess I'm just narcissistic, which is also the reason I don't want to be in a relationship and long term friends, I just put myself above them.

My temper is also bad, and though I can keep it to myself when others are present, I always find myself swearing and screaming when I'm alone. My temper has always been bad ever since I was a child, and when I can't do something, whether that's something like origami or something art related, which I'm awful at btw, I always did break whatever I was making and threw it away.

I would never really do stuff like this, especially online, but this one is new, and I was debating with myself whether I should mention this or not, but recently I've been having homicidal fantasies. I had them with people I hate when I was younger, but this time these fantasies happen even with random people I see on the street, and I don't know why. I never thought of taking action, and everything homicide related is completely in my head. I recently found myself watching lots of stuff related to gore like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Ted Bundy Doc on Netflix, gore sites like bestgore, and etc, which fuel these thoughts more, but again these are completely in my head, and I don't intend in taking action.

I know that I could open up to my family like I did with my suicidal tendencies, but the only reason I did that was because I felt like doing that for change to happen, but for the rest from my lack of empathy and emotion, lying, and more I just feel like that couldn't be changed anymore, and I don't want them to think of me in a different way when I tell them all this + the fact that I don't believe in any religion, which I feel will fuck things up even more, because of how religious they are."

737,Need help for a friend,"I have a friend (F22). She doesn’t feel motivated or energetic or happy most of the time. Most of the times he doesn’t even know what she is sad about. I try to talk to her to her to make her feel better and i fail miserably at it every time. She has tried meeting psychologist in the past, twice, but that didn’t work out for her. She didn’t feel they were as good. Usually the remedy that she tries is just distracting herself in one way or the other, like talking to friends or scrolling instagram or maybe watch tv shows. But it feels that these options are now exhausted. I am currently far away from her and cannot meet her due to the lockdown situations. I tried to convince her to try meeting a new psychologist online, but she says its too exhausting to tell a new one the whole story again. 

It makes me feel bad that i am unable to help her. Please suggest what should i do in order to help her or cheer her up."

740,Feeling very angry and feel myself going into a really dark place,"( I cuss a lot here so if you don’t like that then don’t read)

I had an online friend who randomly started blocking me on all the social media platforms we had each other on not too long ago. I’m pretty sure the reason why she did this is because I no longer allowed myself to be her “therapist” anymore. (I realize that our friendship was one sided and she only liked to talk about herself). 

Well the last time we texted she went on her usual bullshit about only talking about her problems and not giving a single fuck to ask me anything. She was going on about how this one mutual friend we had once randomly blocked her on all social media (how ironic) and I comforted her for a bit (fuck my dumb people pleasing ass). After a while though I had the courage to open up to her about the fact that this once “mutual friend” of ours is a huge piece of shit and basically preyed on me sexually. When I told her this she seemed unphased based on her replies. She basically acted like it was no big deal and then talked about how she still can’t believe that this person blocked her for no reason. Like excuse me? I just fucking told you that this person is disgusting scum and you’re worried about the fact that they blocked you? 

Then she changed the topic to talk about how depressed she was that her boyfriend had recently dumped her. I tried to bring up what I just told her and I even asked her “do you even care?”. She again seemed unphased and then clearly lied to me saying she did. She then began talking about her boyfriend again. At that point I was done. As a final attempt to get her to come to her fucking senses I asked her why she had blocked me on this other social media we were following each other on and she said “oh I don’t know about that” and yep, that was that. I left her on read and felt extremely disappointed. At first I couldn’t really process it. But now (2 weeks later) I’m finally realizing how much a piece of shit she is and I’m really angry. 

I’m tired of being hurt by people. Starting with my own family. I’ve been abused and hurt by people my whole life that I became a hermit because of it. I have social anxiety and agoraphobia and don’t like going out much. I already had major trust issues but now with this Idek. I feel my mind is starting to sink into even more darkness than it’s already been these last few years. I’m tired of people.

And I barely have any friends as it is so to lose someone from my already small circle is really triggering my fear of abandonment even though I know I’m better off without that scum. 

Another thing that I’m pissed off about is that I have a tumblr blog and I have about 3k followers and no one even gives a shit about my personal posts, but as soon as I post something “aesthetic” I get notes for that of course. And before anyone says anything, I know I shouldn’t expect people to give a fuck about me but it still hurts so much to be ignored. Idk why people ignore me but I’ve seen other people on that website say the dumbest things and they get lots of attention for it. I feel like people probably see me as this lunatic since I’ve talked about mental health on there before. Idk I’m just so angry and I feel like everyone is fake now. I’m really tired and done with people"
741,I'm having another mental breakdown.,"It's been a tough few years for me.

Me and my brother were both subject to abuse since we were kids: my older brother was always scapegoated whenever I misbehaved, on top of the general disinterest and lack of encouragement we were given. Our parents hate each other (they hate each other today and they hated each other back then too) and always argued; it was never a stable household. 

Fast-forward to three years ago and both me and my brother were struggling; it was a crescendo of the years of neglect we had faced and we had both couldn't cope. It was around that time where I had my first mental breakdown: I had already been doing poorly; my parents had already moved me from my previous secondary school when I was 12 due to behavioural issues (mostly caused by my parents arguing throughout the week consistently over the most trivial things). My grades had been fine up to this point (despite me never studying and relying on video games to distract me from my bad home life) but due to a variety of factors I finally cracked. Almost out of the blue, I started to struggle with day to day tasks: I spoke slower, I thought slower, I was emotionally distraught, I felt awful. I told all of this to my parents who - instead of trying to help me - decided to gaslight me instead and act indignant towards a 16 year old because he was asking for help when he was struggling. Every day I would wake up and feel miserable, an utter shell of my former self that paced through life like a corpse. My grades plummeted while my parents said that nothing was wrong with me, saying that they thought nothing had changed (despite all evidence pointing to the contrary). 

I spent the next three years struggling also; the misery fluctuated with stressful situations, but never really went away. I devoted a lot of time pondering on what was making me feel so poor, and made progress very slowly. I noticed that whenever I woke up before my parents (my sleeping schedule being the mess that it is) I would feel comfortable and have some of this horrid anxiety leave my body, culminating in one instance where I felt like myself again (before my parents both woke up and the feelings of misery and anxiety came back). Only on my Gap Year (a year taken before university in the UK, typically to develop oneself or to partake in opportunities like travel) have I had the time to realise what has been going on in my family. I realised how much of a narcissist my mother was, constantly changing the narrative whenever it's to her liking (this has been especially toxic when it has involved my university choices) and gaslighting me whenever I point out her bullshit. My father isn't much better, doing the same thing he's been doing since I was born (sitting at home all day watching TV and getting into arguments with my mother). 

I've spent the past couple of months contemplating this heavily, waking up to the abuse and seeking help; it's been a source of major anxiety, combing over years of abuse and trying to understand it. I actually started to feel motivated however, coming to terms with the past and trying to break out of an anxious stupor. Sadly, I'm still under the same roof as my mother and father and am still financially dependent on them. 

This has all lead to me having another mental breakdown, similar to the one I had just under four years ago. I realise now how much my mental health has been impacted by my parents. All of the years of confusion, of anxiety, and of low self esteem make sense. I understand how my abusive parents combined with my other stressors contribute to my poor mental health and the stagnation of my personal development (I've become such a misanthrope these past couple of years and I'm thoroughly ashamed of it).

I just want someone to understand what I've been going through these past couple of years. I know what I've wrote is likely very confusing (my current stress level is pretty high) but I just want people to know what I'm going through. Any help/advice would be appreciated."
742,The funny side of mental illness,"Hey guys- it says no soliciting here, so please delete if not allowed.

But I am considering starting a podcast that only talks about the random funny moments that can happen when living with mental (or even physical) illness. I have been dealing with MDD and GAD with Panic attacks since puberty and my spouse has OCD. Though it can be a struggle to communicate sometimes and we have our difficult moments- there are some moments that make us laugh. I it might be a good way to de-stigmatize mental illness and create a positive community where we can bond over positive things.

SOOOOO - what I wanted to know is- are there any (anonymous) stories that you would like to share here and/or with me on the podcast? I'll start!!!

So my funniest panic attack (in retrospect, obviously)::: I was living in a small city in Guatemala, and needed to go to the bank to change American money for Quetzales (Guatemalan money). This was years ago before there were a lot of options available for getting local money overseas. So it's this huge process that I've done before, where you have to wait in line for like an hour because it is the only bank and is so busy all the time. I have to bring my passport, have every bill inspected, sign papers, etc. It was a huge process and something I had set aside essentially a whole day to do, with travel included. Meaning- once I began this process, there was no bailing on it or I would lose a whole day.

(Just a bit of background on me- triggers for my panic attacks are food or health related things- especially my blood sugar) So I'm standing in line for over an hour already and I'm hot and I'm starting to feel trapped because I'm now in the middle of the room with people everywhere. I feel a little woozy maybe, so that triggers a full-on physical panic attack. I mean, tunnel vision, numb teeth, body tremors, weak knees, cold sweats, nausea, confusion, THE WORKS! So, now I'm the only American in this place and I stand out because of my height and complexion and I do what any seasoned Anxiety person would do. I sit my ass down on the floor in the middle of this bank and start fanning myself. I eventually laid down completely and EVERYONE starts to ask me what's wrong, if I'm okay, that the heat is too much for me, etc. Which makes it worse because Attention! Ack!!

So I'm laying in the middle of a bank floor in the middle of Guatemala with full body tremors, praying I don't shit my pants, puke, or pass out. But let me tell you - I was NOT going to bail on my money adventure for a panic attack. Luckily it passed before I got to the window and my day was not ruined.

I have a million more - mostly about living with my OCD hubby. Long or short though, I want to hear your funny stories!!!"

747,"What therapy is about, and what it's supposed to do","Pasting the comment I made in another sub I feel could help

I think most people are at least okay with their situation. What really happened to mentally ill people is that they lost the gene lottery and/or they got abused one way or another so much they developed unhealthy coping mechanisms that shouldn't be but are used in non-threatening life situations. 

Those mechanisms are not appropriate to the severity of what's happening but they work so they are ingrained in their user's(s') mind so much they don't know what else to do, but the problem is they take too much energy so either the user retreats to recharge or they keep going but can't face another situation that would trigger the coping mechanism again or else 

That's why therapy is important : it teaches what is or not normal, or at least what a sane person would think and do, and what is not. It is also why medicines/drugs alone don't help much on their own. 

Anyway, I kinda learned that thanks to that one Steven Universe Future episode where he goes to the doctor and they tell him what is probably wrong so for those who don't know that show, check it out (and yes, I'm probably older than their young target audience but it didn't prevent me from enjoying it)."
748,my parents don’t think i have a mental disorder,"after years of having me feeling like i have tourette syndrome or some other neurological disorder and my parents telling me that i don’t and everything it fine, they finally took me to a neurologist. and of course i got diagnosed with tourette’s bc i have literally all of the symptoms. i also got diagnosed with ocd and possibly generalized anxiety but my parents literally don’t believe me, they aren’t the type of people who think mental illness doesn’t exist, they just think that it can’t possibly exist in their children. my mom literally told me that my diagnosis is just word and that there is nothing wrong with me, idk if she’s trying to make me feel better but it makes me hate her. my dad and older brother keep saying that the doctor is just diagnosing me bc its convenient and they get money from it and they are just super skeptical about it. i have mentioned several times to my mom that i want to see a therapist and i think it would help me and my mom is like “yeah sure” but then she never actually does anything about it.  when i try to tell me mom something she brushes it off so then i stop telling her things and when we went to see the doctor and i was telling the doctor how i feel my mom was literally like “yOu dOnt teLl mE thIs” i have told my mom about my intrusive thoughts and the way i feel and she literally told me that it’s normal and everyone goes through that even though she doesn’t understand what i’m saying and then when i tell that same stuff to a doctor and a doctor tells me i have a disorder my mom is like “nO tHatS iMpoSsIble” idk what to do.  

TL;DR : my parents don’t think i have the mental disorder that i am diagnosed with and say that the diagnosis is “just words”. they also think that the doctors only diagnosed me bc it’s convenient for them so that the insurance covers it or some crap."
749,"i'm a relapsing anorexic. help me, please.","I recovered from anorexia 2 years ago, but quarantine took a toll on my mental health. I've been starving myself for 2 weeks now, limiting my calorie intake to 200.


I didn't want my 2 year progress to go to waste and I tried to recover again, but I ended up purging lunch today. I discovered that starving yourself for too long leads to your body storing everything as fat, and I don't want to gain weight.

753,Is this normal?,"I have so many questions and i have no one to ask so i might post here frequently. I was speaking to a friend about a stressful situation that happened a few years ago when i suffered from terrible anger from the medication i was on. He told me about the event but when he told me i could only remember certain bits. For example, i remember being talked down by someone but then i cant remember how i ended up from one location to the next. This seems to happen a lot when i got angry and sometimes when i'm watching something. Is this normal? Because my memory is usually pretty good. Replies would be much appreciated."
754,Random bouts of sadness,I get random bouts of sadness and lash out a lot at my partner ... I’m only happy with my bestfriend but even then I still get sad and I have to hide it.... Idk what to do
755,Should I be more worried about physical health or mental health?,[deleted]
756,Loss of control?,"I honestly feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm very clearly not enough for anyone, constantly messing up, yet still trying to get a ton of shit done at once. It's draining and I'm burning out but it feels like my emotions are nothing more than a burden on them. Not too sure how to cope."
757,Moclobemide vs Cymbalta?,"What are your opinions? I suffer from social anxiety and followed by that depression. Cymbalta gives me extreme insomnia and I can‘t ejaculate anymore. My appetite is almost not present and I lose weight. It doesn‘t do much for my anxiety or depression, maybe I‘m a slight bit calmer right now, but it‘s very very subtle and doesn‘t help me with my issues.

The next med my doc wants to try is Moclobemide. What are your experiences and opinions on these two drugs in comparison? Especially concerning social anxiety and depression?"
758,I’m afraid learning to drive is going to snap my mental health like a twig.,"I didn’t drive for a year and four months after failing two driving tests. I was encouraged to learn again because I was in a good place mentally.

Turns out, you can go down hill massively from there. I moved onto advanced material, test standard after 8 hours of refresher course because I’ve been drilling my brain to learn as I tend to do when I’m passionate about something.

I have the test in a week. My instructor says I am doing wonderful. We did a mock test today which I failed because I had some work to do on roundabouts but we corrected it and she was still pleased by the end of the lesson.

Until now, when I can’t do it anymore. I’ve lost my appetite, I look angry, I feel like an entirely different person and I hate it. No matter what I try, I can’t get back to my happy place. I don’t want to quit driving because it will help me in the future, but I will if it means I can be happy again because this test pressure is crushing me. I am a different person now to who I was 2 weeks ago. 

How can I overcome this?"
759,Do you sleep before episodes???,"I noticed I get so tired and sleep for a whole 1-2 days before either depressive or hypomania episodes.

760,just found out my friend also selfharms,"i found his reddit account through our university’s subreddit by accident (but i’m certain it’s him) and i occasionally peek at his profile from time to time. he made a post about self harming for the first time in a while and it kind of stopped my heart when i saw it.

i haven’t spoken to any of my friends from uni since around the end of march when everything virus-related happened aside from a few texts here and there, except with this guy.

he opened up to me about his tough home life and i’ve always felt like we really connected. the thing is, i’m asexual and aromantic (something i only learned last year) and i don’t want him to get the wrong idea that i like him or anything. i haven’t spoken to him now in like two months but the reddit post was from a few days ago. he knows i deal with self-harm and various addictions so i really want to reach out. 

the thing is, i’m really depressed right now and i’m going through my own shit. i don’t know how to be there for another person when i can’t be there for myself, you know? anyways, these are just my thoughts i guess. i know i should text him. i probably will. ahhhh."
761,Is a diagnosis necessary?,"As someone who has personally dealt with mental health issues, I found being diagnosed so helpful, it helps me understand why I am the way I am, and gives me 'validation' in a way.

I just found out someone close to me who is quite young has been struggling with self harm, weight issues, and I suspect anxiety, and I was wondering is it useful to encourage them to see a doctor or would it be more helpful for them to maybe do things more 'holistically' like talking therapy, friends family, healthy eating, exercise etc,

Like at what point do you need an official diagnosis and this is something you're probably going to be dealing with for the rest of your life but you can manage your symptoms or can you just work on these issues without necessary defining them or labels

I hope that made some sense"
762,I get anxious and frustrated whenever i hear news from home,"Hello and thanks for the attention.

I'm a student (23f) and haven't been living at home for five years now. I don't visit often because I don't feel relaxed and at ease at home (like I very much do in the city where I'm living on my own). I hate being at home because it is messy and mostly dirty and also because my family is very disorganised (they never finish anything they start). That's why I have decided to just not come home very often and create a new life for myself. But recently, I have been feeling anxious and frustrated whenever I just hear from my mother via phone. She often tells me about horrible situations which are going on on the estate (e.g. yesterday she told me that our mom cat has left her kittens and doesn't want to feed them, and they still don't know how to drink the milk my mom has given them) and she constantly acts incapable of fixing things on her own. It is like she is paralysed which is, in turn, making me frustrated because the solutions to her problems are simple, but she just does not know how to apply them. I just end up being frustrated because I can't help, or feeling guilty because I don't want to leave the life I'm building for myself to come home and take care of my family.   
Is there a way to resolve this? Or do I just continue living with these feelings forever."
763,Don’t mind me - just venting,"I’ve been feeling extremely lonely and abandoned by the people closest to. I’ve always been that person to be a shoulder to cry on or take calls/texts at anytime of the day when they need someone to listen to. I’m at every event or small gathering to show support and that a truly care but right now im getting really tired of being that person. Not that i do these to get anything return but it would be nice for someone to acknowledge that Im alive especially when they don’t need something or someone to listen to them. I feel like I’m always being kicked to the curb, excluded, or just forgotten. I’ve never been more lonely in my life and nobody gives a shit. it just makes me feel worthless. Like i have the nerve to live on this planet."
764,COnfused,"Right now I am in a residential. This shit is tough. My parents don't think that I'm trying to get better and I'm really trying, but I can't show them. I was at my last residential for 211 days, then I came back home, and I was home for about a week. I attempted suicide and self harmed again, and got sent to inpatient. When I was in the emergency room, I was tranquilized multiple times and was restrained by 5 or 6 cops, and now my parents are scared for me to come home. And, while I was in the emergency room, I was given some antipsychotics that made me trip balls, and I don't remember what I said. My parents won't tell me what I said, but it really scared them.  But none of it could have been true; I was really tripping on whatever they medicated me with but my parents think it was true. But My parents are about to take me off my antidepressant, and I'm really scared, because even though I'm on an antipsychotic, it doesn't help with my depression or anxiety"
765,"At any small inconvenience my first thought is, ""I should kill myself"" or, ""I wish I was dead""",The title really explains it all.
766,Are these breakdowns? Or something else?,"Hi, I know this isn't the place to get an official diagnosis but I jut wanted to know people's thoughts/ if you've experienced something similar. I just have no idea what this is because in my home country they never talk about mental health.
Sometimes when I'm under very stressful or anxious situations I have these episodes where I'll feel completely numb and need to hurt myself. I'll usually cry for hours and be pretty incoherent- for example have a hard time walking and pulling myself together. At first I thought it was a panic attack. But I don't know about the self-harming part and if that's typical of a panic attack. Usually these episodes happen when I'm alone.
Thanks.."
767,Bipolair but with hate and love,"I wouldnt call it moodswings but i really randomly switch from being a bomb full of love and happiness, to hatefull Harry who hates everything that breaths.

769,Panic Attacks,"Guys just wanted to share my experience here.
There is this one person in my neighborhood who always bullies everyone,i never really gave much importance to him until recently when he bullied someone close to me.
I wanted to stand up to him and confront him the next time he does something.I was waiting to confront him and to finally a get a chance to show him that i am not scared of him.I dreamed of all the things i could say to him when the day comes.
Finally the day came i saw him mustered up all my courage and i froze messed up everything i wanted to say,i had a panic attack although i did speak up to him just not the way i wanted ,i just couldn't.
I don't know if its normal but i feel like i am coward and dont have the courage to do anything ."
770,How do I embrace feeling better?,"My life the last month has been a series of emotional rollercoasters. I'm fine, then I spiral for 3-5 days, then I start to feel better. I clean my home, eat healthy, all the stuff that is conducive to a healthy mind. 

Despite all of that, it's happened so frequently that I'm apprehensive when I start to feel better and in control. I tell myself things like ""enjoy it while it lasts"" and ""just wait, I'm sure something will come along and fuck it up."" 

Am I bringing this on myself by being so apprehensive or am I just doomed to be in this cycle the rest of my life?"
771,"Somebody help pls, just tell what to do to make it stop","
I literally feel nothing. At all. I'm not going through a sad phase, I don't feel sad or depressed. I don't feel happy, I don't feel excited, I don't experience emotions at all. And I'm afraid that it's going to be that way forever. I'm not productive anymore. Everything I do is on autopilot from conversations to my job. It's the only way I go through this. It just scares me. I want to feel real emotions, not tiny bits of it. I want to suffer, I want to love, I want to know what it's like to be broken, torn apart and happy. You know, normal human emotions.
I'm just so desperate about it. I don't know what to do. Pls help"
772,What to do,Last year I did something bad to somebody. It’s been really hurting me since because I feel like shit for it and it’s affecting my wellbeing. Does anybody have any tips to forgive yourself?
773,I keep having dreams that make me wake up anxious.,"I keep dreaming about distressing topics. I just napped and dreamed that my cat jumped off my balcony and died. I also just dreamed that everyone at my college was trying to find me and kill me. I dream my parents physically abusing me. I dream of vicious arguments where people hate me and I’m trying to defend myself. I dream of being lost and unable to find my way out. I dream that my friends leave me or I dream that they hurt me.  

Backstory: Diagnosed with depression, social and general anxiety, and ADHD. See post history for other stuff I’m dealing with. What is going on :("
774,Venting: I’m so lonely and I don’t know what to do about it,"I wonder if anyone here feels like I do. Honestly, I hope you don’t. 

No one I consider to be my friend reaches out to me, and when I reach out all I get are short, meaningless conversations. It feels forced. I don’t get it. They all tell me how kind and beautiful and awesome I am, but they don’t seem to want to build a friendship with me or actually hang out. 

I’ve always been the second choice. I’ve always been the background friend. I’m so tired of seeing them hang out with each other while I haven’t seen any of them in over a year. I love them so much, so it hurts to feel like they don’t care. 

I’m out of school and have very few opportunities to make new friends. I feel trapped. 

No matter how hard I try, everyone who enters my life always forgets about me in the end. I’m so lonely."
775,Blew a job interview this morning due to insomnia/anxiety,"I'm sick of having anxiety and insomnia issues. I'm fucking sick of it so much. I've been dealing with this shit for 5 years now and it seemingly will never end.

I had a interview for a project manager role this morning at a good company and feel like I completely blew it. Why? I went to bed at 10PM and my body woke up at 12:30AM and I couldn't go back to sleep and I felt like shit this whole morning because of it. This exacerbated my anxiety issues even more and it just HAD TO HAPPEN the day of my interview. The worst part is I know I would've done much better if the interview was yesterday because I was on my game during my entire preparation and I'm a great interview when I am able to get a regular night of sleep. This is not the first time this has happened as I've blew a phone interview because of this exact same issue before. I don't know what I'm going to do anymore. I just can't stand that I'm going through this but seemingly no one else is (I know this is not true). I'm a great worker and blowing this opportunity just plain sucks man. In retrospect, I feel like I should have rescheduled the interview. Now I just feel like shit knowing the rejection letter is going to be sent to my inbox at any time now. 

I've tried so many things to resolve these issues (doctors, sleep studies, etc.) to no avail. The supplements I've been taking for a month that have helped all of a sudden didn't work right when I needed them to. 

God dammit it's so fucking frustrating to be dealing with this shit. End of rant."
776,The Only Young,"I recently got admitted to a mental health hospital due to some psychotic episodes that I needed help with. I've been here for three full days, and even though I know that I need help and it's good for me, I really want to go home. 

On one hand I'm here as the youngest person (I'm 19 btw). I look around the different much older patients and I'm just so scared that this will be my youth or my life. It might be a really horrible thing of me to say, but I just don't want this to be my life. 

On the other hand though I don't know what to do if/when I get home. Even though I feel scared and alone in this place it's been helping me take my mind off of things such as my boyfriend of two years breaking up with me a few days ago and all of these thoughts that I'm having. 

I don't know what to do. Obviously I need to stay here for a while but I just feel so alone, scared and trapped. Has anyone else been the youngest in a mental institution and felt like this? how did you deal with it?"

779,Depersonalizing even while gaming,[deleted]
780,"Misdiagnosed with anxiety/depression, I think I have ADHD ?","I've been to GPs and psychs since I was a teen for my symptoms and they tried 2 antidepressants ( sertralin and desyrel), both made me worst as they did ease my anxiety and restlessness but gave me additional symptoms such as increased brain fog,lethargy, suicidal thoughts ( when I've never been suicidal ever before) and oversleeping. I've tried Propanolol for anxiety too ( did nothing for me).

I live on energy drinks because it's the only thing that helps me.

I'm a male, 24. I currently don't take any medication. I did my own research and I think I might have ADHD ? A friend got diagnosed with it and we have similar symptoms.

My symptoms are :

\- Recurrent boredom and a need of constant entertainment. If I do nothing for a day for example, I get depressed and anxious. Lockdown has been a nightmare, I've hit a new low with depressive thoughts.

\- Random bursts of motivation that die out quickly, they will last a few hours and I will get so much done, then it's gone. Then I get frustrated, disappointed at myself and lash out at everything.

\- So many ideas. So many things I want to do but I will start, get bored, give up. Start something else. Repeat. It's a battle against myself to get anything done. Now I have a lot of performance anxiety, because I ""know how it goes"".

\- I feel depressed but because I feel like I'm not living up to my potential because nothing I want to do gets done. I don't hate my life or myself, I hate the fact that no matter how well I organise my days, it's a constant struggle to not have the schedule go completely south. My symptoms got worst over time, I used to be a very active kid but I guess nothing unusual stood out to my parents, then as a teen I became very rebellious ( excessive partying,attention seeking behaviour and troubles with authorities) and as an adult I got my shit together so to speak but as the responsibilities pile on I'm seeing my shortcomings more.

\- Really bad mood swings and getting frustrated quickly.

\- I can't stay still : I've lived in 3 different countries, I'm usually not staying in the same place more than a year. I can't work in an office or I get panic attacks after a couple months so I became a freelancer. But I can't settle down anywhere, I start hating it.

As I've lived with those symptoms, I did develop depression : low mood, etc. But depression came after  them, I feel like my depression is a product of not being able to function without it being a complete struggle.

What do you think ? If you think this might be what I really have, should I just go see a different doctor than my usual ?"

Thank you for reading this."
785,I feel as though i am degrading into a shitty person,"I feel as though i am becoming increasingly angry and snap at people quicker then i used to i feel like i am both a sociopath and a psychopath. I have no desire to hurt innocent people but i feel like i am becoming more and more cruel. For example 

Wishing for criminals to get the death penalty 

I feel as though i am losing empathy

I know it sounds dramatic but I really honestly think I've been through the worst kind of toxic life. I guess if anybody is willing to listen, I'd love to share but mind you there's a lot..."
787,Feeling anxious about informing a therapist/psychiatrist about past self harm habits,"I'm planning on going to either one of them (probably both) and obviously I've been told that I shouldn't hold back on my issues and symptoms, but I'm genuinely not sure if I should or shouldn't talk about my past self harming habits.. My mother talked me into feeling really insecure and anxious about telling them because ""oh they will lock you up in a facility"", ""you'll get yourself into a lot of problems"", ""they'll see you as insane"" and etc. 

I know I shouldn't hold back, everyone who's had this problem still told the therapist about it but I'm still having a lot of anxiety thinking about this, especially because I know its an important piece of information for them to be able to help me."
788,Talking To Myself,"I don’t exactly remember when this started happening but I know I was already doing it a little bit when I was 12. I would imagine myself talking to my crush. They would say something in my mind and I would respond by actually talking. It happens when I’m alone at my room, or when I’m just bored. 
I moved to Japan when i was 13 and it started to happen more often. I didn’t have any friends not even acquaintances. I would imagine myself going back to my country and seeing my old friends again. I would imagine them speaking to me and I would respond back aloud. This time it would happen when I’m just simply walking, bored in class, showering and anytime I don’t really need to pay attention to something which was most of the time. Sometimes I would start imagining them saying they miss me. I would just start crying and talking to them telling them how much I’ve missed them. 
My family and I don’t really have any sort of relationship aside from being related. We don’t talk about how we feel, since I really don’t have anyone to talk to. I would imagine I’m talking to my parents and opening up to them, I start a conversation with them, I would cry and tell them I need someone. It gets intense sometimes that I don’t just tear up. I sob. 
There are also those things like imagine I’m being interviewed, but I think everyone does that. I think that my experiences and depression are the main cause of why I’m talking to myself. I’m fully aware that I’m talking to myself but there are times where I get shocked about what I’m doing and think to myself if I’m mentally ill. 
Based on everything I said do you guys think I have a problem?"
789,I really need help,[deleted]
790,I’m terrified of teen girls,"I’m only 17 and throughout my life I’ve often been made fun of by girls since back when I was a child, they used to insult me all the time and sometimes even kick me or punch me. I never defended myself from them or anyone who attacked me, since my mother is a very strict feminist and always told me she’d kill me if I ever touched a girl, even to defend myself. During the last couple of years I’ve been getting more attracting and fit, so some girls contacted me over social medias asking me to send them nudes and sending me provoking pictures. A year ago, a girl texted me saying she wasn’t feeling good in her life and wanted someone to talk to, so I stupidly accepted, we started talking about depression, I talked about how I went through it and even attempted suicide at some point. She kept asking about me and said she was very lonely, she sent a picture of herself (obviously not herself) and told me to send her a picture of me, which I stupidly sent her. Then she started saying I looked attractive and stuff and said she started touching herself and wanted me to touch myself too. She sent me a couple of videos of her touching herself, so I ended up responding with videos of me, for which she threatened to blackmail me (even though she asked for them repeatedly). I blocked her, deleted any social media account and went completely offline. I was already very hesitant about girls back then, but since that episode I’m completely terrified and can’t even look at girls anymore, since I’m scared they may abuse me or put me in trouble. I often can’t sleep at night thinking I’ll have to go outside the next day and see girls around me. I am completely serious, I’ll either become a monk in some desolate place with no females around me or I’ll take my own life soon or later. It’s a nightmare, I can’t trust anyone and I live in constant terror, I sweat, shiver and feel like I want to curl up and cry desperately when I see them, I cannot take this anymore. Please, do not dm me, regardless your sex."
791,I broke up with him. Now I see how much he screwed me up mentally. Help?,"I (24 F) recently broke up a 5 year relationship with my ex (25M) and I've slowly realized how awful I felt while I was with him. 
I am a pretty rational person, so I ""get over things"" and move on pretty fast. But emotionally, I am a mess. Ever since we broke up, I would suddenly cry a lot, because I couldn't cry before. I couldn't cry, be angry or be anything but happy when I was in front of him because he would say that ""it's something I did, right?"". Whatever I felt, it was always about him.
•i couldn't have a single argument without him saying ""do you wanna break up with me?"", not because he thought I would, but because he wanted to end the discussion. Now, just hearing those words make me cry, I already have depression and anxiety, but hearing that makes me go crazy.
There was also some physical abuse (plus, he would not respect my boundaries) which pushed me to the decision of breaking up.
I can't deal with all of it right now, I feel like a failure. We also have friends in common. What should I do?"

793,I am about to lose my mother,[deleted]
794,ASPD? Autism? ODD? I don't know.,"TLDR: My family always worried about me. I have been labeled by Psychiatrists, therapists, and close people I know as. Argumentative, Too smart for my own good, Asked if I was autistic or have aspergers, having ODD, ASPD add/adhd, and weird. But also super cool and super smart and likable.

So I've always been told I'm smart since I can remember and that I'm likable, and very very argumentative I guess. I always just threw away or procrastinated through my homework in school, while getting 80-100 percent on tests. I've always been told I'm weird. Some girls didn't want to sit on the same chair as me. I pathologically lied basically until 8th grade. Getting suspended for several times for several things. My parents and grandparents and even my nicest of family always said I had issues. My dad never smacked any of my younger siblings like he smacked me. After a lot of stuff I genuinely wanted to know what it felt like to kill somebody, my behavior scared people, I got put in a social exclusion group in high school my last days before I was expelled. I got my GED. I did a bunch of psychedelics and got over the wanting to kill someone part of my life but made a stupid post saying if you banned guns I could still stab up a school. The psychiatrist I talked to said I had Anti Social Personality Disorder (psychopath/sociopath) But I genuinely feel empathy. I also feel she twisted my words, this post is long enough but she purposely nitpicked to prosecute. I was getting out of the mindset she diognosed me with, I guess some showed through? But she couldn't see I already started to turn around on the path I's on and I got sent to a program  for ""teenage boys with behavioral issues), where we practiced prosocial communication and problem solving/anger reduction for 6 months straight. I make a lot of people in my life cry more often than other people do. But I feel bad. I've been told I'm too smart for my own good by several people, I've been asked several times if I was autistic or have Aspergers or ADD/ADHD in a serious sense from different people that didn't know each other. because I have trouble finding something right in front of me or don't know where something is that seems obvious to most people or where to set something, I've never had a job where my bosses didn't call me ""something special.""  My family worried the most about me being an adult, I'm on my own with my gf at 19 now. I've been told I probably have ODD by a therapist (oppositional defiance disorder) Can I just be labeled?  I don't know."
795,Just so tired now......,"I've been looking up life insurances and if ill go to hell for this. Its getting rough and tough. I've tried so much and nothing seems to make things any better. Still on meds and changed but im just tired now. Tired of the war raging within me and losing. No answers or a glimmer of light and everything's falling apart. Sad that i cannot open up to anyone about this. So my reply has/have always been, ""i'm fine"". I just ask that you may pray for me. thank you."
796,What is the best amount of sleep for your mental health?,"I find that if I sleep around 7 hours or less I am irritable in the day time, and sadder than if I sleep around 7 hrs 45 - 8 hours 20 ish as long as i dont sleep too long i.e. 10 hours"
797,Any tips?,"Recently got told that at my grandparents house 2cats died and 1 dog. One cat died from age,was pretty old. One cat was really young maybe half a year,ate something and poisoned herself dog was same as cat young and poisoned himself. Was close to all of them so I'm feeling very sad and can't get over it. Any tips how to get over with it?"
798,An aspiring licensed mental health counselor who wants to hear about your time in therapy,"I am graduating from a program that will set me up for licensure to become an LMHC, and I am extremely excited to practice. What I would like to know from those of you who have been in therapy before is what you loved about it, hated it about, etc. I would also like to know how you felt about your therapist and what the best/worst things they ever said to you were. Thanks!"
799,i freeze up and nearly panic when i see my ex’s.,"about 2 and a half years ago i was in a poly relationship, with a guy and another woman, we were all identifying as gender fluid at the time, however i was the first to come out to them. we’ll call them tod and amanda. 

i mention the gender because of what slowly started happening. 

after i came out and openly started talking about making my wardrobe more manly. maybe 2 weeks after, amanda started saying she was questioning, and then came out, and not even a week after we went to the mall and she blew $500 on clothes that were very, very masculine and wore everything MAYBE one time. after i left, she went back to identifying as female. 

she still lives in my area, tod moved thankfully. they were together a year and some months when i was added to the relationship, and stayed together about another year after i left. i was in the relationship about 5 months or so. 

one day, my fiancé and i were at the mall and they were in a store we were in, i immediately froze, started crying, and couldn’t move until they both paid and left the store, with my fiancé desperately trying to calm me down. 

amanda was controlling, we couldn’t have certain friends, we ALWAYS had to be over at her house if we weren’t busy, and she constantly asked us to do everything for her. tod had it the worst; if she asked him to make her bed, and the blanket wasn’t 100% perfect she’d flip out and storm outside and would be mad for at least the next 2 days. 

i don’t know if she and or the relationship really messed me up THAT bad, but if it didn’t i feel like i wouldn’t have the reactions i do. it’s very annoying and weird to me i get like that. i don’t know what to do about it and i don’t know how to fix it. 

a friend of mine said it sounds like they might have caused PTSD but i don’t like self diagnosing and or drawing conclusions like that. should i bring it up to my therapist and see what she thinks about the situation? 

thank you."
800,Is it possible to have both ADHD and be autistic?,"[P.S. not diagnosed with either although share very common qualities and symptoms as someone autistic] 
Also I'm not self diagnosing, I'm just trying to educate myself more on the topic and also understand in what direction my issues ""could"" be going in, plus I will be seeing a MH specialist soon.

Anyways, the reason I'm asking is because I there are symptoms in both disorders that I actually experience but I highly doubt that I actually could have both (or either one of them) but I think it would be good to know if someone can have both at the same time and how/why it generally happens. Thank you."
801,27 year old male with schizophrenia fears full on relapse,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia back in 2017. I have been well for a while now but over the last week my auditary hallucinations have been very loud and I keep falling into the trap of believing they are real. As well as believing my wife is cheating on me and almost buying a spy camera to  ""catch proof"" I've been working as a security guard and that means time alone at night with my crazy thoughts. Relapse could jeperdise my marriage and changing medications from pellerperidon 100mg to something stronger like olanzapine which I was on previously would be debilitating as I would sleep for 15 hours a day aswell as the extreme anxiety I get interacting with people when I am that tired. I would not be able to work. I have a mortgage to contribute towards. I don't know what to do. Can anyone give advice ? I'm in New Zealand"
802,"Nothing Interests me anymore, life is just dull and boring, how can i get myself out of this state of mind?","ever since covid 19 hit canada i’ve been in this depression like state where nothing interests me, nothing seems fun anymore, nothing makes me genuinely happy. i feel like i’ve run out of things to entertain me and i just feel sad and weak, even walking up the stairs feels like a mission, i feel like someone is grabbing onto my brain and squeezing it as hard as they can and won’t stop. i don’t even have the energy to reply to texts and snapchats. if someone has any tips about getting over this plz lmk, this is really frustrating me as before the pandemic began i was actually getting a whole lot better (i’ve dealt with mental illness and trauma before) and now i feel like i’m all the way back at square one"
803,My bf started inpatient treatment today,"As of this morning, my boyfriend began inpatient treatment for the illnesses he’s struggled with for a while. It was a very sudden decision by him and his family but it was voluntary. I found out last night and luckily got to see him in person this morning to say goodbye. Due to COVID, no visitations are allowed. I’m also unsure what his contact privileges are. Therefore, I probably won’t hear from him at all during his stay. He will be there for at least a week but potentially longer. 
I’m struggling with my own emotions even though I know that this is what he needs. Any advice or reassurance is welcome and appreciated."
804,Imagine trying to open up so you ask for a cuddle and getting told not right now the football’s on,what do you even do at that point
805,Help me please!!," 

(keep in mind that I'm 13 ,please) Recently I found out about this type of animes that's called lolicons, and I found out they were basically stuff for pedos. I started saying how it's wrong, and then someone told me that hating lolis might make me a pedophile, because hating pedos might be my mask of hiding that. And I've been thinking about that for two days, I feel like I'm a monster. I would never EVER touch a child in that way, I have never thought of a child in that way, but I fear that I might be a pedohpile. I started crying thinking that I'm a psychopath or a serial killer.So I searched online ''How to find out whether or not you are a pedophile'' And this thing came up with the title POCD, and read it through. I always thought OCD was basically obssesive cleaning and stuff like that.

Then I watched a video about OCD, and I realised ''Wait, this happened to me before''.

Last month, my mother told me that she liked the way my friend sings (14 is my friend), and somehow my brain told me ''Your mother is a pedophile for liking your friend'', I cried for nights and waited for it to go away, it went away like a week later.

Last YEAR, I thought that humans did not exist and they were just in my mind. For a whole month I suffered and cried everynight, hoping it was not true. It eventually passed when I went to school and kept my mind busy.

Two YEARS AGO, I lost a friend due to OCD. I thought that she was obsessed with me just because she hugged me. I thought she wanted to do stuff to me. SO I ghosted her. My mother always asked me why I don't want to talk to her, and I didn't want to tell her because I didn't want her to think like me.

The thing is, it hurts me, it makes me want to take a knife and just smash it in my head, and I'm afraid to tell anyone because I know that these things aren't true, but my mind tells me they are...I don't want to tell my mom to go to a therapist becuase she'll want me to explain why, what can I do,please?"
806,I did this thing where I tried to change the way I think and I think I’ve fucked up my brain. REALLY NEED ADVICE/GUIDANCE.,"When I was a sophomore in highschool I felt really alone. I really wanted a friend or something but I couldn’t seem to make one. I thought that I wasn’t a good enough person or I didn’t have a good enough personality for anyone to like me.

I began to try and change the way I think and processed things. It was/is really sad but it’s the truth. Anyways I tried for a couple of months to change who I was and I sort of developed this persona type thing where I process things differently than I normally would and I act different than I normally would.

Anyways a year and a half later I still can’t get rid of this “persona.” All I do nowadays is play video games because when I’m “disconnected” I feel like this persona is least noticeable. 

When I “reconnect” I feel like the only thing I can think about is executing my persona to perfection in every situation. It’s really hard to describe but it is fucking miserable and I don’t know how to fix it. It feels like I am the only thing that exists and I just focus on executing my persona. 

I can’t really describe how it feels but it’s horrible and I can’t live like this anymore. 

I seriously need help I’ve been thinking a lot about killing myself lately. I don’t want to die but it feels like I’m the only one in this situation. It feels like there is no answer. I can’t live my life this way. 

Although emotional support is appreciated it won’t help me. It won’t change the pain. I need the pain to go away. I need an answer or to be pointed in the direction of an answer or a fix.
I really desperately need advice. My life depends on it."
807,I think my mother has a mental health illness. How should I treat her?,"For some context, my mother last year underwent radiation and surgery to remove her breast tumor. Ever since then, me and my dad tried our best to support my mother. But, she's often talking about how she wants to stop working, she complains she can't eat anything, she constantly has mood-swings and lashes out at us, she isn't proud of her new body despite the fact that the doctors used implants from other parts of her body to shape her new ""breasts"". She feels deformed even though nobody notices the difference before and after. Just recently, we noticed her memory problems have started occurring more often than a usual amount. 

I have told her countless times that she should seek professional help about what she can and cannot eat but she always reads and references 'those' articles. She doesn't even trust my knowledge as a Pre-Pharm student. I want her to also seek a therapist as well but I don't know how to bring it up to her. It's especially hard cause I don't know if these offices have a translator ready for her to talk about her problems, because I don't think she wants me to accompany as her translator anymore. My dad is all in support of this, but he's scared of mentioning it to her because she already gets offended by my dad's actions. 

An example of a mood-swing, I was talking about the BLM and how I want to join,  but I don't want to expose her to the virus. But the discussion became much more heated and after the argument she threatened to my dad that she wants to go back to Vietnam and doesn't care about what happens to me. So I stopped talking about this matter cause she'd get much more upset. 

She gets upset at me and my dad all the time because we are able to speak Vietnamese in the house, thereby she can clearly express to us. However, my brother--who doesn't speak Viet at all--she treats him like a little angel cause she thinks he's unaware of the problems. 

So with my back against the wall, I don't want to hurt her anymore than I've already have. **So my question is how should one treat someone like my mother? If you were my mother, what do you want to hear?** I live in the United States. 

I'm upset with how she is treating me and my dad, and I want to just leave the house. However, I'm not going to be angry at her for her actions. With 1year and a semester left in school, I just don't want anything to escalate during this time. I get it, me and my dad may not be doing something right and can be wrong on some points, but she blows our mistakes out of proportion. I am confused and don't know what to do."
808,Question regarding mental health while on 2 psychiatric medications,"Hello friends Thank you in advance for any insight into my questions, I will keep the text as brief as possible while explaining. . . 

I’m on 2 medications and have been for a year and a half. Medications are sertraline and bupropion (not to be confused with buspirone)

The sertraline is for ocd, anxiety/depression, bipolar type symptoms 
The bupropion was for quitting smoking and helping to level out drowsiness from sertraline 

I no longer use nicotine in any form 

To my question - I would like to drink coffee once in a while or drink a beer but I’ve been very hesitant to do either. The whole time I’ve been on these medications I have completely abstained from alcohol. Once in a while I have coffee and it makes me feel fantastic and then the next day I feel horrible so I keep drinking coffee until a few days later when I’m extremely irritable and depressed or anxious even with the coffee. So I suppose coffee is out for me? Any ideas why I would react so poorly to such a common thing? What do you suppose my reaction to alcohol would be? 

I’m 30 years old and used to be a regular alcohol drinker.

Thank you - 
Lunchbox"
809,A question about something that happened a while ago.,About a year ago I starved myself for a month because I was absolutely terrified that somehow food would kill me. In between meals I would collect myself and understand it was irrational but every time it came time to eat all of that went out of the window and I was terrified it was either undercooked and I would get food poisoning and die or maybe someone poisoned my food. I wouldn’t eat canned food in fear that maybe something got into it that shouldn’t have. Every time I would cook myself a meal I would really try but eventually I would just end up throwing it away. I ate like 4 or 5 times that month and afterward was 100% convinced I was going to die and made myself puke it up. What could have been wrong with me?
810,Does anyone know any supplements that can help them sleep easily?,Thanks!
811,Nervous and unsure about speaking to a mental health professional. Should I just do it?,"Okay, this might be a long one. I (30/f) have had issues for years. When I was around 12 or 13, I began picking at my skin. Don't know why, but I've done it all these years and now have scars all over my back and face because of it. Guessing it's some sort of compulsion. For years and years, I've felt as though I'm lazy. Always struggled in school. Was almost held back in the third grade. Stole my teachers purse in the fourth (still not sure why the hell I did that). 

I was aimless in college. I took a bunch of courses over the years (procrastinated on assignments but was able to pass exams). Finally dropped out without any sort of degree. I wasted my financial aid taking courses that had nothing to do with my degree. I've been trying to self-study and learn a new skill, but I can't read a book (if it's educational) without getting extremely tired and calling it quits. I have extremely thin skin. I've cried at work for things that looking back shouldn't have made me cry. And finally, I get anxious really easily. There's always something wrong. I always think of the worst case scenario and my stomach is in knots. Even the simplest exchange with a new person is difficult. I mask it well enough that most people have no idea that I'm nervous.

I know I should get help. But I really don't know where to start. I'm uninsured but I can afford to speak to a psychiatrist for now. I'm just afraid of how it will be perceived by my family. Or that the doctor will simply confirm that I really am just a lazy good for nothing who's looking for meds (I've never taken any meds or gotten evaluated)."
812,Persistent suicidal thoughts,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression 3 months ago and struggled a lot with suicidal thoughts since the quarantine. I tried couple of medications, sertraline, trazodone for depression + insomnia and clonazepam. Sertraline made me really depressed and no energy, trazodone gave me bad stomach issues and clonazepam helped with anxiety but my anxiety and depression skyrocketed when I didn't take the medication (even though it was less than a week of taking it so it couldn't have been dependence on it). And then about of week ago I started taking Abilify (aripiprazole) and so far it's been the best out of everything I've tried. It could be that I was just working more than usual but i haven't have had very bad side effects other than occasional wave of dizziness. There would be moments at work where I would start to get an anxiety attack or suddenly lose the motivation but it being a retail nature and a stressful job, it's something to be expected. I haven't actively thought about suicide for the past 5 days I took the medication, but then could be from just being busy and exhausted from working 40 hours vs. 20 that I usually work. So things were ok, I was tired of going to work every day but other than that I would say my mental health has been relatively stable. 

I had my counseling session today and it was good, it wasn't particularly upsetting or anything. But every single time my counselor says ""I care about you and I want you to live a happy and long life,"" I don't want to. I don't care if I die tomorrow, I don't really want to be happy (I don't even know what makes me happy) and I don't really want to live that long. I've been in the slumps for weeks, there were 2 incidences where I would have attempted suicide and I finally feel ""better"" but I still feel that way. Apathy might be the right word. This is the most motivation and energy I've had for 3 months, my best friend stopped by my work yesterday and made me so happy but I just don't care. I don't particularly look forward to the future but I can finally think about it without panicking or starting to cry. I've been feeling more positive about going back to school in the fall and just getting my life together again but that feeling is still there. 

I've been reading about anxiety and depression trying to make sense of it and trying to understand why I feel or act certain ways. But it's a pretty complicated subject and even harder to diagnose. My psychiatrist mentioned that there might be something more than just anxiety and depression but he doesn't know yet. Is this feeling normal with depression or is there something more complicated?"
813,I need help.,"I feel really helpless right now... I know I need therapy and help and I just ran out of my antidepressants but I can't get myself to do it. I can't get myself to do anything. I want so bad to help myself and get better, and I know what I need to do I just feel like I CANT do it. My room is unrecognizable, I binge drink almost every single night. I get stoned a lot. I just want the feeling to go away and to just focus on the stuff that matters like getting up on time, showering, making sure my floor is visible, making 3 meals a day. Because I am not going to be able to start my business or work on my skills and pass my classes or indulge in the art and reading I love to do unless I take care of my basic needs first. But why is it so hard? why is it SO hard for me to get out of bed or just simply even form a thought. Even writing this I feel like I'm not making sense or able to get my whole point across. It's weird because I've been diagnosed with anxiety/depression but I don't really think that's what it is. I know I have anxiety but I think my attention span and my mood swings make me think I'm not depressed. I feel everything. I am not numb but I want to be. Everything is a big deal and I can never stop talking or thinking. I hate being me and it becomes so exhausting that I can't move. But all I want to do is move, and to help myself, and to do the things I want to do but my brain just feels overwhelmed and I constantly want to cry or scream but sometimes I can't find the voice to do it because I am so tired. even though I sleep 12 hours (of restless) sleep every night. I guess I'm just reaching out here to know I'm not alone. My friends all have their own problems and I don't wanna bother them. And my mom just tells me ""yeah everyone overthinks... it's human"""
814,Is pretending to be sad a sign of a mental disorder?,"When in a happy/normal mood, I downplay how I’m feeling and act like I’m unbothered and try not to smile even if someone tells a joke. This just happens in front of family and happens occasionally. I’m pretty sure this isn’t normal but nothing comes up when I search online except pretending to be happy which I don’t do."
815,"I feel selfish for this ""I don't care"" attitude, but I can't care anymore.","I suffer from depression and anxiety, much of which has been manageable until recently when I met this friend, who suffers from extreme anxiety. Part of what made our friendship so strong was that we were able to bond of our anxieties because we had a lot of similar triggers. We looked out for each other, reassured each other, and just checked up on each other. However, it got to a point where the friendship was turning toxic. 

It became really emotionally draining to deal with my own mental health issues, but also to constantly be there for them. Not that I didn't want to be there for them, but it was really hard to not let myself go and dig myself a deeper depression hole with her. I couldn't take care of myself while I was taking care of her so much. 

I've since distanced myself from her for a bit, and recently found out that she's been going through a really difficult time. I feel incredibly guilty for not being there for her but at the same time, I physically and emotionally could not do it anymore because it was so incredibly draining. 

I don't want to feel guilty or feel selfish for having to distance myself, but if I can't lift myself up, how can I lift up another person?"
816,i journal in verse to help with my anxiety and depression but i hide it,"i don’t tell a lot of people in my life, because most of them think of me as happy. figured i could share some of it here. :) new to this though so let me know if i could
do something better here or if i’m just doing it completely wrong, but i hope this helps somebody, thx! 

“warm bodies” 

have you ever lied next to a warm body
but still felt cold 
felt that there was a distance between you
greater than space

i’ve lied next to warm bodies 
that had no meaning 
just a warm body that only brings me to feel more cold

you are not just another warm body
i welcome your warmth 
your scent 
the smell of comfort and a cool rainy day
i can feel your presence even when you are turned around 
i hear your still breaths right before you drift off to a deep sleep

i feel safe
your warm body offers more than just warmth to me
protection
care
comfort 
it’s been so long since i have felt this safe 
the feeling is almost unrecognizable 

your warm body has meaning to it 
as i pull myself closer to you
i melt into you 
our bodies becoming one 
i steady my breath to match yours 
and each rise of your chest bring me deeper into your trance 

i stare at you sometimes 
when you are asleep 
you look so calm 
the same look you always wear 
but your smile is gone 
you are at peace now 
this look is what you give me when you are just listening 
to me
to my problems 
it’s not hard to read your face because i am not scared of what it might say 

your eyelashes are long 
and your lips form a soft part in between them
your eyebrows -no matter how much you talk about them
make me smile 
your face is immaculate 
but nothing compared to what’s going on inside your head 
inside your heart 

sometimes i run my fingers over the lines your face makes
i just want to remember incase you leave too
i push my hand in between your hip and your pelvis 
you move 
i remember that you are here too 
and that you said you wouldn’t leave


my eyes are shut now 
i can feel my body relaxing 
i didn’t know i could do that anymore 
i imagine your smile as it flashes across the back of my eyelids 
and as i drift off i wonder only one thing 
what do you think of the warm body lying next to you.."
817,Suicide,"I don’t need anyone to help me out of it. I have thought already so long over it and now my mother, my everything (I have depended personality disorder) is dying, I want to be there before she is there (kidney dialysis stop) I don’t have friends or real family, I only want to be with her. send some music."
818,How to get on medication,"Dumb question but my mental health has been absolute trash. So many ups and downs Idek what the right emotion for certain situations are anymore. I'd like to get on some sort of medication, but not sure how to do so. Do I just schedule an appointment with any family physician or does it have to be a psychologist/psychiatrist? "
819,My girlfriend is moving away in two months and I... I'm so upset and just feel so hopeless., My GF has texted me telling me she is moving in around two months to  another country. The hopeless feeling I cant handles it. I love this  girl so much and losing her is just my chest even hurts thinking about  it. I've told my girlfriend how I feel and she understands but I'm so  sad inside. I guess im asking for advice but i just wanted to get this  off my chest.
820,Today has been difficult,A couple of weeks or so a go my mum kicked me out and told me to never come back for supporting the black lives matter movement. I’m currently staying at my dads on his sofa in his one bedroom bungalow. Today’s been difficult and I miss my dog and in a way I miss my mum too. I know I’m looking at the past through rose tinted glasses but I can’t help but want to go home to a place that never really existed I guess
821,Is this mania?,"I’m all the time starting new craft projects and hobbies and buying all the appropriate supplies, just to never use it.  It makes me want to go out with friends. I’m the happiest i’ve ever been. I want to drink, even if its alone. I want to party and have fun. I make impulsive decisions. I’ve gotten tattoos and made drastic apperance changes in these states. 

The most worrisome to me is that I lie. I make up these stories and then I tell them to others. These stories portray the acts of sexual adventures, wild alcohol-related stories, things I would never do in real life. And i live these stories for 2-3 days at the time. Detailed enough that no one has ever questioned me. When I say I live it, I mean I spend hours running thru conversations and situations, even doing research, pretending i’m living out those lies in my head usually while pacing in my living room listening to music. I have done this for years, but its only in the last 2 years that I impulsively tell others about my fictious life. It worries me that these lies are becoming riskier. They involve my best friends, grad school, everything I care about. 

I can’t get over this feeling of living a double life. I’ve been pretty good at keeping them seperate. My family and half of my friends, know me as a shy, quite person that never steps out of line and is a straight A grad student. The other half of my friends think i’m a promiscuos alcoholic that sleeps around and parties all the time. It just makes me wonder because my risky behaviors usually have a physical component (i.e. telling someone) but the behavior itself all occurred in my head."
822,It just covers me in the evening... Dark cloud above me for NO reason,"Had a pretty productive day, did a lot of things and when coming home, making myself a dinner, eating it - and that's it. Some cloud came upon my mind. Also my stomach hurts a little, so this increased the anxiety. 

So I feel bad for ABSOLUTELY no reason. Because my stomach hurts? I doubt if it didn't i would be jumping around. I can't wind down. I feel like i am wasting my time."
823,"TW: I have episodes of explosive anger, then crippling remorse","...as well as something else I can't even begin to explain.

This, more often than not, happens with my immediate family, like my mom, dad, and siblings. I've experienced this with a person I considered my best friend of ten years.

To explain further, this usually begins for no reason. Somedays, it happens all day. Other days, just under an hour. I will go off on my family and say things I don't mean. Sometimes, I will initiate an argument and shutdown, only escalating it further. I don't really realize the impact I had on my family at that given moment until the argument has died down enough, or I place myself into a different environment entirely. Then comes the remorse; I mean, I get suicidal, scratch myself, and just all-around mad at how I acted, calling myself ""worthless"" and telling myself ""my family will be better off without me"". Sometimes, I even resort to cutting. These past few times, I would get a belt.. and you know what comes next. I was, and am, miserable when this sort of thing happens because I don't mean it. I can't help it.

A lot of the time, I will get so upset at my friend for hanging out with someone else. I will fall into obsessive thoughts, like, ""Oh, she doesn't like me anymore - I'm getting replaced - I'll just kill myself since no one cares - She's the only person I care about, and now she doesn't even care about me."" It would get so bad, that I would subsequently plan my death, hurt myself, among other things. The last time this happened, I saw her in a picture with her other friend, and I just got so mad, then depressed, it lasted well over a month. I know that people can have more friends, but something in me doesn't understand that, and it's so irritating! I know the way I think isn't right, but I can't help it.

I get these triggering moments that can cause my thoughts to be negative and cause me to draw back from people. I was on a trip, and while in the car, I had a ten-minute episode of me just wanting to kms because my friend was going away for her birthday with another friend.

It can just be at random times where I will get those types of thoughts. I'm not sure what triggers them, but other times, there are obvious triggers.

Another time, I was flipping back and forth from wanting someone in my life in a matter of minutes, and then I said some shit that ultimately removed them from my life completely not realizing what I said and the weight of it until it was too late.

All in all, I don't know what's up with me. I know the way I think isn't normal. I shouldn't feel like taking my life will satisfy me in any way. I shouldn't want to take my life because someone is being a normal human being, with multiple friendships. If I think about them hanging out with someone else outside of the bad days, everything is completely fine, and I don't get upset like that.

Does anyone else experience this? I'm so lost at this point. I don't want to feel like I'm the only one anymore.

EDIT: Thought I should mention that I have no diagnoses, have never stepped into a therapy office, and have never taken any sort of medical tests."
824,Need someone to talk to.,"Okay so this is the first time I'm posting something on reddit so sorry if this isnt the best..

Basically, I need some advice or someone to talk to at least as I am having a bit of a hard time at the moment.

As of recently me and other people around me have become aware of my anxiety and the effects it is having daily. I get so nervous going anywhere and constantly feel like people are looking at me or talking about me and judging me and it stops me from going out often. I am 18 and I feel like I should be getting out and enjoying myself but I think this is so difficult as I'm not comfortable with myself so idk how I can be comfortable around other people.  I get nervous meeting new people and get worried I will lose those I have as I feel I'm not good enough which starts a whole other issue with trust. 
I have a boyfriend who I have been with for a year who is amazing but I feel like he doesnt fully understand how I feel sometimes and I get extremely nervous that he will cheat or leave me eventhough he has NEVER given me a reason to feel that way, I realised this is probably  due to my  anxiety and the way I feel about myself. It's also so bad that I csnt even go to a shop or  a restaurant without getting stressed and anxious which is why I usually have someone else do it for me .

It's gotten to a point where I feel really down and really useless and havent got anyone to talk to who would really understand so I could really do with some help.


Sorry this is long  and sorry I've gone on a  bit I'm sure lots of you understand it's hard to try to get your feelings down this way but I have tried my best :)"
825,Should i do college or is there something better for me?,I'm in high school right now and I don't have anything planned out for my college and work life. My mental health is pretty bad and I have difficultly creating and maintaining healthy relationships with people. I'm terrible at being a student and the teachers always end up hating me. I'm not good at doing what I'm told and finishing stuff on time. So I thought I wouldn't do college to avoid all this. But I don't know what else I can do. I thought about getting an online degree but Im better at learning through personal interactions so that's also a bad idea. What now?
826,I have been starving myself,"I don't know how to break out of a very intense low. I just feel like killing myself fir the past three days, I have been starving myself. I feel like a complete failure, my parents have been putting so much pressure on me, I have no passion or will to live. 
As much as I want to write a very long post explaining how I came to feel this way, words don't come out. I don't know how to seek help around me. i don't know how to reach out"
827,Should I tell my councillor about my constant harmful thoughts?,I’ve recently started counselling with a school councillor if you look on my past posts things haven’t been to great and I have been suicidal for while now a lot I think due to constant thoughts of hurting myself I’m not sure about telling her because I don’t want to be sectioned I’m not sure what to do atm
828,Why did I feel so different when I lived on my own?,"Hi,

I am a guy in my early 20s. I have always been a shy, withdrawn and insecure person...until I started to live on my own about a year ago for 6 months. I became upbeat, happy and funny. I had no problem talking to new people and I was a social butterfly. At the same time I also spiraled out of control sometimes and may have acted in quite cringeworthy ways, looking at it in retrospect. 

At the moment I live at my parents home again and I am not this funny guy anymore (also due to a mental breakdown). I don't understand how I can be such a different person when living on my own compared to when I'm not. Any ideas?"
829,Toxic relationships with family members -- help? advice?," I’ve been dealing with double standards basically forever between my sister and I. My sister is 3 years older than me, but she makes it seem like she’s 20 years wiser and so smart. That she's always right and I don’t know any better. She’s always telling me what I'm doing wrong, repeating it again and again as if I didn’t know. But the thing is, she does those things too.

Like for some reason it really bothers her that I have free time now since I’m still a student and its summer. She has work. It makes her so jealous she constantly has to say something. She’s always complaining to my mom that I’m sleeping too much, or spending too much time playing video games, or on my phone too much. Sure, I’ve been sleeping more, and spending more time playing games, or on social media or whatnot. But I’ve also been doing other stuff, and she’s well aware of it. 

I’m a CS major and I’m working on my website, and I'm really proud of it so far! I’ve always been applying to lots of summer programs and working on updating my linkedin, cover letter, resume, all that jazz. I’ve read a ton too, and reading even according to her isn’t wasting time but apparently it is when I read. I’ve been catching up with friends I haven’t talked to in forever. I’ve been doing MLH hackathons and working on developing a plan for an app or website I want to build to help address COVID. I’ve baked and cooked some stuff, and helped my mom bake and cook some stuff. And just last week I started my summer classes and I literally have an essay due tomorrow but instead of writing it I’m too busy trying not to cry. So yeah I have more free time, but I’m actually not wasting that much of it. But of course she only sees what she wants to see. She only sees that she’s more busy (apparently) than me. I try to argue with her, tell her all the stuff I’m doing, but she doesnt wanna hear it. My mom yells at me to stop arguing. Oh yeah thats another thing in this house, not even calm debate is allowed for me, because I shouldn’t be arguing in the first place. Of course, the others can, no biggie. The funny thing is my mom always takes my sisters side, and lets her go on and on about everything “wrong” with me. But if I even once say my side of the story, even begin in, then Im the equivalent of an ungrateful b\*\*\*. 

Interestingly enough, my sister often spends “work”  hours on her phone. Slacking off when she should be on slack or something. Sometimes she takes naps for hours too. 

Yesterday morning, I went to help my best friend’s family move. I was there from 8-about 11am. I hadn’t slept well the night before, and I was tired when I came back, so I fell asleep after 12 and woke up around 2 for lunch. According to my sister, though, I was asleep for “half the remaining day.” What?? Even?? And she made a big deal out of it, and when I clearly demonstrated how wrong she was, she wouldn't take it. And I got in trouble for “arguing.”

My sister always tells me to go help my mom with house and kitchen stuff (when I would anyway). But if I tell her to, or ask why she’s not doing a chore she was supposed to do, I should stop being “jealous” and “mind my own business” (agreed by both my mom and my sister).  

Also, my mom and sister keep telling me that I don’t know how to live with people, or keep a good relationship with them, or be grateful. That I can’t even talk properly and respectfully with my family. Excuse me, but everytime I try, all that \^\^ happens. They say that when I’m a mother, my kids wouldn’t talk to me for support or help or any conversation, they’d go to the dad. Which is a low blow. Honestly, i dont even want to be a mom or have a family, and they know that but yeah whatever insult floats your boat, fam. It still stings and they know it. Hell, I hope I don’t have kids. I can’t even stand up for and care for myself, how will I do it for kids? 

Also, my family stops at nothing to put me down. When I was a kid, they'd call me stuff like ""brainless"" (an insult courtesy of my sister). When I was even younger, they would tell me my sister would be a CEO and I'd be her maid. They expect me to know things and when I don't they yell. They say I'm ungrateful. They say I don't know how to take initiative, or talk to people, or that I'm too insecure (negative feedback loop much ha). All the damn time. 

Gosh, I don’t even know what I’m writing anymore. It’s been like this always to an extent, but it’s been getting worse. And yeah my dad always agrees with my mom and sis.

Maybe I am in the wrong. didn’t know it could hurt so much."
830,Update,"Uhm, hello again. I wanted to give a little update. I'm disappointed and feel like I was used again. You know, my bf ""commited suicide"" a week before. I just found his Twitter. He's still liking other posts. I don't know how to feel about that. He's not responding me. I had a panic attack not a long ago. I still don't know why am I writing this here in the first place. But I feel better after it. Thanks for your time. I'll be in my bed crying if somebody needs me🙂"

832,Bipolar depression,"Hi everyone, just curious what bipolar depression symptoms look like? My boyfriend has an outside perspective and notices a lot of irritability &amp; high’s and lows with me &amp; I just need to know if it’s worth looking into. Thanks in advance."
833,How full is your plate?,"When I got home today I sat on my porch and cried. It wasn’t really a sad cry. More like tears if frustration. I can’t even pinpoint why. There’s so many reasons. Not just for me but the whole world deserves a good crying session. Sometimes I think of my emotional capacity as a dinner plate. And I visualize all my baggage I carry around with me as food. There’s been very few (if any) times where I feel I have had room for more food on my plate. And for the longest time now I’ve felt like my plate is overflowing, and the food at the bottom is just rotting while I keep adding more to my plate. I have good moments in life. Where I kinda forget about the overflowing, rotting plate. I cherish those moments more than my friends and family might realize. Anyways, I shared a little bit with all of you. Now it’s your turn. How’s your dinner plate looking? 

Also, I feel like this could be a really good arts and crafts thing to do with kids. Like get a paper plate and have them fill it up with what their worries are as if it were food. It might be really insightful to where your kid is at mentally and emotionally. What do I know though, I don’t even have kids!"

835,My mother thinks she understands mental health but really doesn't (vent),"when we went to the doctors for my anxiety a few months ago she said to the doctor that she knew a lot about mental health and that she had 'worked with it in the past', this sort of struck me as strange as the only experience i could recall was when she worked in an old peoples home with dementia patients. i didn't mention that comment but believed her anyway or thought she maybe phrased it wrong. But then we were having dinner a few weeks later and she said that anxiety wasn't a mental illness and its 'just a thing' (?). shes the kind to say things like 'oh i have ocd because i need that to be symmetrical' but when i explain what ocd actually is she rolls her eyes at me. In a conversation recently i brought up the comment she made at the doctors and she said that since she worked as a bar tender she had talked to alcoholics so she understands depression, but anytime i mention my anxiety she tells me to stop fishing for pity. I've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts recently and ever since quarantine I've been having episodes of what i think is dpdr. i dont know how to explain anything to her because i'm scared she either wont take me seriously or will think i'm faking it for attention."
836,Males With Body Dysmorphia waawaahhhh,"Hi this is my first reddit post. I (M17) have been struggling with body dysmorphia the past 2 years. I don't know many people who have it but I also tend to invalidate myself being a guy having it. I'm mostly posting this cuz was I wanna know others' experiences. When I see myself and see like, a human dump truck and think like, how can people be friends with me when I look this fucking ugly. My face is too asymmetric, I don't look like anyone (like actors or models), ect. I think it's so weird too cuz I see people of all body types and think they're all so fucking pretty and I see myself and think, stop exist. I know it's something a lot of people have but I feel so alone when I talk about it with family and friends. I guess this as some sort of reach out for a conversation with fellow body dysmorphic folk gfjgkjfkgk"
837,I'm trying to use Xbox to spread mental health awareness,"I play my xbox on a daily basis and have played with a large variety of players. I have now decided to try and help people talk about their mental health. Every player (including you) that you play alongside or against is going through their own inner battle. I emailed the xbox executives  to try get them to send an automated mental health check to every player through xbox.

I hope each and every one of you have a great day. Here is the tweet that I sent. Hopefully the executives will see it and save lives.

838,Do I sound like I’m in the right headspace for a relationship right now?,"So I have (briefly) dated before, but nothing serious. I generally avoided it because I have always been scared I would emulate the toxic behavior I was raised with, and would hate myself if I acted that way towards anyone else. 

At this point I feel pretty confident knowing that my behavior is my own and know that that just isn’t me that I could do better. This has only come after months of working on myself and trying to figure out who I am first.

Recently though I feel like I want to date solely to prove this though, or just generally to prove to myself that I can be better for a sense of finality I guess. Is this a bad mentality to have while dating? If so any advice on how I can shift it?"
839,There’s definitely something wrong with me I just don’t know what it is,"One minute I’m completely fine or happy then the next minute after one small inconvenience which could literally be the most stupidest irrelevant thing ever I’m thinking of giving up and just giving myself a new massive slit down my leg or something. I’m either feeling sadness and anger and a bunch of different emotions all at once or just nothing and feeling absolutely lost and empty. 

I don’t want to be this way."
840,Feel like crap,"I know I have some sort of mental illness but I can’t go to get diagnosed or receive therapy. I have gotten bullied because of my looks and because I am physically weak. Now I feel extremely anxious whenever I’m around someone. I have no friends. I wish there was a support group or something for people who are too good for the world, but who get treated badly."
841,what is the right way to respond to someone struggling with their mental health?,"a little background info: 
i’m a teen who struggled a lot with mental health. anxiety, self harm, that sorta thing. it started when i was around 13, and has recently started getting better now that i am 17. because of my struggle with my mental health, my relationship with my parents has always been complicated. they never really understood what i was going through, and because of this failed to respond correctly. they mostly forced me to do things that didn’t make me feel any better, or just tiptoed around me at all times. we never spoke about it directly, or really mentioned feelings at all during these times. more recently they mentioned that they knew i was having a rough time (it was noticeable) but didn’t know what to do. 

i’ve thought about what i’ve wanted them to do instead, but i’m not really sure myself. 

so, parents, siblings, or individuals who have struggled with mental health/have known someone who has struggled with mental health,, what do you think is the right way to respond? what “should” someone do in a situation where you know someone is struggling mentally? 

thanks for taking the time to read this :)"
842,Suddenly remembering every single cringey thing I’ve done,"This is a problem I’ve been having for a few weeks now. I just suddenly remember what a cringey and stupid person I used to be, and it’s getting so bad and I just want it to stop. But no matter how much I try to distract myself or remind myself I’m not like that anymore, it just won’t stop and it’s starting to drive me crazy."
843,Coping mechanisms? Mine self sabotage,"I ignore how I’m feeling, push my emotions down to where I forget them, and distract myself with reddit and tik tok to not feel my emotions in the moment lol. I’ve been abusing my prescription and idk how to stop and I think that’s the reason my mental health is going bad. My I’m taking them so off prescribed that it’s fucking w my brain chemicals. I know I know I need to get help I’m going to, but I’m the meantime I want to practice better coping.. any suggestions? I am only diagnosed with ADHD, but mainly struggle with undiagnosed but pretty sure it’s fucking there:
Depressed/or bipolar/or BPD? Anxiety. Mainly just need ways to cope when I’m feeling very down and ways to cope when I’m feeling anxious. 
Thank u !"
844,Is there a reason the only emotions I feel are anger and hate?,"As the title says I constantly feel pent up with anger. After moving in with my partner who herself deals with her own MH issues, she has commented sometimes that I show no emotion and can be quite snappy and I have come to realise this myself. I had a great childhood but never spoke to my parents about feelings or even raised concerns about my health at all and I have carried this over and now find it really difficult to speak to the love of my life about my issues. Each day I find myself filled with more anger and rage and I’m slowly letting it eat away at my relationship. I let it build to the point where I let it all out at her over something as little as leaving the milk out. I feel like my anger and rage and hate comes from a hate of who I am and how I have repeatedly failed myself. From failing to lose weight to being stuck in a hostile workplace to impulsively spending a full wage in a week. I do not want to continue down this path as I fear I may eventually build to the point where I injure my partner, myself or someone else. I suffer from symptoms of anxiety and depression and I can’t bring myself to get to a medical professional for help and have no way to let my anger out in a safe manner. Thank you for reading my life story it just feels goos to be able to get this off of my chest."
845,sorry this is just a rant,"late last year i went through this whole thing with my mom about how i’ve been feeling &amp; after begging her to take how i feel seriously, she finally took me to our family doctor. he half-assed diagnosed me with depression after asking like 10 questions and prescribed me prozac. 
my mom then refused to believe that my problem was with my mental health so she took me to a nutritionist because she strongly believed i was feeling depressed because i don’t eat enough vegetables?? so then i started eating heather &amp; she put me on some vitamins.. it’s been so many months and nothing has drastically changed. i felt a bit happier for like a month but now i’m back to feeling shitty. 
i’m exhausted and whenever i mention something about how i’m feeling, my mom blames it on something dumb.
for example, at dinner tonight i mentioned how my memory has been just getting progressively worse and my mom says “it’s because you don’t go outside”...
i’m just exhausted. she never once considered that i could actually be suffering with my mental health. sorry for this rant, i know there’s so many people on this sub suffering much worse, i really just needed a place to vent."
846,Always tired... depression?,"I’m 18 years old and female. I live in NJ. We have been quarantined for about three months. It wasn’t so bad the first month. I still went to work and was finishing up my senior year. I just graduated. Things are starting to open up, but not much. I liked to go on jogs, garden, spend time with my family, and go to the beach in the summertime, however, I’ve completely lost all of my energy and motivation to do anything. I’m at a healthy weight, even though I gained ten pounds from overeating, which makes me feel a bit insecure. My acne has gotten worse, probably because I have to wear a mask in the heat wherever I go. I should feel excited to start college this fall. Not anymore. I like to draw, practice music on my piano, and shop online too, but I find myself just laying in bed all day on my phone with all this free time. I find myself crying more often too, sometimes without a reason. It’s like I lost my rhythm- my entire routine. I don’t believe I have depression, but it’s starting to feel that way. What should I do?"

I need a good cry so bad i can feel it in my chest but I physically CANT. I feel sad everywhere else but my face just sits there I need to cry but I can’t even get a single tear. I’ve tried many things.  I need to let it all out but my brain won’t let me!!! How do I work thru this!!

im not the type of person to hold a grudge so this isn't like me at all.   shit is putting hate in my heart.

but otherwise im a little excited.  the hospital is one i haven't been in since i was 16 so 21 years ago but its still hands down my favorite compared to the other 2 ive been in.

Psych ward is always a good time with good people and pretty much the only social setting i feel like i totally fit in and thrive in, lol.

After the last few months ive had i feel like ive booked a 3-7 day luxury cruise, lol.  

gotta go pack!   2020 has been rough!!!"
850,Is Blurry Vision Normal After A Cold Towel Compress On The Eyes,"Currently treating a suspected case of conjunctivitis, was using hot compress, but thought I’d try cold instead and after my hand towel on my eye for 5 minutes or so my vision was really blurry for few minutes like foggy?

Is this normal?

Reason Im posting this in mental health is because my recent eye issues have really been affecting my mental health, I suffer from chronic anxiety as well."
851,I regularly go down a depressive spiral.,"It could be due to a mistake I made at work, which usually leads me to believe in just going to be fired (even though I’ve never had any warnings or genuine concern that I would be).

Maybe my GF asked me to plug in her Fitbit, and I forgot to do it and then later said she wasn’t mad but “disappointed” because she really likes her Fitbit. (We have a cat separation going on and if they contact each other they fight, we both work from home so it’s a lot easier to hand it to me to plug it in rather than opening the door all the way. The cat situation is a work in progress).

Often times things like these lead me to believing I’m a useless good-for-nothing. These usually cascade into thinking suicide would be easy enough, I couldn’t disappoint anyone anymore once I die (after they get over the disappointment that I committed suicide, of course).

I know I also have ADD tendencies, get distracted constantly in the middle of someone talking, usually end up not even listening to half of what they said (which also causes me to “forget” a lot of conversations, though mentally I wasn’t there to begin with). Or maybe I’ll be asked to do something and then get so focused on a specific task that I forget the things I agreed to do.

Like I could say “yeah I’ll take the trash out after work” (I work from home). But since my home computer and work computer are next to each other, if I don’t recall that information in the span of a couple minute after getting off I get lost in something and might completely forget about something I already committed to. This obviously leads to relationship problems which, on the lightest side I feel like we might break up just because I’m a constant disappointment, and she’s be better off. (My GF is also an absolute 10/10 i all departments, as well being super attentive and kind).

853,How do I enforce my rational will?,"Over  the years I have figured out that I just can’t bring myself to do anything that is productive and this has affected major parts of my life. I have an almost chronic procrastinating tendency - I don’t start working on something until the very last moment. There are days where I sleep through the entire day, avoiding work, with high anxiety levels. I’m 27 and I haven’t had a good career yet. I find it incredibly hard to put effort into things over a long term. How do I force myself to deliberately do things? I’m rarely at peace, there’s always restlessness and anxiety tingling right up my arms. . I would like to come out of this state - parts of which have existed since my childhood."
854,I’m at lost,"Ive fought for my life for years

Several suicidal attempts 
Coping with alcohol and drugs

Finally reaching out for mental health, and my physical help. I’ve been constantly going to therapy and taking medications. Sent my sexual abuser to prison. 

Why do I still want to end my life. 
I feel pain. Everyone’s. Black lives, POC I feel their pain. When will there be a change?? Will there be?
I’m afraid for my future children. I’m afraid. I’m afraid for my life. I want it to end. I want to end."
855,Memory loss/ forget details in bad/traumatic scenarios,"I only recently noticed that I seem to forget a lot of details of certain significant events in my life, only events that are bad or negative, for example my dad used to be very aggressive and abusive and threatening to me my mam and sister only up until 2 years ago it all stopped as we got a restraining order, my mam recalled an event where my dad sat on the stairs of our house with a knife singing as we all hid in my little sisters room, I completely forgot that this had happened until I was reminded of it, once I was reminded I remembered every single detail of the night, Another example is when I was sexually assaulted, It was really bad and caused a lot of issues for me mentally for years, although It causes many sleepless nights and so much overthinking about the situation I somehow seemed to have forgotten the details of the event until I read it in a text this evening and it came back to me very vividly. 

Does anyone else get this? Why does this happen? I feel like I’m just suppressing these bad incidents so I can move on with my life and when they come to light I remember so clearly"
856,How do I move on?,"My ex broke up with me a little over a year ago. I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but they didn't treat me very well so it's for the best in the end. They continued to treat me poorly afterwards when just trying to be friends so at this point I've cut them out of my life.

The problem is I still think about them every day. I don't know why. I don't want them back. I know I can't trust them anymore. It just hurts. Its entirely negative thoughts, not being sad about the good times we had or missing them or anything like that. I feel like garbage and I want it to stop."
857,I don’t feel like I have any worth,"Okay so here’s the thing, when it comes to me and my siblings I don’t feel like I have any worth at all, today my little brother dropped a gate on my hands after I explicitly told him to watch it, after I got angry at him and soft yelled at him he gets cynical and doesn’t care at all saying “I didn’t know it was that heavy *I’m so sorry.* without any remorse in his voice and only being rude. My mother asked us what was going on and I explain what was going on she doesn’t care in the slightest and while we’re trying to get a couch upstairs and she tells me to swap spots with him I try to turn to the side to pass by him, does he reciprocate and turn to the side as well so we only graze each other I hear you ask, No instead he locks his body and proceeds to shoulder me with no intention of ever turning. I get mad at him again and my mother takes his side of course all the while she is looking at me with an angry face he had this smug look because he knows he’ll get away with it and I’m the one suffering, he’s also given priority in conversations because when I accidentally interrupt him my parents and he get mad at myself, when he does the same and completely interrupts me no one does anything. When I bring this up to either of my parents they try to get him to stop and be remotely nicer but through their and my efforts nothing happens ever. He stays the exact same. I get that I’m the oldest and I’m supposed to be tougher and a role model but I don’t feel like I have any value when he can do whatever and even though my parents try to fix it he stays the exact same with no repercussions. Right now I’m sitting on a fence (literally and figuratively) about what to do. Any advice is welcome because I’m at my wits end and the only thing I can think of is the nuclear option."
858,Confused????,"So hello. I am a 21 yo female. I am very confused about my diagnosis and can't seem to figure anything out. I've become extremely frustrated with mental health and I just have to vent a little bit. So:

1.All my life I've been extremely shy and anxious. My mother describes my first depressive episode at 2-3 years old when my parents divorced . My dad used to be a cruel and abusive man, more to my mother than me.  I have reoccuring nightmares of him beating my mother to this day. But I loved him a lot when I was little and him leaving was very painful. Now he's better btw. But he used to push me, buy me smaller shoes cause they were cheaper, let me starve, let me dress myself at 3-4 yo and make fun of me. He always made me feel like I don't deserve help or food and I still carry that low self image and self pity to this day. 

2. I have a very weird relationship with things in general. I just can't put my finger on it and it drives me nuts. I always take things way too seriously and can't ever find a middle ground. I always take things to the extreme. Always. And I just can't have a normal relationship with people to this day. A romantic relationship is not even in the graphs. Sadly for me, the character from The Office I mainly identify with is Michael Scott. I have mild anger issues, I am extremely attention needy, I always take my relationships with people way too seriously, I am obssesed with being the best at everything and having people know it and pretty much just Michael Scott without the insensitive remarks to people.

3. I can't feel(?) time(?) I can't. I have a very weird relationship with time. It's very hard for me to focus on actual existing and I just let time pass by me while not taking anything in.  During this pandemic and summer vacantions I tend to isolate myself in my room and basically just do nothing. Just letting time pass. I lost months on end doing nothing and daydreaming. And even if I were to do something like scroll Facebook, I would be way too deep in my head to actually be aware of what's happening. 

4. I am caught between being overly sensitive or insensitive. If somebody is in distress, I just can't feel for them usually. I am a horrible friend and I feel like shit for it. But at the same time, when I do relate to something, it is extreme and I just can't let go.

5. Went to a psychiatrist at a mental health hospital last year.  The only reason she took me seriously back then was because I was frozen and couldn't move properly, which happens sometimes when my anxiety flares up.  She didn't give me an actual diagnosis in person. In my country, idk about others, we have some codes for diagnosis and I had to search up the codes on my prescriptions to find the diagnosis. Basically depression, anxiety and personality disorder(only had the last one like 2-3 times).  I tried to open up to her about a few things and she ended up dismissing all of them because indeed they were not so severe, but it made me feel horrible. Those things are: some form of sexual abuse (when I was a child, a neighbour's child pressured me into taking my pants off and having him perform some kind of oral sex on me, which his mother saw and I had the blame put on me), self harm (I was scared to cut deeply on my arms, so I don't have very obvious scars, but I do have a few worse one on my legs) and also my relationship with food (I used to starva myself for days on end). I know these are not very serious compared to others, but for me it is very important and the way she dismissed these things was just a hit to take. The medication she gave me was a real help tho.

6. Went to another psychiatrist. Couldn't continue going to her cause she was a private business and very expensive. After consultation, she diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and maybe a personality disorder. I was considering having one, but hearing her say that felt so validating, finally felt like I wasn't just fucked up in the head cause I'm just shitty like that, but there was an actual thing wrong that could be fixed. 

7. Been to 3 therapists.  The first one was too scary, loved the second one but our schedules couldn't compromise and the third one was a just-think-positively kind of approach, which is just... what. In the end, couldn't bond properly with any of them.

8. I also lied to the therapists and psychiatrists. I don't kbow why. I always lie without intending to.

9. I have always been pretty gifted when it comes to intelligence, which ofc I take HUGE pride in. Because of this, going through school was a breeze for me. Always would spend my time just daydreaming under incredible stress instead of studying and just studying in the last moment when my anxiety would reach levels high enough to make me stop daydreaming. But since I started medication, I lost that last-moment-study-impulse anxiety and I am just left with the daydreaming and doing nothing. Which is extremely stressful. I can't believe it, but I miss that kind of anxiety. 

10. Related to working. Working and just doing stuff stresses me out so much. Now that the anxiety driven motivation is gone, I am left with only regular anxiety which makes me freeze when given one (1) task. I am not lazy, I am just straight up terrified of doing something and it not being perfect or goof enough. Hell, I had to write a documentation for a project and all I could think of is how the professor would think I am so stupid and hate every word I wrote as I was writing them.

11. Regarding depression. I am experiencing it as more of a numbness and a complete disasociation from everything rather than sadness.

12. My very few friends always make fun of me and my intense mood swings -it is friendly and I laugh too because I realize how intense I am-. I can go from hot to cold to green to cold to crying in a a very short time and due to stupid reasons. 

So this is all I can think of right now. I apologise for the long post and badly organised ideas. And for grammatical errors too, English is not my first language.

 The reason I wrote this is basically because every time I went to a new therapist/psychiatrist, I just couldn't talk about all these things I am confused about to get some answers. I just want it all somewhere out there. And even better if people can give me opinions because I love hearing other people's opinions. I just wanted to vent and hear anything anybody would have to say regarding my situation. Have a nice one c:"
859,Depression has stolen my life... and I’m afraid it will never get better,"I have struggled with depression for the majority of my life. Most people feel a full range of emotions... I don’t feel like I do. I RARELY experience joy or happiness, but I regularly feel sad and hopeless. Lately things have been really, really difficult. I moved across the country with my partner, with no job, no friends, and no mental health support. I thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. I was so wrong. My partner broke up with me, saying that my constant talk about depression and thoughts of suicide are exhausting to deal with (trust me, I know). I don’t want to hurt those around me, but I do not want to continue living. I don’t know what I’m looking for from this post, but don’t know what else to do. I feel so alone. 

I’m also 10 weeks pregnant, which is scaring the hell out of me. How can I be there for a child when I can’t even be there for myself? What if I put all of these thoughts and emotions on them, and create another human being who feels like I do? I would never wish this on anyone, let alone my own child.  Has anyone dealt with depression as a parent or had a parent who struggled with depression?"
860,Bipolar V BPD,"I’m going to see a dr abt my mental health and I feel as if I’m going to get diagnosed w one of these. I show a lot of symptoms of both of these and I just want to know how other people live with them. If you have one or both of these I’m curious as to how it affects you daily, emotionally, socially, relationship wise, school/work, and how it has affected ur life in general."
861,Would this be classed as paranoia?,"So... do you ever feel like you have special powers or abilities? For example you can influence someone’s thoughts and feelings or will something to happen like changing the traffic lights from red to green. 

But the reason you don’t have access to your full powers, is because you have been placed in this World/realm and had your full powers stripped. But you’re just slightly tapping into them that’s why you can do the things you can do. Or is this just me?"
862,I can't tell if I'm depressed or if it's all in my head.,"I've struggled with this for about 5 years now. It started at around 12. 

For example, I feel sad and unmotivated. Then this starts off a cycle of self destruction. I begin hating myself more, being more irritable, stop eating, occasionally cut, isolate myself., my sleeping schedule gets bad, my motivation is gone, My concentration has gotten really bad, and I basically just do everything in my power to feel worse. I have no idea why I do it. I know its bad. But it's like I can't help it.  It lasts for weeks. In fact it feels like I always feel like this and happiness comes intermittently. I used to consider suicide and cut A LOT even made myself vomit a few times but not so much anymore. It's like i don't even have the energy to consider that. I also went through a period of alcoholism last year.  I  would just constantly drink at school and play it off like it was 'just for fun'

I feel like I'm subconsciously trying to punish myself for being me, in some messed up way. I'll plan to sleep early, have breakfast, make lunch, and do all my school work. But then it gets to when I was planning on sleeping and I'll decide that I don't need to sleep its fine, I'll just stay up until 3am and do my own thing. I'll decide its too much effort to make lunch and eat, I'll survive. And i always regret these decisions. I've been so sleep deprived lately. To a point that i fall asleep while sitting up, and multiple people ask me if i'm okay every day.

I have a very cheerful demeanour and am an extremely smiley person, like i smile no matter what. So I don't understand. Sometimes I'll sit there and say to myself, man i feel like shit, I must be going through another depressive episode, but i'm undiagnosed, and im scared if i talk to someone about it they'll tell me there's nothing wrong with me and then I'll be left to wonder why I do all this shit. Am i just convincing myself that I'm not okay? Is it just all in my head? I don't know how to explain it. I'm just scared that I'm a phony, and that would just make me a bad person.

Maybe I'm being dramatic and making it worse to make myself feel more shitty."

864,Define mania,What would a person with mania feel or do? I have not looked into it much and am curious.
865,Could My Sister Be Bipolar?,"I know I can’t really ask for a diagnosis, but I’m curious. Growing up, my sister has always struggled containing herself emotions. She’s 27 now, though, but she still can’t handle her emotions. Usually she gets really mad, and just starts screaming at you for the littlest things. She doesn’t even apologize afterwards

She acts entitled, like she should get whatever she wants. She also says nobody cares about her. Which isn’t true at all. And she said that right in my face! It hurt :( She’s probe to getting into fights. She’ll literally walk up to somebody, and act like she’s about to fight them. She has been in court many times due to her behavior. When she was a teen, she used to defy our parents a lot, and she was a disobedient kid. My mom says that she feels like something’s been wrong with her since she was around 6. 

She also hates being embarrassed in public, and she’s very self-conscious. She also cuts everyone off, and talks crap on everybody. Now, the thing is I have Asperger’s, and I know for a fact Bipolar and ASD share the same genes. Which probably means she could have it. Is there a chance she’s Bipolar? She’s never been diagnosed, but she refuses to get help. Our home environment growing up wasn’t the best, but she’s been like this since she was very young."
866,how do i deal with negative emotions in the moment when a bad situation arises?,i tried to keep the question short^^
867,do these behaviours sound like ocd?,"I am an autistic male in my 20s, and I have some behaviours that I dont think are due to ASD,

I for instance have set times that I need to wake up, be at work, get to my car during breaks, be home,  smoke, and go to sleep, or it will be a panic due to me being afraid of being late, or wasting time that I could be using to recharge and be ready for work the next day. While I am away from home I constantly am worried about things like ""did I leave the front door open"", ""did I leave my keys in the ignition"", ""did I leave my bong out"", ""what if my parents come by while I am gone and find something embarrassing"".  is this just me being an autist, or something else?"
868,I can't grasp the gravity of consequences.,"I don't want this to be a huge post, so I will be brief. First issue is that I can't grasp consequences. So if I do something wrong, feeling bad about it is not there enough. The weight of that bad feeling doesn't drive me to act differently in the future. Does that make sense? 

Example: Let's say that I miss a meeting at work. I get in trouble. Then the next day, I miss the meeting again as if I didn't learn my lesson.

I also have issues with work. I am very prone to procrastination. I show a large lack of ambition or care in certain things. 

I don't think I am lazy, I like to zone out while cleaning the house. The feeling of cleanliness is pleasing and reduces stress. 

I punish myself a lot, especially when I make a mistake. I think that I am stupid or something else is wrong. 

Do I have a mental disorder or something??"
869,Mom let us be abused then had an affair,"I grew up in a religious household with four brothers. I am the middle child and closest with my younger brother. We were both horribly abused by my older brother in the worst imaginable way at a very young age. The littler one got it worse than me, leading into his high school years. I was treated better and I don’t know why; I still question it to this day. We approached our mom as teenagers when we started to really understand the ramifications of the abuse. We broke down and asked her why she didn’t help us or see what we were going through. She was shocked and claimed she didn’t know, but that was the last it was ever talked about.

Now we’re both adults and my little brother has become my hero. The mental challenges he has faced in his life (the torture and torment of abuse led him to alcoholism) he has overcome and came out on top. I don’t know how I (and my little bro) even have had successful relationships with females. I will soon marry the love of my life and he is currently single by choice (but has had girlfriends). All of the abuse we went through was swept under the rug and my mom never even told my dad.  I somehow still communicate with my older brother who now has a wife and two kids of his own. I can’t imagine how he looks at them knowing how much of a monster he really is. 

Then just two weeks ago I found out my mom had an affair with my childhood best friend’s dad around the same time we opened up about our abuse. My dad ultimately told me coming back from golfing one Sunday and I was able to see just how good of a man he was. He chose to stay when he had no obligation to other than the covenant he made before god and the sons he raised. I opened up to him and told him about our abuse growing up. I didn’t want to hurt him with the truth, the same reason why he didn’t tell me about the affair until now. This whole time my mom has kept the persona of a good girl from a farm family who rode horses and went to church every Sunday. She even had the audacity to tell her best friend to stop sleeping with her boyfriend because they weren’t married!

As of today, I have graduated with my Master’s and just accepted a job offer where I hope to be for many years. I plan to get married, buy a house, have kids of my own, and live a happy life. I generally am a very eccentric and funny person, but people have been wondering why I am acting different in the most exciting time of my life. I feel like I just can’t connect with most people who assume I grew up with a leg up, because we come from a middle-class family. I haven’t told anyone in my life about the pain and suffering my family has endured. 

I don’t know what I am looking for here, but I want to share this story for the first time in case someone out there can feel like they are not alone, and they are understood. I will be seeking professional help going forward but I love how honest this subreddit is. If you made it this far thank you for reading and I hope you and your loved ones are well."
870,How do I silence the voices in my head??,"It’s kind of weird to describe it, I feel like I am ALWAYS talking to a huge crowd or something like it. It’s I have to be talking in my head to my fears. I don’t know if I can explain it well enough, but it is terrible and I can’t get to shush it. Even when I am trying to sleep, I always feel like I am talking in my mind to an imaginary crowd full of people

It’s been months (almost a year maybe) since I have this problem, and i’m thinking it might be related to lack of social communication as I rarely leave my house and don’t have dozens of friends.

If someone has experienced something  like this or can help me in any way, I’d be really really great. Thanks!"
871,My aunt just died and i have no idea how to process grief,"I just lost my aunt to cancer. I received a call from my cousin in tears and i drove them to the hospital. It was so fast. I think she mightve died while on the way because she was unresponsive. I dont think i feel that great, but i am not feeling sad, i think?. I am not crying, i havent. I just feel kinda confused maybe? I remember once i was maybe 10 at my grandads funeral and i i found it so funny for some reason, i couldn't keep my laughter in and i left the funeral. I think i am feeling the same right now, but i am not laughing."
872,How in the world do people function like this?,"My current state of mind (and this is one of the better days tbh) is highly depressed, exhausted (like all I want to do is sleep all the time), suicidal (but not as much as worse days), large cravings to self-harm, and just overall really wanting to give up on life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm genuinely curious... how do people survive and function like this? I'm a full-time college student taking a heavy course load this summer and bringing myself to do something is almost impossible. Anyone have any advice?"
873,The void,"Why can I not get better? Why? Why is every day becoming a struggle? Why is the fatigue, the headaches, the bouts of sadness, the anxiety, the depression, so severe and so debilitating, and still, they say I’ll get better? I am literally dying to get better- which to me means I feel like I am actually dying, and either my life ends and I’ll feel better, or I stay slowly dying til I hit old age and die from some stress related disease. 2020 has been the worst year of my life, not just from the corona but from other things that have taken every ounce of strength, every ounce of love that I had to give. My kids, when they talk to me, I go blank, because I don’t know how to reply. I can’t think I can’t eat and if I sleep my body and my head are in constant pain. I want my body to release the tears that I can feel stuck in my chest but I can’t cry I can’t release. I just want to hug my dad and just smell him. Life is so disgusting without him. There is no happiness it’s all an illusion to me"
874,living in constant fear,i’m constantly feeling terrified like i always feel as though i’m doing everything wrong and that be of that people are gonna hate me and idk why but i just can’t stop overthinking literally everything i’m just so scared of everything and part of me just wants time to stop and for me to be able to gather myself but i can’t and the world is so terrifying and frustrating right now and idk what to do i’m so scared — i haven’t been diagnosed with anything but the fear and stress doesn’t end what could be wrong with me? is this anxiety?? i feel as though this is ruining my life and idk what to do :/

880,"I feel overwhelmed and breaking apart even though from the outside my life is going perfectly okay, please help?","25F. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with my life on the outside right now, I’m grateful for sure because especially in these times, there are people far worse off than me, dealing with illnesses, family issues, hunger, even wars and the list goes on. 

I feel so overwhelmed “on the inside”. I feel like I’m so burdened with my past, my memories, with the intensity of my emotions and I’m honestly on the tip of breaking. Such a contrast: a perfectly safe and healthy life on the outside and yet I’m so broken on the inside. I’m sad all the time. I live in the past, I lose myself in my emotions.I can’t seem to move on from losing my dad, I can’t move on from my break up with someone I’d thought was the love of my life (the latter two events overlapped), and other painful memories from my life.  If I have a moment of complete peace, where you’d expect I’d relax, that’s when it’s the worst.  These feelings intrude into my every waking moment and demand that I feel, analyze what went wrong, and wallow in my “sad reality”. I should be over and past all of this, it’s been years! I don’t even bring any of this up to people I’m close to because they just assume I’ve moved on and to be honest while they’re great, they can’t really do anything to help. But I look around me and I’m still emotionally exactly where I was 4 years ago, if not worse. 

Please help. Any advice is great, if you’ve gone through something similar please share it! Thank you"

882,I don't know what's wrong with me,"I've been diagnosed with social anxiety, agoraphobia and bipolar disorder. I'm not sure about my bipolar diagnosis. I only had one psychotic episode and it was after I was put on Risperdal. I had other complications as well. Some days I would lose control of my facial muscles. I was out of it, I even had a mini heart attack. (Not sure if that's the correct term, the details are fuzzy). I know I went to the hospital for it.

I went to therapy for years, but it never helped. I feel as though I'm stuck in my head. I go almost silent when I'm around strangers. I've been like this since I was a child. Never had any friends. Did well in school though. Until college, I felt overwhelmed so I dropped out. That was 10 years ago and since then I've been doing a lot of research. I'm 95% sure I have undiagnosed autism. But what can I do about it now? There is no medication, no cure for it. I've been on several different medications for anxiety. Nothing ever helped ease this uncomfortable feeling I have around people. I don't know if I'm asking for help or advice. Just wanted to get it out I guess..."
883,Do I have OCD?,"A little bit of my backstory... I have been a music fan for as long as I can remember and started picking my favorite artists when I was about 7. I became very interested in a band in particular and quickly got VERY into it, being that I knew every single detail about every band member, listened to them all day long and thought about them very often too. Mind you, I was only seven years old. But still, this could be seen as a rather “normal” behavior for a very dedicated music fan. Through the years, the bands have changed (I’ll follow them up for a couple of years or so, then find some new band to learn about), but my behavior is always the same towards them. Sometimes it can get pretty extreme, just to point a few examples: at 13 years old a show of my favorite band at that moment I was supposed to go to was cancelled, that hit me very hard and (among some other reasons, but mostly that) I got severely depressed, to the point of self-harming and having suicidal tendencies. After therapy I could overcome that, but I started liking another band from the 1970s that didn’t exist anymore, I liked them so much I started studying physics to see if there was any way I could turn back in time and see them play??? lmao and my obsession is REAL. Like, checking information about the bands several times an hour, saving every single picture, very creepy shit. As I grew older I think I’ve learnt how to “control” this obsessive behavior a little bit better (also the medication for depression that I take might have helped but I don’t know), but I’m still very obsessed over a band at this very moment and I’m already 21. I don’t know if this is a normal fan thing or whatever, but it’s something that bothers me A LOT. I constantly get myself worrying about these artists that I have no proximity whatsoever, checking their social media all the time, getting very anxious when I don’t hear about them, talking about them repeatedly... and it’s very annoying. I wish I could just not be like this ‘cause it sucks. I have never talked about this to my therapist because I’m lowkey embarrassed. It sounds like a fan girl thing but the obsession hurts and is very very tiresome. Well, since this is an obsessive behavior, I wonder if it fits any description of OCD or other obsessive disorder? For the record my family has an history of OCD too, specially my mother. During quarantine I have had some bad obsession episodes/panic attacks, like I said it might sound silly but it’s very difficult to me, I can’t even point out how many breakdowns I’ve had due to that and I dearly wish I could stop it somehow"
884,Small problem,"I know that this may seem like a small thing compared to everyone else’s posts about depression and stuff like that but I feel stuck. 

The best way to describe it is having 1/4 of my brain working but that part is focused on something different from what I should. This comes to a delema where my mother and everyone else says I’m intelligent, even the teachers say I’m smart but just lazy because I don’t get my work completed. This infuriates me because I don’t think I’m lazy, but them saying this gives a slight bit of doubt that maybe I actually am just a lazy shit. I feel like there is something wrong with me, why I can’t bring myself to do work, why I can’t focus on a assignment anywhere in the house, not in my room, not at the kitchen table, nor on the coach or at my desk. No where I go or what work I’m doing will let me focus on the task at hand. I just feel like a monumental fuck up what ever I’m doing and I can’t do anything right while my mom and dad are practically counting on me to be the successful one of the family. When ever anyone asks what are my interests I have nothing no sports or hobby all I can reluctantly say is videogames which would be nice if I could actually take pride in it instead of being dog shit at every game I play. 

I’m sorry if reading this is atrocious I didn’t really format it that good, it’s more of blowing off steam. I’ve also been writing so long I’m doubting this is in the right sub reddit."
885,Scared to finally tell someone,"Hello! First time poster. I need some insight and encouragement. I don’t know where to start, who to tell, or where to go. This is going to be long...

A little back info first. I’m a 38 y/o married mom of two under 10 yrs. The problems I’m having, I’ve had to a certain degree since I was under the age of 10. I’ve never told anyone. I never trusted my parents, my spouse, or anyone else to believe me. Suddenly my issues have been getting worse, which is why I’m here now. 

Since the age of about 7, I’ve been silently struggling with visual/auditory hallucinations, paranoia, anxiety, depression and constant day dreaming/fantasizing. I always thought there was something “wrong” with me mentally, but was scared to tell my parents. They did and still do think mental illnesses are made up for attention. 

Examples of my childhood hallucinations is seeing and talking to a threatening demon. Seeing and talking to an elderly woman who resembled my mom. And the most disturbing one that would happen when I was very anxious, seeing myself jumping on babies stomachs like a trampoline and killing them. 

Example of anxiety. Always worried about everything. Worried that there was something wrong with me. 

Examples of depression. Sad all of the time because I had a hard time making friends and was bullied at school. Sad because my parents didn’t seem to notice I was having issues. Sad because I didn’t feel normal like everyone else. 

Examples of my childhood paranoia was being scared to leave my moms side because I thought she or I would die if we were t always together. Thinking everyone was going to die. Thinking I was going to get kidnapped. Always was paranoid that someone was following me or watching me. Never trusting anyone because everyone was against me for some reason. 

I was constantly in a day dream or fantasy. I was never and still never am in the present moment. I have always and still always am stuck somewhere else. 

I started doing really bad in school, barely passed high school and was only able to pass a few classes in college before dropping out. 

As I got older the depression part got worse. I “attempted” suicide at 19, but woke up the next day unharmed. 

As a teenager, I also developed the delusion that I was going to be traumatically murdered and constantly looked behind my back, waiting for the moment. 

Started smoking weed which took the edge off. 

Fast forward to now. In addition to the problems I was already having since a child, my husband emotionally abused me, gaslit me for 17 years while leading a double life of constant sex with prostitutes and drug use. About two weeks after I found his burner phone and debit card to secret bank account, he confessed, and I was diagnosed with genital herpes that my husband graciously infected me with...

My current delusions cycle around, between thinking I’m the creator, that reality doesn’t exist, that I don’t exist, that no one else exists, that my husband targeted me to torture me for his benefit, that my husband is going to kill me, that I’m going to kill my husband, that spies are watching me to set me up for a crime I didn’t do. That I was adopted to be raised for someone else to use. That I was destined to have a life of suffering, and that nothing I do will ever save me. There’s much much more. 

My current hallucinations include seeing things move around without being touched. I’ve moved objects with my mind.  And I constantly hear multiple voices. My voices argue. My voices criticize me. My voices tell me to do things I don’t want to do. My voices tell me bad things will happen to me if I “confess” everything. Much much more. 

Currently depressed about my husband’s chronic infidelity and now having herpes. 

Still paranoid that someone is watching me and trying to get me. Still paranoid that I’ll be framed for a crime I didn’t commit. Still paranoid I’ll be brutally murdered. 

I’m still constantly in my head and never present for any moment. I have a terrible memory, which I contribute to this. 

I feel like my life just isn’t real. Maybe I’m dreaming?

This is a living nightmare and I’m starting to not be able to handle it anymore. I don’t know how I’ll be able to keep doing this and live a long life. It’s gotten so painful that I’ve recently started disassociating, pretending to be anywhere and anyone else but here and me. 

As this has all progressed, it has gotten so jumbled up and I felt like I wasn’t able to put what was happening to me into words, that anyone else would understand, because I can barely understand it myself. 

Why does this sound like? There’s so much more going on than I’ve written. I’ve just recently been able to start putting pieces together and realizing this is really affecting me and my children."
886,My girlfriend of 2 years left a week agao and she already moved on.,"Hello. This is going to be a long one:
I met this girl a while back (about 3 years) at her friends party. My ex-friend, who is not necessarily known as upstanding, came with me. After the party, they started to talk; while her and I became quite good friends. My ex-friend eventually showed his true colors and it turned out he was really only with her for,  yanno, and to be honest that killed me because while we were friends I fell so hardly in love with her. I ended up basically stealing her from him and I don't and will never regret that. We just broke up last week. I am DEVASTATED. We argued about a lot the last few days of our relationship and that was because I was feeling used myself. Again, I love her so I wanted to address it, and she gave up. I showed her the world. Gave her the respect she deserved. Sketchy thing is that she kept her ex around the last 2 years, hidden from me. When she broke up with me, she started hanging out with him and I got a little crazy. I've done some effed up stuff as a reaction and I'm positive I pushed her fully away at this point. Only thing is that I have had constant anxiety, constant chest pain, and I really want her back. There aren't really any high hopes for that but if I think about that my anxiety is relieved a little. I've been so alone, my friends stopped talking to me because I'm not dealing with it well (can't really say I blame them), I'm really trying not to fall apart every day. I miss her so much. Thank you for reading if you got this far I know I'm not alone, however it's just the changes that I made for her were so great I became a better person just so I could have her. She never gave me the time of day to explain myself better."
887,I just want help,"Hi, so 15 year old girl here. I’ve been dealing with this sort of “depression and anxiety” (not to self diagnose but I have briefly talked to a doctor that believes the same thing) the anxiety started last year. Grade 9. It’s been there my whole life basically but it got bad last year. When it started getting so bad (panic attacks at the grocery store) I asked my mom if I could see a doctor and explained the situation to her. She said ok. Never happened. I did eventually see a doctor for something physical related and we talked briefly and she said to book and appointment. Never did. So here we are a year later, grade 10, and my mental health has officially hit rock bottom. Not sure if depression is the right word because, I have days where it feels impossible to leave my bed and I can’t stand my family and I cry all day. Then theirs days where I’m on top of the world, I think I’m the baddest bitch and I love being around my sisters. Then after the god complex for a day or two I start becoming extremely suicidal. And I’ve never seriously considered suicide until a couple months ago. I stared at a pill bottle for way too long in the middle of a breakdown In my bath tub(the day I realized I needed help) so this cycle has been going on for a while now. Extremely sad - God complex - Suicidal. As well as the depression side, I haven’t been able to leave my house much. My mother asks me to go to the store with her and i can’t bring my self to explain to her that I can’t breathe when I’m there. I can’t go into isles because theirs atleast 1 other person in them. I can’t walk around without feeling like people are staring at me. And I just can’t function (grocery stores, malls, school) etc; On the topic of school, I started skipping a lot of classes that made me anxious and need to throw up, classes I didn’t have friends in. It wasn’t intentional, id go to school with intention of going to all 4 classes. But it just didn’t happen most of the time. The reason I’m wiriting this is because I woke up this morning at 3pm and went on tiktok of course. The first thing on my feed was a girl crying about her brothers suicide and saying she missed him. Immediately shattered my heart and I broke down. I thought about how my siblings would feel, how my mom would feel. And I couldn’t stop crying. I got a huge urge to cut myself again but I DIDNT  (2 months sober!) . I couldn’t bare the thought of them mourning me. I couldn’t bring that pain upon them bc I know how pain feels. Is it good that the only reason I’m still here is because I don’t know where I’m gonna go when I die, and I can’t hurt my family like that. I think those are valid reasons but I should have more to live for. This day has been really bad for me, not sure how I’m gonna be tommorow. I wish I didn’t wake up today. I wish I woke Up tommorow so wouldn’t have to feel like this. How do I seek help. I’m going to book a doctors appointment, but what do I say? I can’t tell her I’m suicidal because they’ll admit me right? Though some part of my wants that. I think I could really heal in a mental hospital. But I’m too embarrassed and can’t stop thinking about how my family would judge me. Do I tell the doctor how I’m truly feeling. I think I will. I’m hoping to get a therapist very soon, I’ve accepted that I need to seek help. Because there’s no one I can talk too. My sister suffers from anxiety and situational depression, she’s doing CB therapy for that at the moment. But I feel like she’ll get mad at me for saying I wanna die. I’m scared she’ll tel me I’m selfish. And that’ll hurt. I have friends and I have family who would gladly listen to me, but some part of me CANNOT express my feelings because I know I’ll break down in front of them and I can’t put my burdens on them, they have enough, I’m not exactly the best kid. If you’ve made it to the end, can anyone tell me if I can admit myself to a hospital, I’m 15 and from Canada. Will they allow me. There’s a hospital near my house I could bike there, Id rather them notify my parents AFTER I’m settled in, also if I tell my doctors how I’m feeling, they legally have to tel me parents. So maybe avoiding therapy all together is best... I absolutely do not want to open up to my mom. She asked me today I I wanted to go walk with her I said no and she got mad at me. It broke my heart that I couldn’t tell her I wanted to die. She gave me life, and I don’t want it anymore, that would hurt her. My mom is the best, though she is the cause of my body dysmorphia and trauma. I love her I can’t hurt her. All in all, should I see a doctor first and ask her if she can have me admitted?"
888,New work schedule is wreaking havoc on my mental health,"My work schedule has been pretty severely affected by by covid19, and it's really starting to affect me. 

It's hard to explain, but I'll try my best. Myself and my coworkers have been split into two teams. Team one comes in on certain days and team two comes in on the other days. We never cross paths for safety reasons, so that if a member of one of the teams were to become infected with the virus, the other team will have not come in contact with them and will continue to work while the team with the infected member would quarantine. 

So, with this weird schedule and some members working from home because they have compromised immune systems, we've been working 10 hour shifts on our on days, and then I've been staying home on my off days.

Having 4 days straight of 10 hour shifts has been really hard for me, and then having three or four days at a time where I don't leave the house is similarly making things difficult. My boyfriend who I live with has been working 12 hour shifts at his job and it's stressing our relationship. My poor dog is becoming depressed because we're never him and when we are home, we eat and go straight to bed. 

I've asked my manager to help figure out a better schedule for me, but there's nothing she can do without changing the schedules of every other employee at my job. She just told me I should be thankful to have a job. We have to stay separated on our teams. and we're staying this way until the end of the year. Because of how the schedule is set up, my team is scheduled to work every holiday for the rest of the year, and I just dread the thought of that. 

I don't know what to do. I need this job and I desperately need the benefits that come with it. I cannot afford to quit, but my mental health, my relationship, and my poor dog can't keep going this way. I want to ask my manager to let me take a break or something but I'm afraid they'll just fire me."
889,"My mom probably has schizophrenia, but refuses to acknowledge it or seek any sort of help, and it's taking a major toll on my life. How can I help her?","In the last year or two, my mom (early 50s) has been acting very different from how she used to when I (college age) was younger. It's strained her relationships with those she knows and thus allocated a huge amount of burden on me as I'm the only one living with her. I did not really know what to make of these things until I researched mental disorders and found that [schizophrenia symptoms](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-disorders/schizophrenia-signs-and-symptoms.htm) match up really well with how she's been acting. The only thing is that I don't know how to go about getting her any sort of help because (1) she refuses to acknowledge anything is wrong and (2) we can't afford therapy/medication/etc. and as such it would be hard to get an official diagnosis. Is there anything I can go to help her?"
890,Anyone else experience this,"I am posting hoping I am not alone.  I need to know I am not alone in this feeling, the feeling like I messed up, Like I destroyed all that is good.  I am living in a city I hate so I can be close to my kids, I lost my girlfriend about 3 months ago cause my mental health and hers overwhelmed her and she had a breakdown and ended up inpatient.  She still talks with me but I feel like the best thing to have happened in my life left with her.  I feel like no one will even compare to her.  We have talked since the breakup, hell we are still good friends, and she tells me not to blame myself but I cant help it cause I had a breakdown cause I lost the keys to the RV we had.  I don't know what I expect here, but I guess I just want to have some validation that I am just being too hard on myself.  I miss the late night talks, feeling of being wanted and needed, hell I miss having someone around to laugh and smile with.  

&amp;#x200B;

Before anyone assumes anything, I am safe, I am not going to hurt myself or anyone/anything else.  I just needed to vent and hear from someone that I am not crazy.  I don't have a support network and I deal with ptsd, cptsd, borderline personality, bipolar, anxiety, sever clinical depression, 2 TBI's, numerous concussions, and I am sure more but just can't remember.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really let go cause I have no one to help me.  My mental health has driven every one that really gave a shit away from my life.  As I said before I am safe, but I just wonder some days how long before someone would notice I was to have died.  I don't want to be one of those stories where they died in their apartment and the only reason they were found dead was cause of the stench/lateness of rent.  I feel so lonely most days, I have a cat but it is not the same as having someone to cuddle and talk to and care about you.  My childhood was full of neglect and so I crave the feeling of being wanted/needed.  For 12 years(from 6 years old till 18)  I was pretty much a lone.  Never had friends growing up.  I don't really know what it is like to have friends.  I don't know what it feels like to be able to have self esteem.    I have 0 self worth.  My self worth is tied to what i can do for people around me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone that reads this and responds, thank you.  You have shown me a kindness not many (including my parents) have shown me."
891,I'm nervous to start therapy and meds.,"In the next few months I (f21)plan on going to get evaluated and get the help I need.iv known for a long time I need help and my mental state has been to say the least rocky. From a young age teachers recommended to my parents that they put me on medication but they always refused, saying there was nothing wrong with me insisting I was the perfect child. But I only got worse with age. Iv been dreaming of getting help for so long that I'm afraid it won't be all its cracked up to be or worse they won't be able to help me. 

Q: What was it like when you first reached out for help and do you have any advice?"
892,Is there something wrong with me?,"Hello all! This is my first time posting in this Reddit! I may be overreacting about this, but I wanted to get a few people's opinions on this. If anything needs to be clarified, just let me know. I sometimes have a hard time describing things.  I'm an 18 year old male, I take Vyvanse, Zoloft and Intuniv. I have ADHD and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually, I feel or act like I'm in a movie. I make situations up in my head that consists of ""Ooh, this or that would be cool as a movie!"" and talk quietly to myself, speaking if I'm the characters in the trailer. I usually do this when I'm not doing anything else in particular. I also have an odd habit of staring at my face in the mirror. I'm not obsessed with it, I often do it when I see a mirror. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second thing, I enjoy being loud. I think it's hilarious to make loud noises. The noises I make include clapping really loud (usually one really loud clap), screeching, hissing, shouting stuff like ""DARGH!"" or ""HUEGH!"", just annoying things in general. I also like making weird faces, sometimes as I'm making random noises. This doesn't happen randomly, I am in complete control of my actions. I just find that funny. Sometimes, I throw myself on the ground as a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, sometimes I find things that are extremely offensive to be funny. I'm into dark humor, so I don't know if it's just that or something else. I'd rather not go into detail about what I laugh at. I also laugh at things like, for example, my friend dropping something. I don't know why, but sometimes, if my friend drops something on accident or nearly trips and falls, I burst out laughing for a few seconds. Basically, I sometimes laugh at inappropriate times. I don't laugh if somebody is genuinely hurt or sad or anything. I'm very empathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what do you think? Is there something wrong with me? I have a feeling that it's just who I am, but sometimes it concerns me. Please, let me know what you think. Thank you!"
893,Why do I become attached so easily?,"Bit of backstory: I’m 23, female. I’ve never really been able to show affection very well, and not been in a proper relationship (I’m undiagnosed but I have symptoms of autism/aspergers) but I do fall very deeply in love with people I’m close with. I don’t open up much to friends or parents, I’m depressed and lonely. I would say I have a good relationship with my parents, but I don’t talk to them about my mental health and I don’t hug them, I haven’t for years. I also had a good childhood but I have a younger sister with bipolar who my parents had to but a lot of effort and attention into when we were younger, possibly leaving me feeling neglected at times. 

Throughout high school, uni and pretty much every day life I become overly attached to teachers and other adult females. It’s not sexual, I just get so attached easily. For example, I went to the doctors for a mental health consultation and as soon as the doctor asked how I was, I cried and just wanted to hug her. I then had a freaking dream about her... that’s weird, right? It wasn’t like a sexual dream or anything, I don’t remember much but I was seeing her as like a caregiver role. Another example in high school, I had a teacher who was really lovely in a very bad time (lots of bullying) and she kept me after class one day and asked if I was okay and I just broke down. I just wanted to hug her and her to hold me. It was really hard to leave that class - her, at the end of the year. 

I’m going to start seeing a psychologist and I know it’s going to end bad because I will become so attached it’ll take over my everyday life and when the sessions end I’ll feel shit again.  I just want to figure out why I get these feelings, I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone about this because it sounds so weird and creepy to me. Anyone got any thoughts? Should I talk to my therapist when I start seeing her about this? Am I just lonely? 😂"
894,Can I go to ER for really really bad anxiety,"I just came off a really high mood and everything was great, then I crashed and I have some of the worst anxiety of my life.  It feels like I'm having an anxiety attack litteraly the entire day at work.  My heart is racing, I'm having constant heart palpatations (like every 10minutes for hours), I have to calm myself every few minutes.  I'm having constant panic attacks, and generally just really miserable. I really don't feel like I can live like this for even one more shift.  I don't have a doctor or anyone who can give me medication and I'm afraid I'm one bad day from just walking out and not coming back to my job.  I really really need medication or some form or relief, and none of my normal coping mechanisms are working.  I'm so overwhelmed and I dont know what to do"
895,am i mentally ill?,"i cant stop thinking about smearing my shit over a local shop. Should i tell my therapist? ive been having thoughts and acting on harming others and myself and social services are visiting tommrow. like most people im suicdal and visit the hospital occassionally for self inflicted injuries. often times when i get an urge i cant stop sweating and shaking. ive felt like everyone is out to hurt me since ive had quiet truamatice experiences with ""friends"" and was sexually assalted frequently while i was really suicdal. my home life is pretty shitty with my dad somewhat threataning to leave and never come back and asking if id forgive him if he never talked to me again. my mum left him in octeober and is pretty distant and disliked by most everyone but me. im sweating quite a lot right now and the thoughts passing by in my mind are quite disturbing and such but i feel calm its strange. considering suicide but not feeling very distressed? its weird i wont lie. i just made this throw away account so friends dont see this but idk. there has been talk of a local mental hospital but since there are not visiting allowed due to covid it would be a last resort so its not currently being considered. my therapist thinks my irrational/violet behaviour is due to the medication i started 3 weeks ago but ive been off it for 3 days and my mind is still being weird."
896,I'm bored of mental health troubles,"Really, I have nothing much more to add. I've tried so many things and made partial progress here there and nowhere. I'm still alone, I'm still struggling, I'm still lost. 

If I were to have someone love me, just give me hugs everyday without talking to me, I'm sure I would suffer a little less. I don't want sex, I am too depressed to get myself up for it, and I think I'm asexual anyway. I just want to hug someone and sleep and never wake up. None of the bullshit I'm dealing with from my childhood are my fault but boy am I done with putting shitstains on a microscope slide. 

Fuck my life, seriously. Fuck god for arbitrarily punishing a few of us, and making all of them equally aware of all that they are going through. I wish I wouldn't be so depressed but I'm so tired. I'm so very tired I wish someone would just be okay with me and not be scared of my inability to be like the others. My inability to be put together. Fuck this. Fuck fuck fuck this so much."
897,I can't stop overdosing.,I am scared and exhausted. I keep trying to kill myself by gulping down handfuls of my medication. Last month I took iron supplement tablets and could have died of internal bleeding. I have gallstones which is probably caused by my overdosing and I have been told I've developed pancreatitis. I'm in agony and I can't stop hurting myself. I hate being alive but I don't want to die.
898,I don't know,"Killing myself... I want to do it, but at the same time I don't want to see what's waiting. I have responsibilities here. I just keep coming back to this, and every time it seems to make a little more sense. What's the point in living if you have to shove your feelings down and ""be a man"", its like im not aloud to feel like this. Is the only answer to anxiety and depression to ""Get over it"" and ""Push Through it"", I've been trying for years but its always the same struggle and it doesn't get easier. If anything it gets harder.. but If you die and its more misery id be stuck. thinking about how scared I am to kill myself makes me want to kill myself... dang, do you ever actually stop feeling like suicide is the golden ticket? or does everyone just lie to themselves and others and still feel miserable all the time?"
899,How do I return to reality/everyday life? I literally spend all day in my room.,"I'm basically stuck in this weird limbo/bubble I've created for myself where reality doesn't seem to exist for me. Working, dating, socialising, politics - even the pandemic - just isn't on my radar. It seems fictional; a whole other dimension. My life just revolves around my bedroom - literally. 

Everyday is spent like this: Wake up round 4-6pm, go toilet, maybe shower and then return to my room. Then I'll eat chocolate I have in there (or on the rare occasion, go down to the local newsagent to stock up). Afterwards I'll just dissociate, lying on my bed. Then I'll just watch some YouTube and briefly check social media. Then I'll just sleep on and off until it's my bedtime - which is 6-8am. After a week, I usually force myself to talk to some flatmates because I know it's bad if I never socialise at all.  

And that's it - that's my life right now. I keep saying I'll change, but never do. I'm so depressed and dissociate so much that I can't function. I've forgotten how to live a normal life - I'm not part of the world anymore.

My primary care nurse says to get a new routine - including a job, sleep schedule, exercise and proper food - to help, but it never works. I'm always too weak, depressed, unmotivated and dissociate to be able to do those things consistently, even doing them in small increments. She says getting a job I like will help - but I can't enjoy anything anymore. She also says I can't attend therapy until I have a healthy routine (because I won't be able to cope otherwise), so it's a catch-22 really. I'm just tempted to lie at this point.

But anyway, any advice? How can I return to normality/everyday life?"
900,People think I'm mentally challenged due to anxiety,I guess my anxiety makes me talk in a way people can not understand me sometimes. I talk too slow. I guess everyone I encounter thinks that. I'm not even sure how to get help with that issue.
901,for the past two weeks or so i have cried everyday at least once.,"i’m a young woman, and i know that this isn’t caused by my menstrual cycle or anything. i’m not sad abt anything in particular. i have nothing to be sad abt, it’s just random small things. someone caused a minor inconvenience, or someone changed plans abruptly, or i just cry and i can’t even remember why.

i feel a little better afterwards i guess..."
902,My story in a nutshell,"Dear anyone who reads, I am sharing a link to something I wrote in an outrageous urge to not settle into complacency and sensationalism after the suicide of a bollywood actor. 
I suffer from bipolar disorder, clinical depression and borderline personality disorder. 
I have, briefly, written down things that I felt needed to be said.
It is my story, without an end because I am still alive and trying. 
As I have requested in the piece, I shall request here, if you do decide to read, read till the end because it must be considered in totality and not fragments. I am sharing because there have been moments when words of strangers and people long passed have kept me off from falling.

[Why His Suicide Seems So Personal](https://medium.com/@afewhappypeople/why-his-suicide-seems-so-personal-36d9733533b9?source=friends_link&amp;sk=3a0d3ced355e36ef20f39224e31f7f8e)"
903,"Just someone to talk to, please...",I can't stop crying. Like I've done my best all day to hold it in but now I cant do it anymore and the few friends I have aren't replying to me. I feel so sad and alone and at this point even if it's a stranger I don't care I just need someone to talk to :/
904,Does anyone else feel like this?,"For the past couple of months, I've been struggling to eat. I had problems sleeping but I managed to get my sleeping pattern together. I keep feeling waves of anxiety and most mornings I wake up with a heavy feeling in my chest. It makes it difficult to get out of bed. I push myself. I go to work, I study and carry on with my day despite the feeling but it takes a lot of effort. I cry a lot and on days where I can't cry, I just feel empty. I can't explain the feeling but it's really taking a toll on me."
905,Methods for helping severe social anxiety?,"I grew up with social anxiety and I’m now about to be junior in college. Last year I was finally prescribed medication for it by a Dr at my university but it wasn’t right for me. Too many side effects it made me feel worse both physically and mentally so I stopped taking it. The psychiatric specialist I saw at school intimidated me a bit. I waited to see my primary care doctor for my annual check up and ask her about it and she removed it from my prescriptions and told me to visit the psychiatric specialist again for a prescription change. At this point I have not made an appointment with her for a check up in a few months and it’s been weeks since I have taken the medication in a few weeks so I was anxious about seeing her again. Can’t even work up the nerve to make an appointment. I’ve attended counseling on and off since the 8th grade and it just never seemed to help me. But I know my anxiety must be treated. I’m not close to a single person at my college, not even any of the roommates I’ve had. I’m currently on academic probation because I’m too anxious to contact my professors and resources when I need to. I just always feel like I’m going to get yelled at. Or that my peers dislike me because I don’t fit in due to my mental state. I’m obviously very introverted and a tend to make people think that I dislike them, don’t want to talk to or hang out with them and that I’m uninterested when I’m reality that is the opposite of how I feel. I’ve started reading, writing, working out and drawing but I feel like that doesn’t help my social anxiety it just helps general anxiety"
906,can a minor admit themself to a mental hospital?,does anyone know if i can admit myself into a mental hospital without parental consent as a minor (15 y/o) in KY? or any way i can get mental help without parental consent. my parents refuse to take me to get therapy or any type of diagnosis.
907,Is this normal?,"Sometimes I’ll walk into a room or something, and I’ll suddenly be like, “Woah, I can’t believe I’m real.” Like I just can’t believe I’m alive and myself. Like I don’t even know how to describe it.

Does anyone else have this? 🤣"
908,I just failed TMS,"I'm lucky enough to have depression that's considered ""treatment resistant"", and I've been on 18 different medications, with only mild effectiveness from one or two. The rest were either useless or worse than useless. 

Since I'm treatment resistant, I was a good candidate for rTMS therapy. I had prefrontal bilateral treatments once a day, every weekday for 4 weeks. I worked through the discomfort in order to get up to the maximum therapeutic dose as soon as possible. 

I was concerned about my lack of any response to the treatments. All I got was mild headaches sometimes, but no change in my moods at all. Right near the end of treatment, I talked to the psychiatrist again, and he said if I hadn't seen any improvement by now, there wouldn't be any. So, I just wasted a bunch of time on a treatment that was useless for me. 

I was so hopeful at the beginning. I hoped that this would help me where so many other things have failed. Now I can add one more to the list of failures. The psychiatrist suggests increasing my dose of fetzima and seeing if that helps (I really doubt it will). Then we can try trintellix, pristiq, or maybe an MAOI. ECT is still an option but I don't want to have to be babysat for a month, nor is that feasible. 

I don't know what to do. I can't stop thinking about how everything has failed for me, and how I just want to sleep forever. Sleep is the only time I feel ok. It's like death without the long term commitment. I think about killing myself every day but I'm too scared to actually do it. 

Has anyone here improved from a situation like this? I'm quickly losing hope"
909,I feel like I’m constantly paranoid,"Maybe this is the wrong place for this post if it is I’m sorry, but I constantly feel paranoid about any of my relationships or friendships, I feel like I notice every small tiny detail and any change and it freaks me out and I over think all of it and usually it destroys these relationships, like right now I’m in a weird relationship but I’m paranoid that this person will leave me so I constantly need reassurance from them or check on them or even check all their social medias. How do I stop this or what’s something I could do instead or is it just sheer willpower?"
910,Seeing sex or romance triggers depression,"I see a woman passionately making love to a man and my whole mood changes. I can't seem to just let it go, it lingers and festers and sours me. How do I kill this emotion?"
911,would this be considered trauma?,"ever since i was really young, i would have huge meltdowns due to sensory overload and really bad anxiety. one of my parents solution was to force me into a pitch black closet with them while they held me tightly and wouldn’t let go. i have a lot of issues when it comes to dark closed spaces and people touching or grabbing me now but i have a great relationship with them. is it technically considered traumatic if i’m still negatively effected by it?"
912,Curious about what anxiety looks like to normal people,"I recently got a job which is huge because I'm agoraphobic and severely anxious.

But I can't stop wondering if they notice something is wrong with me. So I would like your input.... what does severe anxiety look like to someone who doesn't have it? Is it noticeable??"
913,.....,"My entire life I have felt that I am good for nothing, that I am nothing to society and I never will be, that I am a waste of space and nothing more. I never want to trouble people, I constantly apologise which annoys people making them dislike me. Why am I like this. Some people like me but many dislike me even though I always try to please everyone in every situation I can. I hide my emotions for years so that my thoughts don’t bring pain to others. So I went to my schools therapist but I went their so often that they said I depend on them too much and said I could no longer see them. What on earth is wrong with me"
914,i’m so alone,i moved and don’t have any friends and it seems everyone who ever cared about me moved on. i just have no one. not even anyone to go and talk to about it all. my therapist doesn’t help. i’m just so lonely
915,After Gaslighting....,"Thank you to all those who posted their gaslighting situations. In the subtle cases where I was gaslit, writing down things right after they occurred (as mentioned by reddit) which helped me to easily identify that i was right all along and these people were gaslighting me to their own advantage. 

Now my problem is that when meeting new people, I feel that any small trigger or hint at gaslighting makes me automatically go on the defense. I want to move forward and be less gaurded but i believe a decade of being with people who gaslit me have made me quite defensive, and the last thing i want to do is give off that energy to possible new people.

To make matters worse im known to have some means in my town (wasn’t my choice to publicly share this) so there already is a general group of people feigning problems toward me to get money for help. 

Just seeing if any tips going forward as its eye-opening to see you were gaslit the whole time the first time, but i may need to educate myself on being able to still be able to be vulnerable and trusting to new people (and not being super defensive/closed off given my past) while still being able to see if they have genuine intentions and arent gaslighting in the future, thank you."
916,What is your opinion on the helpfulness of counseling?,I never knowing if going to talk to someone would really be helpful depending on the situation?Definitely have a hard time being alone and I feel like I need constant attention from the opposite sex to feel happy at times. Anyone have any advice on dealing mentally with these sort of tendencies?
917,Why am I like this,"My entire life I have felt that I am good for nothing, that I am nothing to society and I never will be, that I am a waste of space and nothing more. I never want to trouble people, I constantly apologise which annoys people making them dislike me. Why am I like this. Some people like me but many dislike me even though I always try to please everyone in every situation I can. I hide my emotions for years so that my thoughts don’t bring pain to others. So I went to my schools therapist but I went their so often that they said I depend on them too much and said I could no longer see them. What on earth is wrong with me"
918,Schools need better mental health care. And better teacher training. Trigger warning suicidal behavior.,"In my middle school I often would hear kids bragging about hurting themselves. They would say things like “I drink bleach every day” and “I cut myself all the time.” I thought that was weird but didn’t think anything of it. There where kids in my class who where obviously being abused at home. They would talk about it pretty openly to their class mates. One kid said he wanted to be a stripper when he grew up. We were in the 5th grade, I don’t think he should have known what that was and nether should have the other kids. Looking back now their was just so much self harm talk, obvious abuse and hyper sexual behavior going on in my elementary, middle school and high school. Even looking at me I was obviously going through something at home. I hardly showered, I had no friends, I was painfully shy and sensitive, and I never talked. But the thing is no teacher ever helped. No teacher ever helped me or the kids the kids around me. Some teachers treated me like I was stuck up and thought that I thought I was smarter then them and told me that. I was 12 years old. Looking back I can see these kids needed to get help. I don’t know if this rant makes sense but I just think about the kids who said they self harm and wonder if they got help. I didn’t know what mental health was until I researched it on my own when I was 16 and I think that I should have been taught that WAY before then and the rest of schools should teach about mental health, trauma and actually work to save these kids. I don’t think those kids who drink bleach would do that if they where taught better coping skills."
919,I wanna stop existing.,"I’m just so tired, tired of waking up every morning, tired of heartbreak. Every moment I breath I’m a burden, no one around me benefits from me being around, no one really wants me around. I just wanna find a corner to ball up in and just stop existing. Nothing makes me happy anymore, I’ll die alone, and nobody would notice.  The world will go on without me if I’m here or not, so why do I even bother anymore."
920,How to Cure Psychosis with Ayurveda," ""Before starting ayurveda, I was taking 6mg of risperdone every night and I was still hearing lots of voices all the time. Today I take 4mg and I rarely hear voices. I can tell you that my health has improved dramatically since I started following the instructions of my ayurvedic doctors. I have high hopes that I will recover completely within the next year.

I want to tell you all that you can do it too if you take my instructions seriously and do what has to be done in order to get cured.""

In the blog post, I link to an ayurvedic spa, but its not for promotional reasons. I'm only reporting my experience and what I went through, so that other people can benefit.

921,Thinking about being admitted,I’ve been going through a lot of stuff for a couple of years. Been thinking about being admitted for mental health for awhile. There is something that is holding me back. I have 4 kids and we receive government support financially and for health insurance. I’m wondering what would happen to my kids if I do this. Will it effect things that I feel like I’m trying to hold together? I don’t feel like my support system cares about me right now/in general and it’s hard to ask for help because it feels like lip service when they say they will. I feel like I’m slowing fading and can’t fix it. It’s getting harder and harder to move and deal with things.
922,Hey i need help,Hello I am 12 years old and I have been sad my grandmother died and nothing makes me happy even though I am not sad and also before I had 9 dogs now I have three 2 of which I had I saw them die and one had to be injected I was sick and at school I'm shit bye
923,Are Personality Disorders Permanent?,"I’ve heard people say that personality disorders weren’t permanent, but I’m not sure if that’s true. Are they permanent or not?"
924,BLM makes me hate my life.,"I’ve been through racism my entire life 
Rumors spread that I was gonna bomb the school. Just because I’m middle eastern. 
My nick name was boom 
I’d get treated like shit 
By men and women of all shapes, sizes, and color. 
Racism from teachers 

Whenever I speak about this to anyone no one cares. 


Throughout life I’ve seen people care about racism. Only towards black people. Lots of people hate racism and wish black people weren’t treated bad. But the same people who want racism to end are the same people who are racist to other races. 

Why does my life not matter just because I’m not black? Women look at me at disgust because I’m middle eastern. White and black people make jokes. 

I’m clean shaven. I dress white. I graduated with a bachelors in psychology. 

I feel worthless. I feel like a ghost. I feel like no one cares about me because I’m not black. Black lives matter is Aganist racism but only Aganist their kind. They don’t care about people like me or other people. 

I’ve been through worse shit than 99.9% of the black community in my generation. So much I don’t want to talk about or included. 

Every time I hear black lives matter, I hear my life doesn’t matter"
925,Why Should I Bother?,"Why should I even bother continuing on with my life when I don’t even have any aspirations or anything to look forwards to? To keep it short I’m 23 I recently dropped out of college cause I didn’t know what to major in and didn’t want to continue wasting money on tuition when I have no idea where I’m headed. No job but am looking for one. I don’t want to have children in the future I want to live a simple life with myself. Therefore, I don’t see the need to earn a high salary just enough to survive. I also have OCD anxiety and depression and I’ve been seeing a therapist, but stopped three months ago I didn’t see a point or any improvement. Even before that I always wanted to drop dead. I’ve always wanted to and did try to attempt but failed. I don’t care about living I just want to disappear. I did try some things like self love trying to improve myself for the better and other things like that but after a while I get discouraged. I feel like all the times I try to invest myself for the better is just a waste of time and I don’t even want to keep trying. What should I do to keep moving forward or just wanting to stay alive? Thanks so much for reading!"
926,it’s really hard not having one of the “gross” mental illnesses,"ive suffered with anxiety and depression for years and years and while more people are very sympathetic and want to help, i don’t receive the same treatment for having bpd and being a pathological liar. it’s hard it’s really fucking hard. everyone is so ready to accept depression and anxiety but people see bpd as one of the “icky” mental illnesses, one of the ones that make u uncomfy because we’re “always mad”. the first fucking time i heard about bpd, it was in a book where they made the school bullies have bpd to explain they’re actions because people think we’re violent, that we’ll hurt people because of our mental illness.

oh and don’t get me even started on being a pathological liar. i cant even tell my friends that. because guess what? the second u say that you’re a pathological liar you’re basically giving up all trust anyone had for you. it doesn’t even matter if im like this because i had to lie to get out of dangerous situations at a young age. it doesn’t matter, no one will ever believe me again. 

there’s so many people with the less accepted mental illnesses that are called crazy and psychotic. it hurts. it makes it hard to get help. my first therapist told me my bpd was just what all teenagers went through and whenever i tried to explain my feelings they would ask “how can i know you’re not just lying?” 

honestly the treatment for people like us is getting worse and worse and it’s making me hate being alive more and more. i hate being like this. the thought of knowing i can never be trusted by my friends if they knew my secrets is hurting me more and more and honestly i wish i was dead if this is all my life is going to be"
927,"I depend so much on my boyfriend, its scaring me.","I depend so much on my boyfriend. Its not healthy, it can get very toxic and yes I know it and I have to say this before anyone judges, I don't do it on purpose. I have a lot of issues that I'm trying to take care of, I only recently was able to convince my mother than I need the help so right now I'm just waiting. 

My main issues and reason why I can be very dependent on my bf is because I'm extremely bad with taking care of myself and being alone. When I'm alone its like I fall into this black hole. I've been alone most of my life, never had good friends who'd care, never seriously dated before him, and my past relationships or friendships would very often end badly because of my unhealthy emotional dependence and my fear of abandonment. 

This is something I'm obviously going to share with a therapist, I want this type of behavior to not ruin others and my life. When I'm alone or if I don't get replies from him, my anxiety hits, existential crisis and suicidal thoughts come back, I'm not able to find anything that could make me feel any better, not even things I know I like or used to like would help, I never feel happy by myself, the best it could get is okay, but usually its just bad."
928,Why is it embarrassing to be sad?,"Life is rocky at the moment and I feel more worried about others noticing how sad I am, then the actual sadness itself. I'm worried about not being ""fun"" more so than the fact that on a spiritual level I'm unhappy. I feel like sadness is a sign that I'm failing somehow, either the world or myself, and I desperately want to hide that failure from the world. Does anyone else ever feel this weird burden?"
929,I can't really put a title to this.,"My Dad passed away 4 years ago, and before then had started a job working a ""cult"" chicken restaurant, after that things got difficult to deal with as my health had just completely destroyed me and the bosses didn't care and gave more of a shit if you popped one up, even to the point of saying that being 8 months pregnant is worth more than having this issues I had no control over. Had to quit because I just couldn't be happy being in work in that way since everything was pushing me over the edge, even taking 3 months off sick... coming back just brought everything back.

I then was off and had a partner at the time who I moved in with although a year and a bit after we managed it, found out that she had cancer and that it was metastatic, and it was just a ticking clock, especially as at one stage had a seizure right in front of me because it had spread to her brain.

She passed away 3 months ago and I didn't get to see her much for the last 3 weeks due to lockdown because of the virus, she was in a care home since her mobility was that fucked and she was struggling to do stuff on her own. WATCHING her slowly deteriorate in front of me was so tough and that it's almost a year since the whole thing started. 

I only got to see her once and that was hours before I got the phone call saying that she was on the way out. She wasn't in the best of ways then and was in and out of sleeping and couldn't get much from her

I am now alone, feeling like I am worthless, seeing people who can actually do shit, manage it and not have issues in the slightest, or pretend that it's nothing that can't be ""fixed"" alone in a place that we were meant to be together in and feeling like what is left for me.

I can do certain things on my own, but others are difficult to even get my head around. I am stuck between the place where my head thinks it should be and the reality that it's not all that it seems and I am not anywhere close to being capable of matching up.

News and all the other shit right now just make it feel like ""is it worth continuing?"" being worried about my own health and how much time I have left, what happens to everything I have now etc.

&amp;#x200B;

all, in reality, I can say is... ""fuck!"""

931,Brain fog and depersonalization from anxiety and depression?,"I abused drugs pretty early in my life, and I’m starting to become worried that my brain fog and dissociation is from my drug use. 

Is it possible that it’s from that, or just from bad anxiety and depression that developed when I quit using drugs."
932,Am I going insane or am I a normal teen(F15),"It’s so hard to explain this because I never said out loud and if I try to I convince myself it’s hormones and I’m overreacting. I’m also sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit to ask this...I just need help 

I feel different a lot some days I feel like I have different people in my head arguing and fighting and they would fight for control and I feel like an outsider or a shell and would become them. Like emotions sometimes I get so angry for no reason and scream and a minute later I would be on the brinks of tears of doubt and every insecurities pointed out to me. Or a wave or pure entitlement and me thinking I was ‘Better’ than others.

Sometimes for minutes or hours I feel nothing but bored and I would be an empty shell. I then would have sick dark and twisted fantasies of hurting and torturing and brutally killing people(including my loved ones,family,friends,strangers etc) and then I would laugh at it(not like a sick dark joke, but some what serious daydreams)and I would think of it as a daydream and I WOULD NEVER WANT TO HURT ANYONE!!

I than would feel disgusted with myself. 
My imagination is wild, I always been very creative but sometimes it’s weird. 
I have an imaginary friend Birdy she’s 5.5 feet tall and she’s wears a Greek toga and have short curly blue hair and huge blue parrot wings. She’s a bit gullible and naive but in a cute innocent child way. She’s been with me for a few months and it’s makes me happy with her and she’s calms me down. 

I also think of bad things too. I’m afraid of the dark because every where I look(in very dark places) I see monsters or claws or horrible creatures and I’m terrified because I know they aren’t real but they scare me and I feel like I’m being watched half the time! They don’t do anything, they watched me and i want to scream and cry! I feel like the thing under my bed or closet will drag me and hang me by my ankles and kill me. 

Some days I feel normal but those are getting rarer and I don’t know if this is normal and I’m overreacting or I’m insane. Anytime I mention this to my parents they say it’s “Hormones” (BTW they are wonderful and loving parents) 
I love to feel in control and some days I lack empathy and with my sick fantasy were cruel thoughts of eating humans too and dressing in their skin as they scream for mercy. I DONT WANT TO BE LIKE THIS, I know if I talk to anyone they won’t believe me or judge me for these sick thoughts and I font my family to think less of me....I feel like I will be very successful or a famous serial killer and I feel like there’s no lane in between it’s like a sides that I pick one and I’m afraid I will snap one day and hurt somebody(had to stop myself from hitting and cussing out another classmate because he was being arrogant in front of the whole class)....I feel so different and I feel like different people are in me control everything and I hate it............I’m sorry for sounding like I’m ranting but I’m trying to explain this and and I don’t know what to do anymore. I need advice, should I get help or she I try to wait it out?"
933,"Everytime I see something relating to especific mental illnesses, my whole body weakens.","Hi, I don't know where else to post this, but I think this is the right place as is somewhat related to mental health. If this isn't the right place please let me know and I'll delete the post. Also, sorry if I write something wrong, english is not my first language.

About a year ago or so, I started seeing videos about mental health, and some mental illnesses, and everytime someone discuses or even mentions they have an especific mental illness (DID, schizophrenia, BPD, etc.) I feel as if my body is weakened and it hurts. I can't even read about it because my body just rejects it.

Does somebody know if this is normal? or what causes it?"
934,i’ve been struggling.,"i have been struggling with depression, anxiety and possible schizophrenia which i need to get tested for, but my parents think i am making shit up for attention. don’t get me wrong, i know they love me, they just don’t care. they don’t know what i go through even when i try to tell them. it has gotten so bad to the point where i have contemplated suicide, attempted to get edibles from a friend (which i was caught but never ended up doing it), and thought about cutting myself off from everyone because i feel like a burden. i am moving to another state in 2 weeks. my parents said once we get there i am going to see a therapist because of the edibles thing, and i will take the liberty of telling my therapist everything. i just wanted to get the general concept of it off my chest, even though i know that others have more severe issues than me, and i apologize for my blind-sightedness to think this was a major issue. again, i just wanted to get it off my chest"
935,Zoloft and Ritalin is making me angry and aggressive and ruining my life .,"My psychiatrist decided to add Ritalin into the mix . I’ve been on Zoloft for over a year and don’t notice a thing honestly ... I’ve recently been deemed to have adult adhd at the age of 26 and was prescribed Ritalin . 

I’ve done research online and mixing Ritalin and Zoloft is apparently not a great combo ? 

I just had a blow up at work and it was uncontrollable. I think I will stop consuming the Ritalin asap ."
936,How do you know if meds are working??,"So I’ve been on meds for anxiety for about 6 months now. I hadn’t noticed a difference so I went up to the next dose a few months ago. I still am unsure if their is a difference, but am afraid to go off them. Does anyone else think meds might work but you personally can’t tell until you go off them?"
937,Cant?,"I want to check myself into a mental health facility to get help, honestly i just want to not exist anymore but i know that isnt normal. Im too pussy to kill myself.. so i know im just going to do everything i have to do like normal but what if i really just let go? Will i feel better if i roll my car in a ditch so no one else gets hurt? Or just step a little farther into the road so it might be an accident? I dont feel anything anymore. I dont even have the drive for sex ? And when i do have sex i just cry afterwards? What the fuck? I feel like i should just get it over with. What if my job fires me for checking myself in?"
938,"Why do I feel ""scared"" and ""shocked"" for no reason at all?","Its been weeks. My hands are almost always shivering, my heartbeat is fast,  I get those occasional heavy, rythmic heartbeats which you get when you're suddenly scared or when you see something really scary? There hasn't been any shocking or scary incidents in my life, and I'm not really phobic to anything. What I'm feeling is completely non-reasonal, except I've suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts months ago. Also, I can't focus on anything because I feel like my brain has stopped working. I feel like I can burst into crying easily. I wasn't like this before, initially it was unnoticeable but now it has become severe that my hands are shaking while I type this. Is this related to mental health? If so, then what is it?"
939,I just want to know what life is like without mental illnesses,"Idek. When you want to do something, do you just do it? What could I have done with my life if I had the self belief everyone else had? Do you really go through entire days, weeks, months, without thinking about how much you suck?"
940,I’m so tired,"I’m exhausted with having mental heath issues. I’ve had chronic depression and anxiety since I was 13. At this point it’s all I know. I’m 27 and I don’t know how to feel good. I’ve been medicated, I’m medicated now, I was feeling okay for a while, but the past few weeks have been a massive crash. 

I don’t know if I’ve been misdiagnosed, if maybe I’m suffering from something a little more extensive than chronic depression. I’ve tried therapy in the past, but my therapist died before I could make any real progress. This whole post is probably all over the place because I’m not in my right mind. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m tired. I’m tired of being in and out of mental health facilities. I’m tired of feeling a little decent one day and then catapulting into darkness the next. I’m tired of wanting to die all the time. I’m just so tired of feeling like this."

944,What is this?,"I want there to be a afterlife of millions of different levels to achieve an almost seemingly infinite amount of time. I really want to experience this, I'm completely obsessed, and I've been training in this life to exel above everyone else in the next life. Is there a disorder, or mental problem with thinking like this?





I call it eternal boredom, and it has been my imaginary fantasy ever since childhood that i hope is real after death. So i will define eternal boredom now. And i ask this sub because it's about one of the things i believe can help me achieve eternal boredom in this known world.

Eternal boredom is something i hope that happens after death. It will be an after life mission that will last 1 billion years total, and will have like a million levels. Every level (mission) will be a certain amount of time long. And the missions can be anything, i will list a few examples that were in my favorite level list that i'd want to experience the most...

-Be courage the cowardly dog and do his mission by protecting his owners and be in constant fear all the time.

-Be sent to a specific area at night in a very cold place, i will have to go to the sea and catch things at night for a long long, while my cousins go out into the forest and seek for whatever the purpose of the mission is. And it will be very scary and mysterious. Then suffer and suffer until we complete it and will have breaks in restaurants.

-Walking to the stars. There will be a magical pathway were we can walk straight to the stars and every 100 miles there will be a magical restaurant and eat and will sleep and continue walking until i reach the stars.

-The workout one. I will have to workout for a very long time because everyday i will only gain 1 lb of strength, and the mission is to be able to lift the ocean. 

-The walking one. Will have to walk all the way to the mountains, and the mountains will turn into a ship that you will have to spend many many years studying it and learning how to operate it and stuff, and be sent out to space to do an impossible universal mission.

-The protect family one. This is were me and my family and my cousins and friends family will be all together in a lonely world of evil. Our mission would be to never walk out at night because there will be monsters, but we will have to walk out at night bit stay safe as possible in order to get supplies. And try to survive it until the mission ends. 

-This is similar to the one above. I will be in a camp with many other families, and we are just living in a boring world were nothing is happening, but something unimaginably great will happen and our mission goal is to wait for it too happen.

-Be in a cabin in the woods alone, constantly got to be looking out for the unknown danger that is coming after you, then kill it, and something will appear and you will have to head to it and find it

So yeah it can be anything like that and will be random. Like a dream except this will be a very long time time and will have purposes and it will be our mission to complete it.

What can i do in this physical living life in order to be more prepared and pass it all on to the eternal boredom after death?"
945,Should I continue therapy?,"My therapist and I have really started to question whether or not I should continue therapy. I’ve had six sessions so far and we haven’t started to act on any plans yet. She told me last session that I show signs of ASPD but I’m too young to be diagnosed. I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. 

I want to want to get better but I don’t want to get better. I almost feel like I just don’t want to put in the work and I know that nothing will happen if I don’t. 

I don’t know if I’m willing to accept help. I want to accept it but I don’t yet."
946,I really don't want to give up but feel like I should.,"I've tried to make myself feel better after constant bullying at school about my weight. I'm not obese, however other students have called me a fatass. It was this summer that I wanted to finally start working out, but after a huge storm, we had a catastrophic flood in our basement. I felt changed after scooping up water for hours on end, just for it to make little progress. With the flood, we lost a lot of the things that I loved, including our treadmill, which is what I wanted to use to lose weight. Because of this pandemic, I've just been sitting here doing nothing all day wanting to make myself feel better by exercising, but I always feel like it gets me nowhere. I've considered just ending it all, but we're still getting everything re-done in our basement, and I want to help my father with it. I don't know if I want to be like this anymore."
947,I think I need help,"So i’m 16 and i told my friend who i loves that i wanted to kill myself because of my political beliefs. She said that’s stupid, so i called her stupid and she has had a very troubled past so she’s not talking to me for a month. i’m an asshole. i cried my eyes out for the first time in years and went downstairs to try and cut myself. i couldn’t do it because it hurt. I feel like i need to go to a mental hospital."
948,Hour 38 with no sleep and going strong,I wanted to see how long I can go without sleep bf I’ve always wanted to know how it would feel. I took some of my meds (too much yesterday actually) to where I didn’t sleep all night and took them today to see how long I can keep this up. I’m maybe having an episode of something cuz I keep doing other self destructive things  and I’m very very very down these days. The last 38 hours I’ve eaten 5 pizza rolls and some tater tots. I have an essay due in two days I haven’t started but I spent literally. All. Day. On reddit. Probs a total of 14 hours and I’m not exaggerating. Idk how the time goes by so fast when I’m on here. I really have let reddit take too much control over me but I like to use it as an outlet it’s the only one thats ever helped me. Idk the sleep deprivation is catching up right about now though. Idk why I do these things to myself I know I have so much school to be doing.
949,What just happened to me?,"Please let me know if I'm posting this in the wrong place, I haven't really been a part of this sub but I have no idea what to do.

So for some background around two years ago I (20F) had 5 episodes, I guess you could call it. I'm not sure what to call it. 

It would usually start with my parents being extra hard on me for something small (my mom not liking what clothes I picked out, etc). Then I'd get so upset I'd start crying uncontrollably and would not let any of my family members get near me. I think my heart would speed up and I just had no control over myself. If I was in public I'd usually be able to find a restroom or something before it started. Once during an episode my dad kept pushing me so I just kept screaming at the top of my lungs but I don't really know why. 

Usually for the rest of the day I won't really be able to control my crying much, but that would be all. My parents never really talked about it after it was over, so I've just ignored it out of embarrassment.

I left home for college that year and only had one more episode the first weekend I came home. I think I've been fine since then. Then today I was watching this kids show on Netflix, Alexa and Katie, and one of the characters had a panic attack. And then I started crying uncontrollably again and I don't know why. It definitely wasn't as intense as those episodes a couple years ago, but the aftermath has pretty much been the same.

I don't really know why I'm writing this out here. I've looked up symptoms for panic attacks and I don't really see crying uncontrollably, which is my main thing. Do I just need to grow out of this? Can anyone give me any advice on how to control myself if it happens again? I've kind of been crying while writing this so sorry if this is kind of everywhere, I'll go through and edit this soon.

TLDR: I used to cry uncontrollably whenever my parents would be sucky and today a depiction of a panic attack brought me back to that state. I don't know what's wrong."

951,Everyone at my school sucks,
952,"Bullied by ""family""","My sister (30) has bullied me (F,25) all my life. Since we were children. She'd make fun of me, she'd make fun of the way I smile,talk,laugh, my body literally EVERYTHING. I never understood why she did what she did. When I grew up I had very less confidence, I thought whatever I'd do, I'd do it wrong. I was very shy and would think people are judging me or making fun of me. 
FINALLY I fell in love and he loved me for me. He loved my insecurities and made me realize I'm more than my insecurities, helped me gain confidence. I'm really thankful that I found him. 
My sister on the other hand STILL tries to put me down but can't because I know what I am. I love myself and nobody can put me down. But I think my sister is pure evil and a bitch, that's why at 30 she still comes after me."
953,Need support if possible ;) all my post never got answered,"So heres my little 2:32 am story

Been coping with anxiety panic attacks and depression since years, anxiety kicked me harder than a mike tyson punch in the last 6 months to the point where i couldnt go to school and all, recently been better life is “good” but i feel like i got an accumulation of bad things happening at the same time (was helping with cannabis for 3yrs but stopped due to full blown panic attacks, stopped working, got heartbroke and played for 1-1/2 year )

954,My mental health is declining rapidly,Hey reddit I recently joined reddit to talk about my life and of course you don't have to read it. Hi I'm Kaden I'm 14 years old and I've been depressed for over 3 years now. My mother moved away from me and only saw her on special occasions. Ever since then my mental health and will to live has disappeared. Now to the part where it gets more serious I've been having severe panic attacks and here is how they are : I basically feel like paranoid like something is going to kill me and I go into a state where I can't speak and i start to breathe faster and faster for about 20 minutes sometimes longer and during that period I can't do anything like I was watching a video and something funny happened and I didn't laugh even though in my head I thought it was super hilarious. So basically I feel like I'm paralyzed and can't do anything but pace around my room or wherever I am and also sometimes when the attack is too much I lay on my bed and go under the covers like someone is going to grab me. I thought I would share this with you redditors and I'm not looking for attention but I'm trying to seek help. If you made it this far thank you for reading it. Love you all. Thank you.
955,Help me Please reddit,"My parents recently found out that I smoke and I drank while going threw my phone and tbh I don't really doing type of stuff I really just to really fit in with a group of people because I don't like who I am, I act like a different person when I'm around them. My family have been looking and treating me different and my parents and siblings will shove it in my face what I did and start saying all this stuff how much better and how they compare him to me and it hurts alot just being treated like a outsider and disappointment. At points I thought of self harm but I don't know how to tell what wrong with me  and the reason I those things, I don't know how to tell how I'm unhappy who I am.                     

Please reddit tell me what mental issue I have or wrong with me and how I should I discuss this issue with my parents."
956,I'm destroying my life and I don't think I care,"I'm sorry if the paragraph structure and sentence placement gets a bit random. This is all raw and I'm not sure how to express myself clearly.

I'm 19 now, and about to be 20. I'm outwardly a successful guy and on numerous occasions I've been told to be more thankful for all that I have. I'm in one of the best med schools of the country, a position which a lot of people might envy (Hence the ""being told to be more thankful part).

But I don't feel like I'm successful or important or that I even matter. Some days it feels like nothing matters at all. That there's no point to it all. I had plans for my life before I finished high school but now, 2 years later, it feels like I was stupid for making extensive plans for myself. The reason for that is I tend to freak out when anything in my plan(s) goes wrong, even slightly. I freaked out when I was first accepted into a slightly lower-ranked med school (Think Top 5) and I spent an entire year improving my entrance scores because I thought that if I didn't do this, it would ruin my life.

My time in med school started out good but quickly went to shit when I experienced excruciatingly painful migraines for almost 5 months, causing me to miss a lot of the academic year. 

It lead from headaches to apathy. I've now mostly secluded myself in my room. I rarely leave the house, have gained weight, and my only joy comes from watching and memorizing interesting facts on YouTube and the internet. In fact, I probably spend 12-14 hours a day on YouTube. I know this is wrong and somedays I wanna kick the crap out of myself, but I feel like I'm a slave to my impulses.

My finals have been postponed a few times due to Covid-19 but truth be told, I had no prep for them. I didn't feel dread as the date approached and I knew nothing. There was only this sense of resignation that ""Oh well. Guess I'll have to repeat the year"".

Even now, when this is like my 3rd chance to do something right, I don't feel the need to study. I know nothing. I don't have an urge to do anything. I was ambitious and I had goals but now it feels like nothing matters at all.

I turn 20 in a few months and I already feel like life has passed me by. I feel old, like I've lost the potential to do all the things I once dreamed of doing.

Can someone please tell me what's wrong with my ? I truly wanna be better, but I don't know how."
957,Unable to find a mental and physical health balance,"it  seems like my mind gives all those physical trouble (Gastritis, Stomach Cramps, Gas pain, IBS)  to my body to keep it off things like depression,i was sick and in pain for nearly 3-4 weeks, once my body recovered fully like 2 days ago, no pain, no discomfort, just physically healthy, depression and loneliness bear downed heavily, and i wasn't in a State to talk or do anything,

and this isn't a one time occurrence, it's been happening for 2-3 years or more now, i do have a mood disorder, either Bi-polar or BPD, but with an unhealthy situations like this, i cannot find any peace, 

&amp;#x200B;

anyone has any advice ?"
958,(tw: self-harm) falling apart,"So I hit a new fucking record and I swear to god each night it just feels more and more inevitable.  I'm tired of disappointing all the people trying to help me, I'm tired of disappointing myself.  It just feels like sooner rather than later I'm going to just fucking go for it and stop being a goddamn coward and actually try.  But in the meantime I guess I'm  just going to have to accept that I'm fucking vile."
959,Mental health vs physical health,"Alright, some of you guys may think this is a stupid question or common sense but I’ve been wondering this for a while. 

If you leave a disease or infection untreated it gets worse. Sometimes it could even potentially lead to death

Does mental health work the same way? If mental health issues are left untreated, will they get worse over time? Could they then cause suicide?"
960,Boyfriend developing Bulimia,"So this has been happening for about 3ish months. He will eat a lot of food, feel guilty, have long moments looking in the mirror, and then purge (by vomit). 
It doesn't happen everyday or every meal, but I would say it happens at least 5 times a week now. 
I'm really worried for his health. Lately he's been throwing up in his mouth all of a sudden. He's been having breathing problems and heart palpitations. 
I just want some advice on how to handle this.
I love him so much and have supported him through many things such as his past self harming and his bipolar episodes. 
But this is something new for me and I don't know what the right thing to do is. 
I want him to know that I will always be by his side no matter what and I will help him. But if he hasn't reached out for help what should I do? 
I cook all his meals so I know that there are days he barely eats and then other days when he eats a lot and purges. He's not near being under weight or anorexic, but I still worry about him.
Any advice?"
961,Took the day off work but feel super guilty,"I took the day off work today as I was starting to burn out emotionally and physically. However, I spent the whole day feeling guilty and ashamed that I couldn’t cut it today. I’m a teacher and so I feel like I’ve also let my students down. I have depression and also have PTSD from my child dying last year. A lot of anxiety around taking the day off comes from the fact that my previous boss bullied me and portrayed me as weak for taking time off for my child dying and subsequent poor emotional health. 

So now, rather than feeling better and prepared for work tomorrow, I feel more drained and tired. How the hell do I progress with this?"
962,Marriage Ending,"Its midnight now and I could really use someone to talk to. Not necessarily about my problems, I've pretty much talked it over with the small support network I do have. To summarize, I've essentially been gas lit and isolated in another state. I thought I wanted it at the time and I think I even thought that moving and trying to be the person she wants me to be.  

I've had about 6 hours of sleep for the past 2 nights combined, and I'm not tired or hungry again today and someone to talk with right now would really help me stay out of my head."
963,Night Anxiety,"Now, I don't know if this is instinct or a real issue with me. (17M)I suffer with anxiety but I manage to push through it fine most of the time and I feel laid back and normal, it really isn't that bad I think only certain things cause those spikes in anxiety. However, over the course of years I've noticed a very strange behavior by me. I check things over and over and over. For example, one time my cat got in the fridge, don't ask, I got him out and he is fine. Now a year later, I open it and grab whatever and close it even with my cat in sight but I HAVE to reopen it to check. I may do it once or if I don't see my cat, twice. That was it for a while, it never got to the point where it seemed like a problem but now I definitively picked up something.
Every night, when I go to bed at 2, maybe 3 am. I go check the doors, once the front, once back, once front, once back. Then I check the other rooms and go on my way upstairs, then CHECK the stairs twice more then get to my bed and get this heavy feeling that I have to check again. Same everything until I force myself to stop. I also do this thing where I move object that are out of place because I think it may harm someone in the worst possible way like a cat toy on a stair. But that happens rarely.
This only happens at night, I could careless about over checking during the day.
I'm curious to what you guys may think, it isn't life changing but still is annoying at times."
964,Pain while walking up,"I've got this for a long time already but it gets worse every day so I thought I just ask if anyone knows what it is. Every morning I wake up I suddenly have this massive pain inside of me, like I ate a black hole that's completely tearing me apart. My whole body is tense and stiff, but I make quick movements, like a fish on land. I often smash my head from one side of the pillow to the other one. And I feel like screaming the whole time but if I try to scream I only make some high pitch noises, some squeaking or stuff. I make similar noises if I try to repress the screams.
I can't control any of this. I just lie there for 10 to 20 minutes having some kind of attack every morning and I really would like it to stop. Does anyone else have experience with this and maybe know what to do against that?"
965,"I lost a friend, and it makes me think that I was just never meant to have friends to begin with.","Sorry for it being really depressing. But today I lost a friend. Our friendship was never meant to be continued and yet here I am. 

The last time it happened I understood why it happened, but this time I didn’t get the reason. It felt as if I’m the one at fault. I didn’t change. 
For me the whole time I thought I was trying to do right, but in the end it was just torn again.

But this time it hurt more because it felt as if everything that I’ve done was just... meaningless? What hurt me the most was to be told that the friendship was more labour than a support system. I thought I supported them when they were down, and I was trying my best to be the one for them. 

I over analyze and this is just a short and not so great paragraph, but it’s making me think how I was just never meant to have friends. As in... I’ve always been in toxic friendships my whole time to the point where, now I’ve become the toxic friend that nobody deserves to be with. And now I really hate myself for it. 

It bothers me now, but in the future I’ll just forget this..."
966,(23 M) Am I weird for missing my dad who left me when I was 4 yrs old?,"I never knew the reason why he left but I'm only filled with memories of then that made me so happy with being with him. Never asked my mom why because I just didnt want the burden of that thought to be on her. But I guess it's been something I've been wondering my whole life. My mom remarried a few years later and I dont hate my stepdad at all but I've never seen him as my dad. Even after all these years I still feel weird when I say the word ""dad"" to him. Idk where I'm going with this but this is all I wanted to express."
967,I'm not sure what's happening to me and I'm terrified,"So around a month or so ago I had an anaphylactic reaction and needed to be taken to the hospital. After that happened, I constantly feel like I can't breathe or that I am going to pass out (or I feel like at any moment I'll go back into anaphylaxis). At this point, I'm terrified of going outside or eating foods that cause common allergies (for example, peanuts even though I have no history of ever being allergic to nuts). Even the thought of going outside or eating certain foods makes me feel extremely anxious to a point where I have a panic attack. I don't know why I still feel this way. I can't eat, sleep, or do anything properly without thinking back to the incident. It just seems like everything is connected to it now. I don't know, I'm very confused and I'm not sure how to approach this. Even talking about it makes me extremely anxious and makes me feel like I can't breathe. I don't know what to do, I'm terrified that this will last forever."
968,I feel like I need help but I dont want to speak to therapists,"I know.. this probably doesn't make sense to you but I just can't bring myself to getting help from the professional.

It feels so unnatural to pay someone to talk to just so they can write notes in another file. 

The problem is that I have insomnia and again suicidal thoughts are coming back and I think specific medicine would help. I've tried sleeping pills, meditation, I'm running every day and I'm trying to eat healthy every day and even alcohol. 

Also its affecting my relationship. My partner is going through tough times and I'm trying to help as much as I can without bothering her with my problems but last night I snapped when they told me that I don't know how it feels to be suicidal. 

I really don't know how to feel and  I'm trying to hide it from everybody but it's getting out of control now. 

Maybe someone could recommend some ideas how to fight this."
969,Does anyone else ever feel drained from putting in work into mental health?,"For the past few months, I was on a nonstop grind in improving my mental health - going to therapy, talking to friends, reading books, listening to podcasts, I did it all. I was really excited, maybe even dare I say enjoying the process. But then, I wasn't. Especially during the past couple days due to some issues that came up in my personal life that tested me, I felt exhausted every time I touched anything related to mental health, even my therapy notes. I'm tuning everything out or I'm consuming everything on autopilot. I think I'm reaching burn out..how can I continue to work on myself sustainably when it's a lifelong process?"
970,REPOST: [Academic Research] Eating disorder participants wanted! (optional entry into £100 prize raffle upon completion),"Hello, I am a master's student at the University of Hull, UK.

I am hoping to recruit participants to take part in my online study. The study is trying to find out how different temporary mindsets (called 'schema modes') link with wellbeing. Previous studies have found that people with eating disorders may experience more unhelpful mindsets than usual. Also, that 'Schema Therapy', which deals with these mindsets, could be useful for helping this group of people. The results of this study will be important to support the assessment of the schema modes of people with eating disorders, which could then help Schema Therapy to treat eating disorders.

To be eligible to take part, you must be 18+ and have had an eating disorder diagnosis.

Please follow the link to the survey for the full details. [https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/edschemamodesandwellbeing](https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/edschemamodesandwellbeing)

971,It’s harder to project your feelings as a male,"I just feel like men don’t get enough help as they should. We’re always told to toughen up and to never cry, yet why do I feel like crying is just what you need to let out all the overwhelming emotions inside. I never thought I’d be this fucked up but I sure am going to look for a therapist today"
972,How do I cope with my boyfriend not replying for hours?,"[P.S. long distance relationship] 

Its quite a habit of mine to text my boyfriend many times when he's not replying for more than a couple of hours or goes somewhere without leaving a message. I'm a very anxious person and have a bad fear of abandonment, and in situations like these I'm inclined to send a lot LOT of messages, expressing my anxiety and at the same time there's so much bad stuff that are going through my head..

In my previous posts I have mentioned how badly dependent I am on my boyfriend 

so this should give someone the explanation as to why and how I literally can't do anything to feel better or distract myself. I really wish I could cope."
973,I ruin everything. I deserve to be lonely.,"I know this sounds horrible, but thats just how I feel. I spent a week without internet to clear my head and calm down. It didn't work. I had a few panic attacks due to some awful flashbacks from moments of my life. None of it was traumatizing for me at the time, but it's really hurting me now. I really want to be a good person, but I only ruin everything, sometimes its just by the thought of me. It sounds overdramatic, but its true.

Warning: Talk of suicide, cheating, death, and verbal fighting. Please don't read if it will trigger PTSD, depression, or other mental illnesses for you.

 When my mom was pregnant with me, my dad cheated and didnt leave until I was 2. As a baby, I would scream if my mom left me alone in the room with him. I ruined their relationship before I was born. After that, it was my grandparents. My mom told me that they didnt start fighting until after most of us grandkids were born. It started before the youngest cousin was born, and I'm the second youngest of 9. To top it all off, they only ever have huge fights if I'm around. My grandpa almost shot himself in front of me one time. I was only 8. Around that age, my mom got a new job to provide for us and my grandparents. She's been there for 10 years now. She's never been happy with her job and she still isn't. She won't get a good job because of me. I've tried to encourage her to get a better job, but she won't listen. I have never seen my mom truly happy before. Even though her and my grandma are mean to me sometimes, I still want them to be happy. They aren't because of me. I also ruined my dad's relationship with his wife and family. My dad and step mom fight a lot about me while I'm at their house, he never talks to his step dad, and he stopped talking to his brother (who was actually very protective of me for no reason). My cousins have never gotten along. Ive always tried to call them down and make them happy, even though they blamed me for things they did. They only ever got more mad at each other or me. We rarely talk to each other now, and it's almost never good. One of them even stopped showing up to family dinners and I miss her. I also ruined a dog's life. Ever since I came home from the hospital, my grandma's dog protected me. If somebody walked or drove by the house, she would stay with me and not let anybody near me until they were gone. As we got older, I started ignoring her. I always noticed something wrong with her, so I pushed her aside because I didnt think much of it. One day, she got cancer in her mouth and throat, so we had to put her down. I noticed something off with her breathing, but I never said anything when I should have. She could still be here if I had said something.

I had a lot of different friends growing up. Those were ruined easily. To this day, I still don't know why most of them ended. They just started avoiding me, never said why. This was elementary. With my former middle school friends, I know why they left. I don't want to explain that on here again though. I let people manipulate me and that ruined a lot of little things, which made one big thing. But the most hurtful thing I've done is ruin my boyfriend's life. He's my first boyfriend, but I thought he was the one for me and the one person I would never hurt or ruin. Thats all I've done though. I was so happy and in love that all I could think about and talk about was him. I always said too much though. He got mad at me a few times, but forgave me. Because of my big mouth though, I ruined his friendships and his reputation. We snuck around and met up a few times and I got cocky when it came to coming up with excuses for him once. He took the blame and now both his parents and mine no longer trust him, but it should be me they don't trust. To top it all off, ive made his mental health worse. I only had him and since I trusted him, I constantly talked to him if I needed help with my anxiety, panic attacks, and mental breakdowns. I made him suicidal and/or want to hurt himself a few times. Because of me needing help so much, he barely talks to me now and he doesnt feel like himself anymore. His parents might give him a therapist and its my fault. I should've never gotten into his life. I ruined it and I hate myself for it. I ruined him and our whole relationship. He says I didn't, but I know I did. I cant fix it or forgive myself. I told him I would find a therapist or something, but ive tried and I can't find one. Ive found ways of trying to ease my anxiety, but its only gotten worse.

I recently made a new friend on here and ive already messed up. I feel like I'm taking advantage of her and I'm pretty sure she's now single because of how often I messaged her during one week. All ive ever tried to do is make things better and make other people happy, but it never worked. The few times I cared about myself, people treated me as a monster. As bad as it is, I think its best for me to give up on having any kind of relationship with anybody. I think I need to permanently be alone. I can't ruin lives if I'm not in anybody's. As bad as it is, I think this might be the best solution. I honestly cant think of a better option."
974,A celebrity's suicide has triggered me like nothing has. Please hear me out.,"Few days ago, a prominent Bollywood (Indian) actor called Sushant Singh Rajput died of suicide at the age of 34 and this news has triggered me like nothing has in the longest time, partly because I was going through a tough time already. 
I can give a little bit of context about this actor, but it my concerns with this link are still universal and pertain to human behaviour in general. 

He was an actor who got into acting later in life, struggled a lot to get his breakthrough in Indian films, but was careful about whom he associated with and what kind of films he signed. He was quite underrated. 
He was supremely intelligent and a big time intellectual. Not something you'd normally see in the entertainment industry. He loved physics, poetry, art, philosophy. He was way ahead of his contemporaries in terms of the understanding of life and nature he had. A Cambridge scholar even went on to call him a genius and mistook him to be a scholar. 

He died on the 14th this month. Every day since then, there are so many people talking about how brilliant and intelligent he was, and to a great extent, I feel so guilty to have not taken him as seriously. I knew he was good, but I didn't place him right at the top of public figures I admired the most.

 I am watching his interviews and songs over and over again and tearing up every single time. (Indian movies and actors become popular over their songs and dance routines in the movie.)

We all have our share of misery to deal with, but what's been making it particularly difficult for me is that when someone this intelligent and self aware couldn't find hope, what makes me and my problems any different?

It's the same case for other high profile suicides which have shocked us the same way. This one was particularly a trigger because of timing. 

This guy even had a bit of a monologue in his last movie in which he said suicide wasn't the answer. 

When you are trying to recover or heal in any manner, you are suggested to go back to the things you enjoy doing and even find new things which can make you feel better. 
So when such high profile figures have the resources to seek help and make these small amends, how is it that they still don't find hope to live for those reasons? 

Please note that I am not trivializing or advocating a misconception that wealthy people have no reason to be depressed. I am just saying that it can help in acting as the smallest bit of hope where you have some liberty over these small amends you can incorporate in your life. 

So to be more specific, it's two concerns which are overwhelming me  - 

- How can I be hopeful about getting better or learning how to deal with stuff when such brilliant and successful people couldn't? Even take Chester Bennington's suicide for instance.

- How does anyone defend saying ""Go back to the things you love/ find what makes you happy"" as a step to recovery, when these things didn't even matter to those who had various interests and resources, but still couldn't live for those reasons? 

Thanks a lot for hearing me out if you've come this far. I would love to read various opinions on this."

**Feeling empty, sad, helpless? study the signs, symptoms, and causes of female depression—and what you’ll do to recover.**  


**Understanding depression in women**

Depression can impact every area of a woman’s life—including your physical health, social life, relationships, career, and sense of self-worth—and is complicated by factors like reproductive hormones, social pressures, and therefore the unique female response to worry. However, it’s important to understand that you’re not alone. Women are about twice as likely as men to suffer from depression but depression is treatable and there are many belongings you can do to form yourself feel better.  


Of course, the Catch-22 of depression is that feeling better requires action but taking action when you’re depressed is difficult. However, while you’ll not have much energy, you almost certainly have enough to require a brief walk around the block or devour the phone to call a beloved, for example—and which will be an excellent start to boosting your mood and improving your outlook. It’s important to also study the factors that cause depression in women so you’ll tackle the condition head-on, treat your depression most effectively, and help prevent it from returning. what do you do when you are depressed?

979,"Life events made my anxiety and worry return really bad, and I need help overcoming this.","Hello all,

I am currently in a really hard place, and I really need some advice on what to do and tips coping, because I cannot seem to deal and fix this on myself.

First of all, I have a history with anxiety. A long time ago, I had a bad trip which spiraled me into an anxiety disorder. I ultimately overcame this with CBT, EMDR and also medication (30mg Citalopram). After my treatment, I was almost anxiety free for over almost 2 years (of which 1 year without medication).

Several months ago (5 or so), I got really stressed up in life since I had a lot of things going on. I had an important job change, my father was sick (and the doctors did not know what was the issue) and I really started to like someone (which was a long time ago, and I kinda screwed my last relation due to my earlier anxiety issues).

I started worrying really, really bad and got anxiety which I cannot remember ever to be so bad. I could not eat for several days, was in constant fear and was really afraid this would be the end of me. Somehow I kinda got over it, with ups and downs, and continued my life. I also started liking this girl more and more, and eventually really fell in love with her.

Four weeks ago, I was talking with this girl (now my girlfriend) about our past sexual experiences. I asked her if she could come with penetration (this has not happened yet while having sex with me). Well this was the case with her ex-boyfriend, who apparently has a bigger size than me (for the record, I am average on this part and I know that). This would become a really strange trigger for me for my most intenste worry and anxiety period of my life, which is still going on.

Somehow this talk became a trigger for me to start worrying about our sex life ALL the time. I cannot stop thinking about her ex-boyfriend and the sex they have had. It made me really insecure, since I want to be perfect for her, and I want her to be happy with me. I wake up with worrying about our sex life, if I am good enough, comparing myself to her ex-boyfriend all the time, and this continues every day, often spiraling into severe anxiety and sadness.

The thing is, I know rationally that she is so happy with me. She think everything is perfect, our relation, our sex life, and that she has never enjoyed a person more than me. The thing is, I BELIEVE this and still worry about it all the time. I seriously worry about thinking that there is something wrong with me. I speak openly about this with her, talking about my insecurities, and this seems most of the time a temporary fix. I however want to make sure I deal with this on my own, since this should not be her problem.

I've really hit rock bottom. I am afraid this worry and anxiety will change into a depression, and ofcourse I fear the fact that she ultimately would leave me because I can't be there for her anymore with my problems. She has really reassured me we are battling this thing together, but still, it frightens me so much.

I have the feeling I am doing all I can, with no results. I regularly go running or lift weights (3/4 times per week), I have been meditating for some months and even started a mindfulness course last week, I eat healthy, do not drink very often anymore, I quitted smoking 11 weeks ago and even quit watching porn since I am with this girl. I also read books about mental health, worry and anxiety and try to journal my negative thoughts.

I am desperate for some help, and would like to thank anyone in advance for reading my story and replying. Thanks and love to you all."
980,I feel like I carry all the toxic traits I see on the internet,"I recently started addressing my mental health and have been looking up what toxic traits I might carry. But every toxic traits I read about, I start feeling that may be I have that and used it against people without realising. Is it normal or am I a little paranoid?"
981,Movies and Relapse,"I‘ve had a five year long battle with depression amongst other things, and I’d like to think I’ve conquered that demon. But recently, I’ve been having some problems. 

I’ve noticed movies that deal with stressful situations and heavy topics (like making sacrifices in order to keep others alive, dealing with the death of someone close, torture and criminal acts, etc.) make me feel very anxious and depressed.

My heart and mind race, and I feel like I just want to scream, cry, or hit something. It’s like I want to literally run from the movie. Is it possible for movies like this to cause an episode or relapse?

My girlfriend enjoys these types of movies for whatever reason, but I get pulled into it because I want her to enjoy herself, but I never have a good time."
982,Mothers on Hospice,"Mothers fallen into cirrhosis and terminal organ failure.  She fell swiftly over the last few weeks and in the last few days went terminal.  She seemed ok suddently was hospitalized.  I am unaware of her underlying situation with cirrhosis as she always told me xmshe was ok.  She had went jaundice and been to the ER about a month ago, cane home, deteriorated, now on hospice.  She's on a series of bags acting as her life support.  Seizing, delirious and on some cocktail of drugs.

At this stage as she gone yellow, having seizures and delirious, I would pacify her instead of watching her die over the course of organ failure.  Were left with some chance of rebound in her condition were she may come out of it and be on indeterminent hospice at home. 

I went through this with my Father as well 15 years ago.  The experience is no more or less traumatizing for either person, its some rough shit to experience.  The person suffering cirrhosis will lose control of their faculties and is typically delirious and all fluid and waste control goes out, leaving them quite a horrible issue to deal with.

At this stage I was kissing her goodbye and hit her with some cyanide.  


Its fucked up.  Over the course of my experiences my mind has been destroyed.

This is just some sick shit to see.

I stow my tumbler and remember the dangers of alcohol and recreational substance use.  Enjoy yourselves in moderation, educate yourselves and enjoy yourselves.

We dont all know everyone's problems or destructive substance use.  Apparently my Mother was on a mission, this was it.



Take care"
983,Clinging onto the last bit of strength I have,"So.. I don’t even know where to start. 
Lately I’ve (26F) just been feeling lifeless. Like I’m a worn out piece of furniture that everyone just kinda throws their clothes on top of.. that’s a really bad description but 😣 
I have recently have gotten married to my best friend and love of my life (21M) 
We moved into a better house, our daughter (f10) is doing well in school, I bought my first car, finally kinda adulting? 

But I’ve always had depression since high school. 
(Also suffer from anxiety) 
Each day I get up and force myself to do what I can, force myself to be a good mum and wife 
I try and organise the house but my Husband new who he was marrying lol.

My kid is smart, beautiful and such a sweet soul.. 
and so is my husband, he would kill to keep us happy and safe. 

I cannot for the life of me shake this empty feeling. I find myself drifting further and further away from myself and my family. 
I’m not happy, I’m angry all the time, I lose my temper, I just want to drift away and be done with it.. 
my Husband does everything he can to cheer me up. 
But I feel nothing. I have no feeling. I am just a shell. 
I just want to feel something. After so much abuse and trauma in my life you’d like I’d be happy. 
But I’m not. 
I’m on medication and it’s not doing anything. This is the 6th medicine I’ve tried and still nothing has worked. 

My husband get upset because when he leans in for a kiss I turn away, I can see how much I hurt him. 
I love him so much, I love every part of him but I feel nothing for anyone.. 

I have tried therapy but it doesn’t work. 
I wanted to book myself into somewhere for a bit but I’m scared they will take my daughter. 

I would kill for her and I’ve protected her my whole life, given her everything I can so she knows she can achieve anything 
I can’t lose her.. 

What do i do.. I’m scared I’m running out of options"
984,Don't know what to do,"Hello,
 
I believe I've been depressed nearly my entire 34 years but only started addressing it maybe 5 years ago.  It's been a rollercoaster every since.  Good days, bad days, and those days.  I struggle with sleep on the regular.  It seems every medication I take stops working within 6 months.  So here I am 4 months into venafaxaline(spell?) and I've already progressed to 150mg a day and I can already tell it's losing is effect.  Usually Summers are my recoup time from the down winter.  But between this year and last I'm noticing I'm not pulling out of my winter blues, my mental state continues to decline.

I decided to post here and not in depression because I'm wondering if there's more to it.  I've been seeing the same councilor for over a year and started seeing a psychiatrist sometime last year maybe to manage my medication.  We've discussed bipolar and multiple personalities but she doesn't seem to think I fit the bill.

So I'm here because I lost my shit last night in front of some friends.  Which was fine they understand I'm going thru things but they've never seen me mad, screaming, crying and spitting all my feelings out.  They assured me it was nothing, no worries.  But after they left and my wife and I started talking and I just kept spilling the things that are constantly going thru my head, including, telling my wife about the voice or whatever it is inside me that does all the destruction.  Weather it's telling me not to get out of bed, that I'm a fuck up failure, that my wife is constantly cheating on me, that I'll never make it anyway so why not just be done with it.

The thing is none of those are true, I have everything.  Great job, home, cars, money, retirement, and most importantly 2 little boys and a loving wife who is more worried about this than I am.

I thought this was just depression but as I laid on my garage floor sobbing several hours ago I was very much having an at least two way argument in my head about leaving the house to go kill myself.  No plan in mind, just a voice screaming at me to just get it over with while I cried out ""no I don't want to leave my boys"" to an empty garage 

I just don't know what to do.  I lost an uncle and a Co worker to depression in the same month last year and that was the closest I've been to feeling like I understood why they did it.  I was so low I even ende envied them.

I don't believe I'm ready to kill myself but I'm so tired of fighting that I'm terrified that day is right around the corner.

I know this is a mess and I'm sorry but if anyone has any word of wisdom I would love to hear it.  I don't know if I should be looking for a new Dr, clearing off of these fucking antidepressants for good, or if I need to just go lose my fucking mind in some psychedelics.

I'm just so tired and lost I don't know what to do."
985,I’ve relapsed pretty hard in my Self Harm and I don’t know what to do or how to stop.,"I’ve been struggling with intense anxiety and depression since I was 12, and part of that has been suicidal thoughts and self harm.

Another windfall of stress and fear and now I’m worse than I have been in years. I’m breaking into nightly panic attacks and fits where I will Punch myself (i just busted my lip not an hour ago), scratch myself, and bite myself leaving bite prints all up and down my arms and legs. 

I am absolutely terrified to let my significant other see me with a busted lip and bites and bruises. I’m literally shaking at the thought of what they are going to say and how they will think of me as weak and childish (comparisons they’ve made before). Each time I think about it it just makes me want to hurt myself more and I’m stuck in a loop I thought I got out of years ago.

990,PNES/ dissociative / conversion seizures - feeling hopeless and grateful for ANYONE who can contribute,"  

24F 166cm, 71kg, no smoking, medication : sertralin /zoloft 100, possibly fibromyalgia, seeking help with PNES seizures I've been having for 10 years and a bit. Sorry in advance that this will be rather long.

I am grateful for input, thoughts and suggestions from anyone, not just professionals.

possible TRIGGER WARNING

It started with dissociation in form of stupor during the traumatic situation which lasted for about half a year and consisted of several additional traumatic events in this time, despite the whole situation being traumatic as such. It was related to abuse. Even after the trauma was treated the seizures still stayed as an own thing as the mechanism kinda got too established in my brain over the years and gets triggered even without reason, a bit like a short circuit. I tried literally everything to get the trauma itself treated and also to get the seizures themselves under control. I've been in various hospitals, rehabs and mental institutions sometimes up to 6 months. I tried every kind of medication and therapy any of the many professionals i consulted could ever think of.

After fighting for it for eight years i had them under control well for two years. Back then i started holding them off longer and longer similar to if you try really hard to not fall asleep or faint , starting with just a few seconds to sit down so I don't fall and after holding them off for like 6 hours they would just disappear. With this it helps if i: - look at one point not allowing it to get blurry

· do slow and controlled eye movements from time to time

· do easy breathing focused on breathing out a lot, maybe with vocalization

· keep legs straight

After i got them under control a few times by just holding them off things changed a bit and after holding it off for 1,5-2 hours i would get into like an active fighting mode where i also tense up physically to fight it off quicker. I just felt when i reached that point cause I got like a pressure in my head, like itd burst similar to if you were upside down really long and a lot of blood flows into your head and that'd almost make me tense up automatically . I like to compare it to arm wrestling if you didn't allow the opponent to push you down for a while and you feel he is weakened and now it's your chance to push him down if you try really hard once more. This would take me about another hour or half. In this mode it helped me if I:

· squeeze or bite a pillow

· push hands against each other

· pull on a scarf or something tied to somewhere, for example the bed

· lean and push against a wall

· kneel on the bed and push down into the mattress or against the wall

For two years I've had them under control very well, they didn't come up so much anymore and if they did i could fight them off easier and easier. But since I moved out and started university ten months ago it got out of control again (even after I moved back in with my parents at the beginning of the year) and i can still hold them off for 1-2 hours but then they always come through. I have never gotten to that active fighting mode anymore. For a few months it's new that I don't only have one seizure but always get a few in a row. Sometimes these episodes last only a few mins with like 3 seizures, sometimes I may have 50 within 24 hours. At the moment a seizure mostly lasts up to twenty mins but can also be two hours or so. If i get a follow up seizure within an episode I can only hold these for a few seconds or up to ten minutes sometimes. Since these are harder I'm curious if id get to the active fighting quicker with these but didn't get it so far yet. I generally feel like something subconsciously is trying to run away from the active fight, not ready for the confrontation maybe. I can also imagine that despite i am originally diagnosed with dissociation due to the trauma the seizures more transformed into a psychosomatic conversion issue since it's not always related to trauma specific triggers anymore but they don't seem to be related to the stress level or such.

I feel quite hopeless now to the point where suicide comes into consideration again even if yet I decide against it. At times I would have given so much to gain that control I still have now but now that I know that full control has been possible what I can do now is just not enough anymore. I feel like all these years I fought for nothing and I'm kicked almost back to the start. I would be really grateful for any kind of input from anyone here cause I feel like I'm at a point where I might just need some fresh thoughts and ideas from rational point of view."
991,“finding family” in strangers idk,"idk really how to explain this but i have a habit of “finding family” in strangers. so basically i didn’t grow up with my dad at all and my grandpa was only a father figure for me til i was abt 4yo so i’ve lived with my mum and grandma but even then my mum was bedridden for a large chunk of my life and was in and out of hospital, along with that i didn’t have a good relationship with my grandma because she was a very angry person and i can’t deal with conflict very well. now with the context out of the way, my mum kinda tells me what my dad was like and i have seen pictures of him and stuff and i still remember what my grandpa looks like and because of that i will be out and about seeing people that look like or remind me of people in my family and i will feel a strong connection to them and get kinda upset thinking abt how disconnected i am from my family. is there a reason for this behaviour? or is this normal?"
992,"Hi, I need help.","So this might be a long post but I need to vent and maybe get some professional medical advice that I can't afford from a clinic.

Note: I have had anxiety since childhood so that may be the cause but I want to be sure."
994,Some advice,Recently one of the actors that I admired committed suicide. I wasn't so obsessed with him that I would think of him daily or frequently but I still liked him but now after he's no more I can't seem to get over it. Is this normal?

996,Why are friendships so hard?,"I just wanna vent. Sometimes friendships are literally the most taxing thing on my life. I literally find it hard to respond or have a conversation with them. Some others though, I get so attached that I’ll have literal breakdowns when they go missing for an hour. I have no idea what’s causing this. If anyone has any thoughts I would love to here them."
997,Anyone ever just wish there was someone that understood you?,"Even if not completely (I don't really know if it's even possible to 100% fully understand another person), do you ever just wish you had someone who understood you? Maybe they couldn't really do much to help you or offer much advice, but just the fact they understand what you're going through is enough to ease your pain/worries just a little.

I've had plenty of people who have been sympathetic and/or claim to understand me or what I'm going through, but it's never felt like they actually do, or they think they do but they're mistaking what I'm going through for something else, and/or try to relate it to their own experiences which are often a lot different from my own once you dig beyond the surface level. I do appreciate the sentiments, but it has often just made me feel all the more alone in my thoughts and feelings when the people that have often said they ""get"" me ironically seem to misunderstand me the most. I just kinda wish that just once, someone said they understood me, and it felt like they legitimately did."
998,Why do I like working with children but not adults?,Im 23f. Some adults hate kids but I'm the opposite. Of course I like some adults. Some are really great. But often times adult working environment can be so...toxic and full of backstabbing. its shocking how apparently adults can act worse and more childish than actual kids the only difference is they pretend more. There are just so much more expectations and gossiping and complicated mess. I worked with kids before and I'm dismayed to say I'm now dreading working with adults. What can I do?

1000,Words of encouragement to help with these crazy times from an ordinary jackass.,"I'm just a guy. Not a genius, not really that special. I played hockey in high school, and I'm in a fraternity in my small midwestern college. I'm like all of you really. So why do you give a shit what I have to say? Well, sometimes I find that words between the average guy without the mental health expert or the philosophy major can often help more than anything, for when you're just feeling wrong. 

I feel like these past few months many of us have been feeling ""wrong"" and who can really blame us? A global pandemic, the US in flames, global superpowers scaring the shit out of us all. Hell, last month, my best friend from high-school died from a drug overdose. Add a mess of stressful shit with my family and 2020 has been a total bust. 

And that's the bad news. Life can suck sometimes. Sometimes life will knock you on your ass and one of the most important things that I've found is that it's up to you how long you stay on the ground. Lie there for a minute, catch you breath, then get the fuck back up. There is absolutely nothing wrong with feeling sad, or depressed, or anxious. It's better to feel all that crap than to repress it. Don't let your negative emotions dictate your life. 

I may not know you, but considering the improbability of human life, I can pretty much guarantee that you are incredible. Don't let your depression and anxiety or anything else try to convince you that you are anything but spectacular. 

You deserve to live a fantastic life.  I said that the bad news is that life can suck some times, the good news is that I can name a hundred times that life has been pretty awesome. It's easy to dwell on pain. I'm here to tell you that when something bad happens, smile through it, and come out the stronger individual. And of course get help from your brothers and sisters if you need it. We're all humans. Let's make this shit happen."
1001,My dreams are haunting me.,(M22) I am dyslexic and thing been diffrent for me since childhood. Recently from almost a year some problems resurfaced. All fucked up and twisted dreams which involve me getting harmed actually cause pains in real life after I wake up. I had both my pinky nail uprooted. I feel glass in my legs. I can also feel stab wounds on my back. Pains from  injections ( all relating to dreams) after all this in scared to sleep and lost my appetite. Is this okh? If not any suggestions?
1002,Does mental health have a voice?,"I'd like done opinions. I work in mental health services here in the UK and have come to the discovery that maybe there aren't enough mainstream platforms out there for people who suffer from or have suffered from mental health to make their voice heard in the context of helping others. There's lots of resources which are made from the health professionals perspective but I don't see much from the person with mental health side. 

No matter where you're from, how do you feel about this and do you feel like this could be better? 
Please give an opinion if you feel you can, whether you agree or disagree I'd like to see both sides.

(Fyi. this is not for a study. This is just something I've been pondering as a Healthcare Assistant)"
1003,I have so much pain. So much tramua. Just want to end this sh$t.,"Before I talk about my experiences as a child, I would like to disclaim that i come from a very African and extremely religious background.  My parents are both Nigerian immigrants, so they didn't exactly have a Western upbringing. I am only 15(as of me writing this) and i have a very complex relationship with my parents. 

To cut the long story short, I am the black sheep of my family. I am  perceived as the troublemaker and i am first one to be accused of something when something goes wrong.(e.g, if something gets broken) My parents think i am bad influence on my younger brother and i  should follow in the example  of my older brother.(But i have to act like the oldest brother anyway because my brother is very emotionally immature and may been on the spectrum) And i am not going lie; i can be very rebellious. My parents find  me to be the most outspoken out of my brothers and i question lot of things; including religion.(I will get onto that later) 

The person i have the most issues within the family is my mother. My dad wasn't home that often due to his long business trips, so most of my early childhood was spent with only my mum and my 2 brothers. My mum had a huge temper and would get riled up over the most trivial things. She was also extremly determined for us to do well in school, so she was extremely hard on us. Without my father around to ease her temper, she fully embraced a ""spare the rod, spare the child mentality"". 
She was the hardest on me especially, since i was somewhat mischievous when i was younger but some of the punishments she gave me still tramuatize me till this day.

Imagine being beaten for having bad handwriting instead being helped.
Imagine being teased and called names by your mother when you wet the bed.(""The Pee Master"")
Imagine  being told to stay and die while choking on a Dorito chip by your own mother at 9 years old.
Imagine being 7 or 8 years old and grabbed , pulled upside down and put my head near the toliet hole just for not understanding a maths homework and yelled at.("" Do it properly! Do It Properly!)
Imagine being chased out of your piano lesson because you lied about losing your music theory book, manipulated to come back to her (because i was smaller and faster than her, i was only 9); then dragged back into the building and thrown onto the stairs. Punched in the face twice, giving you a small bruise under the eye and bitten on the leg to stop you from escaping. The other students heard my screams.
Imagine being forced by your father to say I'm a Christian (even though im athiest) because im afraid that this 55 year old man is going to hit my 13 year old face; your mum then forcing you to read Bible verses.
Imagine barely escaping being stabbed and robbed by gang affiliates and your own mother instead of comforting you; said it was your fault , didn't care you got killed and said you were a bad influence on your younger brother. And then later on, ""apologising"" by saying, ""I have to be hard on you"".
Thanks a lot mum, you gave the best gifts a child could ever  have; mental scars and anger issues.

And that's only the half of it. I am also severely bullied at school but that's a different story. 

Now i am not ignoring the fact that my mother is human too and she has issues of her own. Her own mother died when she was 9 and her dad had 5 wives.(It was 60s/70s Nigeria, it was a different time) She often said that she had to grow up fast and look after her other siblings. Her younger brother(my uncle) got pancreatic cancer and slowly died in our house. 
But im not going to deny the fact that she especially, hurt me deeply. Sometimes at the back of my mind, i ponder at the idea that it was my fault why she treated me that way. Maybe i pestered her on the wrong day, or i behaved too badly and needed that discipline.

Was it abuse?"
1004,My interests no longer make me happy. What do I do?,"Four weeks ago I (14f) became very down. I was fine with quarantine for a couple months, and since I had nothing else to think about I would mostly be focused on writing (which I enjoyed). I had a story I'd been working on for a couple years and everything was going well, I absolutely loved it and all my characters, particularly one of them. Maybe I was obsessed, I don't know anymore. Near the end of May I started to doubt things. I doubted more and more about whether I really ever liked this story, whether it was good, whether character's names were good, whether their designs were good, so on and so forth. I do realise that when I write that out it sounds like hardly anything to be worried about, but this thing that used to bring me so much joy suddenly makes me sick to my stomach with worry and doubt and I blame everything that goes wrong on this. I'm not sure what to do. I feel hopeless and constantly upset, like I'm never going to be happy or get my interests back. In a way, it feels like someone's died and I just can't accept it.
I went to my mum and asked what to do, and she told me it was probably because I'd spent so long in my room on my own without doing any exercise. She's been a good comfort to me. It makes complete sense from the outside, but I just can't seem to accept that how I feel isn't my hobbies' fault. The thought of having to throw all these things I loved away and trying to get some new interests really scares me. I don't fare well with change, especially with things I'm attached to.
I'm always being pessimistic and putting down my hopes, more so than usual lately. I feel terrible. It feels like, even if I have to get rid of this story or these hobbies, I won't be able to remember them fondly. These characters have been my passion and my world for a long time and I wasn't prepared for it all to be so suddenly ripped away from me.
Does anyone have any advice on what I should do or tell myself? Can anyone tell me what's happened to me?
I live in the UK, if that information could be at all useful here."
1005,I am rapidly changing to the worse,"a month ago I was a happy 15 year old teenager doing what teenagers do and having fun all the time. Recently things have been changing, there is no reason for any of this to happen as my life is been the same like it was a month ago, the pandemic locdown didn't bother me except being bored more than usual but for the most part i was happy. Recently I am loosing interest in everything, I used to be really good at maths and can focus on things pretty well, now I cannot focus or learn new things like I used to and it's getting worse, I want to learn but my brain just freezes while I am thinking of a solution to a math problem or in similar situations, when this happens I and I just can't think anymore. I am losing interest in things i have been dreaming of since I was a kid and I just feel empty and shallow. I don't see myself being successful in life like I used to, I do not know if it's a normal things with people in my age but I have never experienced such thing. I have also been experiencing terrible short-term memory loss to the point where I forget things I just saw 10 seconds ago, I have not had a history with Mental Problems or anything close to that. I also excersise pretty regularly and have a good fit body, I have also noticed my speech is becoming more slurred but that just started recently and it is not too bad at the moment. I came here for answers and help, am I developing a mental disorder, is it just a bad month? or anything close to that? I would appreciate any help or advice, Cheers."
1006,Just wondering if this is some sort of condition? Putting a name to it will help me understand and not feel like I’m going crazy,"(F, 17) I constantly feel as though I am acting for an audience, mostly when I am alone. For the past few days my head has been racing with thoughts and scenarios telling me to act like I am “crazy”. I pace around, breath abnormally and look around wide eyed, my head telling me I must have a mental condition. But in reality I know that I am faking. I looked up symptoms of the most common type of mental disorders like anxiety, depression, bipolar , OCD and I don’t seem to have any of them. I thought that maybe I was seeking attention and just imagined 
scenarios where I would gain attention, but I am able to switch off and act “normal” in public. I am academically very intelligent, however I am very shy and awkward, especially around strangers. 
I am known to get easily irritated but as a teenager this could just be passed as being hormonal. I often have no motivation, especially during this lockdown period, and can sleep for 12 hours straight. 
In January I cut myself (not very deep) almost everyday for no real reason. My brain just told me to act as though I have a disorder, again perhaps for attention? 
As a kid my dad was in and out of mental hospitals and I would often come home to him self harming or banging his head against a wall. He hung himself when I was 11, but I remember forcing myself to cry because I felt unaffected. Could that be a possible trauma I’ve suppressed? 
If anyone has any advice or clue as to what I’m experiencing please let me know. I can’t think about anything else right now."
1007,Smile Problem very weird 20 years suffering,"I have a weird mental problem (from past 20 years, I am 40 year old now). I can't smile when someone is looking at me. So when someone tells me something good or success about them, then I can't smile. But I should give them a smile because I should be happy for them. And I look so weird and they think that I am sad because of their success. Should I commit suicide because of this problem is making my social life hell. I am falling behind in life in every area. I don't want to live, because this unique problem I can't even share with my friends."
1008,"Anxiety, depression and paranoid","I'm a healthy man at a very healthy weight, I exercise often but I can't shake this paranoid thoughts and it's catapult me into anxiety and then depression. This post is extremely personal and something I've always struggled with. It ruined relationships and best of times have affected in work as I work as a manager in a customer service environment. I don't know what to do and what natural remedies there are to reduce these thoughts."
1009,Suppressing Bisexuality Actively,"This might sound weird for most of you but I had a few same sex experiences but they are during my early puberty and later 2 incidents are during when i was feeling desperate for sex as i have low self esteem. I was a former addict that uses cocaine, ketamine, mdma, xanax, cannabis and alcohol. I went to rehab and everthing hit me hard. The doctor had prescribed me with anxiety and depression meds. with other additional meds that i dont know about I'm M(23). Brown Asian family so they are now very strict with me cuz of my drug abuses. I feel like there's a mental block that's stopping me from having a good conversation and a good EQ and it's related to stigma of being called gay. I love women and I have some sex fantasy with some cute gay femboys and transgender. I dont like to be called gay or anything to do with gay. I think I'm heteroflexible. I dunno how to have a decent conversation anymore."
1010,I need some help (possible EHS??),"Okay so I’ve been frequently having what I think is sleep paralysis for about three or four years now. Nothing too strange, I’d just feel like I’m falling and I’d hear voices in my sleep or even hallucinate up a dead woman in front of me. But today it’s different.

Like usual, my head would fill up with something like static until it felt like my head was going to explode. I acknowledged it in my dreams a couple of times, how I was going to die because it is a scary experience. But today it was like eight times worse than usual. It hurt so much... I woke up and my jaw is in pain and my head hurts to touch from the outside. I get that this may be all just in my head, but I’ve had enough. 

I just want to know what it is. If anyone has any ideas then please let me know. Thank you"
1011,I might finally gonna ask for some help about my problems.,"Im mad ... So im afraid I might just be declared crazy or mad.. or unable to work and rely on government aids and that they will jack me up with pills..

To be clear I am not a danger to myself or others... 

I might even be asked to stay at a hospital for a few months.. who knows.... Or get anti psychotics or something... 

My frustration is in my mind. So I need to do the things that would make myseld feel happier... like always im just afraid to take the first step and move on... 

But Im all fucked up. I became a shut in in my moms house and have completely changed over the last 3 years. I was much better then.. Now I can't handle shit.  ..

Just venting out..."
1012,Sigh.,"I’m at a loss as to what to do if anything about my mom, who has been getting on my nerves ever since Dad died a year ago and since I moved away six months ago. 

I’m anxious enough about my professional responsibilities, angry at how people handled my father’s death, and fatigued when she tries to “mom” me about anything relating to my daily life and to coming home for visiting. 

It’s not my job to take care of her emotions since she did not do this effectively for me as a child. At the same time, if I tell her this, she will deny she has ever done anything wrong since she met my physical needs."
1013,I really don't know the purpose of my life,"Hi, I'm turning 18 in 14 days. Where I'm from, people will see my age as ""just a kid"" or still immature. 
I've been suffering and hurting for many years and for as long I can remember. My parents got divorced a day before I turn 10. What a beautiful birthday gift right? :)
I have 1 older sister and 1 older brother. None of them are staying with me currently. I'm staying with my mom, so it's just the 2 of us.

When my parents just got divorce back then, they got joint custody which requires me to travel back and forth. When it was my moms turn, I would go to her house. And when it was my dad's turn, I would go to my aunts house coz he was too busy working. I rarely get to meet him on his days. At one point of time I gave up, I decided that I wanted to live with my mom for good. Because over at my mom's I would have company.

Funny thing was that while I chose to live with my mom because I didn't feel lonely, slowly things change. My brother moved. Followed by my sister after her marriage. She seems to have a happy life. A beautiful house and a loving husband. Me? I live with my mom and in this run down house. I start to feel lonely. So so lonely. My mom has truly changed. She no longer wants to work. I feel so angry towards her I feel bad for doing so but i just feel so mad at her. Why doesn't she wanna work? Things in the house are slowly spoiling. The lights in the house, the sockets. And we got no money to repair them. I haven't gotten the chance to work because where I'm from, when you're in school you basically spent more then half the day in school. She's always taking shit so lightly. 

And I feel that my mom in a way loves using guilt trip and playing the mom card. She would get so mad at the SLIGHTEST things. Then she would start slamming everything in the house &amp; give me the silent treatment. This has been going on for soooooo many years since I was young. This action of hers, I feel like it has affected me. Whenever I hear a loud sound my heart would race so fast and I get scared for awhile. Or when I see or hear someone doing something with excessive sounds, I would ask myself are they mad at me? Did I do something? My heart would beat so fast and theres a feeling in my chest I cant describe. My hands feels kinda weak and numb. I really dk how to explain but I just feel something in my palms.

I feel so empty guys I feel so so empty. I cant share anything with anyone not my family and not even friends. I do not have any true friends at all i have no best friend AT ALL not even one. Am i really that bad of a person that i have never gotten a true friend or even a partner once in my life. I hate my life so much oh my God, living with this empty and heavy feeling in my heart 

I just feel sad, I just have an outburst at times and every single thing comes crashing down, all the flashbacks comes back.

I over analyse everything, whenever someone raises their tone a little, i can feel my heart closing in I REALLY DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN i just have that feeling and sensation in my chest. 

I really dont know how I'm gonna go on with life. I dont see a purpose in my life at all."
1014,I have an idea,"it's a new type of restaurants : eating-spots

in eating-spots, food keeps changing, chefs also rotate

This is opposed to current restaurants

thanks to this rotation of food and chefs, eating-spots are way more powerful than restaurants

Along with that, there is an App

People vote for the food that will be cooked in the next days

Menu is influenced by the live input of the customers via an App"
1015,Supporting Mental Health,"Hello everybody! My name is Kristina - I would not like to share my own journey with wavering mental health yet, because I'm afraid I am not ready to do quite so. However, I wanted to inform everybody that you mustn't be petrified of seeking help - often, you will unearth a person or community that has the capabilities to assuage your circumstances rather than exacerbate them. Poor mental health often goes unheeded by many, for it can be regarded as just a ferret for attention or another trivial matter. However, our innate psyche is what defines our life - and it is not your fault if you miserably flounder in the realms of positive mentality. Everybody undergoes challenges that, to be wholly frank, seem almost unresolvable at times. I am here to help you forever. Please do not hesitate to shoot me a DM on Instagram or an email if you are ever in need of requisite assistance. My email is [kristi.nay@icloud.com](mailto:kristi.nay@icloud.com) and my Instagram is kristinanaydonova. Your voice will not be stymied - I will hear it and using my knowledge, I will do my best to help you because that is exactly what you deserve - a beautiful life with an acme of a flourishing frame of mind."
1016,"America sounds better than the UK [TW: suicide, SH]","I know American healthcare has a lot of issues but from what I've heard their mental health stuff is better. Like you can actually get admitted to a psych ward. There were so many times the past 8ish months that I wished I was somewhere safe where people could keep an eye on me and help me.

For context in december I attempted suicide and then was left without any support from the NHS until about April or may but that's only because I moved back to my parents house in a different town and contacted the local services when I arrived. 

During the months when I felt neglected by the mental health services I had been referred and multiple people (my GP and some crisis workers) chased my referral but still nothing happened. One morning (about 2am) I didn't feel safe by myself and didn't know where else to go so I took myself to hospital knowing it would be extremely triggering for my post traumatic stress (plus the fact that I didn't know if I could safely make it to hospital) I had to wait about 3 hours to be seen (so I was having high anxiety and panic attacks in the waiting room). Then I talked to a mental health person there and they decided I should call my GP in the morning (my GP wasn't open on fridays or weekends so I'd have to wait until monday) and they sent me home.

Then a couple weeks later I climbed on top of a bridge with the intentions of jumping off (if the height didn't kill me a train would hopefully finish me off) but, it sounds so stupid, the height scared me so I jumped back down and called 999. The woman told me I didn't need an ambulance and to go home and a doctor would call me back. Turns out an ambulance did come and basically the outcome of that was: lets call the mental health crisis number, long convo with them, call your GP. At this point I'm sure you can guess my GP was well aware of how unsafe and unstable I was but they couldn't do shit because they had already contacted the mental health services who apparently didn't want anything to do with me.

A couple weeks after that I took myself back to A&amp;E because I was worried about my self harm. I had a cut that was kind of gaping so they glued it together.

I know healthcare in America is expensive as fuck but I've heard it's so easy to be admitted to a psych ward. And I am jealous because for months I had to deal with all my shit on my own despite reaching out for help. I wanted them to take me somewhere safe but they wouldn't and so every day I struggled and I didn't see much hope of getting better."
1017,Is there someone who understands me. Please,"I feel like my thoughts are driving me crazy. It is never silent in my head (if so then I will fill it up). Because I am insecure with a good portion of self-loathing, my thoughts are extremely negative. Sometimes it seems like I have no control over it. Sometimes the thoughts are so absurd I dare not talk about them. I am really ashamed, I can not agree with those thoughts at all. I sometimes fail to have normal conversations because my thoughts are too present.

I avoid confrontation and criticism as much as possible. I immediately feel hurt and keep thinking about this for weeks, sometimes months. There is no way I can let it go. I no longer know who I really am. Working and learning have completely failed for 2 years. All my energy goes to the thoughts in my head and avoiding triggers which can give me panic attacks.

I also avoid social contacts as much as possible because I always have the urge to appear as normal as possible. It also seems as if I have no control over it. Sometimes I also have good days. Then I am much more confident with more energy, but fear often still prevails.

I really want to know what's going on with me. I can't even let go of that. ADD and depression have been diagnosed as a disorder in the past. I can agree with depression but not fully with ADD. It just feels like something else is going on. Sorry if that may sound very stupid.

Please is there someone who understands what I mean. I feel so alone in this. I feel like nobody in my circle understands what I mean. And otherwise I dare not say it honestly, 
sometimes it even seems like I have no choice.

Thank you for reading, I’m sorry if it was too confusing"
1018,My appointment got cancelled.,"I’ve been waiting for months to meet with a family doctor, to have a family doctor and hopefully get on anti depressants? Or something. It was for later this morning, they called and cancelled.

1020,PTSD from embarrassing moment and feeling gross about my body,"I accidentally left the door cracked open while masturbating and my roommate walked by. I didn’t realize the door wasn’t closed until I was leaving my room, but I’m sure she saw because she looked at me weirdly later and then kind of avoided me for the next few days. I have recurring intrusive thoughts about how she must have told her friends about it and what I must have looked like at the time. I relive it every day and have had insomnia for the past few months over it. I feel so gross about my body even when changing clothes and showering and just feel ashamed of myself. I guess this is PTSD? And whenever we talk, I ask myself how I could act normal and wholesome when she saw me like that. I know people say not to feel ashamed because everyone masturbates, but that doesn’t comfort me because in my situation, she has an image that’s probably burned in her mind. Please help me get past this. I thought time would heal but it’s been months and the memory and shame is as fresh as ever."
1021,THIS CONTAINS SOME TRIGGERING STUFF POSSIBLY. BE AWARE. I dont know what to do or how to keep my mental state stable due to someone else always being negative about everything,"So i don't even know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this post, however i need to get this off my chest. I apologies in advance if this isnt allowed or if this is the wrong subreddit  for this. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Someone i am very close to, who has been apart of my life since birth, has been bring me down lately.  Every time we have any conversation they turn it into a negative one, playing the victim, and bringing EVERYTHING down. For an example, this person and i were discussing about dogs, and somehow she turned it to her work problems and whats wrong in her life.... We were talking about cute dog memes on the internet.... She does this with EVERY convo i have with her; Even ones where i need support or help with something, but ultimantly in her mind her life is so much worse off than mine and i dont have a right to have bad things happen to me.........This person, ill call Lula, has always been manipulative. For the longest i would bend over backwards to make them happy... I might oughta mention this is my parent. I trusted them, i helped her so much. When i was 11 i lost my grandmother, or Lulas mother. There was family drama that happened resulting im Lula and the rest of her family from speaking. as an 11 year old, i endured my mothers pains and such due to i was kept at home for homeschooling; Not to mention Lula didnt have any friends. So i automatically became her therapist and friend and had to be both her child, friend, and therapist. I didn't mind helping her out, until it got out of hand. 7 years later and she still plays the victim card over the situation. She wont move on. When i was 15 i suggested that she go see an actual therapist; But she threw it back in my face i was just being a disrespectful child and that she wouldn't be there for me when i needed help cause i wasn't there for her... When God and i both know i helped more than a child should.  After this she had me right where she wanted me, and began using me as her therapist or marriage counselor with my dad. She would try to get me to turn against him to get her way.... My dad wasnt a saint either, but he was a drunk and an asshole.  Might i mention too i wasn't allowed to go anywhere without them, i didnt have friends myself, and i was stuck with her because she was my care taker. From all of this Now i struggle make friends, and when i have them i struggle to keep them cause im afraid to help with anything because i fear they will abuse me, use me, manipulate me, like she did. And they were the type of people that would get away with shit cause ""Theyre such nice people! theres no way theyre like that. your just being ungreatful. You dont know what you have"" Well yeah Karen you dont know what happens behind closed doors. This was a terrible set up into adult hood. Im 18 now and going into psychology, hoping i can understand it better and maybe teach myself things and reinforce that not everyone is like that.   I just want out of this.  I want to be able to talk to people without the convo turning dark or into a pity party. just at least one please. I pray to God i dont turn into that person myself. I hope i can stray away from it."

I am tired of this I bet money part of the reason I'm always sad and depresses us because I'm so lonely. My friends are all gone including my online freinds, I can't trust my brothers, and I don't even know if what I'm going through is realy that bad or not.

1026,"Need help! I have been dealing with paranoia, and anxiety. And I’m only now finding out how severe these symptoms are.","So I live in the Raleigh area in NC. I would like to get help ASAP. My mental issues have been affecting my relationship with my girlfriend. She has been completely supportive, but has been pushing that I get professional help. I have had what I’m thinking are mental breakdowns, and she’s had to pull me out of them. The problem is, I have no experience getting help, and don’t know where to start. I’m still somewhat dependent on my parents, as I can’t afford my own insurance. A major issue is, that my parents don’t believe in mental illness, they think if poor mental health is a result of not being close to Jesus (I’m a closet atheist) So I’m not sure that they’d be willing to help if something isn’t covered by insurance.  Basically I’m not sure what to do, or what kind of help is in my area?"

If you’re at a job you hate and are considering doing it too (and are in a position to do so financially) fucking quit!! It’s great."
1028,Could do with someone to talk to?,"Does anyone wanna chat out there problems?

 I'd really like to just chat with someone about whats going on with me and even help someone else if they'd like to chat.

I'm feeling very lonely and could do with a convo

Drop me a message in the chat if you feel like helping out"
1029,fascination with being hospitalized.,"Been a long time since I’ve been down this road. with a lot of free time at work, I’ve been in my own head again. I’ve been doing well for myself for months now but the occasional episode is normal. I would not consider myself depressed, but I’m susceptible to being that way.

anyways, I used to hurt myself. I just wanted that excuse to stop being responsible for everything. I always felt that I’d feel better in the hospital, that people would finally maybe understand that I’m not normal. I never went that far, certainly not as far as I wanted to go. even now that I’m better I still want to do it occasionally. does anyone have any tips I could use to cope with this? any words of wisdom from someone else who’s been here?"
1030,Placing my self worth in other people,"I feel like I keep placing my self worth in other people's opinion of me. More specifically with relationships. I've been with people but it's never turned into a relationship and I keep thinking that there's something wrong with me. Recently there was this guy I was interested in and we did things but he told me that he was seeing someone else and wanted to focus on her. It just makes me feel like I'm not worth it or worth anything at all.

The fact that I've never been in a relationship makes me feel worthless. And I know I'm only 19 and there's so much ways to go but at my age, our lives generally revolve around relationships and I can't help thinking otherwise. The fact he literally said ""I want to focus on her"" makes me feel so shit. So so shit and so undeserving of any kind of love at all. 

Don't get me wrong I have a solid group of friends, but that means nothing to me unless I have someone I can go to talk to or hold if I'm ever feeling low"
1031,Am I depressed or just lazy,"I haven't quite felt 'happy' per se for almost as long as I can remember. Nothing seems to be interesting or fun or with doing really. I seldom have the energy to engage in any meaningful activity and usually just drag along the day. This lethargy has caused me lag behind in class as well which just gives me worries and anxiety when I compare myself to classmates (college student). Yet I can't make myself to push harder to do any better from that fear. In do try and workout sometimes to try and more into shape in hopes of gaining some confidence though even there I can't stick to a routine and just fall of after a week or so of exercise, although I do get a bit of the adrenaline rush while working out. It is to the point that I care little about the opinions of peers and even parents , especially in the matters of personality and appearance and I care little about how I look or feel. I don't have many friends and seldom talk to people outside the house. 

I'm almost completely convinced by my parents that I truly am a lazy shitbag and that things would get significantly better if I try to improve my personality and work out, though I'm not extremely obese (5""11, 90-95 kg last I checked), but even so there is this nagging thought that the problem might be something else , because I can remember a time where I wasn't like this, when I was actually, genuinely happy and took an interest in basically everything I saw. 

Idk , maybe I'm just excusing my pathetic existence.

Edit : the fact that I'm locked in the house for the past 4 moths isn't exactly helpful either , I usually sleep late , get up late , get some of the house chores done and spend rest of the day on my phone, or sleeping again, or playing on my pc."
1032,Drugs have changed me. What can I do?,"For some background info, I developed a polysubstance use disorder when I was 14, which lead to several hospital trips, dangerous interactions, and benders on all sorts of drugs for several days/weeks in a row. Luckily I never got into heroin or meth though. I had some minor life events which played a role, though I feel that the drugs had a big impact on my personality, memory and brain chemistry. Overtime, I've developed clinical depression and my pre existing anxiety has worsened and made me hard to hang out with sometimes, because I can get awkward and draining to be around. I've lost some friends over it and it's been hard to make new ones. I used be confident with enough energy to get me through the day, so it's taken a while to accept these changes and I feel like my family is a bit disappointed in how I turned out. 

Anyways, I've got no clue what the future is going to look like and I'm hoping that I can get back to where I was through therapy and medication (though I haven't had much luck so far). Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you get better? I don't know if it's going to have lasting effects or if it's something which I can fix through meds and therapy. I'd appreciate any advice on how I can get back on my feet."
1033,I think my mental health is ruining my creative drive.,Hi so recently I started mood stabilizers and it was going good but I've lost all my creative drive. Before I was planning on becoming a seamstress and was constantly drawing and making new things. But I just can't. Everything I draw is bland and anything I try to make is just barely decent if even wearable. I know this is just depression but I just want my drive back. I don't even care about feeling alive but I just need to create things again. I can't stop my meds yet because I need to do some trauma processing but I know that when that's over I need to stop these meds and see if I can get my life back.
1034,Some mental health tips please,"Can y’all give some mental health tips to keep depression in check ? How do I not have serious breakdowns after every two days ?

Meds and therapy didn’t work so well. I was doing fine but sometimes it gets really really bad."
1035,[Tw: self-harm] i'm not used to having a roommate,"i own my room until recently, when my sib had to share my room bc we have a visitor. my sib and i had a huge drama earlier. i was really mad and my emotions are all over the place. this family was never healthy to be good for anyone's mental health to begin with.

when things really get tough for me to manage my emotions, i resort to harming myself. i punched the wall of the bathroom and my hand is now swelling but it's still not enough. i'm used to this because i used to be alone all the time and i just had to lock the door. but since i'm not alone in my room anymore, i have nowhere else to go. i cant go to the living room bc my parents are there. i cant go to the bathroom, bc i just used it and i'm left with no excuse. but i have to cope, i have to do something. i have to be calm. what do i do? i have to cut myself. i just know that i have to. my sib doesnt want to get out of MY room. take note that we're still mad at each other. so okay, i thought to myself. fine, then. i'll just do it here. my room, my rule. i have to do it here, or else i dont know what will happen to me.  i dont want to cry bc she'll just laugh at me, i know. So I dont care anymore. 

so i did it. and my sib knows. i am calmer now, but i'm now labelled as manipulative. because my sib knows i'm clinically depressed and my sib thinks i'm harming myself to gain my sib's fucking sympathy, bc we just had a huge drama. and now it adds up to my anxiety. i know to myself that i'm not doing it to gain sympathy because why the fuck? my sib's a bitch whom i want to cut ties with. and now, i am doubting myself if i really am a manipulative bitch because i'm so preoccupied with my emotions and i dont know anymore. am i manipulative? were my feelings valid? were my actions valid? I dont know anymore.."

1037,Struggling and Alone and needing to vent,"I'm so embarrassed to even talk about this.  I'm sure I'll get nothing but critisim about how I should get over it and be a Mom.  I'm just lost.  Very, very lost.  

All of this is triggered by losing a few people recently due to a difference in political views.  People I never thought would be mean to me.  Women I admired and would look to for advice with motherhood.  How quick the tides turned once they found out I was conservative.  

I have ZERO friends now.  I've ran them all off because apparently I'm a psycho cunt.  I've always been there for others, Ive always been the one to answer the phone and hear other people out through hard times.  No one is there for me.  My Mom doesn't even care and never has.  She never wanted a daughter.   My Dad has always thought I was a disappointment.  

I'm afraid to get a job because I've hit this point of being scared of people because honestly everyone is mean to me.  I've been bullied and tormented since I was 5 years old.  First by adults then by their children.  College I was drunk, during all of it.  Wreckless and not caring about anyone or anything.  I got in fights, I thrived on drama.  Honestly that was the one time I fit in.  When I was a drunken mess.  

I don't drink anymore.  I take my medication.  I stay home.  Always home.  I clean and cook and care for my children but it never feels good enough.  I get questioned about my lack of fixed hair, my lack of makeup and worn out clothes.  (seriously whats the fucking point, I'm trash, trash isn't worth the effort)  

Years of being a punching bag has me here.  Angry, full of hate for everyone, and just wanting to die.  I'm ranting on here, which is probably inapproiate since I'm a 33 year old mother of two.  

\*grammer and spelling are horrid, whatever."

1039,Double Personality?? Help.,"I'm a 14 year old. My parents don't know I'm writing this right now. I think I might have DID or something related, but I'm not sure.

Basically everyday at school, I act like a different person. I'm younger, have a more high pitched voice,and get excited or cry more easily. I hate it. But the thing is, I feel like I'm pretending, but have no choice. I remember everything that happens at school, and have no amnesia. I am quite introverted. I sometimes dissociate, but not specifically at school. I feel like everything is a dream, nothing exists. This happens only rarely, and is sometimes caused by the thing written below.

I do suffer from a severe phobia of needles, to the point that I'm dizzy writing this sentence. I have suffered seizures sometimes due to the phobia. I don't think it's related, but I thought I'd mention it.

I never thought much of my personality change, until I read a book called Words of Radiance, where a character called Shallan Davar develops different identites to disguise herself? Forget her abusive past? Idk. Thing is, her disorder starts pretty much exactly the same as me currently, even though I have had a good childhood. And the way they think it's a serious problem in her, it's been bothering me for the past few months.

So I ask you all seriously. What do I do now? I don't want to tell my parents about it, they probably wont understand.."
1040,Advice for stress and anxiety caused from work,[deleted]
1041,I'm angry all the time about something.,"I didn't get admission in the university I wanted, don't have any job in hand and this is making me angry. I don't show it to anyone but in my head I'm yelling all the time, waste my whole day doing stupidity over internet and even that make me anxious and angry. I know I should focus on something productive but I lost hope, nothing feels right. Even writing this I'm criticising myself that I could put effort and become rather than ranting online. I know I have to change it but I wanted to say this, I don't know if this gonna help me or not. I will try to improve myself."
1042,"I reached out for help a month ago, here is everything that’s changed.","I’d describe myself as a ”functioning depressed person” under normal circumstances who occasionally gets bouts of severe depression where I don’t shower for days, struggle to brush teeth etc and depend on alcohol to cope. To put it bluntly, I’m always one bad day away from a huge breakdown. 

My mental health really took a turn for the worst about a month and a half ago when my internship went from being interesting to having much higher stakes thanks to covid-19. This led me to spiral into my worst depression in nearly a year. I had to take two weeks of work because I couldn’t do anything other than lie down and I felt like things were only getting worse. I’m sure you all know the feeling, being trapped, lack of will/ability to function. 

My internship was suffering, I felt like shit and I was going to have to go back to university in a couple months which was terrifying me to the point where J couldn’t see a way out. So I did something I should have done years ago - I got help. 

I contacted my university’s student services and got assessed for counselling really quickly. The waiting list for counselling was about a month, but luckily the mental health nurse who assessed me agreed to have weekly sessions until it started just to keep me going. She was honestly a god send. I learnt about coping skills for when I’m feeling suicidal, working out what triggers my “crisis” periods - where I feel my worst. I learnt to identify what emotions I’m feeling rather than just “bad” to help me react to them correctly and manage them better. After failing to contact my doctor for a week she called him for me and explained everything. I’ve now started antidepressants, and have weekly catch ups with him as well too to track my progress and symptoms. 

Next week I begin my more intense counselling to work through the underlying issues that cause my depression. I’m expecting it to be pretty gruelling, but I feel more equipped to deal with it now and I know it will be so worth it to not to have to “cope” constantly. 

Progress I have made: showering 6 days out of 7 this week, vs 2 times a week at the worst. Brushing my teeth at least every day now. Eating full meals three times a day, and no longer drinking vs getting drunk 3 - 4 times a week. Beginning to tidy my depression nest, but house work is still a bit too overwhelming. Ive also been honest with my internship about my mental state and they’re being very supportive. Self harm free for 6 days! I think the biggest progress has been feeling like things will get better even if they’re hard now. 

Medication (SSRI) has made me pretty nauseous and have a suppressed appetite which isn’t the worst side affect as I often comfort and binge eat when stressed.  I haven’t noticed much change in my mental state yet but I’ve been told I won’t for another couple weeks. Here’s to hoping that it works. 

I’d also like to appreciate how lucky I am. It’s pretty rare to be in a position where you can straight away get help and get it for free The only thing I paid for so far is £9 for my antidepressant prescription. I’m in the UK so for any fellow british students in similar positions - reach out now!! In summer university services are in less demand so can help you a lot more than normal. 

Good luck everyone, we can all make it. 

TLDR: I got help, have improved a little and want to die a bit less. Medication is making me lose weight so who knows, maybe I’ll come out of this looking hot too!"
1043,I just want to do nothing all day,"Work stresses me out way more than it should. I hate seeing most people. Most hobbies I can barely be bothered with. I have picked up on reading comics again but I read about 2 pages before I need a break again. I can’t concentrate on tv without getting distracted. I feel really lazy and unmotivated in life. I often moan about wanting to improve but Ioathe effort. I don’t feel like I have any resilience. Any sign of a potential problem I back down. I have got a gf and now we’re living together I feel like it’s causing friction. She likes to keep active whereas I’m very static in my movements. I work full time and after that I can’t be bothered with ANYTHING. I will go on reddit, listen to music and that’s about it. Anything else is very sporadic. I don’t know what’s up with me. I don’t dislike not doing anything either but I worry that I won’t get through life if I carry on this way"
1044,Sometimes I feel like I’m on the verge of freaking out cause I feel like this world isnt reality.,"I’m not an idiot. I know this is the real world but once a  month or couple weeks I’ll get this idea out of nowhere that this world isn’t real. I’m still sane when having these thoughts and I deny them but they get compounded a bit because I start feeling sick in my stomach and when I notice my sickness I think back to what causes it, keeping the loop going. It doesn’t last very long maybe 10 minutes but I’m just wondering is this the beginning of something worse to come? I don’t want to go crazy I’m so young and have too many dreams"
1045,My parents love my twin more than me/ is it messed up my dad has me give my twin money when he doesn’t,"My parents love my twin more than me/ is it messed up my dad has me give my twin money when he doesn’t



My parents love my twin more than me; is it messed up my parents have my giving money to my twin rn?



My parents love my twin more than me



It’s evident. 



Is it messed up for my Dad to push me into giving money to my brother to help him when he literally gives him nothing. 



Like my big bro mom and dad were on the phone because I was talking to them about how my twin was bullying and harassing me, saying the worst things he could to hurt me, because I didn’t want to give him money because I found out he’s been doing nothing except what he wants to do. 



Before this, he was throwing a fit I was giving him only $60 to go grocery shopping and he was being verbally abusive. My Dad said to put him on the phone so he can say it’s not okay and the conversation ended with me my Dad telling me to give him $100. ?
And then he spent more time yelling and screaming at me for giving him only $100 and not $200-$250 for groceries because I’m on unemployment.



After that, this is all taking place. My dad said “we need to put him on the phone so he knows it’s not open season on Ace.” For the first time in my entire life, my family was standing up for me against family. The entire time before this my Dad, then my big better convinced me of all the reasons why I shouldn’t give him money. He has texted my Mom I relationship was over because I wasn’t helping him. So they get him on the phone.



The conversation ended with everyone saying for me to give my twin more money. 



Yes, after I told them the horrible things he was saying. 



“It’s not open season on Ace?” It was too good to be true. 



I hung up because I was flabbergasted that no one wants to give him money but they are making me because “that’s what brothers do.” He spends money on drugs and partying. He has never paid rent consistently and he’s 23. When he stays with my Dad, he doesn’t have to pay rent; but since my mom is poor when I was with her I had to. My mom and him would drive to school together but she couldn’t even drop me off at the bus stop. My twin manipulates all situations to make me look crazy. If you couldn’t tell, I’m the black sheep of my family lol. 



I had to force my brother’s hand to give me a loan of $500 I set a payment plan to pay him back (which I have already) to help me graduate to pay to get my transcripts in since my Mother stole my money that I was gonna use to do it. He keeps bringing it up over my head as if he “gave” me this $500 from the kindness of his heart. He is literally Stingy from Lazytown. 



But also my question is is it messed up I’m giving him money and not my dad??



The other day he showed me he was working hard so I helped him with the car payment, which was the deal I was forced into after I said I didn’t want to give him money, you know, after they convinced me not to. He asked for MORE money and I did. $231.



Yesterday he asked me for more. I told him I couldn’t and he began saying the worst things including, “FUCK. you. And emphasis on the fuck because it comes from a really deep place. Now I see how siblings grow apart when they grow up.” And continuing to try to guilt trip me and when I told him that he went off some more. I’ve blocked him. My big brother also keeps calling me retarded periodically and verbally abusing me. 



My parents love my twin more than me and they’ve shown me that my entire life. He always gets his way with my brother and parents. It’s okay. I have my own family here in town now. Even though my Mom won’t leave.... literally manipulated me into living in the state she went to and then moved to my city. Anyway. 



Yeah. So my question is it fucked up about the money thing? Thanks.



Long story short: during this pandemic my twin has done nothing to help himself and no one wants to help him but my Dad keeps having me give him money even though he isn’t. 



My parents give my twin everything he wants even if I tell him he’s verbally abusing me because I’m telling him no. They’ve done this always. He’s an extreme manipulator always trying to have sex with my close female friends even tho I tell him it hurts me"
1046,Need help getting help.,"How would go about seeking professional help in USA? i'm new to all of this even though I've been struggling for a long time. I'm not sure if I should find a psychiatrist first or a therapist, any help would be appreciated. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post."
1047,What if I can't forgive them before they die? Right now it I am too angry to regret anything.,"I'm mid 30s and over the past 3 years have been having epiphanies about certain self-loathing/harming behaviours, tendencies, thought patterns of mine and how they occurred as a result of (largely unintentional and/or unwitting, maybe) emotional abuse and neglect as a child and adolescent. Since I am now seriously considering having a kid of my own, the idea has awaken me to the realities of how my parents brought me up and how their tendencies towards me set certain patterns in place in my mind. 

My parents are divorced, in their 70's and their health is starting to fail. My father is increasingly bigoted in his old age which is exacerbated by his equally bigoted and crass wife, he no longer speaks to me because she doesn't like me which is fine by me. I have recently stopped speaking to my mother after an explosive argument. I have been trying to hide these revelations from her because I see her as weak and unable/unwilling to handle any discussion over how she might have done something wrong (she will NEVER accept blame for anything, she will outright lie about something before apologizing for anything and then get insanely hysterical when you say she's lying). She is pathetic, wallowing in her depression and makes zero effort to make her life better. I spent the better part of a decade after they divorced trying to help her learn computer skills, find jobs, do anything. She resists or complains or comes up with excuses. She has no other family at this point, she's so miserable she just drinks herself to sleep whenever she's not working. Her being so alone is the only thing that makes me feel even slightly guilty and the only reason I think I've bothered with her these past years, even though that is her own damn fault. Suddenly pity isn't enough motivation to keep me in her life after I have started to realize what she did to my psyche all those years as a child and continues to try to do in my adulthood. She probably isn't even aware of it, and she vehemently denies everything, even denies things she said that my husband has witnessed. She is a gaslighter, an emotionally manipulative harpy. At this point, I assume she is half senile at 70 or at least her brain has somewhat wasted away from all the drinking. I have very little interest in bothering to resume relationship with her. For years now, every interaction with her drains me fully. There is zero benefit to me when interacting with her, since nothing positive (for me) ever comes of it, everything in her life always has been and always will be miserable and terrible and of course, not her fault. I am tired of being concerned for her, I have basically no respect for her anymore based on how she's decided to live her life after my parents divorced (right after I left the house, I mediated and spoke between them for years after despite repeatedly telling them I wasn't their lawyer). Now though, I don't even care about the divorce stuff. It's remembering how they spoke to me when I was little. It's remembering how they singled me out and made me feel alone, worthless and ugly. 

I am so angry. I am SO FUCKING ANGRY. It has been now at least 2 years of this kind of anger. I feel blinded by my anger sometimes when I think of them, literally cannot see things in front of me, just feel anger and hate that reaches my fingers and toes, I feel it through my whole body. I am angry at myself that it took me so long to see them for who they really are. I am angry at myself for blaming myself for their shitty behaviour. The last text I sent to my mother said ""Children don't learn to hate themselves from anyone but their parents."" As parents they should have known better and done better. They treated me like an outcast from the family and teased me for being ""strange"" and ""liberal"" (read: empathetic towards others - they are a most self-righteous and fairly bigoted type of people) since I was too young to understand, it started at least as early as 5, possibly earlier. Later, I was a self-harming and suicidal teen and they didn't push therapy or anything. They knew and they definitely had the means to pay so it was not a matter of affording therapy. Then my father sent me off to college with the promise of paying for it, which he didn't and apparently never planned to. I have been stuck with 40k of student loans for 10 years that I can't consistently pay, because I went under the assumption that he was going to keep his promise. A few years ago he cuts off my mom's alimony and since my brother refuses to help (he is also very comfortable financially, having had the classes he failed out of paid for and a job handed to him by dear ol dad), I am expected to pick up the slack and be the emotional and financial support for my mother. She now works at Walmart, hates it, and even though she got a better job elsewhere, she quit and went back to Walmart because she didn't want to learn a new POS system. I am disgusted by her lack of effort in everything. I hustle my ass off as an independent contractor in my field but haven't been able to maintain regular, stable work/clients so financially I don't really have interest in sacrificing my financial future so that I can pick up after her lack of effort and my parents' lack of planning for retirement. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TL;DR: Everyone tells me I will regret not forgiving my elderly parents when they die (probably soonish). I am so fucking angry, I don't know what forgiveness means or what it feels like or looks like. I feel so dumb and played for a fool that I didn't even realize until recently that all those negative aspects of myself, they came from how my parents treated me. I don't feel like it is worth the emotional hassle of bringing anything up, even if I could forgive them. They will never admit to having done or said anything wrong. It would only be met with defensive vitriol and more shit about how I am too emotional and more gaslighting BS. How can I move past this and maybe forgive them? I don't want to live with this burning anger forever, I certainly don't want to unwittingly project it onto my future children. I don't want to live with regret after they are gone, but is that even avoidable? What good can come of them knowing I am so full of anger and hate towards them? How does forgiveness even work?"

We only think that because famous people look good in that style and they are HAPPY when they wear it, we don't need to fit that style and do things do make others think we are nice or hot! 
You see if we fit in our own skin and love how we look we will stop caring when people say rude thing because we aren't so focused on making people think were pretty!

1050,trigger warning: self harm,Is it normal to think of ways to kill yourself or wishing you've killed yourself a long time ago?
1051,Worried about my potentially suicidal neighbor,"I live in a student complex and since a month now, I have a new neighbor. However, i've been hearing a lot of screaming from him. I figured that he games a lot, sometimes he seems to have people over and i just hear laughing, but i don't know if that's the same neighbor. But especially this week, the screaming is becoming concerning. 2 nights ago, i heard him yell for an entire hour at someone he was chatting online with. I could literally hear what he was saying. It was something like: 'why are you doing this to me' 'i just want you to fuck off' 'i can't take this anymore, i don't want to do this, i want to die'. Then he yelled something about his father, but i did not understand what it was. He uses curse words that my English translation wouldn't do justice, he stomps on the ground and i think i heard him throw something across the room.

Of course, i couldn't let this go and i sent an email to my student housing organization (because they are also supposed to solve conflicts between neighbors). I explained everything, but i got an email back treating it like a normal noise complaint, saying that they are going to sent him an email regarding the noise and that i should probably also try knocking on the door (not to offer him any help, but to complain). Now he's going to receive an email like: 'yeah your neighbor hears you raging, so just keep your mental problems for yourself will you ? k bye' and i feel pretty bad. Their response made me feel like i was overreacting, but i don't feel like i am. I guess i want to help, but this guy also sounds very aggressive. Last year, a female student in my city got stabbed to death by a mentally unstable guy who lived on the same floor as she did and i keep thinking about it.

She says she's already broken and unfixable, and she'd rather try to get better by herself. I don't think she actually has any intentions on doing anything. It seems more like a dismissal. At least from what she says she doesn't really have any strategy or will to change anything. This has been going on for a long time and I'm lost what to do. Nothing I say seems to be getting through. Today she told me that she self-harms (in the most scarily non-chalant half-sentence buried in a unrelated long story I've heard yet). And I reminded her of the talk we had a few months back. I talked about my experience with therapy, because I've had nothing but positive experiences with it. I thought that might make it easier for her to see that she doesn't have to be afraid or embarrassed or anything. But nothing changed. She ""accepted her fate"" whatever that's supposed to mean. She isn't responding well at all. She just seems to have given up. But that makes no sense. Why would she tell me all this stuff and not want it to change? She must at least want things to change for the better a little bit. What she says and how she acts don't match up and I have no idea what to do with these conflicting messages. On one hand she tells me about it and says how much she hates everything and wants it to change, but on the other hand she jokes about suicide and pretends not to be bothered (difficult to describe, but the way she talks about it is that she says some really bad things and then pretends like it's not a big deal, even thought both her and I know it's a big deal).  


I'm really worried that this will go badly. She's gonna break up with her boyfriend because she doesn't want him to notice her scars and this will probably end really badly for everyone. She's talking about suicide again. She also lives pretty far away so it's not like I can be physically be present anytime.   


I'm unsure how I can even help her anymore. I notice myself getting frustrated with her. I try not to show it but I'm just at a loss. It's not like I can force her or anything. But it pains me to see her like that. Have any of you had similar stories or got any advice to share?"
1053,Unrealistic thoughts constantly intruding my head,"Hi there, first time poster. Some backstory to start.
I have struggled with anxiety and depression since the 8th grade, I am now a freshman in college. To the point where In my junior year of high school I was sent to a therapeutic wilderness school for 3 months, and after that a residential treatment facility for 9 months. I have been out of the system for about a year and 5 months now. When I got out I felt like I had complete control of my head, and thoughts, and most emotions that I felt, the day I got out though I started abusing marijuana again, now I’m at a point where I use BHO daily and have for the past 6 months, and I almost feel like I am returning to the same state of mind that I was in before I got sent to treatment. For about a month now, I’ve been having violent mood swings, half the day I will be energetic and uplifted then as soon as I get off work it’s back to depression and intrusive thoughts. I’ve been having violent thoughts for the same amount of time, the weird thing is that I’m not a violent person, and often times the thoughts that come into my head are very far from something I’d actually do. I can reason with myself as to why these thoughts are outlandish, and that they are simply created by my head, but I can’t get rid of them, they keep coming back. How do I get myself to stop obsessing over these thoughts? It’s gotten to the point where I spend my entire day worrying about it. Please help"

I know there is nothing anyone can do to help me. I live in a for profit country where mental help is expensive and worthless, so there is no go for help. Nothing anyone has told me online has not helped. I can't escape hell, there is no escape from hell.

1055,I need help,"Hello reddit. 
Lately I've been feeling sad all the time(for 6 weeks now) I haven't really spoken to anyone in the time either and I thought about life and death a lot. 
I am more and more unhappy with myself and couldn't sleep because of it. I don't know what to do know. Please help me."
1056,"I've always been a really sad person, but I don't think I'm depressed. Is this normal?","TLDR: even as a child, I've always struggled to find happiness and I've always been empty. Is this normal?


Ive always struggled to find happiness.
Even from a young age,like age 5, I could always remember myself being someone that is sad all the time, and mostly for no reason at all.
I didn't understand it back then. I often felt very lost or like I didn't belong where I am, I always felt as if there was something missing in my life.
That being said, I don't think ive been clinically depressed. Im sad but not to the point where I'm unable to talk to others, isolate myself, unable to sleep, etc, it's just kind of always been this persistent feeling of emptiness.
With quarantine going on, it's given me a chance to sit and think to myself a lot more, which has only made everything way worse, and now Im struggling to get things done without my thoughts distracting me. It's often thoughts of despair/hopelessness etc.
Don't get me wrong, I have many things in life that I appreciate. I've always been surrounded by a very supportive and loving family, always had good friends growing up, could always afford food, clothes and shelter. I'm very grateful for it all and I want to give back to my parents one day. So its not like I have anything to be upset about.

I don't want to die. I'm not suicidal. Not anymore at least. I just feel very lost and have always felt lost. I am able to go through the day and feel fine, but once I'm alone, especially at night, I start thinking way too much and bring the sadness and fear upon myself. 

Maybe it's due to my anxiety? 
Age 13 was significantly hard for me. I started noticing that I often struggled with things my peers at school couldn't relate to. I thought it was a normal thing that everyone goes through in their teenage years. Even sucidial thoughts. Turns out that I was wrong. The school noticed and told my parents. I was taken to a doctor and I was diagnosed with two forms of anxiety, but it was all dealt with by seeing a counselor.I felt better afterwards, but I seem to find myself plummeting back to the same usual thoughts a while afterwards.
Im 17 now. 
Still, this feeling is one I'm very familiar with. Like I previously stated, even as a young child I've been sad all the time, so im not sure it is caused by my anxiety since that didn't really become a distraction until my teen years. Idk..I try to distract myself from them as much as possible. I do do things that make me feel better, such as seeing friends, reading, different hobbies, etc, but its there is a little demon that sits on my shoulder and tries to get me to decline again.

Is this a normal feeling that everyone experiences?"

1058,"Hypochondriac Here, Any Others?","So I've felt like I've been on the verge of dying every single week. It honestly sucks that ever since I had a panic attack this past April that I've been feeling down, slightly depressed, and super anxious and frightened all because I think I might have some really BAD illness or disease. Like today for example, I'm freaking out that I might have Type 2 diabetes because my hands get tingly, even tho I had a blood and urine test last month and it came out fine but my mind is like ""What if It was undetected?"" Or ""What if you didn't have it then but you have it now?"" It's those ""What ifs"" that make me go crazy and feel as if I need to go to the doctor every week. I also right now feel like not only I have Type 2 diabetes but I might also have throat problems, or cancer because I've been feeling pain and a lump in my throat, or that I ""feel"" as if i have a sore throat. I can go on a list of many illness and diseases I thought I had over the past couple of weeks and its affecting my daily life. I was usually the outgoing and chill person in the family but even my mom and the rest of my family have seen that I look more depressed, sad, and unmotivated to do things. I've stayed out of google and internet news because I realized how bad it is for someone like me to search up anything about symptoms online.

I just wanted to put this out there because I feel really down at the moment. and I also wanted to know if there are any current or noncurrent hypochondriacs that are or were dealing with this problem right now, and how they are handling this."

Apparently people who consume high fat but NOT high carb snacks before bed have improved sleep quality."
1060,Overly religious family and mental health.,"I have an extremely religious Mother who is quite closed minded and doesn't believe in mental illness. That's anything from depression, anxiety or any sort of psychiatric disorders. Having suffered from a few mental illnesses, living with a Mother that doesn't get it because she's stuck on religion is exhausting. I can't explain anything to her at all - she will blame the devil for making me think ""negative"" things about myself.
I want to sort out my mental health, but my Mother is discouraging me to do so. Discouraging me to go to hospital or take medication for my illnesses. Not that I am listening to her - I'm obviously not but it's really sad for her to think it's nothing more than some sort of spiritual attack.

The even saddest thing is that she's brainwashing my younger brothers into thinking that mental illnesses isn't really a thing and more so a curse from the devil. It's ridiculous.

Does anyone cope with mental health whilst dealing with an overly religious family?"

I also found several other spot in the driveway that had oil, that I son think were from my truck. The way I determined this is I went around with a bottle of water, and poured in on the gravel. The places with oil, I could see the oil swirling around in the puddle the water left behind. At first I was afraid of the oil contaminating the well, but now I'm afraid to go anywere, because then I'd have to walk through the driveway and get out on my shoes, then everywhere I go, I'll he tracking oil, and contaminating the environment."
1062,Considering trying anti-depressants-- any input?,"I've been depressed for most of my life. I can trace roots back to atleast fifth grade, started to get worse in high school, college, ramping up bascially, its gone through different phases, but fairly present throughout. My depression does not stem from any kind of trauma, its been a low simmering, high simmering experience that's pretty much always with me and is mostly characterized by lack of energy, lack of will power, self loathing, suicidal ideation etc. I'm am frustrated by my obvious dysfunction, inability to remember anything, to learn anything, life hardly feels worth living, life is only something to be watched, not something I can be *in* etc. My depression is certainly not manic, there are days when its more intense, occasionally I'll hit myself a little bit, recently I fasted for 10 days after decided that maybe I could kill myself by not eating, oddly its maybe the first time ever that I felt vital and able to focus. I wondered if it was how most people felt, I felt excited for life, I wondered if I was just gluten intolerant etc. I've been back on food (lol) for about a month now, (and haven't eaten gluten), and its obvious that all of that is a wash, sort of crushingly, just back to the same state of nothing nothing nothing. As I've gotten older the depression has gotten a bit uglier, I'm 29 now, and just incredibly tired of living with it. I've more or less agreed to stay in this state of 'waiting to die' because I don't want to traumatize the few people that might have their lives fucked by suicide. I've had long stints on adderall (probably on for 4-5 of the last ten years, I can't honestly remember, specifically) which has always had this wonderful ability to make me excited for life, able to connect with people, but also always eventually reduces to being unproductive and (sometimes more) depressive coupled with too many co-substances (weed cigarettes and alcohol) so I usually stop, seeing it as unsustainable, and deal with a shitty withdrawal that only in retrospect do I realize was a withdrawal. I'm sort of coming out of one of these.. haven't used it for about 45 days... I can't imagine being in my 40s on adderall, and basically I think adderall just makes me manic, but sometimes thats better than just being... nothing. But then I look back on long periods without it (years) and recognize that.. yeah I was still depressive and unlike on adderall, I actually didn't do Anything, no creativity, no excitement. I've gone through exercise phases, which kind of help, of course, but they don't solve anything else, my brain mostly, I want a vital brain, I want to feel alive. I'd love a fucking brain scan honestly, to try to confirm that there's some kind of intense atrophy that's gone on, over 10 years of so many days just laid out in bed, thinking about dying, etc. etc. etc. Confused why our medical system can't work like that. 

Anyways, I've always been afraid to try anti-depressants, I see them as this kind of last straw, a sort of admission that this depression will never lift, and a tangled web that I'll never be able to leave once I start, a goodbye to whatever 'self' is my 'self'. I'm incredibly mistrustful of most doctors and the DSM and taking a cursory look at the /anti-depressants subreddit kind of confirms this. Nevertheless---

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Are there people out there who felt that taking anti-depressants actually solved their problems, specifically I guess, SSRI's? Anyone who had symptoms like mine? (I.e. not manic, not responding to major life problems, or crippling anxieties) (I have spent a year on wellbutrin btw, didn't really do anything, other than maybe, in retrospect, make me incredibly asexual, but I'd been calling myself essentially asexual for most of my mid twenties...)\*\*

Are there people who wish they had never started in with anti-depressants?

Can I try them and them stop them? Or will I be like, irrevocably altered by them? 

I hate the idea of having worse sex, of being unable to socialize by drinking etc, but honestly, if I could feel vibrant, and happy, and productive, and normal... I would? Do people actually feel that way, am I just spoiled and weak and other people just wear their burden without giving up all the time?

\*\*Have any of you actually got out of a long term depression, or known someone who has? (anti-depressants or not)\*\* Is that possible ? Or do we all just essentially decide to 'wait to die' instead of cutting it short.. 

This is probably too long for anyone to read, and maybe gets asked all the time, but I wanted to throw it out there... thanks for reading through this."
1063,I'm in desperate need of help for my bipolar grandmother,"My grandmother, 65, was diagnosed as Bipolar at a young age. 

We are use to her manic episodes. Sometimes they result in her going to the mental ward so they can stabilize her and get her back on her meds. This recent episode has gone on for months. It seems like she hasn't recovered or has only partially recovered from the last ward visit. She does an okay job at pretending she's okay in front of doctors. I think she has developed other behavioral issues. We need help. My family is stressed. My grandmother won't stay at home and is getting into all kinds of trouble.

She won't listen to reason and it's stressing me out because my mom, her daughter, doesn't want to help. It's like my mom doesn't understand that her mom has a mental issue. My mom is just like, ""she needs to stop this BS."" My mom is also exhibiting symptoms of a personality disorder. 

Guess it runs in the family and I'm next. It would be a little better if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic. But with this quarantine and other things going on in my life, I feel like my mental health is deteriorating. 

**I'm seeking advice on what I can do about my grandmother. We are in Houston, Texas.**

&amp;#x200B;

More info if you care to know:

Since April, my grandmother has been in and out of jail, the mental ward, in a minor car accident, walking the streets at night, going to people's houses to beg for money and curse them out when they don't give her any. Her manic state is violent and impulsive (and she becomes a habitual liar which I think is a new development). She spent all her stimulus money on getting a preowned car (I don't know how she was qualified for such a purchase as she doesn't work or have retirement money, just $750 of SSI a month) and wasted it on random stuff like toys for the neighborhood kids. She did something to get her ""new"" car towed and it's now in the pound at over $1000 to get out. I personally am glad it got towed because she's a danger to herself and others by not taking the pandemic seriously and just her general disregard for others in this state.

Her older sister has been her only help outside of me. But she talked to me and said she was stressed and tired. She's given my grandmother about $2000 over the course of 3 months. My grandmother has just been buying cigarettes and other random stuff with her own money, instead of paying her bills, for example, thus leaving my great aunt and I to be responsible for her livelihood.

What is baffling to me is why my grandmother won't stay home. I spent most of the last 2 years or so talking and doing paperwork on her behalf after Hurricane Harvey. Her home flooded and she was denied assistance from FEMA because the title of the house was still in her mother's name and not hers. 

The remodeling of the house was finally done with the help of donations and volunteers in March...of 2020. I thought she'd be happy enough to want to stay home, but no. We have begged her and she still drives around in my grandfather's truck and truly terrorizes anyone she can for money. My grandfather is actually living we her, but he's illiterate, not as an insult, but he really doesn't know how to read or write, has a speech impediment and also lives off of SSI, using half the money for beer and cigarettes. However, his mental state is mostly intact. Though, he's not able to control his wife.

I tried to contact her doctor and the office staff said they weren't seeing patients because of the virus. The mental ward the police sometimes takes her to won't keep her for more than a week. 

It's like there are no options for people with mental disorders. 

**We need to get her somewhere that will not only medicate her and hope things get better, but provide a psychologist or some kind of therapist to get to the bottom of her issues and provide a real solution.**

Finally medicated for ADHD suddenly more aware of just where the fuck I am in life .

I've been living in my apartment for the past  5 years and somewhere I don't particularly want to be, the only fully finished room is the Livingroom.

I'm wakening the fuck up and it's Like a holy fuckin shit moment .

I'm barely living am I even alive 

So many things id wanted to do in my life.

But I'm sitting in a barely finished apartment , socially dead and just working here and there , night shifts or self employed getting my head fried by the noise of the place.

Should have been out of here long ago .

Depression has a funny way of shutting down the idea of possibility.

I'm not sure if I need therapy for this.

1066,Recently somebody broke into my apartment while I was home and it’s affecting my anxiety and depression.,"Hello from the US. I have a history of severe anxiety and depression, and while it’s something extremely difficult to deal with sometimes, I was getting by. In May, a man broke into my apartment while I was home alone. This guy broke in and when he saw me getting out of my bed, he turned around and left very quickly. Thank god he didn’t hurt me or take anything. He is now in custody and we are still awaiting trial. As I’m a witness to this crime, I will be called to testify. This is beyond out of my comfort zone. I’ve never even been pulled over, so being involved in any kind of legal process is scary to me. Not knowing when the court date will be is driving me crazy. My anxiety and depression has gotten much worse since the break-in. I keep thinking, why did this happen to me? I’m trying to get better, why did this guy have to do this? I’m having a very hard time getting out of bed and I can’t stop thinking about the court date. Every time I remember I’ll have to go to court, I immediately feel sick to my stomach. I have basically taken 15 steps back from any progress I’ve made with my mental health.

1068,Could I get OCD about my boyfriend's OCD?,"I've never gone to a doctor/therapist about it and maybe I should, but I've always been very sensitive and prone to ruminating, my parents make fun of it. I have long suspected I had OCD as a kid (would use the toilet up to 20 times a night at 8-10 years of age, losing maybe an hour or 2 of sleep with the worry I would wet the bed, but I literally hadn't since I was 4) and struggled with what I now know are intrusive thoughts about religion and sex which terrified me until I was 15 or so. I also had social anxiety disorder or so I think, for most of my late childhood until I was 18 or so, I was so petrified of rejection and played over almost any conversation outside of my family in my head for years, looking for clues people didnt like me etc., had no friends for most of this time. 

I was pretty normal for the last 2 years after starting college but since I moved back home 3 months ago because college closed for COVID,  I've struggled again. My boyfriend of 2 years has scary intrusive thoughts, some even worse than what I had as a young teen. An online therapist he has had 3 sessions with seems certain he has OCD and just needs a formal diagnosis, indeed he is a textbook example. Still my head drives me crazy with fears he doesnt actually have OCD and it's an act to excuse his nasty intrusive thoughts, even though he cries to me over them sometimes and has lost weight with the stress. I'm so scared he is a monster in denial and I overthink every OCD thought he has and search for clues he is a bad person when he so very clearly isn't. I feel like I'm searching for stuff to stress over, genuinely. The future is so uncertain as I have no idea if I'll be back to college this fall or even fall 2021, my semester in Germany may or may not be happening next spring and I lost my job and I won't be able to get a new one for a long time. I'm stuck at home all day with my anxiety. I don't have friends in my hometown either. My boyfriend's weekly visits and South Park/ The Office are my only distraction. Any time I calm down, within an hour, I start panicking that my boyfriend's OCD is fake or about my future. I can't let myself feel good."

1070,"Getting a therapist seems difficult, any advice?","High Reddit! Back in 2017 I was diagnosed with ADHD, after many years of knowing this and not doing anything about it. Flash forward to this year and I'm finally working on my mental health. I switched from a doctor who was refusing to prescribe me different ADHD medications, to a doctor who is actively encouraging me to try different ones to see which one works best (we've landed on an extended-release adderal). I also have a sleep study scheduled soon to test for narcolepsy, which I've also known about. Now, I'm trying to get an appointment with a therapist, which I've also been putting off for a long time, and I'm finding it very discouraging. I work from 8 to 5, in the place that was recommended to me by my insurance also only operates 8 to 5. They are not open on the weekends, which is the only time I have off, and the gentleman who is taking my case takes his lunch at the same time that I would be taking my lunch. So, now I have to wait a whole month to talk to him over the phone.

1072,Were these symptoms of depression?,"At the beginning of 2020, I decided to start making some positive changes in my life. I wouldn't say my life was horrible but it wasn't where I wanted to be. So I quit drinking, which had become excessive, changed my diet, started exercising, began taking anti-depressants (for anxiety) and talking with someone about issues with anxiety. After 6 months, I feel great. But now looking back at home much things have changed, I wonder if I had depression but wasn't entirely aware of it. Here are a few of the symptoms I am now wondering about:

-I often felt tired, even when sleeping for 9 or 10 hours. And many times simple tasks, like doing the dishes or paying bills seemed exhausting 

-The idea of being successful or improving life seemed almost impossible. Everything felt very stagnant and like my life hadn't changed in maybe 10 years. 

-I was often bored. Things like watching tv, going out to socalize, playing video games were all seemed kind of dull. I just couldn't get into things. 

-If I was out in public, like grocery shopping, everyone would annoy me. I felt like I was surrounded my morons and I was constantly frustrated. 

-I felt a bit isolated. Like I didn't really have any connection to a lot of things in my life. I didn't feel like I was a part of anything bigger or part of any kind of group. Like being at work, it was a job. I felt kind of like a machine. I was there to carry out a task and I wasn't part of a company of other people, playing an important role.I was just kind of there to get some stuff done and go home. I felt like it was just me, alone in the world, with everyone else being connected.

So basically SOOOO MANY THINGGSS embarrass me and make me cringe sooo hard...things that shouldn’t...I can’t bare it. I honestly believe that I can’t get into a relationship until this it fixed—food makes me cringe...like if I have to get a plate of food in front of people I get sooo much anxiety it’s unfathomable. Yes I do have social anxiety but this is like an extra layer to it all. I do get anxious doing presentations and walking through hallways with a lot of people behind me, but again, this is literally a whole other layer and this cringe occurs with people I’m completely comfortable with even.

- It is so embarrassing to me to have to carry a plate of food in front of people. Seeing THEIR plates of food makes me cringe even. Especially certain foods like beans. There is nothing more embarrassing than beans to me. I can’t even say the word aloud. I don’t wanna watch people eat and I don’t want them to see me eat, it is so embarrassing. Certain objects and shapes make me feel super embarrassed as well. Like pots and pans. I don’t want anyone to see me holding a pot something about that is so embarrassingggg. Or a blender. I don’t want to be associated with a blender. I don’t know why this is the case in my reality but it takes a major toll on me mentally. Sweeping a floor in front of others is absolutely cringe to imagine. And makes me want to just run away and hide. And it doesn’t even have to be a crowd it could be ONE person that I’m COMFORTABLE with. Vacuum cleaners too. I don’t want anyone to see me associated with that oddly shaped fat machine it’s so cringe. It’s so silly like I’m actually laughing while typing this because I see how ridiculous it is but I can’t escape this “sensitivity” I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Everything that would be considered immature to overreact to affects me. Like farting and stuff, I don’t overreact on the surface but inside I’m dying. Any mention of such a term or engaging in it even makes me so embarrassed and makes me cringe so hard. 
Whenever I see animated previews and the jokes are stupid and immature I cringe soooo hard to the point where I have actually left the room because I could not deal with the pain of how cringe it was. Other people were in the room and I didn’t want to be acknowledged simultaneously with that horrible preview. I returned after estimating how long the commercial might be in my head. I came back when I was certain it was over. 
Anytime a preview like this plays in a theatre and I’m with someone I try to distract them from the cringe by talking and engaging in convo, otherwise I block my ear canals the best I can and am left trembling with cringe in my seat. 


I’m sorry this is so long but I don’t understand why cringe and embarrassment is sooo prominent and severe in my everyday life and I need this to stop so that I can live properly

1076,How hard/easy is it to get involuntarily committed to a hospital?,How visibly 'bad' do you have to seem? Just having suicidal thoughts or actively attempting? Does age play a factor (I'm 16)? I know self-harm can get you committed but does it have to be dangerous s/h or does it not matter? Trying to figure out just how honest I can be with this new therapist I'm getting.
1077,I just never feel like talking to anyone,"Even though I feel lonely, feel bored with life and want to hang out, I just never do feel like talking to people. 

Before I used like chatting online, always had something to say, but nowadays I can't be bothered, I never have much to say.

Nothing excites me anymore and interacting with others feels like hard work.

I get into a state of regret I started a conversation with them, feel like a boring person and feel like i can't be bothered, I feel I have nothing to look forward to and feel negative inside.. 
I never click much with anyone.

I been having problems socialising before, easily socially confused and aloof as what some would describe me.. but feel worse than before, It's like I've fallen into a comfort  zone I like to escape at the same time wanting to stay in and don't know what to do."
1078,Just another rape story,"Hello, trapped in quarantine here and nobody to talk to so I’ve chosen to write it out. I (24f) was raped by my own cousin for over a year when I was 14 years old. Story started with force, him moving my hand, forcing my head down, holding me down, locking me in cars, etc. Same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members. What I want to talk about is the aftermath. What nobody really realizes. My virginity wasn’t lost the same way as my friends growing up, I felt my body was meant to be used because that’s all he told me I was good for. So I believed him. After having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb. It starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn’t anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with. I don’t feel like my body is mine, I don’t have a connection with sex. I hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners, but I have always viewed sex as my duty. It was my job to make men feel nice, I never had a right to say no. Still feel like I don’t. I don’t have connections with people, every friend I push away because I don’t “fit in” with them. I’m disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do (drink, party, yoga, etc) my focus for the time I’ve grown up is to just make sure it doesn’t happen again. Survivor mentality if you will... I’m not saying all this to feel sorry for myself. It happens to a lot of people. But what happened to me made me feel like a outcast, I can’t share “losing my virginity” stories because it wasn’t funny or cute. I can’t stay in relationships with... well anyone because I don’t trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what’s to stop others. I don’t talk to friends (don’t have any), I’ve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family I haven’t lost like my mom, dad, and brother I don’t talk to them anymore because they don’t understand why I’ve changed so much from the happy go lucky “pretty teenage girl” to the cold hearted one I am today. Nobody can help you but yourself. I’ve been told over and over again to “just get over it” but here we are, 10 years later. And I’m over what happened to me, it doesn’t haunt me like it use to. But that doesn’t mean it didn’t permanently change me. My ability to form relationships, my mentality, my hobbies, my happiness, or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago. So for those that have been raped, you don’t have to just get over it, you don’t have to just bury it, but you can build because of it. I’m a strong person because of it, just isolated. So if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it I will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor. Thanks for reading."
1079,Being super anxious about an upcoming situation,"So in my working place there's this traditional thing where whenever someone is either getting promoted or leaving for good, we have some sort of a gathering in appreciation of that worker. It usually starts with the people stand around that worker, while each one is given their time to talk about their qualities, relationship and experiences with them. Then we have a small feast, and later on people move on with their day. Seemingly a wholesome and nice tribute.

I absolutely hate these, as you might have expected. Whenever we have one that is concerning to a close co-worker of mine, the obligation to talk in front of everyone stresses me the fuck out, to the point where I find myself wanting to miss on work at days where I know there's a gathering like this planned. Most of the time, my words would come out very wobbly, with my voice being very trembly, and the confusion/awkwardness in the face of the person I'm talking about would be pretty visible.  The thing that irritates me the most is that I consider my verbal skills to be quite impressive, but given the large crowd and the social expectation, it feels like those abilities just go out of usage.

For the past two weeks or so, the main thing that has been boggling my mind, is the fact that my boss, which is a person I truly admire, love and thankful for (which just adds to it), about to leave at any day now. My life are very busy these days. I just can't have these future two minutes where I would have to be talking and deal my fear to be the biggest concern in my mind. It's just stupid, and I truly feel embarrased reading this as I write this.

How do I overcome this? How do I stop giving these nonsense fears so much mental space?"
1080,Should I seek help or should I just go on for a week or 2 and it'll be fine,"Ok so here it goes. I'm 15 and ever since 2018 I've been getting these like weeks where I'm just super depressed and then afterwards it goes back to normal (I'm generally not a very happy person so normal isn't like happy but it's neutral for me if it makes sense) but anyways just thought that might help. (I also went through a similar thing in 2018 where I was considering suicide but I got through all that without help) 

See my girlfriend has been getting these super bad headaches recently and it sucks that I can't be there for her (she also stresses alot about everything) because of Covid-19 and that caused me to breakdown a couple of times. But then it got 'better' (I mean it didn't but like it wasn't as bad, I also got too see her which helped out alot.) but it didn't go back to normal. I generally felt sadder than what I did before and then a week-ish afterwards I got news that one of my close friends dad has just died and that made me cry for 3 days and then 2 days after that I just felt like crying the whole time (so I think it was just be mourning). But then one day I just woke up and felt more broken than ever, it felt like I was less depressed about my friends dad passing and way more broken than before.

And now in just wondering if I should rather talk to my parents and ask for help or if I should just leave it for a bit and it'll get better on its own. (I know this probably isn't as like intense as other stories on this subreddit but I'm just asking for a bit of guidance)

Edit: the last bit where I felt more broken than ever has been going on for the past couple days (like 2-3) and its felt the same each of the days"

1084,Why do I constantly feel and anticipate real and imaginary confrontation? To the point of violence.,"Title says it, I had a weird upbringing, dad's a kind heroin addict &amp; mum's very tom boyish, brought up rough by UK standards, but I'm happy, healthy live alone, have a girlfriend I adore and a job that I love as a bench joiner,.
A lot happened when I was young but nothing I can actually call Upon to explain this. I just can't seem to shake it.
I've been on anti depressants before but I truly don't think I was depressed Although I was going through a breakup at the time, just my doctors 15 minute pressure during a busy time and I accepted, Took fluoxtine/prozac in the USA I think? For around a year, my initial plan from the doctor. 
Stopped taking it after around 3 months.
Credit the drug for helping me even now.
But I still can't shake the perceived confrontation and reactionary violence that ensues, all imaginary, but I can waste alot of time in these daydreams.
Its begun to leach into my real life to the point any stranger I perceive as an unknown entity, I somewhat see as threatening, especially at work with contractors, delivery's etc. But in public, City centres etc I just don't feel that way, Im fully functional in society, bit of a loner but no introvert by a long shot.
I have spoken to my doctor about all of this but to be honest, they either offer me therapy or drugs, neither I want, I'm not a huge fan of taking tablets each morning, &amp; I truly don't have the time or patience for therapy.

Comment, dm me, anything that I can change or do, I hate this and its frustrating, it's intrusive on my daily functioning and its becoming harder to ignore and push back, I appreciate any feedback.

For those of you who have healthcare and use it for your therapist/psychiatrist, does it make a big financial difference?

1092,any tips when you have nowhere to go?,"im from a country where the nhs is our mental health service, so you can see what's wrong already. all the good therapists abandon you and the shite ones are. shite. my last psychologist, who hadn't seen me since the start of november, dumped me in mid february because im not well enough. you can ask for more specifics but im not paraphrasing incorrectly.

im at the end of my rope. ive been going to mental health specialists for half a decade and none of them have expressed interest in helping me.

you know when you talk about this kinda shit online and people don't take you seriously, and mostly don't even think you've been trying to help yourself. obviously a stranger knows better.

anyway my only thing im worried about is my cat being left without me. i don't know what to do which is why im even still looking for help even though im so so past exhausted.

don't tell me to stop drinking or anything. don't fucking care. i don't even care about my deathwishes anymore i just want my baby girl to be okay, she's already 9 years old and im the only one in my family who was nice to her. im so torn ive failed her"
1093,Friends use my mental health/weaknesses to their advantage??,"I am way too open with anyone and everyone in my life who i consider a friend close or distant. It’s a problem I have always had and am working on. 


Recently I started to realize that my friends(mostly close friends) will randomly be very mean and make me cry (via text or in person) and then turn it around so I am the one comforting them telling them they’re not a bad person and a good friend. I don’t know the reasoning for downtalking to me as if I am 12 (I am a 19 y/o female)


Because these people know me so well they know I will let anything and everything slide to keep a friendship because my biggest fear is losing people. Over the course of years have lost lots of friends and it breaks my heart and soul every time. I have about 2 people in my life who I know for certain are genuine and do not mess with my head who i have known for years and years. Other than them I am beginning to realize I shouldn’t trust my other “close friends” or even “distant friends” because they take whatever information i vent about and then use it to their advantage. 


What I hate the most is that people will be so nice to me one day say i love you im always here for you then when i vent either dismiss my feelings or make me feel worse. And then as I said before will say mean things and then if i say it hurts my feelings (im at home sobbing at this point) i end up comforting THEM! it just seems like emotional manipulation. What do they gain from this? I go above and beyond for my friends and do anything they ask, pick them up when drunk, lend money, give them free things, drop whatever I’m doing if they are upset and want to vent. I guess I am just frustrated that people don’t have the same heart as I do. 


I do work with some of these people so even if I decide they are too toxic I have to pretend to be friends for works sake because some of these people are my supervisors and based off situations with other people i know for a fact if i were to end the friendships I would be stuck doing all the “grunt work” which i dont mind but they know how much i love other aspects of the job and would take that away from me to punish me. I truly love my job and the people I work with other than the few friends who are mean to me. I can’t transfer to another location because no other location is hiring or taking employee transfers at least no where close to where I live. 


I don’t know what to do because even if i fake being friends with these people for works sake I know my stupid self will end up confiding in them again about things and then the cycle continues. I can not confide in my boss about this because of reasons I don’t care to disclose. I feel trapped but at same time don’t wanna quit my job. Also these friends if i cut them off are the type of people to text my parents and try to cause issues with my relationship with them by telling them things about my past that would ruin everything. As of now I have made no decisions on what to do but I am going to block every persons number on both parents phones (i live at home) when I get the chance to just as an extra precaution in case i do slowly cut these people off. It’s not fair I have done nothing wrong other than confide in the wrong people. 


I am scared someone will see this so I will probably delete this post by tomorrow. Any tips or advice on what you would do if you were in my situation would be awesome. Thanks!"
1094,I just want to end it but I can't decide,"Hello, I am a 14 YO teen, I recently have gotten these feelings of sudden ups and downs. I have woken up days and randomly gotten really depressed and thinking about committing suicide, I have normal days where I go to school and have it completely fine but I work 2 jobs at my age and it's taking a toll on me and I have just been trying to reach out but I don't think anyone actually cares about how I feel because I live in better conditions than any of my classmates. I just want to wake up and not want to kill myself randomly every day or so. I think I need help but I don't want to embarrass myself by telling people that I know. I have a really bad habit of not being able to control my feelings and not being able to stay at 1 meaning of mine and that is why I keep getting sudden spikes of feeling depressed and I don't want to end my life but still, I do because I feel like such a burden to the world at this point, The world right now is so fucking broken that some people get to live so fantastically while other people have to die for things they haven't done, and there are so many governments that are corrupted and I can't live in this world knowing that so I might just end it so I don't have to deal with all of these things, it's just too much the whole time and I barely have time to do what I enjoy.   


I really need help, I don't know what to do anymore and if anyone could just explain to me why I'm feeling like this I think I might just get through this and actually smile again, I don't wanna live until I know how I can live without being such a burden on this world."

I feel actually exhausted so i have to force myself to do stuff required of me. I also feel i have the flu or that i am sick. I did some other tests to check if anything is wrong health wise but no i am good. I tried different meds and stuff but nothing worked. I did a lot of sports and socializing, same. I wake up sleepy and tired, and weak and spend the day like that and then sleep. It's more about survival than living. I feel my whole body is sick and bothered. Not my thoughts, again.  Thoughts? Anyone going through something similar? I have been meditating and breathing a bit but sometimes i can't even do breathing exercises  i literallly feel exhausted to do them. Even though i want to!"
1096,During the pandemic I have realized just dysfunctional my family is.,"TLDR: My family is dysfunctional and that makes me feel lonely and anxious. 


I think it wasn't until my college years that I realized my family was dysfunctional because the behavior was normalized. It wasn't until I discussed family matters with friends that I realized things were different. 

These people that attended all my childhood birthdays and have lived just a few miles away, don't really care about me. And I accept that, but it makes me wonder how hardships would have been if I had a functional family. While I went away to college for 6 years, I was sexually assaulted, the case/trial for which lasted the following school year. But I was alone. Not one family member would reach out to me in those 6 six years. Another example would be when my parents lost their place of business. The landlord and sold the entire block of properties and we were forced to pack up and move all on Christmas day. I remember my mother lamenting, that no one called. No one bothered to check up on us or help move. 


There are some family members I do enjoy hanging out with, and I became the Dungeon Master for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign for them to do over Zoom. It has been several weeks and it is dysfunctional to the point where they have still not officially decided to be a party and adventure together because they keep trying to go in different directions without even discussing it with each other. 


It's draining on me feeling alone in this specific way. Like I have a few close friends, but I wish I had a healthier family."
1097,my hospitalization experience.,"-possible trigger warning (suicide, self harm, violence, police, psychosis) 

So about a month ago I was hospitalized because I had a pretty severe psychotic episode. At the peak of the episode I went out at like 3 am with a knife that I held to my neck and started screaming about how I know they are watching (government) and that I’m not letting them use me (for mind control) and I don’t know how long that went but someone eventually called the police. Now you can imagine what I thought “they are from the government they are going to hurt you” and the voices started telling me they are going to kill me. So in my delusional mind I screamed “ I have a weapon” long story short I got tased (could have gone a lot worse) 
And pinned to the ground, punched and all that good police stuff. I was terrified out of my mind. 
I have this necklace on me that says my name someone to call and that I’m schizophrenic. 
So they found that and took me to the hospital so I wasn’t in jail for long. 
I was immediately injected with something and was knocked out for at least two days. The hospital staff were super nice to me. But I did act out a couple of times and it ended up with me being strapped and injected and it’s a very traumatizing experience. 
My dose of meds was upped and I was getting better still am. Yeah just wanted to get if of my chats because it really traumatized me. I lost all trust in police. And I think I might need a therapist because of the trauma from that arrest. 
Yeah I’m doing better now still in recovery but much better. 
I wish you all a great day !"

I love them and don't wanna loose them but just regular chatting fills me with guilt. And then there are those semi regular phases where I get so bottled up on emotions I just leave every chatroom just to come crawling back a few hours later.

1100,"I want to reset my(22F) mentality, relationships, my point of view.","My last 2 years were such a downhill: I lost big part of my friends, motivation to maintain basic life, my boyfriend (also my best friend), enthusiasm, gained weight and I am going to repeat my class next year etc... Basically I am failing in my life.

I was not OK before this corona malady, but quarantine striked me so hard and I am at the very deep bottom right now.

I have so many flaws and I am doomed to notice all of them. I can't stick to a goal for more than 5 minutes. I can't finish what I have started before (and it has to be perfect in my mind but guess what? I can't even finish a quarter of a task). I want to do billions of self-improve hobbies but I. Just. Can't. Start. At. All. I feel like I am in a continous agony loop. 

I am thinking about other persons all the time and I am judging them too much ( who am I to judge?). As a result I am in a constant fear of doing something silly. I am judging myself too much too. And this is keeping me out of my way. I will not do the ""couragous"" thing. Even it is simply ""saying hi"".

In relationships: I am too touchy. I instantly will be aware if someone doesn't want to talk with me (and I know it is okay some time to time but...), I will get annoyed, little sick worm in my head will fantasize about conspiracies why they behaved like that. That was a simple example, I am having these thoughts almost every single little coldness they show. I am constantly critisizing myself if I laughed too much, acted silly or crossed a boundary? I can link 2 different incidents in my head, find a cause-result similarity, in a way that normal human being wouldn't think about. And I will get defensive immediately. I feel like I am toxic to everyone: my family, my friends, ex, acquaintances, and even to myself. I just wanna let it go all of my thoughts, wanna be insensitive to tiny miny micro problems but I do always exaggerate them and ruin my life, part by part...

I feel like there are so much toxicity in me and I want to change that, I want to be releived from my thoughts. I just wanna change my point of view by reseting ALL. I want to have a fresh start. I want to be enough and sufficient as a person. I don't want to feel depressed, annoyed, anxious, insufficient ALL THE TIME. I don't know how to do that or what is wrong with me. And I feel soooo insufficient that I can't seek for a help, even if I do seek for help I can't maintain my recovery, durability.

1103,"I felt ugly today, and I'm so thankful for it.","Let me explain: I'm in the middle of an existential crisis. Only it's more than a crisis- it has been going on for years and it fucking sucks. The biggest part of this for me is the whole ""oh well nothing matters"" thing. It doesn't matter how I look because I'll die and be forgotten, etc. It doesn't matter if I get better. I was pretty insecure before the crisis hit me, and then I was just a sea of numbness, half wishing that I could go back, and half not giving a shit because, you know, nothing matters.

Today I felt ugly. So spectacularly ugly. And while that may SOUND bad, it felt phenomenal, because just for a split second, I cared. I cared about my weight, and my bumpy skin, and my bone structure. These are not important things, but I cared about them.

I haven't felt like this in so long."

1106,"I'm appreciative of what I have, though unsatisfied to the point where it affects my mental health.","To preface this, I appreciate everything have. I love my career, I love my friends, I love where I live, and I love my hobbies. For years, Ive always taken on a lot of new things, new clubs, teaching myself new skills, new groups of friends, new jobs etc. I am someone that can't sit still, relaxing to me feels like I'm being lazy, and feeling lazy I ultimately feel guilty. With all this in mind, there should be. There should be at least some part of me that feels satisfied, but Im never quite at that point and whenever I can't keep up with the things I've done the day before I just feel bad about myself.

As of recently, I've seen this reflected in my work-life, and the things I do outside of it as well. My job will pick up, and I can keep up with but when I'm unable to it just feels like I have to sacrifice my mental health in order to just meet the bar. At moments like this, my projects just end up worse adding onto my workload. When work is slow, I feel like I'm undervalued and not doing enough. 

I will say, I am certainly not depressed as it isn't affecting the things that I actually want to do (though I do feel really sorry for those going through depression). But the pace of my life isn't healthy, my mentality towards it isn't healthy, and just overall it's really taxing. I don't know where to begin, I don't know how to slow down, and I don't know who to connect with (although I do know a therapist is the obvious one)."

I don’t go to her practice anymore since she found out I was self harming and am lined up to see a psychiatrist because they don’t think therapy will help me. 

I try to keep myself feeling 0. Not negative but not too positive either. Because when I feel happy things get very weird and I start acting like I normally wouldn’t. The easiest way to control it is just to stop being too happy. 

Last night I found something for sale online that was not major but have been looking for for years and it was at a reasonable price. I was so shocked I couldn’t sit still and I kept messaging the seller when I wasn’t getting a reply straight away. I was so giddy, loud and irritable the rest of the day. It’s now 6.50 am and I can’t sleep from the excitement waiting for their reply. I kept looking at the ad for it. 

As I typed it out it feels like I’m the one who stops myself from being happy. But I don’t know what other choice I have. From what I gather from advice from my former therapist I’m supposed to step away when I feel like this and “not give in.” But I feel like I’m not allowed to do anything I like or talk about it.

What about now? I really have been looking for exactly this for ages.. I am so confused."
1108,Support GCs ?,"I don't know if this is allowed by Reddit rules as im fairly new to Reddit, but are there any mental health support, or general group chats available even just for lonely folk to talk and connect with each other?

If not, would people be open to making one?"
1109,Eating disorder and depression,"Hi, I’m 17. I have anxiety, panic disorder, depression and OSFED. 
I have had a really rough few weeks. My family are lunatics to say the least and there is always some sort of drama going on and it’s ended with me cutting off all ties to my older sister and my older brother. 
I just feel really down, Ive had a few bad moments but I haven’t been to bad, Which frustrates me, apart from my OSFED I have been okay. Now with everything that is going on I can feel myself spiralling all over again and I just don’t think I can get through another breakdown. 
I’ve never self harmed, I’ve contemplated it, I’ve contemplated suicide too. The only thing that stops me killing myself is that it would hurt my little brother and sisters and I don’t ever wanna be the reason why they’re in pain. They look at me like a mum not just an older sister, I could never do that to them, but I’m just so fed up of having a constant battle in my mind. I’m so fed up of putting on a smiling face and pretending I’m okay when I really am not. 
I have nobody. 
My dad died when I was 11 and I see my mum twice a Month at best and even then she looks at me like I’m broken, she has been like that ever since I was diagnosed. 
I feel like everything I have tried to achieve and all the demons I’ve fought against are slowly creeping back in. 
I haven’t been “hungry” for months. By that I mean I’ve had no desire to eat for months, not even a stomach growl, I eat just for the sake of eating, I eat at specific times everyday because I know that’s what normal people are meant to do to stay healthy. 
I just feel lost, confused, depressed. I’m crying everyday, I’m having panic attacks/anxiety attacks everyday. I find no joy in the things I used to. Yet I act like I’m okay. I feel like I’m going crazy. I feel like I should speak to someone but I don’t want to be a burden on anyone. 😔 

I don’t even want to post this, I feel like I’ll be laughed at. That I won’t be taken seriously. Maybe I am being over dramatic, maybe I’m not. Some advice would be great. 

I’m sorry if my post is confusing I’m just typing whatever comes to mind and it’s a lot 😅. 

Thank you for reading. X"
1110,I take meds but I dont know what's wrong with me,"I'm on Abilify but I dont have a formal diagnosis for anything except for Autism. 


I feel sad sometimes. Sometimes I feel suicidal. Somedays I feel no motivation.

On other days I feel good. I feel optimistic for my future and happy. 

On most days I feel social anxiety. I honestly feel weird around people. I feel like they all dislike me secretly. Somedays I feel like I am being watched and judged. I feel like there are these people who are around just to watch me. I dont know who they are. I feel like my own family thinks I am weird.

I dont know if I even need to take meds. They do help but I don't know if I even need them that bad. They have taken away my suicidal thoughts though. I also feel less of my social anxiety. But it seems weird to be on a medication without a diagnosis of a mental illness."
1111,I'm switching schools (and country) this year. I have only a single week of school left and I lost the ability to function properly,"I'm switching schools this year and it drives me fucking insane. I have realy good friends, nice teachers, and generally lots of fun stuff in this school. I don't want to leave all of these friends and teachers behind and move to a completely unknown and new school. Sone teachers say to me it's fine to feel this way and stuff but I really don't think its okay to losing all my appetite, inability to sleep, inability to focus (well I have adhd to be fair but I completely lost my ability to focus during these few weeks), just recalling random memories of my experiences in the school to do a wrap up kind of thing. I know I can contact my friends thru my phone but I just get the feeling that its not going to be alright or the same. Same with teachers, I will probably never see them again (and I have no way of contacting them as far as I know. Someone can correct me on that one) and all of these stuff just make me really depressed."
1112,How to deal with guilt?,What’s things that help you deal with guilt
1113,What is wrong with me,"I feel pretty down but somehow optimistic about the future, at the moment i do things and lose track of what I’m doing as I’m about to do it, I’m reading something get lost because I can’t really focus on it because I’ve got the most mildly irrational thoughts that I know are stupid but continue to obsess over them. example: my friend smoked weed across from me, not for long, but I smelled it and now I feel I’m somehow neurologically hindered in most things I do... thing is I’m definitely not but can’t stop obsessing over it (I used to smoke it often so I know what it feels like and it wasn’t that, but have a bad experience surrounding it). Weirdly paranoid about most things and if I finally do feel good I’ll probably think about something that I should feel bad about like some sort of weird addiction.

If anyone actually reads this, cool. But I just wanted to note it down, feels like a release."
1114,Need some tips for people to talk too,"So I’m 14 still live with my parents and my whole life they’ve emotionally neglected me so that’s caused a lot of issues.And I don’t know who I can talk to about my emotions I don’t have money to get online therapy all my relationships with friends and family are extremely superficial so I can’t talk to them.Does anyone know who u can talk to about stuff.

1115,I don’t wanna try anymore!,"I’m over people coming into my life who really just want to leave when they get everything they needed from me. It’s like I help people financially or I help my s/o get over the damages from their exes. But it’s not really leaving that upsets me the most. It’s when those who leave just want to tell me everything that’s wrong with me or tell me I’m the reason they gave up. Like I get it, I hate me too, but I’m not perfect. After the painful things I have been through, it would be nice being able to just wake up one day and have someone love me for who I am. I’m understanding, but I guess I’m not worth even the time it takes to just let me fix myself so I can keep fighting on in life. Now I don’t even feel like getting outta bed. Realizing how little I’m worth in everyone’s eyes just helps me care less about living."
1116,I keep seeing things when I sleep.,"I think this is the right subreddit, please re-direct me if it isn't.

Every single time I close my eyes to sleep, I see these like... Creatures? I don't really know how to describe them other than shitty arg/jumpscare/creepypasta esque. (y'know, realistic eyes + teeth, only in red, black + yellow/white, highly deepfried). I've dealt with this since I was a kid and I always thought it was normal, but the more I see people post about this stuff being a sign of some mental illness, the more I worry.

For context, this isn't just miss-seeing a shadow in the dark. No this is seeing vivid, color flashes of distressing shit every time I close my eyes. It most commonly happens before I go to bed, but seeing flashes of them when I blink during the day isn't uncommon either. They never say anything and never move, just stay there in my vision... Always staring at me.   
They're also all original images I've never seen before (I went through a phase where I was very into internet horror and creepypasta, around 6th grade, so I've seen my share of creepy shit) with a few exceptions. I've pretty much stopped consuming internet horror and horror in general all-together, or when I'm in the spooky mood I'll just put on a light-hearted video (shout out to SomeOrdinaryGamers) in the background, never actually watching it. This is because they generally get worse after I watch something scary, but as I said, this happens nearly every time I try to sleep.

I've gotten very good at dealing with it, but it has lead to multiple sleepless nights and a general tense relationship with rest. I would say about 8/10 nights I deal with this shit.  
I just want to know, is this something everyone has? Is this normal? Is it a sign of some mental illness I don't know I have? (I've been diagnosed with rather mild, self-manageable depression and anxiety, nothing more.) I just want answers, and don't know where else to look."

1118,I NEED HELP. IF I DONT FIND AN ANSWER SOON I WILL KILL MYSELF. I THINK IM GOING INSANE. FUCKING SERIOUS MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.,"I think I’m going insane. I feel like I am the only thing that exists. There is absolutely nothing that is rewarding anymore. 

I can’t live like this so I need direction or something. Every time I tell my doctor or therapist I think there is something wrong with me they assure me that I’m depressed. It doesn’t feel like it. I feel like I am the only thing that is real. Being present in the real world causes me indescribable pain. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like this is the end of my story. I’ve tried and tried and tried to find an answer but nothing ever fucking changes. I get sent in circles. I think I find an answer to find out days later I’m completely wrong. Someone please tell me if I’m crazy. If I am I just want to die before I lose the mental capacity to even carry out my own death. I don’t want my parents to have to watch me go insane."

1122,Thinking everything is a lie,"Heya. I trust people with information and secrets and such fairly easily, though never really trust them. I've been on a long road to improve myself and I know if I'm to have healthy friendships and an eventual healthy partnership, I need to learn to trust. I feel it takes a very very long time for me to even make progress with trust. Even my good friend of over 2 years, everything he says seems like a lie to me. I am unable to see a therapist right now, so does anybody have any tips that may help me? I don't expect much here but I can't ever get close to someone if I can't trust them so I'm turning here."
1123,I need your suggestions,"I am 23 years old guy from India and was diagnosed with depression last November. In January this year i got in contact with a girl i had crush on again. Before that we talked but quite rarely. We started talking a lot and something clicked and i told her i liked her. Lucky for me she had the same feeling we started a relationship though it was a long distance relationship. Currently i in college persuing CSE but due to lockdown i had to move back from college to my home which is in a different state.
One thing when i got in the relationship, for 3 or 4 days i felt on top of the world then i started feeling trapped. I loved talking to her and we talked for hours teasing each other or just sharing thing but as soon as i was off the call the trapped feeling came back.
After the lockdown started i was back home so we couldn't talk much i started feeling that i was better off her. So i broke up with her by giving her a stupid reason and blaming myself for it. I know i am a giant asshole for doing that.
I though about the feeling of being trapped a lot and i came to a realisation that i like the concept of relationship but i don't want to be in a relationship. As if the corona virus was not enough this thing has been driving me insane.
For background since childhood i have seen a lot of negative things related to relationships and no I won't talk about them as its personal and family related.
So i seek help from you redittors. IS THIS NORMAL OR AM I GOING INSANE?"
1124,Do you think my sister is beyond help?,"
My sister Mya is 20 and I’m 16. I share a room with her because our house is really small and we live with my grandma and mom. 

Mya doesn’t have any friends and she honestly hasn’t had a single friend in years. Mya has never had a boyfriend and She doesn’t have a dad. Her dad abandoned my mom when she was a baby. Never wanted to be a part of her life. She has no plans on going to college and she doesn’t work. She literally sits at home all the damn time. She doesn’t really do chores either. My mom works a lot so she doesn’t really care what Mya does. This stuff she’s been doing for a while but I’m honestly sick of it. I have to pick up the tabs and forget talking to her (mya) all she does is scream at you and never listens. She was seeing a therapist earlier this year but decided to stop going and stop taking her meds. She has been in the psych ward twice. The last time being in 2016. 

She has idolized this male celebrity since she was like 13. She sleeps with a cardboard cutout of him and has his pictures all over the wall. She’s even gone to his concerts and he gave her attention. She has fan pages for him on social media too. (The celebrity is 40 years old). 

She always talks about how he’s old enough to be her dad and how she thinks she looks like him. (She somewhat does resemble him but more in the personality department rather than looks). She’s even bought some nike and adidas clothes because he wears them. I have caught her talking to pictures of him on her MacBook. I wish I was joking but she literally had google images opened up and was laughing and sounded like she was talking to someone, I walked in the room and there she is talking to his pictures on google images. 

I’ve heard her whisper at night “I love you daddy” to the pictures on her wall. She sucks her thumb and cuddles the cardboard cutout every single night. Yes she is 20 years old and still sucks her thumb. My mom never stopped her. When I leave the room sometimes I hear her talking to someone and I back in there and she’s facing the wall laughing and talking to the posters. 

She has seen pictures of him with his own kids and starts bawling. He has 2 boys but is expecting another one. She goes off like a nut yelling about hoping it’s not a girl. I don’t get why it matters....She said she might deactivate all her accounts for Father’s Day because he posts pics with his kids and she will probably cry. She did last year. Anytime she sees pics of him out with his kids she starts crying. 

I have told her many times that he is not her dad. He is not listening to her. She’s talking to nobody. She gets all mad and goes “yeah I know that” and sometimes starts swearing at me. She has a really short fuse and can be really mean."
1125,Anxiety,"Hi guys, so I've been dealing with this feeling where I feel as if my heart is sinking and I get this weird feverish feeling, thought loops mostly negative such as fears and constant reminder of things I can not do, and this weird joint pain with a weird sleepy feeling but no sleep when I try to get some. When I say joint pain, I mean on my feet and wrists.

 I've been feeling this way for quite a while, I feel like I have a lot of potential to do things, people often appreciate my efforts but most of the time I pass up opportunities even though I'm perfectly capable of doing it.  I used to be quite confident and lively but ever since I had a break up back in 2016, these feelings are intensifying.  I'm married to a wonderful woman, she really takes care of me and everything and I love her a lot! plus I've moved on from those hurt feelings from the fail of my relationship to the point where it does not play any part in my life but somehow these ill feelings and weakness lingers. I keep trying to ask myself, why am I feeling this way when I've dealt with my emotions, waited a healthy amount of time after that plus made peace with the past? Will it always be like this, perhaps this is hinting some form of illness?   


Anyone is these shoes? if you are then how do you deal with these feelings? all tips are welcome. Thanks."
1126,Good resources for my boyfriend,"Hi all, thanks so much for reading this! For years I’ve struggled with mental illness, and after a move to a new city where we’re far from both of our families and I don’t know anybody at all, my boyfriend had to leave for a business trip leaving me alone. As expected, depression hit me like a brick to the face, and our interactions over FaceTime and text haven’t been super pleasant because I don’t know how to act and he doesn’t either. I’ve never sent resources to someone about this, so I’m wondering if anyone has come across good content that I could send him so he can know what I’m going through/how to provide support. I told him that the way he’s treating me isn’t constructive and can make me feel a lot worse and I would prefer if he would do some research about it, but I’d like to help instead of just holding the standard to him. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!"
1127,"I feel extremely depressed at night, while in the day I feel completely normal and happy.","I think it has to do with my excessive media consumption. In the day I either listen to music, watch youtube, watch anime or play videogames (sometimes with a friend). I consume so much media that I sometimes can't hear my own thoughts clearly anymore. I guess you could call it brain fog.

In the night I try to fall asleep, so that's when I can actually think straight. That's the time when all my emotions overwhelm me. I also completely broke down in the shower once, mostly because of the same reason.

I'm only 15 and am very privileged, so I don't have any real issues. The only thing that's somewhat an issue, is that I don't have a part-time job unlike everyone else around my age. (I am trying to get one though). I'm not really affected by the pandemic, except that I have more free time.

So I was curious about the effect media has on your thoughts/brain. 

It could also be a completely other reason to why I feel depressed only at night. If you know anything about this subject, please tell me.

Thanks for reading.

1128,I don't trust people when the lights are off?,"I (15f) am normally a very trusting person, sometimes to my own determent. But as soon as we I am with someone, and we are in the dark, even if its just dark enough to not see their face clearly, I cant trust them. When I slept in the same room as my brother, I felt as if he was a monster taking his voice so I would trust him, and it would kill me or my family. Even today, when I sleep over at a friends house, I need light or they are some sort of monster to me. I'm confused.  Is there a reason for this? I have a couple mental illnesses, so maybe it's part of them? If this sounds familiar to anyone,  please let me know."
1129,School has done something to me mentally and i dont know what it is,"I've massively hated school since high school

Since school started again ive felt way less happy and energetic. The first day that school started i was pissed at everyone, later i Just went crazy inside of my head. It was a feeling i cannot express in words. Later that night i burst out in tears for 20 minutes straight. 

And i Just broke out in tears again, it started from something that happend in a show (seems logical i know) but i couldn't stop crying, it was't about the show i just couldn't stop crying. Every time this happens it feels like there is a massive weight of my shoulders

Is there anyone that can explain where these feelings come from and what i can do about it?"
1130,Advice/tips for a family member of an individual with depression,"Hi everyone. I'm just looking for tips/advice for myself in helping and living with my brother. He is 21 years old. He suffers from what I would say is severe depression (but I'm not a clinical psychologist) for about 1.5 years. His behaviors and symptoms have changed drastically over this time span but now they are starting to really concern me. Prior to his onset, he was a freshman in college, and would have been playing college football. He was a great athlete but was suffering in silence for so long and we didn't know. He no longer attends school but holds a part time job. In the beginning he had the classic symptoms of anxiety, sleeping too much or not sleeping at all, isolating behaviors, occasional self-harm, lack of appetite or binge eating, loss of interest in hobbies, flat affect etc. He has had inpatient services when this first began but after, refused to see a therapist or take medication. He dabbled with medication after his physician basically forced it on him about 6 mo ago. But didn't continue taking it after a few weeks. I personally think he needs it and therapy but, can't/won't force it. Most recently his behaviors have changed so much that I am very concerned. When speaking to him he cannot make eye contact and if he does his eyes move rapidly back and forth, he cannot stay on topic, he will interject when someone else is in the middle of talking to say something unrelated, he will say random things that don't always make sense, he will talk in a loud tone or sometimes say inappropriate things. I also don't think he can pay attention very well or process incoming information the way a typical 21 yr old would. I don't know much about the course depression but I'm nervous this is the start of delusional behavior or psychotic behavior, possibly a different disorder perhaps?. If anyone can relate or give any insight that would be super helpful. Thank you :)"
1131,My experience with antidepressants for depression and anxiety,"Hello everyone, I (F, 24) am currently on fluoxetine/prozac for depression but I also suffer with some anxiety. I was on F for about 2 years before and then switched to sertraline because I felt F had stopped having any effect. The sertraline however did not seem effective at all so after nearly a year on that I switched back to F (as my doc advised me too). I've been on F this time for a total of about 7 months now and I'm having doubts.

Basically I do feel like it's helping with my depression most of the time except for pms which is a big problem for me. My memory seemed to be effected quite a lot from S aswell and so far F seems to have no effect on that so that's good. But, I am questioning if it's started making my anxiety worse. I feel jittery a lot more and my anxiety is flaring up nearly everyday now which isn't common for me. Ita giving me somewhat agoraphobia at the moment but it's mostly anxiety around sickness. 

I think the lockdown is mostly responsible but has anyone else ever experienced F increasing anxiety? Or a change in tablets etc or maybe 7 months isn't long enough for it to be fully in my system working?"
1132,I don’t want to kill myself but I wish I didn’t exist/ wish someone would kill me,"I (16m) recently have been super depressed. I’m not thinking about killing myself but I just wish I wasn’t born so I wouldn’t have to deal with the struggles of every day life. I know I can be successful but being depressed just degrades my physical health so much that I don’t feel like putting the work in to do so. I used to be a super motivated person, I had an amazing work ethic and a drive to do anything I wanted, but I’ve lost that. If I need to do something for someone I will get it done and make sure it’s done right, my problem is that I will try getting out of doing it before hand. I’m so mentally exhausted that i can’t do normal things like jump on a trampoline or go mountain biking like I used too. I just get so worn out over the smallest things. I’m tired of existing and I just want a 10 year break from life but I know I can’t get that. I feel like I was so hard on myself when I was younger that It wore me out so now when I actually need it I don’t have it. I just don’t know what to do"
1133,"I got problems, no need to divulge. In my recent experiences I've found it hard to find Any one to talk to.","The point is, detailing my problems in depth creates a very particular problem, with what I'm assuming, needs a tailor made response. What I've come to learn is that it's an equation of a few common types of issues. Each differ from their own. One common part of the equation is lack of expression, being totally misunderstood &amp; feeling completely lost. I don't expect that anyone out here will balance my equation, but I know that even discussing it may help. I'm not asking for a therapist here, just someone who can relate....in any way! Just wanna put it out there that I'm up for helping, which in turn will ease my problems. Just kinda relieving talking to someone who has also felt in any similar way!! That is all! Feel free to message about anything! Even distraction has a positive part!! Take care"
1134,I still feel guilty for the people I lost during my depression phase,"Two years ago, I have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, panic disorder and BPD.
I used to have suicidal thoughts and self-harmed a lot. 

During that time, I was dating a guy, he was energetic and kinda brought happiness back to my life,
But that didn't last long..
 Once I started telling him about my darkest thoughts, how I self-harm, my suicidal thoughts, he started to back off and started ghosting me until he eventually broke up with me, after only 4 months of dating,
His excuse was that he couldn't handle my negativity and that I overwhelmed him with bad vibes.
I loved him so much and I didn't deserve being dumped in that way.

It has been one year since I stopped taking my meds, and I can say that I am happy again and free of negative thoughts.. 
But this idea of being dumped for having mental illnesses still hits me hard everytime I remember it, and I developed a fear of being in a relationship."
1135,I just want someone to hold,I just want physical intimacy but I can't have that nobody in my life care that my needs aren't being met they think I'm obsessed. I don't want to end up raping someone to make things change but if nothing changes soon enough I'm afraid I won't be able to stop myself.
1136,Losing control; I need help faster than they can give it to me,"My gf broke up with me 4 and a half months ago and ever since then I’ve been spiralling out of control.

I can’t stop stalking her on social media, (despite it being on private) my ocd has shifted massively toward her and I can only daydream about what she’s doing - I’ll get heavily depressed for hours at a time and then feel on top of the world for about an hour before falling back into depression.

I’ve had mood swings all my adult life but normally they last longer than this - I can be randomly depressed for a few days before getting happy again but this is something else. It’s like my mind is snapping in two - happy, sad, happy, sad. Thoughts coming on at a mission miles per hour. It’s been like this for four and a half months.

I thought, after learning she’s moved on and dating someone else, I’d be able to stop the madness but it’s only made it worse. This is like all the problems I’ve suspected myself of having over the last five or so years (mood swings, anxiety, hypochondria, ocd, delusions, addiction, fantasies, depression) on steroids. God, every day is a drag. I hate waking up because I just go through the same cycle.

Even when I’m “happy”, like, sometimes I get this sudden burst of amazing happiness that knocks me out of depression and I used to be able to use that energy to focus on my work or something but now it’s just sporadic, I can’t control it, can’t focus, it’s driving me up the wall. Sometimes I lie on my bed just waiting to hear voices (I don’t) but I just want to confirm that I’ve actually snapped, gone off the deep end.

This week I phoned my doctor and got referred to a CBT therapy place, I had an assessment but they said that the NHS cannot provide me with a therapist for at least a few months and I sure as hell cant afford private since I don’t have a job anymore.

I don’t know what to do, i can’t live like this, I feel insane :( apart of me just wants to order a handful of random anti-depressants off of the dark web and just take them, see what happens - can’t be worse than this."
1137,I don't know what I am.,"I'm not attracted to anyone. Romantically or sexually. Never have been, never will be (hopefully, maybe). But I feel pathetic. 

My family expects me to marry and all that stuff. When I tell them, they respond with a ""we'll see."" and scare the hell out of me. I can't consume any media with that stuff in it bcuz I might get a panic attack. The days I'm ok with it, I yell at myself for not being good for anything if I can't be in a relationship.   


My friend is ace too and has it way worse than me. She recently came out and her parents beat her (I mean they do that for everything but still). People stalk her for it. I feel like I should just be grateful that it hasn't been a problem for me. I feel like I should just get over it and... well destroy my life. But also I don't feel like I can live with that much pain. I don't want to seek it out, but sometimes I just think that if anyone did anything... at least it would motivate me enough to end it.  


TL;DR I hate myself for not being straight."
1138,my dad doesn’t understand anything,"this is also kind of a vent w a question at the end so if u don’t wanna read it then it’s alright cuz it might be long


when i was really young (like in elementary school) my parents would be really terrible to me. i don’t want to say emotionally abusive because idk if i should use that term but they would yell at me for the tiniest things, and hit me (just wanna say i’m asian so the hitting part is relatively normal with lots of immigrant asian parents). this basically made me hate them and force me to suppress my emotions otherwise i would get yelled at, among other stuff, again. now i’m a teen and i feel kinda miserable a lot of the time, cuz of lots of physical issues n stuff. the last couple years have been a lot better with my parents and i thought they were beginning to understand me. i don’t smile much or talk much (i don’t talk much cuz of some random physical thing, probably puberty or some crap) but my dad constantly yells at me to smile even when i am feeling like shit. it is so hard for me to force a smile, and when i force it, or smile genuinely, he doesn’t acknowledge it. but when i don’t smile once, he goes up to me and says “smile!” with a. sarcastic tone. when i do smile, he says “oh hey he’s smiling! good job!” which pisses me off so much i have to punch myself to keep me from exploding. when i don’t talk (cuz of the physical limitation which i don’t even know what it is called), he yells at me for not talking but i remind him every time that reason. he forgets (or maybe doesn’t believe me) and still yells at me. i don’t know what i should do now because i can’t talk to them either; he is stuck in the mindset that men can’t be vulnerable and that i shouldn’t talk about my problems."
1139,very gloomy past week :(,"for the past week (almost two) ive been super tired, i dont enjoy everyday activities and i dont even
enjoy communicating with my friends and boyfriend too much. i sleep either too much or not enough and i barely eat. my diet consists of a few pieces of fruit or veggies and a small portion of chicken or protein for dinner. no breakfast or lunch. i just dont get hungry anymore. nothing is rlly bothering me im just bored and tired of being locked up in the house and i try to get in a good mood in hopes my appetite will come back. it still doesnt :("
1140,Failure,"My diseases have won. 

My social anxiety caused me to hide and isolate my whole life, I dropped out of high school because of it, I never grew or made friendships because of it. 

My depression caused me to be apathetic towards life. It made me hate myself and believe that I am worthless. It caused me to fall behind in classes and fail college 3 separate times.

My ADHD has made it too hard to learn and focus on the things that would have set me up to be a successful human/adult. 

My insomnia caused me to have unproductive days and unproductive nights.

I am 26 years old with nothing. No friends, no career, no degree and maybe worst of all no memories. Almost every day for the past 9 years have bled into each other"
1141,Is there any one disorder that has all of the following symptoms.,"Agoraphobia, depression, rage, superiority complex over intellect but an inferiority complex over inability to interact with people correctly, delusions of being a deity that is being punished by being forced to live a human life, obsession with sex but not actually enjoying the procreative act nor homosexual intercourse but only enjoying sodomy of a female or the fondling of the breasts of a woman &amp; all other sexual acts being boring to actually perform but fascinating in the academic sense. Also I have an obsession with purple and idky. Also linguistic prescriptivism. I also enjoy the macabre but that’s practically seen as normal these days."
1142,A void,"Hey y’all, didn’t want no one seein this so I (18M) made a burner. I’ve been feeling a void lately, it’s absolutely horrible—it’s like when I’m not distracted or in the middle of something it’s always there, and even when I am doing things it’s sometimes there. Only really exhilarating things really get me in a groove, like parties, drugs, new people to meet etc. I’ve been having a really tough time with meaning lately and honestly don’t feel anything for anyone or anything, nor do I feel anything back from them. I don’t feel any real sense of love or friendship, and could care less about most material things. I almost feel like I’m a sociopath or something—I manipulate people to like me it feels like, I don’t care much about anything, I don’t feel love. I used to be such a kind hearted person and had so much empathy, but it doesn’t seem to be within me anymore, life jus don’t seem right. I been practicing Buddhism and that’s been helping a bit with finding compassion and connectivity again, but it never lasts more than a day or two. Idk what to think anymore, any thoughts are appreciated."
1143,it’s been too long since i’ve actually lived life..,"hi, i’m 16 (f) , i’ve been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety, general anxiety + an eating disorder. the last few months have been fucking hard. i don’t do ANYTHING, well at least nothing that i find meaningful, i just cant. im a deeply passionate and creative person with zero drive to actually make anything and i feel i’m just wasting my time everyday. i was out on this earth to create, and im just..not doing it. why is it that i spend more of my current life sitting in bed for hours not doing jack shit, more concerned abt what i had for breakfast rather than experiencing life. i see my friends, i’ve tried to pick up skate boarding, i love fashion and it’s something i’ve been somewhat able to put energy towards but for the most part it’s all unfufilling. how do i get myself out of my bed with so much fear and negative self talk? im not good at anything, not by my standards at least. i have a job, i contribute to society but i want to feel PASSIONATE abt life!! what can i do on my own time to , attempt to live life again? 

note: i’m on antidepressants and have a therapist so other suggestions would be preferred :)"
1144,i get overwhelmed easily (?),"hi! i wasnt really sure where to put this post, but thought that the mental health subreddit was probably a good start. ;) (also im on mobile so sorry for any strange formatting).

so, i tend to get, like, overwhelmed (?) easily. im not sure if thats the best word to describe it, but i cant find anything on google and i assumed that people here might have some answers. 

like, if im stressed, ill get to the point where i cant handle anyone saying pretty much anything to me. like anyone trying to talk to me makes me feel like im going to cry. and like ill have a LOT of trouble focusing when i get like this, and ill have a lot more energy. like ill almost have the urge to cover my ears. 

like for example, when im taking a test and the classroom is noisy, my legs will start bouncing, ill have trouble keeping my hands still, and ill sometimes have to shut my eyes and cover my ears because i cant focus on what im reading because of the noise. sometimes its not even that loud, but ill freak out anyway and reread the same sentence over and over and over without registering it. 

this doesnt happen super often, but im just curious as to if there might be a reason. i hope everyone has a good day. :)

also, just for some more details, im 15f and have no other diagnosed mental health disorders, (though i suspect i have some but thats a story for another time lol)."
1145,I’m ruining my body and mind and I don’t know how to stop,"I 22F, have bipolar disorder, possibly ptsd, body dysmorphia with disordered eating.

I started taking lithium over a year ago while my eating disorder had me at about 8 lbs over how much I weighed when I was 13. I gained 15 lbs up from that and I couldn’t handle it and I started drinking a lot.

I am now still 15 lbs heavier than I was a year ago, I went off the lithium but couldn’t stop drinking, at most I take a break for about a week.
I’ve called in sick with anxiety over my weight gain and over being hungover and now I have only 4 days of work per week. I keep getting drunk and then eating the next day when I’m hungover.
I always feel bloated, my stomach usually hurts after I eat anything now, and I’m not a full blown alcoholic.
I’m not obese and I know a lot of people where I am are, but being 15 lbs heavier with how short I am makes me feel disgusting.

I used to lose and gain the same 10 lbs but now I can’t even get 5 lbs off before I gain it back either from eating too much or getting drunk.
I have work tomorrow, am hungover today and want to get drunk again bc it’s the only way I’m ok with myself or my body.

Right now I feel like I have a wall of responsibilities and things I need to be doing.
Like scaling a huge brick wall and if I slip up I have to start all over again. Nothing seems worth it. 
I need to get my license, save money, change my living situation because I hate it, stop binge eating, get my taxes done, clean my apartment more, get into physio therapy because I can’t fucking walk properly.

Because I’m not an alcoholic and because I’m not obese no one in my life is going to consider my complaining to be anything other than melodramatic.
I live in a smaller town, alcoholism and drug use is common where I am, most people don’t take care of their bodies, if it’s not drugs and alcohol it’s food.

I’ve gone from accidentally punching myself in the ribs trying to pull my pants on to looking like I must be a month pregnant. To other people it’s not a big deal but to me it makes my body unbearable.
If I never started taking lithium I never would have gained weight, never would have started drinking, and I probably wouldn’t be in this situation where I drink as soon as this is bothering me. 
On top of that I feel like all of my childhood dreams and all my interests and stuff mean pretty much nothing. I am the oldest of my siblings with the least to show for my life. I just get to be the messed up one. My expectations for myself were super high up until recently and now I just try to hold my min wage job and not get fired and feel physically ill all the time.

There’s a lot going on with the other people and the (maybe) ptsd so I just wish I didn’t have to go to work and I could just hide and starve myself back down by 15 lbs but I have responsibilities and after 10 years of cycling through eating disorders I’m just too tired to do both and I can’t just eat normally either.
I keep trying and failing to lose the weight and keep trying and failing to quit drinking and now I’m sick and uncomfortable socially and physically, constantly."
1146,"It's strange that one is able to share and open up to a stranger, but sometimes cannot open up to the close ones. If I could talk to someone or just see what people think of my disjointed thoughts.","All this kept me awake all night and often impact my sleep. So I wrote them out randomly today on my phone and then thought of posting here.


My mother thinks I'm an arrogant, dumb, good-for-nothing guy who's too proud of himself, so much so that I don't know how to talk to people, thinks he's always right, who's nothing more than what his father is. Just as dumb and unwilling to learn as him. And because of all this I'll always get dumped by anyone and end up alone, unless I learn things from her. I have a younger brother too who likes me, admires me.
They say a mother knows her kids the best. 

But I'm introvert, a hopeless romantic and want to learn as many things as I can and also do well in my life. I want to travel and learn more about the world. I like to click pictures and want to have a big fat album of my lifelong memories that I can show to my grand kids.
I want to end up with someone in a lifelong romantic relationship. 

The things that I am and want to do seem better than what I wrote above.

The second girlfriend dumped me for no reason a few months back.
I miss my first girlfriend. I ended things between us and she and others say it was a good decision. I could've done things better with her. 

I need someone's help. I want someone to talk to. I want to open up to somebody. I miss crying while hugging her. 
It's very freeing to be able to cry while hugging your love. 

This too shall pass. Are you sure this won't affect me in some ways? 

I have been reading and learning things about history, space. I want to learn more about physics, the subject I dreaded in school. I'm fascinated by the stars and I want to click picture and identify the stars in the sky. Astrophotography is fun. Photons after traveling light years of distance captured, by my small camera.

I want to block out the family drama from my mind, until I can get out of here, for my job at sea. Covid messed up an already bad situation.

I want to be alone but also have someone to love and trust and be with. I want to have more friends too if possible. 

I like the concept of being a polymath. How will I do that? Lead a comfortable life and yet achieve all this that I want.  There's a lot more I want of myself. 

I want to be this cool calm and composed guy who would be emotionally secure and controls his destructive emotions. I don't want to get angry often. I want to be master of my emotions. 

I want to be happy. And I don't want to be alone. I have people around but I feel alone. I want to apologize to everyone I've hurt. 

Do I sound idiotic? Or I need help? Why am I always do doubtful about my thoughts?"
1147,"What micro aggressions have you experienced or observed in regards to mental health, disorders, illness, and disabilities?","I’ve been trying to put into words some of the micro aggressions I experience or have experienced in regards to mental illness, disorder, and disability and I’m struggling to put it into words because my frustration gets so strong that I can’t think clearly. I think that listening to what others experience could really help me have more mental clarity here. 

I’d also like to learn more about the experiences of others, and maybe even how their socioeconomic position influences the stigma they encounter.

1148,A Question About A Medication?,"I took Latuda last night at the last meal of my day, just as it says on the bottle...and I was feeling very peaceful and quite calm for a while. Then, about 5 hours later, I started feeling TERRIBLY TERRIBLY restless and like I had no control over myself (just an urge to tense up my whole body and then release and also to shake my head and body really hard) and the sleepy feeling that I'd had just popped out of existence like it was never there in the first place! It took me FOREVER to fall asleep and then I slept about 15 hours into this afternoon! What in the WORLD was that? I have severe anxiety and I have a feeling that it had been triggered in a BIG way. I do have another appointment (telemedicine) appointment with the psych next week, but I don't know if I want to take that medication again at all. I am scared to. I am also on Luvox, which has no side effects that I can see yet. I took that medication in the morning and the Latuda in the evening so it couldn't have been an interaction...could it? I felt GOOD after taking the Luvox, as if the brain fog that has been bothering me (as well as the depression) had lifted a bit and I was able to find humor in things, etc. again.

&amp;#x200B;

UGH. I am not sure what the hell happened but it was scary as fuck. I went to bed around 11 pm (that is HORRIBLY early) and I didn't fall asleep until after 2 am.  


Anyone have any insight? Thanks in advance!"
1149,Celebration of life?,"I’ve decided not to celebrate my birthday anymore. I’m going to be 26 this year and I feel like I don’t have anything to show for it..

Why can we not just give each other space to grow and learn and try."
1151,I don't trust my brother.,"So basically the title explains it. I was always protective towards my stuff, and i never shared any of the things i most cared of with others. Not even with my little brother, we never really shared anything. Like, i am mainly talking about my computer, which is one of the most expensive things i can ever own and i care a lot about it. I basically live  with it: i study, i practice my hobbies (like i am recently learning 3D art thanks to the time the quarantine gave me) , and you got the idea. and i will never, NEVER, let anyone touch it. I share my room with my brother, and when i am not at home i always get a little anxious because i can never fully trust him. He doesn't really care about his and other's stuff, and he often broke everything he had and i fear that he will do the same with my PC, even if he is not allowed to touch it. I might sound stupid i know, but this is really driving me a little anxious. What should i do?"
1152,please I need to know that!,"is it the same elsewhere, 

here in Algeria, as soon as they notice a schizophrenic person, they hypnotize him to want to have sex with his sisters.

my uncle who is schizo have it, I am schizo and I have it and I know a brother of someone has it as well, they all reported they can't leave them with their sisters around.

I thought it was schizophrenia thing, but I searched all around, there is no such thing in the schizophrenia trouble.

and I searched people who they really like their sisters, I found it happens in teen years, not my case or the case of my uncle, my uncle showed the schizophrenia symptoms in late 20's and he was already married and have kids, just after his fall, my family reported he likes my aunts, and I don't remember at all I have any attraction to my sisters when I was a kid or a teen."
1153,Every day,Almost every day I have suicidal thoughts. I thought that maybe I could live for the feeling of happiness but I'm suicidal even when I'm happy. I have a session tomorrow and I am losing it. I hope it helps.
1154,I’m not sure,I know I should be grateful for this but I just don’t feel mentally well to go back to work as stuffs reopening in my country due to covid. I feel super anxious about going back tomorrow and my whole family doesn’t understand and cannot support me one bit
1155,Don’t Have Access to a Therapist?,"I have a feeling I may have some kind of mental health disorder, but don’t have access to a therapist? What can I do? I’m 17"
1156,I regretted openinh up to someone,"So idk if this is the best place to put it but i feel safer to put it here for some reason. Now i dont have alot of friends and there r only 5 people prolly whom i have completely opened up to about my depression and anxiety and past. 
I recently had a weird heart to heart on call who over whelmed me by telling me how close we are and stuff. NOW DONT GET ME WRONG, i like her and i am ready to support her and any of my friends when they go through stuff which is why ppl usually come to me but this gurl kinda made me open up even tho i didnt want to. Idk why i did and im not blaming her at all. But yah i dont really feel as connected to her as she does with me. This does make me feel like an asshole but yah :((
After opening up to her my brain keeps thinking of the past because if out the 5 other ppl i opened up to only 2 of them are still in my life, the others just turned out to be fakes... which is why i never open up to people. I just have trust issues with people i guess.
I am definitely overreacting and being weird about it but ig i cant do anything. I just had to let it out... coz i wish i could take it back u know. Now i feel like weird and cant properly converse with her about stuff. I wish i was more normal idk how people open up so easily :(
Has this every happened to any of u?"
1157,Need A Break,"I don’t have a close relationship with family members. When I was younger I was always subjected to the insults and not feeling wanted, which has sort of shaped me now as I feel not good enough. They also don’t care much about where I’m going with my life and don’t give me any support. We’re are a very poor family and I feel like people are getting easy rides into their future and I have to do everything myself.

This year has really not helped me much, the only ambitions I know I want to achieve it to travel ( I know not original), but I’m not going to be able to do that now with no money from no jobs going and travel bans, and then I’ll be going to University. Well I hope I do go, but I’m scared of the financial implications looming over me for a long time and the possibility of the whole thing being a waste, with the degree being useless. 

 Im lucky enough to have a reasonable amount of friends but talking to them will only lead to them using what I say as group jokes as that’s sort of the culture. ( Like everyone ‘banters’ and expect you to handle it but some times I’m not able to and feel hurt but I can’t show it)

I feel like all my friends are making strives in the right direction in their lives by forming relationships, working. And I feel like going to university is a huge risk on my future as I want to be far away from where I am currently to form a new path for myself. I only have a few connections with the other sex and would like to form a relationship as I would like to feel loved for once and to have a chance to show mine (sorry this sounds a bit corny). I just don’t know how I’m just too anxious to do anything, even though I’m very friendly with them.

My days currently are very repetitive and dull, I just think it’s making everything worse. The only shining light has been my dog and I cherish her for always making me happy but I don’t think it’s enough.

I feel like writing this has helped a bit to clear my mind, sorry if you do read this and there is errors. I would like to speak to people if they are in something similar maybe we could help each other I’m not sure. I might remove"
1158,I'm scared it'll start again,My boyfriend started off amazing  dont get me wrong he still is....he just lies to my face a lot. Its starting to scare me because my abusive ex started off great too and turned into a monster. I try to talk to him about it but I don't get anywhere. Our relationship  is amazing other than his lying brings back the fear of my ex and I get scared. Also been having a lot of nightmares about it. I love this man to death but I just wish he wouldn't lie to me..
1159,People who are trash.,"Once upon a time there was a young man. He was poor and broken. The youngest in a broken family. The most damaged boy you could imagine. He met a girl. Who tore his heart out and laughed about it. But deep into the night she wept. For the boy did not get mad. He loved her. One night the girl laughed at him to further the act of betrayal( a common way of gaining what these low life scum call ""clout"") The boy was furious. For the first time he got angry at her. And gave her one last chance at forgiveness. She refused and the boy left. He ingnored her constant attempts to make him love her again. The boy held strong. Until one day the boy looked into another girl's eyes and felt nothing. He looked back and realized he had lost it all too that night. Now he spends his days being tortured by the vile creature that once used to be a cowardly human girl."
1160,Years of social isolation,"I’m so depressed by hearing all the experiences people had in their childhood and teenage years.

I was homeschooled from a really young age, and my parents were extremely protective. The only source of communication I ever had was through online games. So I’ve never been out with friends before, never communicated with anyone in person. It really messed me up in many different ways. 

I’m now 19, recently Graduated from high school(still homeschooled). I thought after Graduating, I could get a job and meet people. But then Covid came around. 

And it has surprised me how badly this whole social distancing has affected peoples mental health, because I always though I was just a big baby over it. My life has been like this since about 4th grade.

And I’m finally gonna be able to get a job soon because my town is opening up, and I need to aquire my drivers license first. 

But now I don’t know how I’m gonna even do the job interviews. I’m so awkward, and bad at socializing in general. 

I literally feel mentally disabled or something because I don’t know how to hold a simple conversation , how to act in front of everyone, or handle little social situations. 

I like I can’t relate with anyone at all. And all around I feel like an outcast."
1161,[Advise plz] How To Support My Depressed Mother,"Hi everyone. I just want to seek some advice on how I can support my depressed mother.
My mother has been depressed since she got abruptly fired from her job recently for no good reason (her boss is heartless as hell!), and a few years ago our dad passed away due to cancer which majorly affected us emotionally. 
Currently, I live away from my mother and work in a different place; but since my mother has been depressed to the degree that she doesn’t feel like eating anything, cries almost every morning, has sleeping issues etc, should I take some time off of my work and stay with her for a while? What is the best move to take?? I’d love some advise from y’all!!!"

1163,How to break it off with a therapist and find the right one,"I've only seen this therapist twice. After the 2nd session it was clear to me it wouldn't work. Her style feels very prescriptive and activity based (ie draw a picture) vs what I would prefer which is to have time to talk and process my feelings {feel understood} around a traumatic situation. We've only talked twice and she's already assigning me homework to help me feel ""empowered"" when I don't actually feel disempowered. She's not listening deeply, but more waiting for an opportunity to perform her knowledge in any way even if it's not applicable.

I'm an adult. I know I can just call and have the difficult moment of saying, ""We're not a good match."" and then move on, but how do I go about finding a good match so I don't have to keep breaking up with therapists?"
1164,Is it normal to for your mind to wander when watching tv or playing a game?,"Had a lot on my mind recently and I find whenever I try to focus on something like a movie or playing a video game that my mind can kind of just suddenly stare into space kind of thing

Is this normal?"
1165,is this a problem?,"i don’t understand what’s wrong with me. for as long as i can remember, i’ve been obsessed with how i look. i take hours to get ready before i go anywhere, and though my parents don’t say it, i know they think i’m vain and shallow. they tell me to not focus so much on how i look, that others don’t focus on your every flaw, but no matter how much i tell myself this, i still find myself looking in the mirror every chance i get. 

i’ve always felt like something was wrong with me. when i was ten i started wearing concealer because i had started getting acne, and i felt like i couldn’t go out anywhere without it being covered. this went on for five years until my acne finally died down. for five years, whenever i went for a sleepover, i’d wait until everyone was asleep to take my makeup off, and wake up extra early to apply it on again. i never went swimming with my friends in fear my makeup would come off, and had to endure people telling me everyday that i was wearing too much, or worse, whispering it behind my back. even when i went to germany to visit my grandparents, i always had to have layers of makeup on, or i’d freak out. i was so convinced everyone would notice and care if one pimple wasn’t covered, and i drove me to the point where i just didn’t want to go outside anymore.

this obsession has focused on numerous parts of my body. my acne had always been my main focus, but over the last couple of years its shifted back and forth between a handful of things. at the beginning of eighth grade it was my eyebrows. i was stupid and plucked them for the first time, resulting in my eyebrows being shorten by at least half of what they used to be. to try and fix them, my mother gave me one of those gel eyebrow brushers. i’d spend an hour if not more in the morning, brushing my eyebrows, trying not to get a hair out of place. it made me constantly late to school because i couldn’t leave my house without them being ‘perfect’, or at least what i thought was perfect. if i had to leave before they were, i’d have either a major panic attack that ended with me curled up in a ball on my bed, or a rage fit that resulted in my room being torn apart. even when i left to go to school, every hour i had to go to the bathroom and fix them again. it got to the point where i missed a whole class just trying to fix my eyebrows. 

by january, my eyebrows had grown back well enough, and i no longer needed the gel brusher. it wasn’t even two weeks before another thing caught my eye. i started noticing there was a small shadow on my nose, and no matter how many times i piled on makeup, it wouldn’t go away. soon the panic attacks and rage fits started again, and no matter how much i wanted to just walk away, i was always pulled back to the mirror. i started missing classes again, and even during them, all i could think about was how i looked and if anyone noticed the shadow on my nose. i started hiding my face behind my hair and hands, and though i know no one noticed nor cared about the shadow, i couldn’t stop myself from obsessing over it.

ninth grade was better, or at the beginning at least. my eyebrows grew back to normal, my acne was well under control, and i switches makeup brands and could no longer see the shadow. i was finally happy to go to school and for people to look at me, and i wasn’t spending that much time in front of the mirror anymore. that is, until my brain decided to tell me my nose was awful. throughout the years of my obsession, whenever something was finally going right and i was no longer focusing on a flaw, something inside of me would find something new to lose sleep over. 

to this day i still can’t look at myself without noticing how ugly my nose is. it didn’t bother me before, but now it’s all i can think about. it’s gotten to the point where i can’t watch tv without comparing myself to a character/actor and crying my eyes out. i’ve been considering a nose job for quite some time now, but i have no idea how to go about it.

do you think i should speak to someone? my mother suggested i go talk to someone about my problems a while back, but my dad thinks all teenagers go through this and i’m just being dramatic. he thinks i can just walk away if i really wanted to, but i don’t think i can. for a while i blamed my behaviour on my perfectionism, but now i don’t think this behaviour is normal. does anyone have any suggestions on what this is or if other people go through it? is this something i should be concerned with and talk to a professional about? i’ve never considered seeing someone before, mostly because i feel people have much worse problems than i do, so why should my silly problems matter, but everyday i feel like i’m slowing sinking and i don’t know what to do."
1166,Im living in my imaginative world,"I'm 16F and ever since I was young, I've always talked to myself and had an imaginary person in my head. It's been getting worse over the course of the last couple of months, I have made this imaginary world where I have a trustworthy friend and I'm actually talented in various ways and popular and all that shit. Now, in real life, I'm failing school, have fake friends, not popular whatsoever or talented in anything. I'm not doing anything productive in real life at all. So, whenever I get hurt by something in my real life, my brain immediately goes to ""I don't need anyone, I'm smart and talented"". I feel like it's a coping mechanism at this point, and whenever I take a moment by myself to realize that none of that shit is true, I end up crying myself to sleep. I can't stop living in my imagination, I have stopped talking with my family and friends and have started talking to myself only, it's affecting my grades and social life. Please help."

Please don't try to relate to this to something innocuous like day dreaming, *it's not.* I've literally been doing it since I was a child. It's not that I just repeat what I'm thinking. I appear to be in some highly suggestive state when it comes to the things I repeat. Once when I was 8, in a foster home my foster dad told me there was a bear sighted in town when we were camping in the back yard and that it was after me cause of my teddy bear. I don't fucking know *why* the dude said that, but... Either way, I forgot about it but got woken up in the middle of the night to my foster dad yelling about me ""not shutting up about the bear"". I was confused. I hadn't even been thinking about this bear. In fact, as far as I was aware, I was asleep. That's just one example. I've found alphabet soup I've written on my mom's phone that I have no recollection of typing. This one kid made fun of me when I was younger for doing the same thing on a computer without realizing it. Apparently he could see it and I can't. Like my mind blocks or fragments awareness. The closest I've been able to find is a functional neurological disorder or a subtype of Avoidant PD. I ran away from my home town and ignored everyone I know for 7 years. I'm probably gonna kill myself if I don't find an answer soon. I can't go to school. I can't get a job. I have to hold water in my mouth to go anywhere so that can't hear me babbling. I also go places without realizing it. It's not multiple personality disorder. Don't suggest lame ways to cope. Then you obviously shouldn't be on this post. This is rape. I feel so contaminated. There is no protective membrane between me and the unwanted taint of others' touch. Someone help me. But I don't think anyone has any answers. And yeah, I've gone to a fucking doctor. All I need is an answer. I can't take this anymore. I've become profoundly sick because of this. I have no privacy in my own head. My sanctity has been violated. People tried keeping it from me for years in an attempt to preserve my sanity. Which is odd because the few people I've mostly accidentally told have been completely dismissive towards me. Fuck em' all. I can't live life like this."
1169,Should I seek therapy for confrontational anxiety?,"Forty year old male, suffered from anxiety and major depressive disorder for as long as I can remember. Both have gotten significantly worse over the years and I have been seeing a psychiatrist for the better part of a decade for both issues. None of the pile of meds I've been on have had any significant impact on either issue.

So, anyway, long story short I have a real problem with confrontation. I hate getting into it with people and will avoid conflict at all costs, or just sit there and take the ass chewing, whether it be at work or home, but it's really starting to take a toll on me at home. I won't go into the details right now but I never feel like I can speak my piece to my wife and have her take it seriously. We've had some things going on lately and while she asks my opinion, she just seems to brush it off as soon as it comes out of my mouth, and I have no idea how to respond back.

I know this is all kind of a muddy explanation but I don't have the time to write out all the details right now.

I'm just wondering if it would be a good idea to look into therapy to help me with these issues I have with sticking up for myself?"
1170,How do u heal from a bad childhood,I grew up very isolated and rarely interacted with my family apart from arguments. I also got very little affection from my family and wasn't really allowed to have friends or do anything outside of school and soccer. I got rejected by every girl I ever liked growing up so I stopped perusing girls because my self esteem got so bad. I constantly wonder what affection and mutual love even feel like but I can't even imagine. I feel like no one had ever cared about me and I question if I am even capable of love. I recently started seeing a therapist and I'm wondering what's the best course of action to take in terms of fixing myself
1171,Crying for no reason and no sleep.,"So I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, correct me and I will delete. I'm using a throwaway account because I'm embarrassed to be honest.
So for the last 7 or 8 days I've been crying at around 2-3AM for no real reason. I've found it impossible to sleep until about half 3AM so I'll be scrolling through Instagram and see a post of someone I used to know or  something I really relate to and I'll start crying uncontrollably for about 5 minutes. I've never been one to cry at movies, books or songs. I don't have any mental or physical health issues (that I know of). I am a teenage boy and in general quite happy (although I have been feeling a little down the last weeks but I'm sure it's nothing to be worried about). Does anyone know why this is happening? Again - sorry if this is the wrong sub and thanks :)."

1173,What is this?,"Going over thoughts, certain family stories go and I realize that sometimes the stories hold truth in my waking state.

1174,Has anyone here been diagnosed with Paranoid personality disorder(PPD)?,"I recently read about PPD and all the consequences it has on people. I’ve read the whys, whens and possibilities behind this illness and I believe I might have PPD. I don’t want to self diagnose but the description matches 100% with me. “People with PPD also suffer from paranoia, an unrelenting mistrust and suspicion of others, even when there is no reason to be suspicious.” Symptoms are hold grudges, commitment, loyalty from other and or cheating ideas about your significant other.
I have all this symptoms including the rest. I grew up on a home were both of my parents cheated on each other because my dad was an alcoholic, my mom and me got kicked out of our home by my dad and forces to live with my moms family. I always thought my parents and family blamed all the issues on me. I’ve been cheated on before, betrayed by people, I hold grudges since I was a kid.. etc.. any advice or information on how I could get tested for PPD or your experience with this? Thank you 🙏"
1175,My story to how I got to a shitty point in life,"So ill try my best to explain my story and how I got to this point in my life

I grew up with a narcissistic dad, everyday he would berate me over the smallest things. He would call me degrading names which caused me to have low self esteem which led to me having social anxiety.

One day he gave me the option to go to another country and study there I was 14 at the time. I said yes because education in that country is better and I wouldn't have to live with him anymore. While in the boarding school life was just hell for me. Because of my social anxiety it was hard for me to function there. Imagine living in a boarding school in a country where your family in 10000km away with social anxiety. It's hell. What's worse the country I was staying at the people were a bit racist against my race because my race is known to be low level people there and usually just caregivers. So I encountered a bit of bullying which didn't help my self esteem at all. And I think because of it school staff also hated me

Fast forward to the end of the school year, one day I woke up with double vision. My counselor took me to the hospital where they did an mri and there it was a brain tumor.

Since I was a minor they couldn't treat me without my parents with me so they flew in the next week. I thought maybe because of the situation my dad would be different, but I was wrong he was complaining all the time about how he had to stay here with me bla bla bla

The doctors gave us a diagnosis but we suspected it was wrong and the medicine could disfigured my body(high dose steroids for months). So we asked my school if we could get a second opinion but instead they just gave us an ultimatum. Take the meds or you'll get kicked out.

 I couldn't afford to get kicked out because healthcare where I'm originally from is very bad and I didnt have insurance there. So instead of getting second opinion there we asked if i could take a 1 month break and go back to my country to get a second opinion. She agreed but once I landed in my country they sent a letter that I was kicked out. 

I was devasted. That racist bitch played us. So we contacted the people above her and tried to explain that we had her permission. They agreed and decided to let me back in. We got our opinion there and they said it was most likely cancer. 

So we flew back with this information and gave it to the doctors but those self righteous racist fucks wouldn't listen. So I had no choice but to go back to school and take the medication. 

And then I just started getting deeper and deeper into hell. The medicine that they gave gane me a lot of general anxiety and I would have panic attacks frequently it also made my social anxiety worse i couldnt even go to the cafeteria to eat. It caused me to have extremely painful cramps that sometimes would wake me up at night and i would be in tears. It made me gain 20 kilos within 3 months which caused my body to have fat deposits all over and my face became round. Also the weight gain cause me to have stretch marks everywhere and I mean everywhere my abdomen, underarms, legs etc which just worsened my self esteem. 

While on this medication my symptoms just worsened. My vision was deteriorating greatly. I noticed I was thirsty all the time and peeing every hour. I would wake up at least 4 times a night to pee. I was extremely fatigued all the time.

I complained to my doctor about it but he just brushed it off as side effects of the medication. Then after 4 months I experienced bad abdominal pain and got my blood tested to see that my liver values were through the roof(normal is 100-300 I think mine was 3000).the medication was damaging my liver. My dad managed to convince them to do another biopsy and finally those fucks diagnosed my cancer. 

The medication I was on suppressed my immune system which made my tumor grow bigger faster which caused the deterioration of my symptoms. My vision deteriorated so bad its hard to see. I also developed Diabetes insipidus which was the explanation for my thirst and peeing. I also developed hypothyroidism. All of these were permanent and couldnt be fixed. 

Throughout my treatment they continued doing more mistakes which gladly my dad caught but instead of thanking him for catching it they would be bitter they were caught. During my first 2 rounds of chemo my school refused to take me in the school car which is used to take children to the hospital. So we had to take the bus for my chemo treatments which was hard because I would be very fatigued after every infusion and it was 1 infusion per day for 3 days per round.

Finaly for the last 2 rounds they decided to take me to the hospital. But they didn't use the school car they ordered a $450 dollar taxi to take me there. I think the reason for this is they wanted people in management to see that im an expensive student so they would kick me out. They also told us the cost because I think they were trying to guilt us. 

So when chemo was over it was time for radiation. We flew to the US to get my radiotherapy. While I'm here I'm noticing symptoms of Ptsd. I'm constantly having flashbacks of what happened and everytime it's very distressing. I would become agitated if someone mentiones about what happened there. 

What they did to me was torture. I wish all racist fucks burn in hell. I'm having suicidal thoughts everyday and I swear the moment I land back there I'm gonna kill myself"
1176,Am I going to be murdered by my internet stalker?,"During quarantine I met a girl on discord,  we started playing games on the switch together.  I was bored,  she was bored, some days we played and talked all day.  She starting bringing her mental health and family issues into the conversations and having been a camp counselor for troubled youth, I tried to be as supportive as I could. Once I went back to work I explained I wouldn't have much time to talk anymore,  which really upset her. I did my best, but she started threatening to not take her meds if I didn't call her, calling my husband on discord when I didn't answer etc, etc. I felt bad for her,  and tried to understand her mental health issues. I tried to set boundaries and clearly listed what I am comfortable with/uncomfortable with moving forward. She agreed, then nothing would change. It was a continuous cycle of manipulation.  I completely blocked her from everything tonight,  and now am getting random messages from strangers,  threatening messages from strangers and she called my husband 40x and messaged him saying I was the only friend she's had her whole life and is devastated.  I feel bad, but the attempt at friendship started interfering with my daily life. Was blocking her the right thing to do? Should I worry about my safety? One night I had mentioned how much I like the name of the street were moving to, and received screenshots of her looking it up,  trying to figure out where I lived. I'm so conflicted."

1178,Broke up with my girlfriend I lost my virginity to and having bad thoughts," 

So I recently broke up with my girlfriend of two years. This was my first relationship and I also lost my virginity to her. She has been in 4 other relationships prior to ours. To make this post short, and not get too complicated, we connected on many levels and shared the same love language (physical touch).

So, I can't get the thought/thoughts out of my head of her eventually finding another guy and having sex with him. I just keep thinking about her having sex with another guy and these thoughts are just really bothering me.

I am also extremely depressed from the breakup. I just don't know how to get these thoughts out of my head/forget about them. I even went to confession the other day but I am still having these thoughts."
1179,Could it be that I’m developing schizophrenia?,"I’m 20 years old. I can’t sleep at night because I’m scared. I was sitting downstairs on the couch when I thought I heard someone knock on the window about 4 times at 3am. So I rushed upstairs to my room. A bit later I heard 1 knock on my room door. Then it sounded like someone took about 4 steps up my stairs. ITS SCARING THE SHIT OUT OF ME. 

It’s been een hour since then. I feel like I’m going crazy. That it’s all in my head. But it could just be that my house is making creaking noises. I can’t help but think “What if someone broke into my house?”. I can’t sleep. I’m so freaking scared.

Or do I just have some kind of panic disorder? I don’t want to develop schizophrenia. It’s one of my biggest fears."
1180,I’m so unhappy right now that I don’t know what to do.,"A friend of mine and I decided to take a break from one another. We were both so worried about each other that it was unhealthy. We depended on one another too much. I don’t know if we are going to talk again and that scares me. Like, I’m trying to be positive but it’s hard. I just don’t know anymore.

I am a protector within our system and I am so scared because if she does something rash she may die alongside myself. What can I do to help her right now? She wants to go away for good, she wants to die, she wants to integrate with me and I don't know what to do... How do I help her? I'm so scared.

1183,"Me, a sinking vessel.","If you noticed by my last posts (if you actually seen them) that I am a 11 year old boy that doesn't have a real reason to live.

Now, my Dad, he has been noticeably getting more and more angry. Probably because I am so burnt out and emotionally numb that I can't even get homework completed, or just live a normal life. I lied to him saying that I did homework and did things good. Welp, if you knew me personally with my dumb luck, that I am really unlucky, from my Dad being a complete asshole to me because it has gotten to the point when I did one mistake, he would snap at me. But my older brother when he does something wrong, no repercussions! I talked to my brother that I might have bipolar disorder due to how quick I change moods in a snap of a finger. And, my brother literally laughed in my face and said ""you don't have it! You just act dramatically! "" 

I feel scared of what my Dad might do to me if I cause a problem next time. My mother can't be with me this week since my parents are divorced, I wish my mother was here right now. She doesn't get mad at me for dumb reasons. 

Any help is appreciated greatly."
1184,help please,what should I do if I have a perfect life but still want to kill myself
1185,"Is there an illness in which a person believes he/she is being kept alive by some force? Like you physically can not die, no matter what you do?","I ask, because I feel this way. I’ve thought about killing myself, but have been too afraid to do so, and I don’t know why. I’m not afraid of death. It feels more like I’m just afraid of the pain. If it was a quick death that I didn’t have time to think about before it happened, I’d be fine. It feels like something is keeping me alive, almost like an experiment to see how long it takes for me to break.

I don’t know if that makes any sense at all, but I can’t think of anything else. I’m just curious. It’s like a god complex, only, I don’t feel invincible in the sense that I’m important or valuable. It’s not a narcissist thing. It just feels like I’m still here because my pain brings others joy.

Any ideas as to what this indicates, and what I should do to help it?"
1186,Is this adjustment disorder?,"For as long as I can remember, I have had a very difficult time with change. I transferred high schools two weeks into a new school after weeks of severe depression and anxiety and endless unexplained crying. I quit numerous jobs in high school after a day or two because of feelings of being overwhelmed and out of sorts. The new environments felt too surreal and I felt like I was so lonely I couldn’t possibly do well at those places (stupid I know after day 1 on a job). In college, I usually had 2-3 days of intense crying sessions and difficulty functioning after moving from home to campus every fall. As an adult I have had similar disproportionate reactions to things big and small in my life - a divorce (I cut myself some slack there) but also things like my sister moving out of my house and quitting a job/starting a new job. 

It has gotten to the point that I just know I will struggle with any relatively big change and kind of brace myself for it. And frankly try to avoid them. It’s usually 2-3 days of lots of crying, holing up alone, worries that I’ll never be happy again and nothing will be the same. But then it starts to ease up and before I know it I’m feeling fine again.

I’m worried because these occurrences kind of haunt me - I’m embarrassed by many of them in the past and things I did during them, like quitting jobs etc. I’ve made irrational choices because of these intense feelings. And now I worry about making future changes in my life because I know what the upheaval may do to me. I’ve lived in my current house 7 years and sometimes the though of moving out is terrifying. I look at other people’s lives and see how they switch jobs or move houses with seemingly no issue and I’m envious and confused as to why it appears so easy and carefree. 

It’s almost like I feel a bit paralyzed in my current life now. I’ve read about adjustment disorder and feel like I may have this, but curious to know others thoughts and recommendations."

This is a call for help."
1189,My [16F] mom [47F] just threatened suicide and I don't how how seriously I should take it,"Long story short, my mom and step-dad have never agreed on some fundamental things, and after 6 years together, everything is falling apart. 

My mom has extreme anger issues. She sees a counselor but it's not all that effective. My stepsister [17] made a snotty comment about doing the dishes, and my mom heard from the other room and came storming in. My mom overreacted WAY too much, calling my step-sister a ""fucking little bitch"" and other things along those lines. She didn't say it directly to her but to her dad (who was also in the room). My mom's actions were wrong on so many levels, even though a lot of what she said was true. 

My step-sister is not very well behaved and does make a lot of bratty comments. She was raised differently than me in an environment where that was okay, but I was raised to be a lot more respectful so I understood how it was wrong. She was never really taught right from wrong, and her actions lead my mom to be very verbally abusive. 

My mom has never even come close to being physically abusive, even though she has admitted to me in private that she's had intrusive thoughts of hurting and killing my step-sister. I very sincerely doubt she would ever act on those thoughts.

She's been deeply depressed most of her life, and her crippling relationship with my step-dad (partially because of his daughter's behavior, partially because of his own flaws, partially because of her issues) has put her over the edge. The last few weeks she's seriously been considering moving out, and even went to look at some nearby houses for rent. The problem is that she's too emotionally dependent on my step-dad, and doesn't have many other people who care about her other than myself.

She was suicidal all through her childhood, teens, and 20s. When she met my biological dad and had me at 30, she became a lot healthier. Then my biological dad became an alcoholic and she had to leave him, eventually meeting my step-dad  who, for the first few years, took away the pain of losing a relationship with my bio dad. After her and my bio dad broke up, she became suicidal again, but we t to therapy and got on medication and never acted on it.

Today, after her and my step-dad fought for a few hours in the garage, comes in my room to talk to me and say goodnight (it was around 10 o'clock). She left my room but right before she left she turned around and said ""I just feel like killing myself"" and I said ""Should I call the police?"" and she said no, she'll be fine.

I know to call the police because I was suicidal a few years back and she had to call the police because I was about to commit suicide and I know the process of going to the hospital and staying there. After a week in the mental health ward I got a lot better, and I thought maybe she could do the same.

But I also know my stay in the hospital costed a lot of money, and she doesn't make very much money at all at her job.

Should I call someone or just go to sleep? I'm tired as fuck and I've had the longest day, but if this is serious I can't risk losing my mom."
1190,Are all people miserable?,"Okay, so this is my second job after I quit my first job for a variety of reasons that all boil down to it being a miserable place to be. Everyone hated working there and it showed. I remember even having one guy walk out after maybe two months and not show up again. It was always that everyone, or at least almost everyone, was miserable all the time. In my new job, the environment is definitely more positive, but there is definitely crap going on (my manger had a nervous breakdown in the break room; another member of lower management quitting \[2 in a month, 3 in 6 months\]). The more I'm there, the more I see how much everyone is hurting. Is this just how it is? Are we destined to be miserable for the rest of our lives? I hate to be a downer, but I gotta know.

Also, if anyone has any ideas on how to help the situation, I'm all ears. I do my best to keep a positive demeanor, but I don't know what to do anymore."
1191,How to go about seeking help?,"Hi all, I’m a very reserved person when it comes to my feelings; I tend to feel so many emotions throughout my days (stress, anxiety, anger), and I have no idea how to control them so I tend to always (90%) lash out on my partner, using all the anger inside. This causes me add on more stress/anxiety/anger, ruining my relationship, and lack of sleep. 

I’ve had enough. I really want to seek out help but I feel so....scared, weird, embarrassed to do so. What is the first step I can take in order to seek help? I want to stop feeling like this."
1192,DAE parents start talking religion when you’re discussing MH?,"I decided to sit my parents down today and have a full-on conversation about my current mental health issues, as well as depression and my heavy suicidal ideation. Mid-conversation, my mom just brings up about finding faith, and that it “can heal me”. I told her that a faithful woman prayed for her cancer to go away, and it did, only for it to come back a few months later, so it doesn’t work. Finding faith, praying, has never healed anyone. Finding my way with God will never change the fact I want to die everyday. Why can’t parents stop finding a way around their children’s mental health and just accept the fact their child suffers? Why must they always take a religious route than a medical route? Why must they always invalidate their child’s feelings and concerns? Fuck."

1194,My mom has bipolar with psychosis. Help please!,"Hello there, my moms had this my whole life (I’m 25) and every 2-3 years in the summer she will relapse. Well last summer she had it and now again this summer, only now I think it’s worse. Even in the very early signs of it she won’t have anything to do with treatment and will get mad/change the subject. In the past, family has always put in a court petition or drive her to the hospital. Last year we did both and the petition was denied and the hospital did nothing. Everywhere I call or even the police dept says nothing to be done unless she is immediate threat to herself or others. Here’s what I’ve explained: she is having delusions/hallucinations-thinking she saw my deceased father and heard our dog getting slaughtered in the woods (not true), she doesn’t tell people where she goes or who she sees not even me, spends money carelessly and doesn’t open bills, she drives very slow on main roads and she would pull over if she saw someone she knows, her cars front bumper is hanging off 2 inches and she can’t remember how she did it, she’s all scratched up she says from going through the forest. It’s bad. And she thinks my step dad is the devil (she’s had feelings in the past of leaving him) he’s a good guy but doesn’t make her happy. She’s cleaning the house like manically to get away from him and move out (piles of stuff everywhere). Idk if she’s taking prescribed meds for it (doubtful). Any thoughts or ideas what to do?"

I honestly don't know what to do, this probably isn't the answer but idk what it. I feel like shit, is anyone willing to talk it out with me, I guess?"
1197,Suicide thoughts,I right now feel like hurting myself. I have been brave enough to do some harm. But do i really need to make a point? I really need to show that i am really hurt. I tried several ways to tell. one really doesn't get the fact right. And they think i am threatening or being sick. Which i know i am sick at this moment. how do i get control of myself back?
1198,Self hatred,"I feel like I could jump out of my skin. I’m so tired of seeing my face in the mirror, hearing my voice when I talk, feeling MYSELF remembering MYSELF just being this disgusting human being. I don’t ever have the motivation to write my thoughts in my diary anymore and thus I get super irritated and breakdown. I get this emotional spiral of 3 different emotions fazed into one complex emotion where I’m mad sad and terrified ALL at once...my face even shows it as my expression changes rapidly while I endure this, my mouth and eyebrows just spazz out of confusion. It feels like the only way out is to end myself or I just want to combat this by hurting myself because I just hate myself and want to hurt myself. (Don’t worry I’m not actually gonna hurt myself or kill myself...one I’m terrified of death and would like to avoid it and two I’m too afraid of pain to hurt myself.) I just despise myself and can’t believe that I’m stuck as this person for as long as I live it’s so disheartening. I want to love myself but anything positive directed towards me (calling myself beautiful or even trying to say I love myself) is so sickening to me and so gross and uncomfortable and I hate it. I don’t know where to start in self love. I’ve hated myself for 7 years and I hate EVERY.SINGLE. aspect of myself ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Anytime I look into it online I see one thing in common. All the stories are people who hate themselves for 1-2 different reasons and it’s usually either they hate how they look or they feel like a failure. ( not that there aren’t people out there who hate everything about themselves but I feel like there isn’t enough light on those people on the internet who actually show u how to overcome it) therapy isn’t an option for me at the moment...I can’t tell my mom I hate myself...I can’t...also my therapist is religious which I am not and I cannot tell my family I’m not religious...the therapist speaks religiously in dealing with my mental health which I do not agree with. I once told her about a panic attack trigger of mine and she told me it was a matter of trusting God. That was the end of that..."
1199,I feel like I'm relapsing from my Ed but it's different this time,"I have struggled with a lot of confidence and body image issues for as long as I can remember. It got really bad in my last few years of high-school. There was a lot of shit going on in my life at the time that no one should experience, let alone a kid and all at once. I needed to be able to control something as I felt my life wa spiralling out of control, so I turned go food and exercise. I found the only thing I had almost full control over was my food, I was already very active, but then I turned even more towards exercise as an excapeism. This was not a particularly good mix to say the least and I became very unhealthy very quickly.

When I went to college I got a lot more confidence and I actually felt happy for the first time in my life. I was doing so well, I became a personal trainer and I had so many new found hobbies and goals. But then quarantine came, I got stuck at home and all of these hobbies and my gym, wer taken away. I still had running but then I pushed myself too hard and got really bad shin splints. It was the last thing I had left, and I lost all control again.

I am fully aware that I am restricting and binging again but I can't stop it. And this time round I can't sleep at all, I don't have anything to do anymore to occupy my time and now I have just so much more of it. I spend it all thinking and it just makes it all so much worse. I got furloughed, I don't have college, and I don't have sports or hobbies anymore so there is no one I can talk to and nothing to hide me from myself.

This time round I don't have anything, nothing reasonable to blame it on, nothing to occupy myself, no social interactions. I've completely cut myself off from everyone and I can't sleep at all anymore. It's 5am, I just finished another binge session after a 2 day fast and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

I just don't want to hate myself anymore."
1200,I feel so alone,"I don't know if this fits here but I have mental health issues and I just need to say something to someone and I don't want to burden my friends and my family doesn't really care...
For the past 2 years I have been struggling with mental health issues and felt like I needed to be happy for others to not worry I thought I could put on a brave face around my friends and talk about it with my family but my mom just calls me irrational and my dad yells.
If I'm sad or angry I am forced to take a pill which just saps my emotions for a time calming me down 
I want to be happy but I feel I need to Express my other emotions not just bottle them up but that's all I can do I can't let my family know they just don't seem to care and I'm beginning to think my parents don't love me my mom has constantly put me down for every little mistake and my dad just doesn't care he still owes me money from when I was 10 and now I'm 15 finally asking for it I try to understand them I try to understand their problems and try to help but they don't do the same for me I just feel so alone."
1201,Does it ever get better,"This is a throwaway account, but I just wanna know. Everyday is really just boring and I can’t do much. (I’m terrible at wording things so I apologize) Every once and a while I’ll have some form of happiness, but it lasts a very short time and only happens at most once every month. I have basically nothing to look forward too. I don’t know if life is worth living if everyday is just the same boring linear stretch to just eat, and sleep. It doesn’t help that I have atrocious social skills, and every time I try to talk to someone I cringe afterwards. It doesn’t help that some people after talking to them think I’m a sped. I also feel bad for people because I’m just an ugly fat cow walking around and just a general eyesore. I’m not funny, intelligent, or have any redeeming qualities. I’m just a boring, ugly person who has nothing to live for. I’ve heard people comment on other people’s posts that it gets better, but so far for about the past 2 years it’s just gotten worse. I don’t know what to do anymore."
1202,"Breaking down after leaving a traumatic environment, I don't know what to do",
1203,Soooo should I try to get rid of my neuroticism?,"So I'm highly neurotic and I know it has a negative impact on my life, mainly preventing me from advancing in my career and socializing.

I know that I should work to get rid of it. But here's why it's so hard.  When I am neurotic, I feel alive.  I don't know why but when I'm in my neurotic state, I feel like I'm me and despite the worrying or negativity, there is a part that feels good and enjoys it.

Meanwhile, when I'm not neurotic, everything feels fake.  Sure it's nice to be able to socialize and be liked and what not but everything feels like a facade.  

Obviously the best solution would be to switch it on and off but that's not something I'm able to do as most of the time, I don't realize what state I and in until much later.  And switching is hard even if I know what state I am in.

So what is your advice?  Which side of me should I give up?  The side that's neurotic and real at the expense of accomplishing my life goals.  Or try to obtain my life goals at the expense of feeling alive."
1204,Not Sad But Still Wanna Self Harm?,"Title speaks for itself. I'm 14 and I have some serious concerns as to what is wrong with me. I haven't been diagnosed but my therapist is highly suggesting that I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, ADHD, and she's looking into Bipolar Disorder but that's not as strong as the other three. 
//
I started self-harming when about 2-3 years ago and have stopped for months now, but the urge is still there even when I'm not sad. It originally started as a coping thing for mental breakdowns but I've been feeling the strong urge to keep doing it. I liked the feeling somehow, of cutting myself.
//
Im very concerned for myself and I don't know what's wrong with me to non-depressively want to hurt my body.
//
If anyone has any idea what is wrong it would be appreciated. Thank you."
1205,People tend to see my social anxiety towards eating in public as an eating disorder and it really annoys me.,"I’m very thin naturally but completely healthy, I’ve always gotten comments about how skinny I am which lead to me being very uncomfortable eating in front of others. Now when I don’t eat people ask if I’m starving myself,but when I do eat they stare at me and comment on it."
1206,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,At first I just started having extremely low self esteem or at least that’s all I remember of it starting then it got worse and worse and sometimes I would move without meaning too like my neck would turn quickly or part of my face was twitching that’s just how I remember it starting then I started feeling worse and worse so I decided to research this and from everything I found it seemed like I had depression. So I kept feeling worse and worse. So eventually I somehow made myself tell my parents. Probably the hardest thing I have ever done. Then I found out that my mom doesn’t believe in depression mental illness or chemical imbalance or whatever and she thinks I’m not depressed anyway and that I just have anxiety. At this point the random neck turning and face twitching turned into my teeth chattering randomly and I could barely stop it. At first I thought that I didn’t have depression and I was just doing it for attention but then I felt all the cuts going down my arm over my arteries and that I told no one about this so I don’t think I’m doing it for attention I cut because I want to die and slit my wrists and for the pain that I deserve. After my I got my mom to explain to me why she thought I had anxiety I realized I probably do but from what I understand what’s happening to me can’t just be anxiety. I think mom noticed that I felt that she isn’t taking me seriously so now she refers to it as me feeling depressed which makes me feel that she is just doing that because I felt like she wasn’t taking me seriously which makes me feel that way even more. Talking to my parents About this makes me feel very very uncomfortable. My mom thinks that whatever she thinks is happening is because her and my dad where fighting. Also I’m 13. Now that my parents are actually starting to try to do something I feel super guilty and that I deserve to suffer and deserve to die and I can’t tell if I even want to get help at this point and every time I try to question it or question if I’m regally as stupid as I say I feel even more guilty and like I’m just imagining everything and it is for attention but idk now I’m just asking what am I supposed to do? Anyway this is getting kinda long so no one is really going to read it. If you did read it I’m sorry for wasting your time but thank you
1207,Mental Health Advice for Family Incident *sexual assault*,"Today I found out my father had an strange episode, likely cause of new medication and his state of mind. 
Background story: father &amp; brother shares a loving space with my uncle (my dads brother) &amp; wife kids. 
My dad has a history PTSD from early childhood, separation of 13-14years, 2 years out of work- but on disability due to work related injury. Currently seeing therapist but stopped due to covid. He's also suicidal &amp; has anxiety (My father doesn't get along with his brother &amp; his family that well- we're also not an affectionate family +kids are grown &amp;starting own life)

Here's the story the long story short:
 
My father woke up early morning, asking my aunt who was cooking for a hug because he said he was sad. (Mind u my father is antisocial) She hugs him, probably thinking it was strange but she felt sorry. 
My father then walks back to his room then seconds late come back to ask for a kiss. Naturally, aunt reacted say ""No, you are brothers-in-law.. etc"" Then my father said, ""okay, can I still get a hug?"" She gives him a hug but noticed he kissed her neck... shocked and uncomfortable with what happened, she calls her adult sons and told them what happened. 
Of course, they were ready to defend their mother (my aunt) but then they realized he wasn't in a right state of mind. My father's other sister, who is the responsible caretaker of everyone, rushes over to mediate and see what happened. Upon checking on my dad, she noticed that he was staring into space and when she addressed what went down, he cried and vented to one of the adult sons about his depression and anxiety, loneliness from mental isolation. They all felt bad and can move forward with what happened. However, there is still this lingering feeling from my aunt (victim of situation) that her stepdaughter may be unsafe around my dad.

I found out about this situation hours later with my siblings. Since I am currently living elsewhere, my sister lives with the responsible aunt, &amp; the only one who lives with my dad, is the first sibling who wasn't home at the time of situation.

I'd like advice on how would you mediate both parties, the victim my aunt &amp; my dad?
What are some short term &amp; long term resolutions? 

This has never happened, my dad isn't a sexual predator &amp; I believe it was the new medications +mental health. However, I do not tolerate this behavior and extremely disappointed that this even occurred. We as a family have decided, in order for him to get better he will move with my responsible aunt (his sister) so he can socialize and hopefully decrease his social anxiety &amp; dependency on medication for mental health. 

I'd like to call in a family counselor for everyone that was involved but since its still fresh in everyone's mind, I'd want for things to cool off first."
1208,"I feel so alone today, my place does not feel like home right now","My wife got committed to the hospital today (I don't know for how long yet) and its driving me crazy, I hate being at our place alone , feels like l'm in a strange home , I hate it."
1209,2020 has grabbed us all by the pussy,Did someone say thriving?? Because it sure as hell wasnt me. 2020 was one of the hardest years of my life. I got sexually harassed at my full time career and had to quit. My three year relationship just ended and I feel hopeless. I got a new job but then lost it due to corona. I’m terrified of where the world is and feel like I’m losing it. I’m hopeless anxious and depressed. I have constant suicide ideations and can’t eat. I feel like I’m spiraling and can’t use any previous coping mechanism. Anyone else in my boat?? Thanks for coming to my ted talks and please please drop any coping mechanism or traumas in the comments.
1210,Dreams about my mom who passed away,"Throw away for personal reasons , also sorry for the long post , but I promise this isn't a karma whore post. I just need to get it off my chest.

We just passed the one year anniversary of my mom passing away from brain cancer.

A little back story, it was very sudden. She had cancer for awhile, but it wasn't really getting worse....untill it did. In April we were told she had 6 months to a year, and then June she died.

The last few months were the worst times of my life. She was in so much pain, she lost all of her hair, the radiation treatment made her age 20 years in a week.

Anyway, when she died I was relieved.. so relieved, I felt guilty, and still do.

The day she after she died I had my first dream. We were standing outside our old apartment, and she said "" I really wish I could have at least died beautiful""  to which I said "" you are mom"" and then I woke up.

Then about a year without any ( other than weird ones, like me and her working at a video store), so the past week, I've been having dreams where either , we are told she is going to make it, and she recovers. Or the ones where it's like I can say what I need to say to her. To where I cry and tell her I don't want to lose her, and don't know what to do.( Things I never said while she was dying , I tried to be strong )

These dreams stay on my mind for days, and they break my heart all over again. I'm not really religious, but could these dreams be a sign? ( I really want to believe she is living it up in a afterlife , even though I don't really believe it)

Idk guys, I just don't know where to go from here, or what to do.

I'm lost."
1211,How to bounce back after so many failures?,"I'm 24. I have no friends, no job, I've never kissed a girl, still living with my parents. Last year I graduated college with a bachelor's in a ""useless"" subject. Tomorrow I'm interviewing for a minimum wage job at a retail store because no one will hire me. 

My family is amazing and supportive, but I've grown to resent them. They've become an audience to watch me fail. I wanted to be successful and make my family proud. Now I can barely even look at them, I just lock myself in my room all day. I'm humiliated at what I've become, I want to hide, I don't want anyone to see me.

I had a goal to learn computer programming so I could one day have a job where I can support myself. It hasn't been going well. I can't bring myself to do anything, it's like my mind is gone. I'm weak, defeated and useless. I sit in front of the TV for hours and watch Netflix. I hate myself for wasting so much time, but when I'm watching a show I get to escape my problems for a little while. That's all I ever want to do now is escape, just go somewhere else and forget about everything. Truthfully I'm afraid to start learning computer programming. I'm afraid I'll fail at that just like I've failed at everything else. When you fail so many times it starts to weigh you down to where it seems pointless to even try."
1212,"What exsactlly is ""wrong with me""","I'm not entirely sure how to start this off, this very question has been in my head for quite some time. Not weeks, or months, but a couple years. Ever since a YouTube video fell into my recommendations, I've been doing a lot of reflecting about myself. In fact, I've been doing a lot of reflecting of my whole life, everything I can remember, and I believe that's where I should begin. I use to be extremely compassionate, and completely empathetic of a kid, I believe religion had a lot to do with that. I would freak out on people for hurting animals, or bugs. I would say they where gods creatures, and that every life deserved to live. Mother noted I had some traits of someone with autism, from sensory, to my behavior. I could stare at a fan for hours, and watch static display on the TV we use to have. My parents ended up splitting up around when I was 4, and I was introduced to a new family that was rather the chaos soon to come. Step siblings didn't really get along with me, and in all honesty, I was alone. Of what I could remember in school, I had extreame fits of shouting and disobedience. I've always had that problem, and even to this day still find myself struggling to work with school. I believe it was middle school that changed me, I began to find an interest with science, and the Russian language. In elementary, I didn't have too many friends, in fact I was deemed insane by my fellow peers. No one really wanted to socialize with me, and I stopped caring about people. It wasn't hatred or anything, it was just nothing. For a while mother was guilty from the split up, and would buy me whatever I wanted. And because of that, I was used alot. I use to love giving my stuff to those who wanted it and was too unfortunate to get it. Now I've stopped caring, in fact, I don't even see why I even liked doing it in the first place, they where undeserving. Pathetic idiots that should've just wasted away. But in the end of the day, I was the fool, I was the one taken advantage of. Now it affects me the rest of my life, the sense of paranoia, and that everyone has their own dark intentions. While I was in late elementary to early middle school, I was into setting things on fire, and making firecrackers. I still love doing it, but I haven't done it in quite some time, I also use to do it almost daily. In 7th grade, I was looked at like the kid who didn't give a fuck, the kid who said what he wanted when he wanted, and they knew that I was alone. So they began to talk to me, they wanted to be my ""friend."" And lonly I was supposed to do? And ever since 7th grade, I would never be the same again. Went from a kid who was quiet until provoked, to a kid who had fun fucking with others, and especially authority. I was the class clown, and I would get sent to the principals office on a daily basis. My actions where based on pure impulsivity, I didn't want to be contained, I was beggining to feel a reputation that was my ticket to the top. What's funny is that to the select few who I told that I'm nothing like the act I am at school, they didn't believe me. And everyday I would come home to the realization that I'm still alone. So I began to preoccupy my time alone to become smarter. I would spend hours in front of a screen, learning anything I wanted, (mainly Russian, and physics) as I began to develope with my intellect, my narcissism also grew. Because of the lack of dealing with real friends, and the lack of seeing my true family, and being hated by everyone at home, I lost my sense of empathy. These traits affect me to this day, it makes relationships almost superficial, and usually involve me having to move from person to person. My relationships are rather intense for some, like having sex only after a couple of days of knowing each other. A feeling overwhelms my mind, turns into some sort of autopilot mode. Makes me believe I'm feeling love, but am I? I develope an almost parasitic attachment to my partners, and just only really need that spice in my life. To makout, and have sex, I could accomplish this with anyone really. Infatuation is the word that describes this feeling. Now I'm alone, debating if I should even consider a relationship right now with those who will only bring me down. I was put on this world to do great things, things in which spark my interests. I talk to my therapist about these things about me, asking why I think this way, even though I already know. And I act as if I care, when I don't, in fact, I never seem to do. I've had multiple people crying over family, pets, cheating, friends, all of which is unnecessary garbage. I would act like I care if there was a reason to, but most of the time I don't even show that I care. I can guilt trip who I please, and if they don't show any guilt or sense of submission, I can really drill into them. Make them feel like a terrible person, to the point where they hurt themselves. Is it for fun? I don't know anymore. It's more of satisfaction I guess, once you get me worked up, there must be a price to pay. I do have morals, I know right from wrong, but I don't really care at all. I'm able to convince myself in the moment to feel a certain way about something, and truly never really care. I consider it fake feelings to either appeal to someone, or to spark a reaction. Both traits developed in middle school. I'm still in school, still having episodes of emotions of anger and frustration, that can cause me to cry. Yes, I can cry, I can feel sadness, but it's very rare, and it's usually involving somthing around me. I still lack empathy, I never feel remorse or guilt because I believe everyone plays a part in some capacity. If I make you cry, I believe it's just you finally realizing your wrong. To the rare exception to those few who are close to me, I will try to make things better, because I do care. I don't regret the things I say or do, and I don't care much for your crying, but I'll try to make things better. I believe it's because of my abandonment issues from the past, (Friends and family) but maybe I do have a small amount of empathy left. I often fantasize about my goals in life, to be an inventor, to build and create my own robots, And creations. I also want to have a lot of money, because without money, I have nothing to sustain my hobbies. I also want to compose pieces of classical music for the whole world to hear, but it's too bad people don't listen to much classical anymore. Such a shame too, I'm called a genius on the piano, and organ, But I digress. I've considered interpreter because I was able to learn Russian on my own, but it dosent seem to exite me as much as robotic engineering. I will reach my goals however it may seem necessary, and I believe that I need to start developing a social plan to reach that high level. I'm failing at school because doing the work is difficult given my circumstances. And I consider going to jobcore. I don't plan on living with my parents, and I would rather work alone. I'm not much of the class clown any more, I stopped this year, I got tired of appealing to those around me, when there was nothing to gain anymore, I already had my reputation. I'm 17, and to my understanding, I'm diagnosed with O.D.D, (opisitional defiant disorder)  and depression. But I feel like there's a lot more. I believe I have a personality disorder. I know it's still very early to say such a diagnosis, but I've been like this for years, and it seems to not be changing at all. A couple of people who have autism believe I have it, 2 of my not too close friends, and my step mother who has a kid with autism. I personally don't think that's the case, but I don't 100% know. If I had a true friend to show me how to care and love, maybe I wouldn't be so cold inside, yet superficial on the outside. I haven't really told any of this stuff to anyone else in such great depths because I don't want it to affect me negatively. For the most part, I'm a nice person who doesn't thrive on primarily putting others down, in fact, if you where to meet me, I'm actually a very cool person, or so I'm told anyway. I still have very bad anger management, and can lash out over small things. But I'm actually very funny, and just make others laugh with my sence of humor. I'm not really manipulative because there dosent seem to be anything to gain from most people, unless it's a relationship, I don't know. But I can be a huge asshole with no empathy, remorse, or guilt, and can say or do things to spark a reaction, or debate. Im not someone to really cry too about emotions, but that dosent mean I hate you. I view emotions as weak. But if you are close to me, I'll try to help solve the problem by mapping out the situation and developing a plan to help you continue. Even if I invalidate your feelings, consider yourself fortunate enough for me to help you solve the problem. My close friends get mad at me often for invalidating their feelings, and then many months later realize what I said was completely correct, but they are still mad because I didn't acknowledge their feelings. I keep my friends in small numbers, and I don't say too much because I know better. I've done mbti personality quizes, and I got INTJ multiple times throughout the last 2 years. Is it really a surprise though? Reading about it, I realted heavily to the long description, and some of my friends agreed that it described me very well. I've only met one other INTJ, and he's actually one of the smartest people my age I know, and that alone interests me to friend him. I know I need to be around people like me, but seeing how rare it is, I know its somthing that isnt going to happen anytime soon. These traits of mine affects me everyday, and cause me trouble with relationships, friendships, and just people In general. If you have any knowledge of what I possiply could have, it would be greatly appreciated."
1213,I get insanely stressed out when people tell me what to do.,I don’t understand why but when I’m being ordered to do something or anything along the lines of that I get really pissed off and stressed out and don’t know what to do because I’m constantly snapping at people in my household and I feel like a dick.
1214,My story,"I think i use to be normal but since my family die im not the same . I was 7 years olds when my house burn whit my mom ,dad ,sister and brother. Im 17 years olds now im suffering of schizophrenia . I every night when im in the dark i can hear the scream of my mom . Todays as a goodbye letter i writed this as my last days alive"
1215,How do people maintain friendships,"I have a really hard time staying in touch with people and I don’t know how to keep up a friendship when I meet new friends. I have almost no friends right now and I’ve been feeling annoyed with the few I do have. I don’t know how people do it. I have such low self esteem that I don’t feel good talking to other people at university and those that I do talk to, I feel like I would never really get along with them outside of class. It’s so much harder than it seems and I never expected to be in this positions of being 23 with like no friends and not being able to make friends."
1216,what happens when time doesn't heal your wounds?,"Hi. 

I'll try to make this short. I have had severe depression and suicidal thoughts since early childhood. By age seven I knew that I did not want to live. I had an alcoholic, pathological, abusive father and an absent and narcissistic mother. I have blocked out years of my childhood. I feel the weight of those years every day. Through all of the slight ups and extreme downs in my life, my desire to stop living has always remained. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my life, I have had only a handful of months that I have been happy. A good majority of that time was filled with my ex and former dear friend. I always believed I wanted to be alone before I met him. He made me feel safe and hopeful that life could be okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

He left me for a woman that we had both mutually disliked. I was gutted. We cut off all contact. We had one text conversation where he apologized, and it only worsened my pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have not seen or spoken to him in almost two years. My heartbreak is still as painful now as it was on day one. I can honestly say not a day has gone by that I haven't shed a tear over him. I can logically understand that this situation is clearly a result of my childhood or some trauma and that this particular experience is in no way a tragedy, yet, I can't stop obsessing over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time is supposed to heal all wounds but I just feel the burden of my emotional scars weighing me down more and more each day. My depression has become worse with time. I am on medication and have sought out many therapists and I have no relief. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I can't take it much longer."
1217,I get so nervous when I talk to people and that’s the only time anxiety affects me,I’m able to go to the shops and order food and even be in crowds without anxiety but when I start socialising with people one on one or in groups I will become very nervous and my anxiety becomes horrible it’s crippling it makes me very socially awkward it’s fucking making my life hell I have no friends because of it. I’m really hoping to take anti anxiety medication for it
1218,I'm deathly afraid of my friends leaving me because of their careers.,"I don't want them to leave me ever. But if they become what they want to be, that places them far away from me. They all have successful dreams but I doubt I'll be anything special so I'll be left in the dust. I don't want to them to leave. I'm fucking crying."
1219,Feeling tired,"Melancholy, I feel no joy
No happiness or medicine can I employ
My life is now only boredom
Lethargy's grip to tight to ignore him
My day is now a dreary design
What once was fun is now benign
How again shall I smile?
If not for long at least a while"
1220,Friend’s Husband,My friend’s husband tried to kill himself tonight. My friend struggles with SI too so I’m worried about her. She’s staying with another friend and I feel like a jerk because I feel bad that she didn’t chose my help and choose another friend over me. I know that I shouldn’t be thinking this way and making it about me but I want to take care of her and I can’t right now.
1221,I'm 24 and have no friends,"I'm 24 and I've realized I have no actual friends. I have several people in my life I always refer to as friends. I've know them for various amounts of time 7-10+ years and we're all mutual friends. My best friend of 10+ years and I used to be so close. For quite some time things have changed. I call or text occasionally and get little to no response. I stopped trying to make plans because she always tells me she's busy. I've noticed that on her time off she's constantly hanging out with other friends but it's very rarely me. I'm lucky to see her 3-4 times a year and we live about 25 minutes apart. I've never said no to an invite from her and always have so much fun when I'm with her. We have a mutual friend of 7 years who is visiting from out of state. We have a group message on snapchat and talked about getting together for dinner as our out of state friend was coming home to visit. I was excited and happy to see both of them and was just waiting for a time and date. The other day I saw they had gone to dinner without me with my ex. I was really hurt. It had been 6 months since I had seen our out of state friend and probably 4+ months since I had hung out with my best friend minus a recent BLM vigil where she came with my ex. I try to be a honest person and I expect people to try to be honest with me as well. I really wish they would just say they don't want to be friends with me or hangout anymore instead of just ghosting me. I've been really hurt by all of this. It has messed with my head and really hyped up my insecurities. I can't help but think there's something wrong with me or that I must not be fun to hangout with because of this. I do genuinely have fun spending time with my ""friends"" and they always appear to have fun to. It's just been a lot to process and these are just a few examples of recent things. This has been happening for quite awhile and I've been making excuses for their behavior for too long. It just really sucks I let myself get played by a group of people I loved and trusted. People I would do anything for. I don't know if I should address it or how. I just am beyond sad. I don't know how to make friends and start over. I thought I had found my people. I just hate slipping further into depression over this and doubting my self worth. Fortunately I do have a great partner who I've been with for nearly a year. I don't know what I'd do without him. I really don't have anyone else. We don't live together yet but I do cherish the time I do get to spend with him. Looking forward to my last therapy session this coming Tuesday. My therapist is always great to talk to. I'm just sad after this appointment I have to stop until further notice due to insurance/financial reasons. Sorry for the long vent I just needed to get this off my chest and figured reddit might be a good place to find support."
1222,"Hi I was hoping maybe someone could talk to me right now, I just feel in kind of a bad place and don't want to be alone",It's ok if not though I understand
1223,Psychiatrist help,"Hi, sometimes for me, dealing with a psychiatrist involves dealing with other people as well, case workers mainly. It seems unnecessary for me to have to deal with that when I'm just there to talk about meds and get treatment for meds. Its almost unacceptably intrusive. I've actually had social workers get mad at my psychiatrist and me for not wanting to deal with them. I'm just there to talk about my meds and go home, I don't need anymore help. They say it's required for the program.   'xxxx behavioral health' or whatever, requires that when you join, you are part of the access team, and its required. I just want to see a psychiatrist and talk about meds. Does anyone have to deal with this? And have they found a place where they didn't have to anymore?"
1224,Day 98 in quarantine,"I've been in quarantine for the last 98 days and I feel like I'm going insane. I'm an extremely extroverted guy so this is pretty difficult. I can't eve talk with people online anymore because I have nothing to say. I don't know what to do but I feel like I'm breaking mentally.

I've only hung out with one person during this time. My now ex girlfriend who dumped me on my birthday. I could really use some love right now."
1225,This sub sucks,"Sure it’s great when it works, but for da most part it doesn’t. I posted for the first time ever on reddit, even on a burner cause I was so anxious, and none could even upvote. On my main I give advice all the fucking time on here and now realizing how many fucking people don’t get any on this sub from tryin post on it disgusts me. I jus went through the recents and like no one had any comments or upvotes. If this is a space for this typa shit—it needs to be a real place, not just a place where people feel like commenting on shit that’s relatable. Be pragmatic for fucks sake. That’s it, hope shit changes, if not for me, then for other god damn fuckin people on here. 
Ps I’ll probably be banned for spitting fucking facts."
1226,Making up for lost time,"I am 23 years of age. Next year I will qualify as doctor. That single goal is the only thing I will have accomplished in my entire life. I have no hobbies, I have few friends. I flunked out of an RAF training scheme a little over two years ago, after telling myself for 10 years that joining the military was what I wanted to do. I had none of the makings of an officer, no command, no drive, no ambition. I have no idea where I want to go in my career, no particular direction or aspiration.  I was diagnosed with clinical depression nearly 2 years ago when a friend dragged me to the GP after I had a breakdown.

I told myself throughout my entire childhood that only the goal of doing well academically and becoming something successful mattered. Everything else was superfluous. I had a few extracurricular hobbies on and off, but nothing I dedicated myself to, because they didn't matter. The only thing I have consistently done is use the internet, for ""relaxation"".

Now I just feel like I have nothing. I've wasted my fucking life on the internet and on meaningless distractions and now even the one thing I wanted to accomplish feels meaningless because my life outside of it is just so empty. I have deleted my reddit accounts, and accounts on other sites that I have been visiting for over 10 years. Bickering with people on the internet, trying to remain impartial in the mud of everyone arguing while not even being particularly well read on any particular topic myself, scrolling through news channels on Facebook and seeing people just being ugly to each other, has become tiresome.

I do not feel like I have lived for 23 years, I've just existed.

In an ideal world, which I wish this was, I could have my childhood back. I could enjoy it properly, play with friends, play sport, learn an instrument, have hobbies, instead of telling myself none of it mattered. I want it back, but I've accepted that can't happen. The only thing I can do is move forward. I understand the full irony of posting on a site I have literally just said I was leaving, but it's all I know. 

I want to move forward. I'm tired of dreaming of killing myself like it'll just end my emptiness or make everything start over. 

I'm just scared and I don't know what to do next. 

How do I do it?"
1227,Whats wrong with me?,"Im pretty sure I’m going crazy while in quarantine, but recently I’ve been able to focus on how I am. Recently just a couple days ago my dog ran away, and we haven’t been able to find her since. Instead of crying or having any real sad reaction I just feel like “oh well”. And the problem is, is that I’ve known her for 7+ years and I was extremely close to her ... I feel guilty for not having much of a reaction too... is this normal? A weird way of grief?"
1228,Any over thinkers here?,I over think to much. The over thinking is litteraly consumuning me to the point where I cant function in day to day life.
1229,i don’t know if this is mental health related but it feels that way so,"I have lately been having trouble figuring out whether or not i want to do things bc i actually want to do it or if it’s because other ppl who i think are cool are doing it and i wanna be cool too. does anyone one else have this issue?

One day i sat an thought and i really couldn’t see a way to tell the difference. It makes me feel like i don’t even know who i am or what i like because i’m hung up on getting others to like me. 

I am aware of my wavering self esteem but i didn’t know that it would be that bad so i really wonder."
1230,My anger problem is starting to get worse,"I’m not sure if anger is a mental health thing or if this is the right place to go but I don’t know where else to go. If there’s another subreddit for that I can post this there but I’m just gonna use this for now.
I’ve always had a horrible temper. Because of it, I’ve broken countless things that my parents had to pay for. Except only recently, it’s been getting worse and worse. Sometimes even just out of the blue I’m filled with rage and want to break something. I can’t ever calm myself down because I just feel like an idiot for getting mad at something so insignificant. Does anyone have any advice or has been in a similar situation?"
1231,Sexual activity and medication: Why do SSRIs make it difficult to cum? What is the cause?,"Hey guys! Im currently on an SSRI and sometimes have a hard time coming to orgasm. I know this is a common issue for other people on SSRIs when it comes to orgasm and sex drive, but what causes the issue? I cant tell if it's an anxiety thing (because it's hard to cum if you aren't relaxed or out of your head enough) or the SSRIs causing the issue"

1234,I'm so tired,"I'm so tired of this. I just want to sleep forever. I hate uni, I hate being lonely, I hate being around. My boyfriend is distant. My friends have moved on. The only contact I have is with my parents and all they care about are my uni results. I'm so close to just stopping all of it. Why the hell am I trying so hard for  anyways? My cats avoid me, I got a dog just to feel loved and yes, she does, but I'm not ready for such a long commitment when I don't know if I wanna be here another year. But I blew all my savings on her (dogs are expensive here) so I'm woe to just cart her off on someone. I'm tired, nauseous and cranky all the time. I don't know how many sleep pills they'll let me buy at once, I'll go ask today for reference."
1235,My husband is dragging me down,"My husband is 12 years younger, ex con who had his first job and got fired in a week. He came home super early tonight, and he wasn't there for an hour before he got fired. He drank a pint of alcohol in the parking lot before going in. Then got pissed, again,  because he just wanted to do his assigned job and not be told to help do other things working him like a ""Slave"", his word. I have a mental illness (bipolar2 schizoaffective disorder) and just began my medication to get stabilized a few days ago, he told me to quit my job that I just got hired at, and I did, so he can take care of me. Now we have bills and if not for my social security check I don't know how the rent will get paid, not to mention we have bills and how will those get paid. I think I need to cut this loser now while I have the chance and stop forgiving him for his dumb shit. Not to mention he gave me a black eye not long ago. He stopped hitting me because I called the police, however, he just isn't marriage material. I gave up everything I established to be with him, and the sex sucks, so I haven't stuck around because of that. He is dual diagnosis, won't get professional help, I'm the only one crazy let him tell it. I have a bad track record of eventually getting into arguments so none of my family will let me live with them anymore. I feel so stuck. I need to take my check and belongings and run, but I have no where to go to and the money won't get me far."
1236,I hurt myself today; to see if I still feel.,"I've been doing great for a long time, I haven't even considered harming myself in months, BUT I recently switched jobs (excuse and I know it). Long story short, I hurt myself this evening.  I traced a few veins in my forearm with a razor (bleeding controlled, former medic here). I will be calling my VA doc in the morning, but I hate that dude, and honestly feel more accountable to Reddit, I love you Reddit and I'm sorry to have let you down tonight."
1237,Smile,"You there, the one reading this now. I want you to do something.... SMILE! 

Smile because beautiful, 
Because you’re amazing,
Because you’re unique, 
Because you can, 
Because tomorrow is a new day, 
Because no matter what you think, someone loves you. 

Smile because you deserve to."
1238,It’s so frustrating...,"I get labeled as lazy and selfish by my family and get pressured to “try harder”  and sometimes get told “you say you love me but you not helping out around the house doesn’t really show it”. 

I’m sorry about my language but WHAT THE FUCK? I am struggling here, I am trying to get better, I’m sorry if I’m not working hard enough for you and my depression makes me stay in bed all the time...I’m sorry I’m not healing fast enough for you....And you think I’m using it as an exscuse??? I was suicidal, I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF, but I came out of that place, but it wasn’t easy and it was a ton of work but you’re sitting here complaining that I’m not “helping out enough”?!"
1239,Returning back to normal after quarantine,"Hello, 

I was previously diagnosed with GAD but now it's more of panic disorder with agoraphobia. 

I found quarantine/stay-home order to be a great break from my normal busy life. Things were more slow paced and I had generally, a great time. The economy reopening however has been VERY stressful. Going out, the crowds, lines at shops has triggered my panic disorder and I now suffer from constant panic attacks and am fearful of many places &amp; environments. It doesn't help that I'm about to start working again soon and I'm worried that the additional stress from the job will worsen my condition

Anyone else who feel the same way? How have you readjusted?"
1240,You ever get so depressed that your bones inside you can physically hurt?,"Once in a while it will happen while I’m trying to fall asleep and my mind begins to wander, but today I was walking and literally tumbled to the ground out of the pain I felt inside"
1241,Depression is a bitch,I’ve been depressed for years now and nothing I can do helps much in the long run. I went skydiving today in hopes that I would literally and mentally be able to get a different perspective on life. It was fun in the moment but not I’m back to thinking up efficient ways to kill myself. Any tips on getting happy?
1242,Anyone have experience with a 5150 or 5250 hold?,"About a year and a half ago I was sent to a “mental hospital” (it was just a hospital with a section for mental health I guess). I felt like I didn’t need to be there, as the reason I got sent there was because a suicide hotline hung up on me in the middle of the call, and then decided the only thing they could do was send the police to my house and take me away. Since the hospital in my city didn’t have a mental section I had to fly to a different city while being escorted by 2 police officers (and no family or friends), I stayed for 17 days because it was a 5250 which means you stay for at least 14 days. I believe I was very lucky because the other people there were very cool and chill (it was coed and all of us were 16-18 years old, me being 18). I’ve been searching for people with the same experience, but I just can’t find any posts talking about it on any platform. If anyone has a story about their 5250 or 5150 experience please comment under this post or dm me if you don’t want to share it publicly. I’m very interested on how you felt about it and if it helped you at all."
1243,What to do when parents say no to therapy,"So my friend is still a minor and lives in an abusive household. There are a bunch of things going on so I won’t go deep into that here, but her parents have refused to get her therapy which is something that she really needs and wants. What can or should  she do?"
1244,"I always feel like crying, what's wrong with me??","I always feel like crying without any reason. I don't have suicidal thoughts or anything but I cannot say that I'm happy in my life. I overthink over a few things from my past that people around me have done to me, particularly my mom. But I don't blame myself for all that. Sometimes I imagine scenarios in my head like my mom doing something to me and I start crying. But most of the time it's without any reason.
I'm 22 year old female and I still live with my mom."
1245,Im not sure if this counts as mental health,"So the thing is i read alot trough this sub, and my problem isn‘t really the worst but it stops me in alot of aspects in life, so my problem is i can‘t learn, i simply can‘t learn im bad ad it like really bad, since my 1st school year i can‘t do it im sitting down i learn and after 1-2 hours i literally forget what i learned (i may only remember a few things) and now more then ever it kills me with my driving license test , i failed today again... a second time, even tho i learned everyday for 2 hours for the last few weeks and i still fail... but when i drive(which i do illegally because im in a third world country its easier to drive here without a license) i understand every sign everything every road rule everything and i know how to behave while driving, but when i see a test in paper form my mind literally gets lost and doesnt know what to do... im sorry if this doesnt fit the sub and im sorry for my writing skills in english"
1246,Need advice. Have anxiety and struggle to make choices. What should I do?,"Long story short. 

I help my friend coach his soccer team. Coaching has been making me quite anxious for numerous reasons:

- High pressure 
- Giving up a decent amount of my free time 
- Not enjoying it 
- Don't feel respected by players 
- Worry what others think and what they may be saying about me. Compare myself to other coaches. 
- Now covid worries 

Due to Covid 19, the season most likely has a maximum of 4 months left. I know my friend really wants me to stay and values me. I don't even know now if my anxiety is whats making me not enjoy it. 


Do I keep my commitment, stay, face my fears and finish off the season for my friend, even though I'm not enjoying it? 

Do I just leave and put myself first and expect him to understand? 

Do I just finish the season off, but on a more casual basis (not attending every single training etc.)"
1247,"Why do I get an urge to cry suddenly, and is this normal?","To start off I want to say that I am not one to cry in fact I haven't shed tears since my grandmother died on that fateful December day in 2017. Even when my grandfather passed away just a couple months later I did not cry. (He was 89, and for most of my life the had been battling dementia, so I had little to no relationship with him) I am not a crier, however sometimes out of the blue I feel a enormous black cloud form over me and I have to fight back the urge to ball my eyes out, then after a while it goes away and I forget all about it, until it happens again many weeks/months later. which brings me to last night. I was learning how to do a new job and was being told many different instructions from many different people, but not being one to get flustered easily I was able to handle it, listen carefully, and learn quickly. However, as soon as everyone stopped talking to me and I went back to my task this bizarre feeling came over me as it had in the past... a sudden dark cloud came over me and I want to cry, and like every other time this has happened to me I was able to hold it in. I don't know when this first happened for as soon as it is over I often forget all about it and move on. Now for the questions: Could this be some sort of slight nervous system malfunction? is this some sort of mental health malfunction/illness? Is this common? Have you ever experienced something similar? Should I allow the tears to roll? Or not because it would be odd everyone around including myself would have no idea why I was so sad? Finally, do you have any other thoughts or questions? Thanks for listening!"
1248,From planning a marriage to having a baby. Miscarriage to break up. She's bi-polar and she's leaving.,"I (M) met the love of my life (F) 3 years ago. We became friends and eventually left our relationships to be together. The first year was amazing then it quickly took a turn. The mania turned to depression. I know who I'm with and the illness that she copes with. I knew there would be hard stages through life. When she got pregnant we were so excited. Then with the miscarrage came a dark fog. No sex, barely touching. Shes been trying to figure out a medication regiment that works for her. Two days ago she tells me she can't be a good girlfriend and doesn't want the pressure of being one. I never pushed, was always supportive and truly hopeful. I'm crushed. I tried so hard to help, to make her happy, to make this work. Im so fucking sad, guys."
1249,Why do I get sad over other peoples problems?,"Ever since I was a kid I cry or get extremely sad over my loved ones emotions. I have so many problems of my own, but nothing hurts me more than other peoples problems, I don’t get it. I know empathy is normal, but it’s to the point where it’s prioritized over my own mental health, making me more depressed than I already am. I’ve tried everything to fix it. But knowing I’ve been like this since I was a kid I think it’s just who I am?"
1250,How to genuinely take compliments?,"I've been struggling with CBT lately to deal with my depression (since medication didn't work for me). One thing I've been working on is fighting my feelings of self loathing so that I can build up some confidence. One knee jerk reaction of mine is to wince when someone compliments me. Whether they're saying I look nice or that I did something well or it's about something they like about me, I immediately don't believe it and clam up. It just doesn't make sense with how I see myself. 

Sometimes, I feel like they're blatantly lying, especially when family and friends give half assed compliments about my appearance. I assume they're thinking or seeing that I'm insecure but they don't sound believable and then I feel ugly and pitied (which is way worse lol).

Any tips on being more open to compliments? I don't want to cringe every time haha."

TLDR: I wanna get professional help, get rejected, get harassed, or cannot afford it.

So my story is simple. Years of child abuse, school bullying by class and teachers alike, my dad disowning me because I kept insisting he apologize for beating my mom and he did not take into consideration that my step sis stole shit from me and attempted to murder me with a steak fork, nobody respecting me, sending me porn videos even though I am asexual due to rapey wapey as my drink has been drugged when I was 19, not having friends even though NOBODY EVER KNOWS I have fucking depression because GUESS WHAT it's hard to see on high functioning bitches.

My mom attempted suicide over her cheating ex leaving her and everyone blamed me for it, because I told her I will beat his ass if he ever sets foot in this house (he treated me like trash for no reason too - just wanted me gone because its hard to fuck my mom when im home). So yeah, whole village pointing fingers so I ran away abroad, no friends, working 6 days a week, having a burnout, boss dragging me around like a ragdoll when I am hyperventilating and having a panic attack, my legs would be covered in bruises because I cannot stand for long - I found love, moved countries again, trying to get friends but no luck, I am just a stupid foreigner who dont speak the language, this cunt tryna moving on to my boyfriend because I am just a fucking slav and slavs are something less or what, inlaws literally watch ""fuck all migrants go back home"" content right in front of me and bully me out of the house despite me cleaning and doing shit that the lazy stoner bitch flat earther inlaw is lazy to do despite not hwaving a job, all the while I am barely able to take a breath cuz constant anxiety.

We move away, I have my job, GUESS WHAT now I am fucking losing my job because of Corona, which will potentially lead me to lose my house, so what, its either back to inlaws or home to my village because the rent in this fucking country is over the roof.

AND NOW LADIES AND GENTS, TO THE REAL FUCKING POINT OF THIS POST

I go to the doctor (somewhere after my bday in Nov, which I spent locked in my house, as everyone we invited with my bf did not come and well I just decided to fuck it and not do anything) - ""pls refer me to a therapist, I am feeling very bad, I think I am losing grip on my life"" ""but you look good, you do not look like someone who has something serious going on"" ... I got up, apologized, resisting the urge to punch this piece of shit who does not deserve to be called a doctor in the face and registered elsewhere - they refer me to a therapist... I tell her all the above, with colorful details. She says she cannot give me meds or help me because I might have some serious diagnosis and whatnot, WAITING LIST IS 6 FUCKING MONTHS but PLOT FUCKING TWIST NOOO because of the corona you get postponed, oh jolly golly joy! U wanna kill yourself? Wait 6 months! Wonderful! Tried to book a private therapist - sorry we do not operate cuz corona.... tried a few others, either scheds full or corona, some just told me to wait out the waiting list because I have been assigned there for a reason....SO WHAT IM SOME AUTISTIC BIPOLAR SCHIZO ASPERGERS PTSD WHATEVER FUCKING LABEL YOU PUT ON ME BUT IM NOT HUMAN? ALRIGHT THANKS. /I do not curse at the people who suffer from the disease. I did not mean to offend, I curse at the label/ I see an ad for online therapy. Unlike in this post, I am being civil, they tell me to complete a questionairre. ""U SHOULD CONSIDER FACE TO FACE THERAPY CUZ ONLINE THERAPY IS NOT FOR YOU"" THANKS BUT I FUCKING NEED HELP ...ANY HELP! ....theres a link to find your local therapist. OH GUESS WHAT, I CHOSE MY CITY AND NOTHING POPPED UP, AND THE ONES THAT POPPED UP FOR NEARBY CITIES TOLD ME TO FUCK OFF ALREADY!!!...I go to another online therapy site. I connect with a listener.... I just wanna talk to someone...first one is responding every 2 hours with 1 word, coldly,  does not give a shit. I close the convo. Connect to another one. GET SEXUALLY HARASSED - CALLED ON WEBCAM, ASKED FOR NUDES AND SHIT. Then I see connect to licensed therapist, but its 150 a month and soon I cannot pay my rent cuz losing my job and do I even wanna sign up at a site which allows sexual harassment?!

OH U HAVE A PROBLEM GET HELP. WHAT A FUCKING JOKE. HOW EASY, I GO TO THE FUCKING HELP TREE, PICK SOME HELP, EAT IT AND I WILL BE ABSOLUTELY FINE!

1253,needing advice,"how do you bring yourself to talk to someone you are aware of is beating themselves up for making you feel depressed, when you are badly depressed yourself? my sister has been endlessly sending me texts, trying to get us to talk. i know she's gonna apologize for making me feel bad, and honestly it's not even her fault i'm depressed, she just happened to have no filter and tell the truth. i read her texts and i just cant talk to her no matter how much i want to, i'll just cry and make everyone feel bad. we're not an ""open"" family and we never have heart to heart talks. but seeing how me, already feeling like shit, makes other people feel the same is just the worst. add the fact that ive been isolating a lot. it's maddening as hell when she's just on the next room probably doing the same. and i hate it, i hate making her feel this way but i still cant bring myself to talk to her"

1256,How to overcome Phone Anxiety at work?,"So I have major anxiety towards incoming calls at my workplace. 

My department mans a hotline (not our primary job like a call centre, but it’s a small department that undertakes everything from customer inquiries to event management), and every time an incoming call shows up on my phone, I panic and avoid it at all costs, letting it bounce to another colleague. 

It’s easy to let it bounce because I’m now working from home. I was only at work in-office for a week before my country went into COVID lockdown, and during that one week, I wasn’t taught anything or advised anything regarding calls. It was more of the whole — “when you get a call, just message / call us with the questions if you’re not sure of anything” — situation, which is highly impractical when you’re actively on the phone with someone right? 

Anyway, it’s not like I haven’t taken calls before. I used to work in customer service and did case management for an escalation team, which included a bunch of outbound calls and the occasional inbound call (which I tend to miss and call back instead). Also, it’s not like I can’t manage calls. When I’m on the phone, I’m able to slip into the whole “customer service” persona and converse rather normally. 

So, I don’t understand why I get so freaked out with incoming work calls. I know that my anxiety towards it revolves around picking up the call and not knowing what to expect / not being able to give an answer, because I’m so new and might not be able to keep up with questions. The few incoming calls that I DID pick up have all been pretty okay considering, but even 2.5 months into the job, the sound of an incoming call still makes me freeze and panic and want to quit my job that very second. 

The suggestion my therapist gave me was just to bite the bullet, not let myself overthink the panic, and pick up the call. I’ve managed to do that sometimes, but other times it’s just so overwhelming. 

I feel like a liar and a terrible employee and colleague with shirking my hotline responsibilities like this. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this anxiety? 

Note: I’m not diagnosed with GAD / Social Anxiety, but I have clinical depression and am in the throes of it right now, and my confidence has been shot to hell. Anxiety accompanies the depression every now and then, but not always. I’m medicated for depression but not really for the anxiety because it hasn’t presented too severely save for this and some anxiety attacks."
1257,Paxil withdrawal sucks.,"I've been on paxil for about a year, and it's been helping me a lot, controlling my sui urges and not crying all day, etc. Making me numb. Which is nice.
I've been in a tight spot financially and I had to lower the daily dose for a couple of days to make the pills I have last until I got paid. However, I had to spend about two days with no medication. And it's been unbelievably horrible. I mean holy hell! No sleep, shaking, pain, and a really bad brain fog and bad thoughts.
I finally got paid and bought some and took my pill. I need it to work fast. In the meantime I'm listening to Rick Ashley singing Foo Fighters' Everlong on repeat and sobbing.

tl;dr If you're on paxil, be careful not to run out. It can be horrible. I am genuinely concerned that I won't be able to ever stop taking it.

PS. I had to check what I wrote several times to fix things I've miswritten cause I'm having a really hard time typing or thinking. It's that bad."

At this point I've repressed it so much ut barely affects me anymore but some things can still trigger flashbacks and talking about it brings me to tears almost instantly. A few months ago when my depression made me have to stop school, I made the decision to finally seek professional help. Today is my first meeting with a therapist and we're gonna discuss the possibility for EMDR. I'm really excited and hope they can actually do something for me.
I just wanted to share this with someone."
1259,I’ve reached a level that I am fighting myself,"I always tend to remember bad memories from my past that lets me suddenly hit something anyways years past and I’ve solved the problem by myself then out of nowhere the memories flooded than ever I tried to use my old myth by tracing  back the reason of the anger then knowing the problem then neither forget and tell myself it’s nothing or else learn the lesson and by doing that I’ve started to react to my mythiod in bad way by telling myself how pathetic I am by trying to do this etc etc and from now own everytime I remember anything I choose to swear at myself to calm my anger or hitting anything idk how I am writing  this tbh there’s more but that’s all I can anyways please help me out of this I am frightened about my future.

 (serious replies only)"
1260,I'm worried I might have permanently scarred my skin through self harm,"I self-harmed a long time ago. Now, many months later, although the cuts are gone, I have dark splodges all over my arms exactly where the cuts were (and in the same shape). I'm extremely worried because it doesn't look like it will ever heal. I'm 15 and scared to tell my parents. Has this happened to anyone else?"
1261,Does anyone have tips for toilet anxiety sufferers?,"I've (M18) had really bad anxiety for 2 and a half years now. Whenever I'm on a long car journey or in an exam I get the urge to go for a number 1, despite me not actually needing to. I know this because if I do go to the toilet it is obvious I didn't need to go and I don't have this problem when I'm at home.

I've hoped it would just go away with time but it's at the point where I go to the toilet between every class in college and immediately before getting into a car, no matter how short the journey. I have important exams coming up that are all 3 hours long and I know I can't get through them without my anxiety flaring up.

Does anyone please have any tips to stop this."
1262,Possible OCD?," 

Every so often, I'll get the strong urge to put my hand to the side or back of my desktop computer to check if it or any cables are pressing against the wall, even though I know for a fact they aren't.

How often this happens changes a lot, it used to happen at least once a day now it's only happening once or twice a week or so.

If I don't do it I get this constant ""itch"" in the back of my head and I can't get it out unless I check with my hand. I don't want to bring this up to a therapist or anyone since they'll think I'm crazy (I'm 13)

Any advice or possible disorder will be greatly appreciated as this has been bugging me.

Thanks! :D"
1263,"How do I self parent and deal with an id crisis, needing validation from everyone, and just feeling lost due to Childhood Emotional Neglect? (My story)","(20M)I'm not sure how to express myself, it's my first time posting anything personal on the internet, sorry if it's messy. When I was a kid I liked to always learn, ask questions and have fun. As the youngest of three when I would see my so called dad talking and joking with my two sisters, I would want to join in. I would ask what's going on, jump around or ask for a turn. But every time he would shame me for wanting attention. When I wanted to show I can do things too or do something funny he would say annoyed  ""Oh! He's here to put on his show. Everyone watch"". He would make me feel like the way I was acting was annoying and wrong. Maybe I was annoying, what kid isn't sometimes? That shit would hurt though. He would get annoyed at or ignore my questions on the history and science shows he would watch. When I tried to bring up a topic of conversation he would say ""I already know about that"". I honestly can't remember a conversation we've had that wasn't him criticizing me. As I got older (middle school) I started to look for validation elsewhere, I believed something was wrong with the way I was so I started copying the behaviours of my friends. This lasted up until junior year of high school when the friends I made by copying them graduated(they were older). I started having anxiety because I didn't know how to act or make new friends. I subconsciously decided to latch on the last thing I thought was true of myself and that is being smart. I started copying the behaviour of smart fictional characters I saw on movies or tv. I believed if people thought I was smart I would be liked. I knew deep down this was fake though, although I would get compliments for being smart I knew it wasn't true. I lack basic life skills and because I went to an alternative hs for difficult teens i feel bad to say it wasn't hard fooling students and teachers I was smart. Part of my ego still believes I need to act smart get people to like me. I'm trying to work on that. 
Does anyone have advice on dealing with an identity crisis, learning basic life skills, needing validation from strangers and self parenting? 
Thank you for reading"
1264,I'm questioning my mother's sanity,"Yeah, I'm so mean - I know. 

Seriously tho, it's not a joke at all, and I know assuming someone's mental state isn't right. I'm not trying to diagnose and push an issue on her. I just can't take it anymore and would like some outside opinions, advice etc. 

Context: I would consider my mom to be a good mom. I think I actually won the lottery with my parents. They really are lovely. I am very similar to my dad, he's a very caring and gentle man. My mom is very devoted, she sacrificed a lot for me, cares about me, and always told me she loves me growing up. I owe a lot of my good self-image to my parents ( my mom has always insisted on telling me how amazing, clever and blessed I am, and my father always taught me to trust my judgment and opinions) and I am very confident that they would always support me no matter what. NB: I am an only child (F/19)

When I said I am very similar to my dad, who is gentle, I also meant my mom isn't so much. Which isn't at all the problem. To each their own - as they say. And it isn't at all negative - she's a very energetic and louder person. No problem with that.

However, some of her behaviors always seemed off. This is where the ugly stuff starts. She's always had the ""habit"" of bursting into sudden fits of anger for seemingly mundane things. No physical violence there, but if only people could hear the filthy things coming out of her mouth.... She would curse a lot, insult us (even when I was a child) and the insults would be shockingly graphic. The older I got the more it happened (or maybe it was just me becoming more and more conscious of it). Even though she would say horrible things, I only remember her apologizing once. It's almost like she didn't see anything wrong with what she was saying. What would bother me the most with that is the lack of consistency. I would never know how she would react to anything. The first time I brought a really bad grade from school, she laughed nicely and told me to put more effort into my schoolwork. The time I forget to make my bed, she curses me and stays angry for 3h. 

( Examples ahead: obvious trigger warning)

"" You really can't do anything right can't you? You're really lame, a zero. "" (after I failed to clean something properly)

"" You are not fit for life"" (It actually hurt me a lot.  I cry when I'm angry, which bothers her a lot since sensitivity = weakness in her book. She always reminds me of how she wishes I had more ""character"" and ""ambition"". I know I have enough of that and thanks to God I know my sensitivity isn't a weakness)

"" He's a pussy. He can't do anything."" (to me about my dad, which I also know isn't true)

A lot of them have the same theme and I don't want to write the specific cursing out cause 1) I can't properly translate them 2) I'm afraid to get banned or something

(End of examples)

The other things that worry me are her sudden periods of mistrust and paranoia. The older I got, the more it happened. I can't explain why as I've never done anything to make her think I would be subject to such behaviors. Still, she often has in her head that when I'm texting my friends, I'm actually plotting to meet up with older men and that I'm spending my nights secretly texting on some shady dating apps. She once went as far as making me sleep in the same room as her to check on my phone use ( I never use my phone at night in the first place, which makes it even more f-ed up). No amount of openly showing her my dating-app free phone would convince her otherwise - in her head, I want to get laid quick with mature p\*dos (this started when I was a teen). 

She also often accuses me of purposefully ""dressing s\*\*ually"" even though idk why since most of the time I'm considered to be slightly conservative in my clothing choice. 

I've never noticed her having the same doubts towards my dad, even though who knows what's going on, right?

(Examples ahead : obvious trigger warning)

"" Your texting? With your younger or older group?"" (yesterday. I was texting with my friends)

"" Ok. So today your dressing nice, but tomorrow you've decided to dress s\*\*ual"" ( today, when I told her I want to wear a dress tomorrow)

"" Oh you're texting strangers again"" ( often, and I'm not)

"" Looking like a barbie doll but can't do anything. Empty, lazy  little girl"" ( I put makeup on to go to school; I do it every day)

"" I don't know what you're doing on your phone"" ( often, even though i gladly tell her what I'm doing when she asks)

And the time she burst into my therapy appointment to talk to my therapist about the fact that I'm surely talking with strangers on the internet. She then called her unprofessional when she declined to talk about it (it was my session). 

( End of examples)

There is more. I'm worried about how spontaneous it all is. You never know when she's going to start acting weird and truly ""crazy"". Idk what to do about it. I would like her to maybe see a psychologist (as mental illness runs in the family) but I don't think she'll listen to me. I'm not asking for advice regarding her (I know the obvious is to see a professional) but rather to see if someone else is in a similar situation.

 Is it abuse? I know the behavior is but I don't see it black and white enough to call her an abuser. It is obvious to me that she has problems and it is destroying our family. My parents don't love each other anymore. It has ruined their relationship. Honestly, I find it harder and harder to look past it, but I don't know what I can do about it. 

Thank you lots if you read this far, I know the text was long."
1265,Is there a mental condition that makes me think this way?,"So ever since I was a young girl, if something didn't make complete sense to me, I'd dispute it and I'd get annoyed by it. So if I bought my friends ice cream and they refused to give me some of theirs after I finished mine because I bought it, I'd get mad and say 'why? I'm the one who bought it'. I did this quite often. It was manipulative and selfish. But it's who I am. I also genuinely truly believe human beings are inherently and innately selfish and self serving. Whatever the deed they're doing is, good or bad, the motive is the same to me. Helped a homeless guy? It's to feel like you did good and feel better about yourself even if you tell yourself you did it for the homeless guy. Was nice to somebody? It's because it makes you feel better/gets you ahead/help you in some kind of way. I understand we developed the ability to feel compassion for others and help one another as a way to better survive as a pack but I just can't believe that humans aren't truly in their nature selfish. That isn't good or bad but it is what it is. 

I've had trouble making friends my entire life. To me friendships are so pointless. Maybe it's because I haven't met people who understand me/have the same hobbies interests etc yet, but I've given up on that because I understand no one is going to understand me 100% and the world doesn't owe me that. But I still CAN'T compromise under any circumstances for other people. I can't stand their flaws. I can see right through their motives. I can see who they really truly are deep down and it disgusts me or makes me cringe or weirds me out(I know, sounds edgy. But I can't stop myself from noticing other people's flaws and being irritated by them). I find that I'm a very happy and fulfilled person when I'm not being held back by my mental issues and just doing my own thing. I think therapy and professional help will benefit me but having 'support systems' and 'safe spaces' from friends is bullshit and has just never helped me. I can't stand it.

I love paying for things because I know I will expect something in return and I get what I pay for most of the time. That makes perfect sense to me. Why can't human beings be the same? Why can't people not use me without actually offering something in return? Why can't people be honest and open about mutually beneficial agreements and what they want from each other rather than this smiley, fake extra bullshit? 

I can see my life being perfect even if I'm utterly alone in this world. Sometimes it's a scary thought to think about but I still think I'll be happy even if I'm completely alone. The only thing that disgusts me and I can't stand is exploiting people or any shit like that. That is not something I'd be comfortable doing simply because I choose to lead a lonely life. But I don't feel like I need people. And I do feel like I can move on VERY quickly from people I cut off. It used to be hard and took time and it still does sometimes if the person really hurt me but I'd still move on. I'd cut them off completely no strings attached and no emotions to show.

What is wrong with me? What makes me this way? Am I normal?"
1266,Can sociopathy/psychopathy/lack of empathy develop?,"I have no idea where to post this, but this sub seems right. If it's not, please redirect me!

I'm 15, for reference of timeframe.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, please redirect me to the correct one if so.

I've heard from people that the main indicator of sociopathy/psychopathy is lack of empathy which I didn't have... **until**  recently? I used to be quite an empathetic person, but now I don't? The  ""stick that broke the camel's back"" (like the reason I decided to  finally ask about this) was earlier, when my mum broke down crying in  front of me, and as much as I wanted to, I just.. didn't care? I just  wanted to go back to doing what I was doing. Recently, things like that  have been happening a lot; Situations in which I would normally feel  empathy, but now I just *don't* at all.

Another  example of a situation where I don't feel empathy anymore is (not with a  person) with my pet bird. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I'll make a  reasonably loud noise to.. scare him and make him look at me. And I  don't feel bad about it, despite people telling me that it's a really  bad thing to do.

So like, am I developing sociopathy/psychopathy, am I merely losing my empathy or is it nothing at all?"
1267,How do you feel after a therapy session,"Had my very first session for some trauma related ptsd today, and I’m done. Absolutely done. Just wanna curl up in my bed and lock the world out. Directly afterwards, as soon as I disconnected the call I was crying and hyperventilating. That’s really not normal for me.

Is that what I’ll have to expect every time now? Do I need another therapist? Am I the problem?"
1268,Trying to find myself,I am recently going through the hardest breakup I’ve been faced with yet and it’s been very difficult I feel like I am going crazy and with bi polar and anxiety I label myself so easily I hate it though but I feel like being self aware is good and accepting ur mental illness Ifk the anxiety part has been very difficult lately and I’m just trying to find my way. Like what happens when u literally feel so lost at such a young age of adulthood. I am tired of my 9-5 even though my great success in it. I started to record music but I am so shy I legit hate hearing my voice and I’ve realized how I’ve literally never really heard my voice that much and it feels almost like a loss of identity like I don’t have a voice at all because I hate my voice but I just don’t know what to do anymore I feel so disconnected from everything it’s crazy I reached out for a therapist but fuck that legit to no prevail I know there are hotlines and warm lines but what I want isn’t to talk I want legit fulfillment. How does one find that like I feel I have no passion or drawn to anything the things I’m good at I am bored of
1269,text-based online therapy? and overcoming being guarded and uncommunicative,"Does anyone know a service for therapy by text chat or email? I think I will more easily express myself this way. In person I am extremely guarded and unwilling to show emotion and I think because of this therapists in the past have assumed I am doing better than I actually am. and we haven't delved into my actual problems.

Like, I need extreme mental health intervention but i'm too scared to talk about my issues in real life. I need a therapist or whoever to ask more pointed questions and actually pull the info out of me because I'm not able to just volunteer it. Nor do I know what is or is not relevant.

Any advice or suggestions would be great, thank you."

1272,I'm too old to be acting like a teenager (just venting),"And yet I am. 

I'm not okay. I don't know why, but that's how it is. I want to lose so much weight, partially because of how much better I looked when I was younger, but also I just want someone to notice things aren't okay but I'm not losing weight fast enough. I'm only down 3kg in a month. I know it's pathetic to be looking fo attention but there you all have it. I'm pathetic.

1273,Will/can exposure to fear in general help with anxiety?,"I am not sure whether or not I am posting in the right sub, but hopefully someone could be able to answer this. 

I have struggled with anxiety for quite a while now, mainly in social situations, but also in those where I have to perform well (e.g. in school and sports). The worst part for me is the physical symptoms, and I recently figured that the way in which my body reacts in these situations is pretty much identical to how I feel when I am scared. I assume that this has something to do with the adrenaline that gets released. Therefore, I started wondering whether or not your body can get used to the stress hormones, and that way reduce the physical symptoms in the future. So in other words, if I started doing activities that scare me/cause an adrenaline rush, Would I be able to see a reduction in the severity of the physical symptoms in other situations as well?"
1274,How do I get over things?,"I know a part of my mental health issues stem from not being able to let things go.

I try to console him best I can but he just gets annoyed. what can I say that isn’t a cookie cutter response? I don’t have much experience with ptsd outside of my mother who Id just ignore when she got angry, that seemed to work for her. is saying nothing at all better? I don’t know. he’s also american, and I’m canadian so I can’t be there for him in person and it’s so frustrating. I’m really afraid that we won’t be able to meet in person once the borders open..."
1278,Why Do I Suddenly Feel Happy for No Reason?,[deleted]
1279,5 years.,"Hi. This isn't about me, its about my oldest brother.

He's been suffering with mental health for 5 years. I have always put in a smile whenever speaking to him, just trying to be cheerful because he never wants to talk about it. He tried medication for 3 years but in his words ""those tablets mess me up even more""

So for 2 years he's told himself and the family that he can get better on his own, he doesnt need any help from the doctors, any charities etc. 

Today he came to our family home saying how he could not sleep all night and my mum made a comment on how he needs to see professionals again as its been 2 years since he came off medication. Which resulted in him leaving the house angry and my mum crying her eyes out.

What can we do? We have tried for 5 years to talk to him, my parents even went down a private route for him to talk to a psychologist as the NHS waiting list was too long. My parents also gave him my nans house after she passed away, so he has no financial worry, which I've told them they need to stop as it doesn't provide any incentive for hin to try and get back to work.

If anyone has any advice on if they have helped someone or have been in this situation it would be great to know what you have! We all don't know what the next step forward is for him."

1282,Small issues,"I’m a 16m in the us and have a lot of issues with my mental health and just need a place to vent and talk about it without someone judging me a lot of my problems are small so I’m sorry for being whinny and spoiled and I’m also sorry for the long post

I have speech apraxia a semi rare speech impediment where you have trouble planning out words sounds and sentences I’ve had trouble with it and honestly hate myself for it with speech becoming more and more vital to life I think I’m horrible because I can’t even do something so simple. I can’t say the things I want or explain myself to people because of it I’m looked down upon and now with being at home and playing online games in some o my free time I’ve been getting assholes a lot more regularly it seems I can’t make it an hour without being told I’m stupid and a retard for it. I also have issues with slight depression and self worth it goes away once I do sports and work out with my team but doing the winter and summer it goes into overdrive because I feel worthless because I’m not working to improve and with track being canceled because of COVID my depression spiraled out of control until I started with cross this year. I have issues with my step father he used to be an alcoholic but now he’s clean and has been for a while I’m trying to make a relationship and I try but sometimes I can’t see past his yelling at me I used to get yelled at for everything I did and this made me worse and I have anger issues I’ve always had a bit of an anger issue but could bottle it up and be fine but I’ve been getting worse and worse blowing up at anything sometimes. I feel like I’m not goin toward in life when I was young I would wake up early and have little sleep and be fine I could think a lot clearer I remember saying “well at least I’m being a little shut now I’m getting it out of my system so when I’m a teen I can be like a young adult and be ready for life when I’m out of school” but now I’m a worse procrastinator and I feel like I’m becoming a horrible person and can’t stop. Even if I want to do something I can’t make myself I’m lazy and can’t do anything. I also have major trust issues My issues with self worth go over into my friendships and I truly feel sometimes That I have no friends and everyone hates me and only deal with me to be nice and not leave out the retarded kid my issues with my step father and not having a father figure for 12 years of my life have lead to me having a distrust for authority and hating people who are higher up or older than me until they prove they are nice I feel like I should trust first but I just can’t and I’ve had issues with dating with people cheating on me and more relationships then I can count looking at a list old the people I’ve dated truly makes me disgusted in myself because I’m such a whore I think I’m useless I’m relationships at times and that’s the reason my last real relationship ended because I tried to tell her she needed someone better and she lost her feelings for me and the 2 people I tried to rebound with that I thought were good left me even though they were the ones to make the first move idk what it is about me but I just feel completely and utterly useless in every thing I do I can’t keep up in sports I can’t keep a lover to save my life I can’t keep my emotions under control and I can’t even talk correctly I feel like I want go anywhere and I’ll just be a loser with no life working a shitty job that I hate and die alone with nobody to mourn me"
1283,I don't want a TREATMENT I want a CURE,"I am entirely, 100 fucking percent tired of my brain. ADHD, aspergers, and every comorbidity in the book along with them - anxiety, depression, sensory processing disorder, the working memory of a goldfish, uncontrollable stimming, time blindness, a circadian rhythm that either doesn't exist or is 26+ hours, anhedonia, you name it and I hate EVERY FUCKING SECOND OF IT. I get that some people have managed to blindly fumble their way into a place where they make their symptoms work FOR them but I seem to have been built so every benefit from one illness is counteracted by a different one so there's no positive effects from it.

What's worse is, my brain WANTS me to suffer. ""Medication"" is a 4 letter word. I've tried plenty of stuff, be it prescription, OTC, or illicit, and the one thing I've found in common is that ANY DRUG THAT'S HELPFUL will do absolutely nothing in a month's time, sometimes as little as a few days. This is handy, I can try anything I want and quit cold turkey like I never started except for the occasional physical withdrawal, but the absolute bane of my existence because no doctor will believe my meds stop working THAT FAST.

And don't even get me started on therapy. They try to teach coping mechanisms, but those require being able to remember them and stick with them when I can't even remember what the hell they were long enough to write them down and lose the post-it note if I manage to. Worse yet, they made me aware of the underlying issues and why I do the things I do so that I can ""make a conscious effort"" to improve but all that did was make me realize that no, I AM NOT IN CONTROL. Not in the slightest. I'm a dad yelling at a bratty toddler who's in control of my body and if the dumb shit feels like doing something they might eventually half-ass it but usually they blow me off to watch YouTube videos I don't even enjoy. 

I'm not even exaggerating, if my subconscious/unconscious is feeling angry at me it will quite literally leave me paralyzed by taking away all the automated processes for walking, typing, opening doors, etc and require me to consciously, manually, control individual. god. damn. muscles. to be able to move at all. I've taken to keeping a taser on my desk for when it does this because physical pain is one of the few things it understands and I can usually eek out enough manual control to give my hand a good zap for that sweet adrenaline, which is quite literally my only motivator these days since dopamine doesn't do anything anymore and if I scare/abuse the toddler living in my head they'll play along for 5 minutes maybe. This is the only way I ever get anything done.

I just want a fucking cure. Just figure out WHY my brain is as broken as it is, jam a scalpel in there and FIX THAT SHIT. Fuck neurodiversity, yall can keep it if you like it but if they figure out something that's not ""well, you're having trouble concentrating so take this diet meth and call me in a month lol"" I'm taking it, I don't even care how much it costs because my procrastination has kept me from getting a credit card to ruin my score. If I could take my consciousness and transplant it into the subconscious of basically anyone else, I'd take it in a heartbeat, regardless of how much of an impact it has on my ""personality"" because at this point my personality is literally just terrible pop culture references badly covering up a laundry list of mental illnesses."

1286,Feel okay for the first time in 20 years,"This is totally just a get my feelings out post. I started drinking, smoking and taking anything I could get my hands on when I was about 12 or 13. I was promiscuous, a thief, a liar, and drunk or high all the time. I’ve been horribly self destructive for as long as I can remember. 

When I turned 21 I became pregnant with my first child. That was the first time I was sober for 9 months. I abused alcohol so many times after her birth, as well as after the birth of my other two children. I put my partner through a lot of stuff over the past 10 and a half year’s.. and I wasn’t the best mom. I struggle with a lot of guilt over that. 

I had a pretty severe mental health crisis in the end of may which led me to the doctors office. I finally have a diagnosis, I have bipolar affective disorder as well as borderline personality. I have been on medication for two weeks now and the world feels more calm and bright already. 

I know I can be a good partner, and a good mom. I already like myself a little better... I’ve been mentally sick for as long as I can remember and I will get better. It will take time and I have a lot of fences to mend.. but I’m hopeful for the future."
1287,When actions die to mental illness are past forgiving someone?,"Hi everyone! My cousin has struggled with bipolar manic episodes for a really long time. He was doing well for 6 years but missed a day or two of his meds recently and has gone down hill real fast. He is posting really really horrible things about me and my mother on Facebook that aren’t even true. He’s calling us and everyone else in our family horrible names saying he can’t wait for us to get fat again to math our ugly (and otherer things along those lines). It’s really hard to see past this and be able to forgive him so I am curious what people think about these actions. I sort of have the mindse, especially being that this isn’t his first time, he knows the consequences of not taking his meds and is ultimately responsible for taking care of his mental health. I also feel like mental health isn’ an excuse for being an asshole? There’s plenty of people who struggle (myself included) with mental illness that don’t bully others! When he gets back on track too it doesn’t even seem like he is sorry for any of the things he’s done. He’s never apologized to anyone. 

I would really like to know others opinions if I’m being unreasonable for not wanting to forgive? When do actions go to far where mental health stops being a valid reason?"
1288,"This subreddit is an unhelpful, potentially damaging place. Sort by New or leave this sub.","I made a single, detailed post outlining my general dissatisfaction with my life, a trend which has perpetuated throughout my entire life and resulted in numerous extended periods of depression and suicidal ideation; and a trend I am trying my hardest to break.

My post was simply a request for help and advice in a time when I am trying to transition from person I no longer want to be, to a more proactive and healthy person, while also having to contend with my impending entry into the work place.

**I was completely ignored and let down by this subreddit.**

Now, I am attempting to be resilient, I know that occasionally a post on any sub will get overlooked, but frankly after having reviewed the New tab on this page, I am **disgusted** by how little attention the majority of posts get. My post didn't get a single vote or comment and was completely lost to new. I would hope this would be the exception, but even a cursory review shows that it is by far the norm.

Let me make one thing perfectly clear. If you are coming to this subreddit and sorting by ""Hot"" or ""Top"" and only commenting on popular posts or posts you find ""interesting"" **YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE.** You are helping no-one and leaving far more people to be completely ignored. If you're coming on here to read interesting stories about people's lives and circumstances and that takes priority over actually sorting by New and reaching out to people desperate for help, **you are a not being a good person.**

Now personally despite how angry I am, I do not personally care that my post got ignored. I am actually in an alright place overall, with a degree of anxiety about the future, but I can seek help elsewhere. There are people on here reaching out for help who need it, far more than any ""Top"" post which already has tens of comments. Help them, be a good person.

Now I’m facing an F because I didnt attend an exam and didn’t notice the email that said i could retake it (would have been yesterday). I was barely able to sleep yesterday eventhough this was routine for me a few years back. 

I don’t wanna share the other thing but it’s just ridiculous and nothing to have to worry about whatsoever. I just wanna be chill again and stress out when it’s actually appropriate."

Now with everything happening I am restless - I am not depressed- but I am finding it SUPER difficult to have ANYTHING done. I mean ANYTHING. my freelance stuff , cleaning my place, dishes . everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I am living alone. and since the virus I didn't get to see any of my friends . face time was an option but connection isn't great in my area so we get bored of FT lagging and cutting off so we only audio chat now.

we are on a lock down here. and im living in a very small space. I get cluster phobic sometimes. I am supposed to move abroad and I already started packing but flights are banned . The feeling that you are moving but you just dont know when , ur bags are packed , boxes everywhere. Its so numbing and I just cant describe it any more.

1291,Is there something wrong with me?,"Bare with me this is rather a long one, I’m trying to explain as best as I can. 

Since quarantine, I’ve been inside the house for months. I have no where to go since I don’t really hang out with people and don’t want to hang outside. But it’s just now that I realized that something is wrong with me, mainly because I wasn’t paying any attention to it. So let me tell you a bit of my life. I’m an introvert, I don’t really talk to anyone nor do I want to. I’m actually a sophomore now, pass the school year with what would’ve been a straight A but my English teacher kinda hates his class somehow so I got a B in his class. My grades in his class never go any higher than a B. There’s nothing much about me to know because all I ever do is spend time in my room alone and likes to be alone. I’m going through a lots of things right now so I’m stressed out. Anyways, I want to share what I’ve been experiencing for the few months I’ve been in the house:

1. I get paranoid, or unreasonably anxious because while I do what I always do i always feel like someone is watching me. But really no one is there, still it feels like someone is. When I go get something to eat from the kitchen I don’t like when the door to the laundry room is open because I feel like I was being watched from there, when I go brush my teeth I keep thinking someone is behind the shower curtains, going back to my room thinking someone is in the closet or at the back of the door waiting to lunge at me. I was googling it and it said something about delusions. As much as I like to think I’m being delusional or being dramatic. I still get suspicious about what’s happening. I live in a rather quiet and peaceful neighborhood, rarely see my neighbors so it gives me anxiety thinking that something could go wrong.

2. I remember once when I heard my mother call my name, but she would be either sleeping or not there. But this one is actually very rare to me now, but I do sometimes hear ringing or weird noises at night when I’m trying to sleep. Which i can’t really sleep well by the way I have fatigue possibly from insomnia, i have a bad sleeping habit.

3. Often I do for some reason have unwanted racing thoughts about death or other unusual thoughts I get out of nowhere. I lose interest in things quickly. You can see me finish a Netflix show but then when I want to watch it again it’s suddenly is very boring for me as if I seen it a thousands of times but i have only seen it once.

4. This is something I’ve seen rarely but often when I was an 8th grader I see a glimpse of a black shadow. This one is what I told my parents about, but they didn’t believe me.

That’s all I can think of my experience. Feel free to ask me questions because I’m rather confused with myself trying to figure out what’s being going on with me. Sorry if I don’t make sense at all."
1292,"Kind of a semi-vent, more of a list of what's going on. Feel free to help explain what the hell's happening to me","Constantly hazy. Like can't register any super complex thoughts, can't think, can barely remember anything from recent memory. I often forget what my gender is or whether or not I have a name, how tall I am, etc. More or less, I feel constantly stoned but I'm completely sober.

Emotionally colorblind. Like totally oblivious to the things I say and the ramifications behind them.

I'm kinda overly lacking in self preservation. Like sometimes I'll forget to eat or drink, or when I'm presented with a situation that could pretty easily harm me, it's usually no big deal.

I think the main takeaway from this is that I'm pretty much entirely disconnected with my body. It's kinda handy sometimes but it kinda feels like this isn't my body. Like I'm borrowing it. Yknow what I mean?"

1295,Advice on how to deal with our friend who has bipolar disorder?,"  Okay. We’re posting this since we couldn’t get any kind of advice in real life. 

We have a friend (let’s call him Mike). Mike has bipolar disorder, and he’s **very** volatile.

For a long time, he told us dramatic stories about his life, and since about a year we have noticed that these stories are quite fake. For example, claiming that his sister got angry and punched him, breaking his teeth. We know that this isn’t real because, given his dramatic and generally victimist tendencies, if his teeth really were broken he would have made a big deal of it (specially since in our country oral healthcare is very expensive). Nonetheless, he didn’t. 

We don’t want to fight with him, but sometimes he gets very delusional, so we have an agreement between the rest of the members of our group of friends in which when he tells us stories of dubious authenticity, we give Mike our condolences, but we do not dive into how dramatic and sad his life is, because we don’t want to feed his tantrum nor his hate towards the person he’s antagonising.  

This worked for a time, but now the thing is scalating. He gets very angry for small things and makes a big deal out of it. Mike gets angry even if we try to talk to him with a warm approach, and he gets really mad if we try to change the subject or just do not answer. He has always been like this, but since a year he gets angry at one of us like every week. 

Mike used to have a girlfriend, who broke up with him in a very cold way. He told us that we can still be friends with her, but we know that’s not true. A few days ago he saw us commenting her post in social media and got **really** angry. He told to us with a quite passive-aggressive and disturbing tone that he didn’t mind that we were friends with her, however he told us that she is a horrible person, that if we got into trouble with her she would stop talking to us with the same coldness, that he does not talk with our exes and that he may need to stop talking to us for a time because the mere fact of seeing us liking her posts makes him so sick. 

We found this very manipulative and got scared because he had never done something like this. Is like the thing is scalating and he’s getting worse and worse. He even remarked that the girl had ruined his life (I promise you, it was not that much of a big deal, she just broke up with Mike via Facebook), that his mental health got worse because of her and that he even tried suicide. He even blamed we being friends with her as a cause of his depression. He even told us that he wanted to marry her! (They were friends for a couple of months and dated for like a year, all of this happened while we were minors)

We know the girl and this is not that truly deep. What she did was wrong. However, the girl recognized that when we called her out. She even wanted to talk with him but didn’t because of his volatileness. He paints the situation so it seems that he wants to make up, but it’s the very opposite. He really does hate her, and we know it.

We don’t know what to do. This is burning us. However we don’t want to dump him, specially knowing his condition. But we are very young and inexperienced, and have no realiable adult figure that could help us. This is very draining, we feel like we’re his nurses and we need to measure every simple word or behaviour so he doesn’t explode. He’s going to therapy and we’re doing our best to be good and kind friends with him but shit, it’s imposible to negotiate with him in any subject, he thinks he’s always right, makes a big deal of everything and never apologizes. 

What should we do? I feel kind of embarrased posting this, but we really don’t have anyone to guide us."

It feels like a void.

To fell the void I watched random shows that I enjoyed, I didn't like talking to my friends - felt really left out. But I was extremely hurt when I didn't code for like a month and still I didn't feel the need to do it.

It was then that I wanted to do something for people who go through this, an app which doesn't judge you, doesn't respond to your feelings but I can always have conversations with it, a private space, a place I can be myself and still not be worried about anything. This was a motivation to get back, get back to work, get back to Coding, I coded, shared my updates with the app, ranted about things, shared my smallest feelings, anger and frustrations, it felt like someone is listening to me, I would go back to any specific day and read what went wrong, correct it and improve, it helped me recover, today I feel I am good, I am back, I talk to people, I enjoy games with my friends, I behave normal, I code, I enjoy my life now.

1300,I've written up a list of issues I struggle with - can anyone offer online resources such as CBT that might benefit me?,"I saw a counsellor for a while but they kept pushing me to go to group rape counselling (got mildly sexually abused as a child by some older neighbourhood kids) so I quit that. I'm not really interested in going back and want to help myself. 

*Thank you so so much to anyone who might have resources to share with me!*

These are some issues I identified that bother me regularly:

**What do I struggle with day-to-day?**

* Believing that many things I see/experience have an ulterior/secret message, meaning or motive, leading to distressing overthinking and jumping to surreal conclusions
* Never feeling like I meet ""good"" standards so I've given up on all the stuff I used to enjoy, such as writing and painting. Feel like nothing I ever do is good enough and I'm a failure
* Focusing - zoning out when people are talking to me one-on-one. Zoning out watching TV and reading books or driving. Caught up in random thought trails that jump eratically from one topic to the next
* Conversing normally - I feel like my topics of conversation are immature and childish, and that I can't properly contribute to adult conversations. Although this may not be true and might just be social anxiety
* Panicking during every conversation about what I'm saying/doing/how I look. I never catch a break from this
* Depressive thoughts. Can't really have good thoughts about myself. Can sit staring at the wall for hours and hours whilst my mind runs wild with self-deprecating thoughts (""you're stupid, pathetic, never amount to anything, can't do anything right"" and so on).
* Believing that nobody likes me, including family. So I don't talk to anyone, or ever go out anywhere 
* Generally just don't feel like I fit in with other people
* Abused drugs since age 16, moved from Class A to weed which I now smoke daily although I try to quit frequently
* Poor body-image 
* Anxiety attacks and depressive episodes after sex (but only if I orgasm)

&amp;#x200B;

**What do I struggle with occasionally?**

* Heard voices since childhood - difference voices shouting my name. Although this happens infrequently
* A few weird disassociative episodes. For example suddenly thinking that I am stuck in Hell (was actually in my bedroom watching a movie) and my boyfriend is a demon who is trying to eat me alive. Thinking people are coming to my house to kill me so I hide with a knife. Or one time after several hours of self-deprecating thoughts, screaming ""I hate you"" repeatedly into the mirror - my reflection was ""me"" and I - the person in reality - was something else. Not sure what, just not me. 
* Letting my mind run wild and staring at things, my eyes start to warp them into other things. I.e. staring at a shadow on the wall my mind makes it look 2d then turns it into a weird scene that is different from reality
* Self harming and suicidal attempts/thoughts
* Starving myself"

1307,Anger isn't all bad. Here are four ways it can help you grow.,"When I was in elementary, I had a tutor named Sarah. She was a great mentor. She was compassionate, wise, and someone I trusted. One day while she was helping me with my homework I blurted out, “Sarah. I don’t like it when I’m angry. I want to cut it off.”

“You want to cut off the feeling of anger?” she asked surprised.

“Yea. When I get angry, I can’t control myself and only bad things happen,” I said. “I yell. I say mean things. I hurt people. And sometimes I get so mad I want to punch something.”

“I see,” Sarah paused. “Sometimes I do bad things when I’m angry too. But you know what? You shouldn’t cut off your anger.”

“Why?” I asked.

“Because anger is an emotion and emotions are what make us human,” she smiled.

“Oh okay,” I said and went back to my homework.

# Anger is a Powerful Emotion

I think many of us can identify with Little Andrew and his relationship with anger. It is such a powerful emotion that sometimes we lose control. We say hurtful things we don’t mean. We take things too far. We act irrationally.

Because of this, it is easy to see anger only as a negative emotion. But anger can actually be constructive rather than destructive:

1. Anger tells you information about yourself.
2. Anger activates you into action.
3. Anger helps you fight for something you value.
4. Anger helps you build self-respect.

## Anger Tells You Information About Yourself

Anger is a secondary emotion. That means it’s a response to a primary emotion such as embarrassment, disappointment, or fear.

In this way, anger is like smoke. Just like how smoke tells you that something is burning, anger tells you that you are reacting to a primary emotion. Therefore anger is a signal that something deeper is happening and can be used to learn more about yourself.

When you get angry, take a moment and explore the [Emotion Iceberg](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-explore-the-emotion-iceberg). Figure out what primary emotions are underneath it and pay down any [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and#what-is-emotional-debt) if needed.

## Anger Activates You Into Action

Once upon a time I was let go from work and I was devastated. I was depressed, I struggled with low self-esteem, and I couldn’t get motivated to do anything. But as I was thinking about my time at the company, I got angry. I got angry because I realized that there were a lot of things that weren’t handled properly. I got angry because I felt like I was never really given a fair shot. This anger gave me the energy I needed to step out of my sadness and move forward.

In this way, anger can activate you into action. It can also help you overcome emotions that keep you stuck like fear, doubt, and anxiety.

Earlier I mentioned that anger can make you act irrationally. It is precisely this trait that allows you to bypass the fear, doubt, and anxiety that are telling you not to do something. By getting angry and irrationally ignoring these warnings, you are now capable of moving past them.

## Anger Helps You Fight for Something You Value

One of the reasons people get angry is when something they value comes under attack. This can be a set of beliefs, a family member, or even a physical object that they cherish. Anger is a signal that you can use to protect these values. It lets other people know that something negative will happen if they threaten your values in any way.

Alternatively, anger can also reveal your subconscious set of beliefs. For example, you may get angry in response to a joke. This can help expose a value that you may not have been aware of.

## Anger Helps You Build Self-respect

One time when I was playing pickup basketball, my team was down 5-11. The other team only needed 2 more points to win. I started yelling at my teammates in anger to play some defense and play harder. In my mind, we had the better team. We shouldn’t have been losing. We went on to win the game after scoring 8 points in a row.

Afterwards I went up to my teammate Drew and apologized for yelling and he said, “Don’t be. We needed it.” My anger communicated to the team that we were better than how we were playing. It communicated to them that we could win if we fought. And they appreciated it.

In this way, anger can be used to build self-respect. When you choose to see yourself as a value worth protecting, you can then activate yourself with anger to fight and set boundaries. For example, anger can help you stand up for yourself when someone disrespects you. It can also help increase productivity when you’ve been lazy.

Hopefully by now you can see that there are benefits to anger. Like my tutor Sarah said, emotions are a part of what makes us human. So the next time you get angry, see it as an opportunity. Embrace it, dig into what’s causing it, and learn how you can use it to grow.

1314,"Need help for cop-fearing, mentally ill parent","I don't use reddit, so i'm sorry if I do a no-no

I (20) live with my parents and my brother in Canada. My mother (50) has been showing signs of mental illness, and what I'm pretty sure is schizophrenia 

she's shown signs of mental illness in the past, but ever since this pandemic started, it feels like it's all just snowballed into a huge mess. Heres a list

**1.**Stockpiling. Our basement is stuffed with more food/resources than we can ever need, including an air soft pistol and machete. This is for 'when shit hits the fan' as she often puts it. We've dumped at least 3,000$ into this. 

**2.** Fears. She believes the cops might break into our house and force us to vaccinate against covid. She leaves trail cameras around the house, has installed a small security system, bought barricades for the doors and bought things that are supposed to make the windows of our house bullet proof. 

**3.** Hallucinations. She talks about seeing things a lot, anything from beams of light in the sky to sprawling scenery and people in the backyard that in no way exists. She talks about hearing spirits and guardians angels. I usually find her awake anytime from 12-3am just sitting in the dark and staring out windows. 

She is aggressive and doesn't listen to reason, picking fights wherever she can in my family, distancing herself from her friends and even my older sister whom was her voice of reason for a very, very long time. My brother has anxiety and refuses to do anything about it, insisting this is just something spurred up by the pandemic and that it'll go away when she has more structure to her day. My father has been (for lack of a better word,) a limp-dick loser for the past decade and a half and honestly just likes to feed into the idea of having guns and doomsday prep. 

They both watch these hard-core conspiricists that talk about the end of the world and covid being a hoax, as well as right-wing leaning videos, like fox news and other stuff I don't recognize. This is the complete opposite to what my mom watched before this, usually being a fairly centrists/left kind of person.  Her political leaning doesn't really matter to me, but she's very bigoted, and makes me worried as I am apart of a few minority groups that often gets bashed in these videos. 

I'm sort of jobless, addicted to drugs and have only 2 friends that live in a different country. I have several mental illnesses myself, including anxiety and ptsd, and my therapist has long since stopped returning my calls. I pretty much spend my days playing video games, working a freelance online job and fighting my suicidal tendencies. She refuses to help me get my medications, and I don't know how/have no way of doing it myself, so being the family's activist and getting shit sorted out is getting way too hard for me to handle on my own. 

I've looked into mental health help and my brother even called a crisis line- they said that they'd have to bring a cop while assessing my mother's mental health, and that is one of the biggest issues since she's so scared of them. 

I love her. Even though she's grown bigoted and hateful, I want nothing more than to see her get the help she needs and to reunite her with the friends and family she pushed away. She's lived a long, rough life and doesn't deserve to suffer like this.

I'm really sorry this is so long but  
**TL;DR:** My mom has been showing signs of schizophrenia for the past 3 months, and the only way to get her help is to get a cop involved. She's terrified of them and will refuse. The rest of my family would rather wait and see what happens than get the help right now. We are thousands of dollars in dept and I'm scared.

I'm sorry if I don't answer replies, but I will read them. My parents monitor my computer use sometimes and I'd be fucked if she caught this post."
1315,I feel nothing about anything,"29m and my problem is that I don't typically feel anything about much of anything. I've felt like this for probably 10-15 years now.

I'm anhedonia personified. I don't feel sad or depressed, generally my mood is stable and I feel alright. My mind, while good at the task at hand, is essentially devoid of any background or internal monologue the rest of the time. I almost have to procrastinate to an extreme to give me some anxiety to do much of anything, otherwise there's just no middle ground. 

I'm either totally devoid of any feeling at all or I'm winging it because I have 5 minutes to do something that will take 20, and I'm only doing it because I have to. I have completely lost any creative impulse at some point along the way. It's like when you look at a menu at a restaurant and nothing sounds good, except I wake up everyday with that feeling


I've taken Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor, and Cymbalta. Each for 6mo to a year at a time. I've also been through CBT many times and nothing seemed to work, even on extremely high dosages of all of those"
1316,Coming off lithium (not bipolar) what I've experienced,"It's a long story but basically I was misdiagnosed as bipolar a long time ago and have been on lithium for 8 years. At 900mg, my psychiatrist and therapist concluded that I should get off lithium.

I have tried to find info on what to expect if you are NOT bipolar and haven't really found much so I thought I would write a little about my experience if anyone is interested. I am not implying the items listed are a direct result of decreasing lithium, just that they occured after the decrease. I have also started 2 new meds: adderall and paxil.

First decrease (900mg to 600mg): 
-terrible insomnia for a few weeks
- a little emotional, akin to PMS
-dramatic increase in creativity
- a bit more anxiety, but that could be attributed to just being nervous about what to expect
-able to recover from upset mood more quickly/move past hurt feelings faster
- lost 15 pounds

Second decrease (600mg to 300mg):
-only been a few days so I will update later if anyone is interested
-bad insomnia again
-increase in anxiety but feel more in control of my actions, I feel my adderall and excessive caffeine intake might have a lot to do with this
-talking fast, but not disjointed
- more impulsive but not self-destructive (interrupt people a little more mostly, i don't go on spending sprees or say hurtful things or anything like that, you could argue it's an increase of confidence and energy and I'm just getting used to it)

I have not had the energy to add cardio and meditation into my daily routine yet, but I feel those will help dramatically. More to come, hope this is informative!

Edit: I also noticed my skin is clearer and less sensitive"
1317,2 months self harm free!,"I made it to two months! When I made it to 50 days I couldn’t believe it, and now I’m 2 months self harm free!!"
1318,"People who have pets, what effect (if any) do your notice on your mental health?",Is it something that's helped you? I don't have any for now but I'm curious.
1319,If yall have any advice it's much appreciated,
1320,Have you ever felt like everyone you ever loved hurt you one way or the other? How did you overcome it? I'm not asking for sympathy but strategy and experiences. Any strategy at all. Please and thank you.,"If this is too long, I know everyone is busy and has a life, etc etc, just scroll down and read the TLDR. Please.

My life looks perfect from the outside: good at doing almost everything I ever tried (I'm not trying to be arrogant, just wait I need your help, I really do and I need to be honest to get it), successful and balanced overall, albeit being pretty eccentric in some ways. The problem is this: somehow I've always been the person people shit on in my personal life. 

I got stalked and molested before I was even 19, before I ever even had a casual date. My experience of men was tainted from there. I tried really really hard, found a few really good friends and was finally feeling at one with the world. These people gave me hope.

Then, my best friends, who happened to be guys, bullied me and almost tried to coerce me into saying yes to something I didn't want (had to say NO loudly and clearly 8-9 times before they stopped, had tears in my eyes at the end). That was a deep wound, emotionally and years of friendship and trust went down the drain in my head. At about the same time, one of my female friends disclosed a medical problem (not serious) that I had requested her to not tell anyone in front of a whole group of people. Trust, gone down the drain. Then, a guy who I'd really liked from a distance for a long while approached me, and lo and behold, turns out I'm the idiot and he's just a really mean guy who has some issues with women taking advantage of my poor boundaries and my kindness.

All of these things happened around the same time and left me with two realisations: 1. That I had poor boundaries and 2. that people basically need to be kept in check most of the time and you can't ever really trust someone. I spent the rest of my social time being careful to remember these things when interacting and it seems to have solved the social issue. People no longer treat me like shit if I enforce boundaries and stay aware to give reminders of that. I focused on my work, which I truly enjoy more than anything else. I enjoy it in a way an artist enjoys painting and that love has saved me from all the shit I've ever been through. 

TL,DR: Practically, I'm fine, good, successful even in the worlds' definition. But I have lost hope in people ever being nice to me or caring about me at a personal level. Also, I'm fairly young and I want to love someone halfway decent, I want to be able to look into someone's eyes and not see deception. Being smart enough to see through hurts like nothing else. I do things for people, I'm sincere, I'm always there when they're really in trouble and everyone seemingly fucks me over. Be brutally honest here, please. Tell me if you were here and something helps, tell me if you think I'm the problem, tell me if you think I'm too sensitive. But, please try to help. Thanks."
1321,Do you think it’s ok to live at home at 30?,"I had to move home because of the pandemic after several years of living on my own. I’m planning on going back to school in the fall so I need to save up financially. I have a job and I’m not a freeloader, but I guess I feel embarrassed about it?

I have really bad PTSD and anxiety and self harm issues and BPD and guess it doesn’t help make me feel any more normal. My siblings live at home as well due to expenses.

I have a goal to move out once my worm reopens and I finish my school. I guess I feel ashamed because I’m such an introvert and I don’t have a relationship or close friendships. 

I don’t know how to feel ok with where I am."
1322,Am I manic?,"I suffer from anxiety and mild depression and take zoloft for it. After i go through my lows with depression  i will always feel the really intense need to change things. Like i was sad all week and now ive dyed my hair, tattooed myself, am thinking i want to bleach my eyebrows and give myself another tattoo and get a piercing. Like i just feel like i need to do everything. Like I dont really have any other symptoms of manic episodes so idk if its that i just always go through this and don’t know why. Does anyone else go through similar feelings? Is it just the way i am or is there a reason for this?"
1323,How do I get better?,"My story is really lengthy and detailed but I’ll try and summarize it. 

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for a lot of my life and I recently opened up to my sister because it’s severely affected my academics and I feel like I’m wasting money at college because my mom pays tens of thousands a year and I just can’t seem to get decent grades or the grades I used to. I was considered a gifted child when I was younger but that all changed around junior and senior year of high school because I didn’t know how/was too scared to ask for help and didn’t know how to handle all my stress. Me and my sister aren’t close so it took a lot to open up to her and it bothers me because she didn’t comfort me, she just yelled at me basically and told me that’s how life is, it’s hard. I know that but I don’t know. I just didn’t like the way she responded and I feel like opening up to her didn’t make much of a difference. I think this is more a rant if anything, so I apologize if this is out of place. 

I just feel so lost and I have so many issues and I feel like it’s so so hard to get better.


Edit: Might be random but I had to send a financial document to my sister and I was literally in the middle of it and she sends a passive aggressive sounding text which really triggered me. I was literally going to do it, why do you have to always sound like you’re yelling at me all the time??????? Ugh"
1324,My life with emetophobia so far,"Hello. I am a 26 year old male living in a Western European country. In the following ‘few’ words I will try to summarize my life in the hope that someone sees what I am missing. 

  
  First off: I have emetophobia. I have an irrational fear of vomiting, feeling nauseous and everything that could possibly cause either of it.   I would argue that the fear manifested at the age of 9 or 10 when I got the stomach flu after having visited family the day after Christmas. My dad had the flue a few days before that and so did a lot of other relatives, at that point in time I was not really afraid of being sick, so I did not think about keeping distance from my dad. Anyway, I can’t quite remember how it all developed, but I do remember waking up vomiting and having the reaction and sense at that point in time to catch it with my hands, so I wouldn’t get my bed dirty. I remember my mother coming into my room, telling me that it wasn’t a problem and that everything would be fine. I have no memory of what happened after that, she however told me that I apparently vomited in a very painful looking and violent way. I remember that the vomit had a very strong disgusting potatoish taste, as this was mainly what I ate at my relatives. I wouldn’t eat potatoes for years after the incident.     
  Up to that, I would have described myself as a relatively normal child. Being born before 2000 I feel like I had a very privileged childhood without social media being a large part of it. I was very active, played a lot of sports, was generally happy (I actually remember the feeling of that) and I did not even think about food. I have always had a rather slim build, as I never ate much and was constantly running around. My parents also never forced me to finish meals. If I wasn't hungry anymore I should not have to eat.   In retrospect this seems unusual as my friends' parents almost always had a 'finish your plate' attitude. 

  
  My behaviour, my state of mind, my attitude toward things, all that changed subconsciously after that last vomiting incident. Still being in the equivalent to a middle school, my mother had to come and get me more and more often as I apparently had stomach aches. As soon as I was home these stomach aches stopped, which of course led my mother to believe I was faking it. So she became angrier with me. We checked in with doctors. They couldn't find anything. So I got some pills (homeopathic) and my stomach aches slowly went away.       
  For a long time everything seemed to go back to 'normal' and I was about to go to high school soon. My teacher claimed that I had a gift for languages, an opinion I didn't share (as you probably will be able to tell by the mistakes I make throughout this). So instead of attending a high school that specialized on languages I decided to follow my guts and what I thought would make me more happy. With two of my best friends I attended a high school specializing on sciences and math. I even gained a few new friends early on and everything was very exciting.   

  
  Parallel to all that happening, I ate less and less as time went by. I still enjoyed sports very much, but I gradually stopped seeing my friends outside of school. After two school years or so my parents decided to go for a beach holiday in southern Europe.   The first time my parents saw me basically naked (in swim shorts) they were shocked. They apparently haven't had such a view of me for quite a long time. Hence, neither of us had realized how much weight I had actually lost.   It was like 35 °C outside and I was constantly freezing. This holiday time was basically, like constantly being on drugs. I was to weak to enjoy anything. Additionally two other 'vomit incidents' happened: A boy swimming in the sea was caught by a wave full on and swallowed a whole lot of the salt water, which basically made him puke instantly. The texture of the vomit floating in the sea I can still remember quite vividly. What bothered me wasn't the fact that he vomited. It was the irrational fear of me getting in contact with the vomit (which was spreading in the sea) somehow and possibly catching something. The other incident was as my parents and I were renting a pedal boat, severely underestimating the waves. My dad and I got pretty nauseous just a few minutes being on it. It got so bad that we had to jump into the water, dragging the boat back to the shore. 

  
  Before this holiday I was deeply involved into an online video game (Guild Wars). This game gave me a lot. Mostly social interactions. It was challenging and a perfect distraction from my real problems that I didn't even knew I had. So this was taken from me during these holidays and I was stuck in my malnourished body and of course in my head as well. The state of mind in that current time was later described to me as 'tired of life', wish is different from being suicidal. I had no intention of killing myself, but I really didn't care if I had died. This came to  my realization on our flight back. Basically we experienced some turbulence's. The plane that we originally were supposed to be flying home in with wasn't available, so we got a smaller one. Everything was a little off about it. The pilot was wearing khaki shorts. We had to go to the plane by foot. The windows inside were leaking what I assumed to be condensation water. Anyway, we got up and the flight was rough. A lot of woman and children screaming. But I was like 'meh'. Who cares. If we die, we die.     
  Arriving back home and settling into our everyday life. My parents did everything to get me to a doctor. At this point in time nobody knew what was wrong with me and why I was eating so little, while feeling so sick all the time.  First stop was my pediatrician, who basically send me straight into a hospital due to me being dangerously underweight. Which was horrifying from my point of view, as I hadn't even realized the severeness of the situation.   

  
  I can't remember how much time exactly passed between this visit and me being hospitalized, but I do remember missing school while being in the hospital. Which led to an increase of negative feelings against my parents and especially my mother, as I had the feeling that she was responsible for me being in this position. This of course hurt her very much. And still I wanted her to stay with me, especially during nights.     
  In the hospital a lot of blood work and other non-invasive tests were done. All without any significant conclusion. My condition got worse and if no solution would be found soon I would have to be fed artificially. I remember nights where my EKG would pull me out of my sleep because my extremely slowed down heartbeat would trigger some beeping warning signals. 

  
  The most memorable part during my hospital stay was when they decided to put in a gastric tube into my stomach. Unfortunately they tried and failed exactly this with a boy I was sharing the room with, with him being under anesthesia. So they decided I would have to do it while being fully awake. A horrifying situation for me. For everyone who doesn't know what I am talking about: A tube was put into my nose and pushed from there into my stomach, while the other end with a little computer was strapped to my chest. During this procedure your gag reflex is going to be triggered, which I of course immediately associated with vomiting. And while being around 160cm tall at that time and weighing around 40kg or less, for the first time in my life I realized what a human body, even such an underfed one, was capable off. Three male doctors, two nurses and my father all had to hold me down, as I was giving every last bit of what I had to prevent that tube going into my stomach. Only when they allowed my father into the room (my parents were waiting outside behind a glass window) and my mother started crying I started to cooperate. I gagged a lot. Gagged and swallowed the tube until it was through.   

  
  The feeling of the gastric tube wasn't as bad. It got bad when I was eating the little bits I had to, mainly cookies. Each swallow would pull on the tube downwards, which made eating even less attractive to me.     
  Analyzing the data the tube provided, of course, led to nothing. I had an increased amount of stomach acid, which could be explained by the fact that I wasn't eating. So the conclusion was clear. There was no physical reason for me feeling sick and being underweight.   

  
  During the time in the hospital some few close friends from school and my class teacher where allowed to come visit me bringing letters from everyone. This and the fact that another boy I was sharing my room with, who was a few years younger than I was, was doing math homework, which I helped him with, made me realize how much I was missing in school. I recognized the possibility that I would be held back because of my missed time, which would ultimately lead to me loosing my friends (in my mind).   
  This somehow gave me motivation to eat again. Something had clicked and I had decided that I didn't want to die. So I started to eat more. I realized that I was avoiding food because I had a simple but common misconception: If my stomach is empty, I wont be able to vomit anything out.   I nowadays know that this is very much possible and in fact much more painful than emptying a full stomach.   This realization however did not lead me to discard this misconception. It still is, up to this day, even though much less, something that I cannot completely forget.   

  
  Next up was a visit with a psychiatrist, who was supposed to evaluate my state of mind and advice on further treatment. I don’t remember much about that appointment, but the weird fact that he checked my patella reflex (the thing when someone punches you on your knee cap and your leg moves) and of course that he strongly advised my mother to put me into a psychiatric clinic.   This is was a horrible suggestion from my point of view. I would have to leave my parents and there would be no chance of finishing the school year.   

  
  So together with my pediatrician my parents compromised on me visiting a day clinic. Of course this wasn’t fine with me either and I hated going there. I was a child. I just wanted to be normal again.   My time in the day clinic amounted to about two months or so. Of course during this time, basically nothing happened to improve my well being. I got sorted into a few activities including few school classes, but it was basically all bullshit. It just felt like waiting for something to happen. I became more and more depressed with my situation and during this time there I only had one talk with the psychiatrist. This talk was right in the beginning and he basically wanted to put me onto some antidepressants straight away, which made my parents also very skeptic. One thing led to an other and it resulted in an argument with my parents and the psychiatrist and they pulled me out of the day clinic.   

  
  Next stop: Normal therapy sessions with a child psychiatrist. Some of the sessions my mother and even an aunt of mine attended, for others I was alone. The doctor tried to assess who I was and of course what my problems were. He however never came to the diagnosis of me being emetophobic. Instead he diagnosed that I had a manic depression (which I still don’t get to this day). A few other evaluating tests were done. IQ tests, concentration tests etc. Apparently the IQ test, if I remember correctly, came out a little below average. It was claimed that I had concentration difficulties (which there might have been many fucking reasons for, psychological as well as physical,  e.g. still being underweight and constantly tired). And furthermore they said that my ability to remember numbers and stuff like that was above average. 

  
  The sessions went on and I was put on meds either way, with the active substance being opipramol. This stuff is usually described as a tricyclic antidepressant (which it isn’t). But it helped. Even though every time I had to take the liquid drops was a fight against the taste and the fear of vomiting.   Parallel to this I started to attend school again slowly. I had the best class teacher anyone could ask for. She managed everything with the principal, vouching for me and everything. As I had missed the start of learning the second foreign language, which every student has to choose, she even gave me extra lessons in french during breaks so I would catch up. I owe her a lot and I am very grateful.   Firstly, I would only be in school reduced hours, as my therapist claimed everything more would be too much for me. I was extremely motivated to get through the school year and was eventually allowed to move up with my class mates, even though I missed like half of the school year. My grade point average of course significantly decreased to the years before that and every bad grade made me mad at my situation. This somehow sparked an ambition in me, which would later develop to something rather dangerous. The only negative experience I had was not being allowed to attend a schools ski trip. From which I later got to know that a stomach bug was going around during that time and like 50% of the students and teachers caught it. They all had to vomit and some even were collected by there parents early.   

  
  With time I felt better and my fear lost presence in my life, as I also managed to avoid triggering experiences. I was able to attend school regularly again. My parents and the doctor slowly put me off the meds using placebos and I was soon back to a more normal self. I got back into sports and and also into a trading card game (similar to MAGIC The Gathering). For which I regularly attended tournaments in a small shop in our city. During that time I took buses to get to the shop. And for a short time the fear crept back onto me. Being in these buses I feared vomiting and not being able to get out.   

  
  Besides that, and my social interactions in school, I did not have much else going for me. I wasn’t interested in girls or in music (still being pretty young), but in this card game and Lego. I build a lot with Legos. Hours. I would forget everything around me, unfortunately also eating sometimes, planning everything I wanted to do in my head. My mind was occupied and it was great.   In between I had stopped seeing my psychiatrist. I manged to get my grades up (being class best at times with 2 or 3 others) and was fully focused on my future. School became my whole life and good grades gave me the short gratification I longed for. And I have to correct this last sentence. It weren't good grades that gave me this short bliss and rush, it were the best grades. An A- gave me no gratification. I became ultra competitive and overly ambitious regarding grades. I even spend holidays working through the stuff that would be taught to us the following semester. So I very easily slid into the role of being a very good student. Teachers and other students would recognize me as such. And soon they would ask why only wrote an A- in my last exam. I was completely differently measured and judged compared to other 'average' students. I had no real social group I belonged too, but was cool with basically everybody. I guess peopled liked me because I was loyal and also very reliable. They could count on me if they needed help. And I was able to blend in and adept easily at every social atmosphere.   

  
  The very of vomiting wasn't that present anymore. I was still a skinny kid and had problems eating a lot, but I wasn't spending a problematic amount of time thinking about it. I was living life playing this role. I got back into sports at the end of high school. Started playing football (soccer) and also Basketball (which I preferred). In both I also got very competitive. Even though at times it was hard to keep up with sports and school I somehow managed. So approaching the end of high school I realized that I was closer to a perfect grad point average as I would have thought. Remember I have never been an overly smart or intelligent student. I just spend a lot of time studying and dismissed all other possible interests, including human relationships. So my marks often were close to perfect. But in some subjects I lacked skill or something. Still though I got close to the perfect GPA and actually tried to pursue it and eventually got it. I felt like I achieved something incredible (altough 6 other students out of 200 or so manged to do the same). The feeling didn't last long however. It opened every possible door for further education, but I kinda felt like a fraud. It is to mention here, that my parents never pressured me to be a great student, they were always supportive but never really demanding. 

  
  Parallel to getting my high school degree I ended the football season with great success but fucked up my knee later on during basketball. The doctor told me I had a jumper's knee and also some deformation in my kneecap, which basically meant that I couldn't play basketball any longer if I wanted the pain and lack of mobility in my knee to go away. 

  
  So sport as a balancing component to my life was gone. I focused on university. It was clear that I would either study physics (because maths and physics were my strongest subjects and my teachers urged me to do so) or medicine (because I could easily get into it with my GPA). Physics it was. Hpyer-motivated, incredibly inexperienced and stupid as I was, I even thought I could study both in parallel but would start with physics to see how it went. I know...   I had noone to help me with these decisions or guide me through it. I was the first person in my family that even qualified to study at a university. But I did have one guy from school who also decided on studying physics (we went on doing everything together and became pretty close friends out of convenience). 

  
  So let me skip a little quicker through my time in university (at least the Bachelor time). It basically killed me. The sheer volume was just so much more than school was that I was completely overstrained. I soon was bitch slapped back to reality. My marks went down. I was no longer close to being 'perfect' and thoughts of just bailing on everything did rise in my mind. Which of course I couldn't do because of my stubborn and pathological ambitions.   My student life did not include partying and drinking. My student life was studying like 12 hours a day. And of course also the days in school had been shorter compared to these. I got extremely tired during  the days. And this is when the emetophobia crept back into my life. I wouldn't go to the canteen during my bachelor time. Simply because I often choose a very tight schedule and because eating there would just stress me out. I felt observed and of course I had the fear of vomiting in university.   

  
  I went to my fathers family doctor (who knew nothing about my past) and he basically just told me I should try to eat more in order to get over this tiredness. I somehow compromised and started to make time in my schedule to eat something that I brought with me. I pulled through my bachelor (as I always did) was able to write my thesis in a field that had little to do with physics and got my degree with a B and finished in the standard 6 semesters .   

  
  Instead of stopping here and pursuing something else in life, I continued with my master studies. Everyone encouraged me to do, as a simple bachelor degree in physics wasn't worth anything.   The first semester continued just like the last bachelor semester. But during the semester brake another (and to this day last) vomiting incident happened.   

  
  It was a horrible summer day for me. I ate lunch (a large one in my opinion) pretty late at around 3 p.m.. Around that time I had an argument with my mother, as I asked her if she thought that I was still to skinny and she told me that I could definitely gain more weight. Which made me extremely mad. And out of spite I ate an other chocolate bar. I was stuffed. But this wasn't a problem an average human being could not handle.   However I decided  to play my second round of Day-Z (which was basically PUBG back in the day). The game was extremely intense for me and gave me an adrenaline rush, also making me somewhat nauseous because of the style you have to play it. So after finishing the game I started to panic. I couldn't really talk to my mother because were still fighting and it was extremely hot outside. So I tried to calm me down. I went to the toilet to have bowl movement. After that I felt something at the back of my throat. It was some kind of fluid. And right after that I started to gag. As I know now this can happened if you are about to vomit to protect your throat and teeth from being damaged by the stomach acid.   So I full blown panicked and I ran to parents. They realized the situation and the fight was forgotten. They tried to calm me down but I was to far in it. So I sat down on the couch in the living room with a bucket and a blanket. And as if the world was conspiring against me a full blown thunderstorm started to gather outside. The air pressure changed immediately. And I vomited. I think 2 or 3 times. I remember the feeling right after was extreme relieve. But if picture the feeling of vomiting right now I cannot picture this relieve. My father actually said that now I would never again would have problems with vomiting again and he was extremely sincere about it. At first I thought I managed it well. I even went to a barbecue party the following weekend. But after that I entered a rapid downward spiral. Everything was back to square one. I was afraid to eat. I was afraid to be left alone. I was afraid to go anywhere. It was horrible.   

  
  I managed to pull threw it somehow getting through my master studies. But I developed a serious fear of exams. Something I never had before. I was never able to eat before exams (but this was normal for me), as I were in an extremely concentrated but tense state of mind. However now the nausea before exams dominated. I was so afraid that I had to vomit during exams, that I would position myself closest to an exit as possible, just in case I had to run out. I scanned the room for bins I could vomit into, just like I did all these years back. Of course this lead to an decrease in my marks. But I no longer cared about that. I just wanted to pass and be done with it. So the last exam I had to write was another breaking point for me.   I got noticed that I failed the exam by 0.5 points (however this information was without any guarantee as it came from my tutor). I could not believe it. I had such a good feeling. But this broke me. The idea that I had to write an other exam and possible add whole semester two my studies was mortifying for me. I just wanted to go on and write my thesis and be done with all the pressure. So I got this notification on a Friday and would be sure about it until Monday, spending the whole weekend in the void of my mind. I remember taking a walk through the forest, crying, while it started to rain. I didn't turn back. I just kept going. For hours I walked to the forest until I reached some tree that caught my attention and the thought of killing myself popped into my head. I realized this as soon as it happened and I started crying even more. I were so overwhelmed by my feelings that I didn't know what to do.   

  
  The monday came and I went to university to take a look at my marked exam. Indeed 0.5 points were missing. But also the whole last task (which gave like 30% of the points) was graded with 0 points because I apparently missed the question (which I totally disagree with to this day, but was way to tired to argue about it.). Anyway I noticed something else. I had written a correct equation down which was also graded with 0 points by my own tutor. So I was visibly confused and talked to the professor. He firstly said the equation was wrong and wrote down the 'correct' one, which was the same fucking equation that I wrote, but inverted. I straight up told him that got 2 points for it and passed the exam.   I don't know what would have happened if this hadn't worked and I had failed.   Besides all that crap I definitely realized that I was severely fucked up in my head. 

  
   So this time I decided on my own that I needed help. So first off I made and appointment with my mothers family doctor, who gave me a prescription for Venlafaxine. So in the morning before I was heading out for university I took the pill. And it basically knocked me the fuck out. I got so dizzy that my only fear once again was vomiting. This feeling passed eventually but I decided I would never take that stuff again.   
  After that I called a psychiatrists and eventually got an appointment with a doctor. I told him everything about my situation and asked if it was possible for him to prescribe me opipramol (the drug that I took as kid) as I knew that I almost had no side effects taking them. So he did. And I still take 100mg each day.   I started therapy soon after. Cognitive behavioral therapy. And I didn't wait for diagnosis. I straight up told her I had emetophobia and had developed severe OCD over the years in University, which I only later recognized as such.   
  Maybe it is important to mention that a few months before I got therapy my mother actually got therapy as well. She had developed a fear of suffocation and swallowing. So this maybe also influenced my state of mind.     
  My OCD was primarily a nightly routine thing but also included carrying medication against nausea, a bag, a bottle of water. Of course it also included obsessive hand washing rituals and many many more.     
  Anyway, as the therapy went on, I slowly managed to get rid of my OCD. I had developed a rather strict eating plan. As my fear drastically expanded from only fearing nausea and vomiting to a fear that I would loose all the weight I gained possibly going back to being a hospital case.   

  
So I still, to this day follow this eating plan: 

Breakfast (usually straight after I wake up): 1 slice of whole grain bread, 1 slice of whole grain crispbread with butter and smoked ham 

11:00: Fruit-salad with walnuts and quark.   

13:00: Lunch (differs)   16:00: Some bakery sweet stuff or chocolate bar   

18:00: Dinner (same size as lunch approx.)  

 21:00: Ice cream (Gelato) with almonds  

 23:00: Oatmeal nut cereal   

  
  So basically I eat 7 meals a day. I have been told this is rather healthy and what I eat yields a balanced nutrition for my body.   In therapy I of course also worked on being more flexible regarding my eating habits. Nowadays I manage to leave a meal or two completely out of my routine, or just eat at different times. However this my standard construct.   At times I still feel very stressed when I have to eat out or with people I am not particularly close with. But overall the therapy improved my life significantly even though I would describe it as a very bumpy road.     
  Parallel to therapy I finished my master's degree in the regular 4 semesters. I wrote my master thesis in the same group that I wrote my bachelor's thesis in. And managed to have a GPA equivalent to a B+ as I managed to get an A in my thesis.     
  I was functioning again. Everything got better and I was starting to enjoy life. I got offered a PhD position in the same group which I of course took. So currently I am in the second year of my PhD.     
  My PhD studies challenged me and my fear on other levels. Attending conferences was a normal thing. But I hadn't flown in years and was extremely afraid that I couldn't pursue my eating habits on those conferences. But I managed and in my first year I attended 4 conferences. Including a bigger one in the US. Which was to this point the biggest challenge for me. A 12 hour flight. Eating in a plane. Not getting enough sleep. Basically being awake for 24 hours. Arriving in a country that is known for its rather 'dead' calorie food.     
  But I got through it and I did well. I survived and I grew on it. The individual experiences there weren't great at all but from the trip as a whole I gained a lot.     
  My therapist agreed with me on that and I got more confident with myself. During my master thesis I had picked back up playing basketball. My body was no longer skinny but rather athletic. And I decided that it was time for me to have sex. (I know. What a weird transition.) 

  
  Of course I always had that urge, but I lacked time and also confidence. Both of which I had now.   So I went on tinder (classical). I got a few matches and wrote with a few women. But one in particular sparked my interest. We were completely honest with each other from the start, which was extremely refreshing for me. I told her about my emetophobia and that I had no experience with women whatsoever (besides some sexting). She was not repelled by it but rather intrigued. We wrote a lot and had some dates. At the end of one date she eventually had kissed me. Which was great. But I had developed feelings. And she basically was just interested in sex. At first. I was honest about that too and told her that I didn't think this would work for me. I didn't want this to be a fuckbuddy thing. So right before we were about to have sex I explained myself to her and asked her to decide if she wanted to try going for what we had or she could just end this here (which I was totally cool with and I wouldn't be mad about it). And then I left, which apparently impressed her. She agreed on not seeing anybody else, which was fine for me at that time. We eventually slept together and it was kinda as I expected. She said that I didn't act like a virgin, which was mainly due to me being so confident at that time. I had nothing to loose. So we grew closer and closer and saw each other every weekend. We even went on a holiday trip together. Which was also a great time overall, even though it was very exhausting. I managed extremely well with my eating and almost spend no thought on vomiting or nausea. Up to our last day. I kinda felt a little weird and focused on that feeling (it was basically just gas and nothing serious). As it had to happened on that day we saw a boy vomiting next to a bin in brought daylight. I had a serious laugh about that. I felt like the universe was communicating with me. Like offering me a way back to my old self. Something like a test. The feeling passed eventually later that day. Since my now girlfriend is a very restless person and constantly making plans we actually did do a lot of things. Going onto concerts, eating out and similar stuff. My experience of life increased drastically in the sense that I was experience more. In a lot of cases I wasn't even entertained by the things that we were doing but I still enjoyed her being happy a lot and was grateful for the experience. 

  
  Eventually I was feeling so well that I decided to get off my meds. My girlfriend surely played a vital role in that. So I talked to my therapist and my doctor an we all agreed that I would slowly get off the meds. The process as such was doable. My stress increased during that time for multiple reasons, but I definitely realized that I started to feel worse (even though I didn't want to admit it during that time). I pulled through it and was eventually drug free. Things didn't really change that much except for me having more negative thoughts again.   I had previously described this to my therapist as non-problematic, as I felt I was on like 130%-happiness while being on my medication and that a possible 80%-happiness off my meds would still be worth it.   My Doctor, my therapist and myself however underestimated the positive influence the medication had on me.   So it was bound to happen that during a regular night I kinda crashed with my stress-level overflowing. I had just finished my last meal for the day as I started to feel nauseous. Even though I tried for like an hour to shake the thought I wasn't able to do it and eventually started to panic. I woke my mother and explained myself, that I feared throwing up and needed help. So she comforted me like back in the days I took an anti-vomiting pill and fell asleep.     
  This reopened certain gates. Very similar to the last time that I actually vomited. I started to get worse, had a lot more of these incidents and eventually decided together with my doctor that I would start taking the medication again (a decision that my parents this time very much promoted).     
  In a turn of events my girlfriend and I realized that she also had an eating disorder. She was already in therapy because of other complex stuff but I don't want to go to much into detail about how she developed he eating-disorder. As I started to feel better again she started to feel worse. She showed very strange behaviour in many aspects of her life (as she had before, but now I recognized it), like not being able to call in sick because she felt way to responsible about things that were happening in her workplace and she feared that she'd loose the affection and recognition of her colleagues. I eventually was able to reassure that it was okay to miss work and work on her mental health. So after a serious breakdown that she had we went to her doctor and paved they way for her to visit a clinic. This was happening around the start of corona in my country. So she additionally had to miss work as a part of the government regulations and was confronted with her problems even more.   

  
  This all was stressing me massively. I wanted to help her as much as I could but this of course led to me neglecting working on my own problems. I wasn't making much progress but was on a solid level regarding my fear and facing it on a daily basis.     
  I eventually talked to my therapist about me fearing that I would never totally get over my emetophobia. She had no real answer for me on this. She believed that I would definitely get better but she wasn't able to tell me if there is a complete way out of it.     
  So I kinda took things into my own hand and started reading a lot of scientific papers on the matter of emetophobia. Besides that I tried looking into other platforms like youtube or reddit in order to find the one person that claims to have gone past this phobia.     
  What I found is very discouraging in general. The scientific papers report on improvements regarding emetophobia, but not even one of the patients claimed that they are cured and the phobia is gone.   

  
  This is something that makes me extremely sad. I know that my life can improve and that even with emetophobia I can have good life, but I want to live the best possible life that I could live. And even with all these improvements I know that I can always crash again, like I have so many times. I am just exhausted. 

  
  I eventually found something called 'The Thrive Programme'. Which is basically an instruction of how to get rid of emetophobia. There is a huge amount of sponsored videos from persons who claim that they made it past emetophobia using this program. I am very critical about it but still bought the book and went through it. It convinced me in some parts and others I found to be very naive. Anyway I found no external source that confirmed the success rate of this program. So I kinda stopped pursuing it once I went through the book (which the author of course claims to be the biggest mistake). 

  
  And so it happened again. The corona restrictions were reduced and I had to be present in the office again. This was once again a huge problem because I had relaxed in my state of being. I was able to eat regularly and at the times that I wanted. This is not always possible when I am in the office and just thinking of that stresses me so much that I developed physical symptoms.  These mostly included nausea but also some kind of diarrhea. Almost every morning my bowl just felt like it had to completely empty itself and I have not much control over it.     
  So these symptoms come and go depending on my level of stress and it eventually got better again. I feel like I am lacking the stamina to confront myself again with huge new things that trigger my fear, but I still do it.   

  
  Then my girlfriend confronted me again. She had criticized me for my limitations regarding this fear before. This time however it was shocking to me. She basically claimed that I am living in a cage and then I am not doing enough to get rid of the emetophobia. This has hurt me extremely and just happened recently (way after I started writing all this). She claims that she is doing all that out of love for me and she knows that it is wrong but she can't help herself.   So I have thought a lot about ending the relationship, simply because I don't feel like can be comfortable around her anymore if I had an other anxiety attack around her. Of course our fight is much more complex then this. But this is the main takeaway. 

  
  I am now at a point in my life were I want clarity about my future. But I would like to know what my possibilities are. Is it possible to ever completely get rid of this fear and view it like distant memory or do I have to accept my fate here and live through the ups and downs of this phobia. 

  
  So basically my questions are: What am I supposed to do know? I don't have anything up sleeve and feel completely vulnerable. Is there any person who has overcome this phobia? If so how?   What am I missing in my life? Were did it all go wrong? Why am I constantly rebounding in these miserable states.

1325,Suicidal need help,"I’m a 31 year old man with nothing but a string of let downs. I have no friends not family, everybody hates me for my introvert manners or inability to connect with them. Even the people who know me and understand me has left me to another country because I’m an expat working in a country. I have been battling depression for a long time now and today I have been having this idea to take my life just to get it over with. I really feel like breaking down and crying or hugging someone who can understand me. But there are no one. I came over here as a last resort. Being the coward I’m , I might not go through it but today is a day I feel strongly towards the idea of ending it once and for all. Please be kind. Thank you and love others."
1326,question for people who have been on klonopin long-term,"i've already submitted this exact post to the anxiety forum but i'll put it here too because i really want to know peoples experiences.  i've been on klonopin since 15/16, and i'm 20 now. my dr recently raised the dosage to an amount without causing ""potential addiction"" because i've obviously formed a tolerance at this point. how do you feel after years of taking it? do you also feel clumsy, slow-ish, fatigued, blurred vision, and just over-all like your brain cells are ""dying out""? it's hard to tell when it's my mental illnesses causing me issues or when it's the medication. maybe both. i've always taken klonopin as prescribed but i don't think i can live without it, nothing else helps with my anxiety like it does, but i know it's not even meant for long term use, yet here i am. how has it made you feel in the long run? what side effects do you experience? do you think you can go without it? or were you able to stop using it completely? it still helps with my anxiety which is why i still take it, and my doctors are aware that it's been too long at this point, so my dr's goal is to have my SSRI (prozac) start helping with my anxiety so i can wean off of klonopin, but just thinking about not having it available scares me since it was always there for me through the years"
1327,"there's never going to be a perfection explanation of my problems, but that's okay.","(this is just something I've realized regarding myself, but I thought I'd share for anyone who may be in a similar situation)

since my mental health struggles began, I (and probably my family and my treatment team) have been in search for an explanation. why did I spiral downhill? what diagnosis could explain why I am the way I am? why do I do the things I do? what happened to cause this?

for years, I took those online tests that just tell you that you should see a doctor - for autism, for personality disorders, for ADHD... probably every diagnosis out there, I've read about it. I spent time reading the respective subreddits and immersed myself in those communities hoping that maybe - just maybe - I could find an answer..

I read posts from people who would say things like: *I read the symptom list for ADHD and it feels like someone was spying on me when they wrote it.* I'm really glad those people have an explanation. I can't imagine what that feels like, though. 

but that selfish, rotten part of me always wishes I had something like that - a label that fit me perfectly and described many of the struggles in my life, with a community of people who could relate to me. 

none of that changes what I'm going through, but I guess I've found a bit of peace in ceasing my chase to find that answer that doesn't exist."
1328,can't go to sleep after reading an 'inspiring' text from mom,"so it was 12am when i wished my uncle happy birthday and got ready for bed until my mom sent me a picture. curious, i opened it. of course, it was a picture of me from a few years ago when i was 12 (i'm 15 now) when i had really bad posture. my back was hunched but my stomach was like pushed forward (it's hard to explain but trust me, it was a really really really unflattering position). i looked so bad holy shit i just want to personally apologize to everyone i met back then because of how awful i looked. to top it all off, my mom captioned the picture with ""oh wow look at the way you stand"" as if i hadn't realized how horrible my posture was. it still is but i'm working on it. i honestly didn't know how to feel anymore but before i knew it, i bawled my fucking eyes out. like i know she meant for the photo to be inspiring to me, so that i would finally be able to have a proper posture or something but it just reminded me of a really dark time in my life. they never thought about *what* made me have that bad of a posture, to have the shittiest confidence ever or to suddenly be so quiet (everyone always said that i was a really loud kid but around 4th grade, i just became so quiet). it was my fucking family. they would just tear my confidence apart. ""are you sure you want to eat that?"", ""you know, you would be a lot prettier if you lost just a liiiittleee bit of weight."". my family is chinese so they believed in the chinese zodiac and there were quite a lot of monkeys in my family and my aunt made this story about this hierarchy of the monkeys in my family and i was at the bottom of the hierarchy, she said i was 'scraping the other monkey's waste'. she would repeat that story at family dinners, family parties, car rides, and fucking chinese new year. i was fucking nine. i know you're not supposed to take what someone said into your heart or whatever but i was nine and my aunt (who i was taught to trust) said that. 

i've tried working on my posture but everytime i tried standing up straight, it just didn't feel right. it felt like im not worthy of standing up straight because i feel like am worthless. i've even had problems with my voice. like i would speak so softly nobody could hear me because i didn't think people actually cared about my opinion like i didn't feel worthy of voicing my opinion to other people. i have to admit i have definitely made some progress over the past few years but i still don't feel worthy of standing up straight and i still think that people wouldn't care about my opinion. i have been very lucky to meet my friends and they've helped me through numerous occasions, they made me realize that oh, people actually do care about me. but i realized that i still have a lot to work on and that only i can change my horrible view of myself (if that makes sense). anyway i just wanted to like share this with someone because i have never talked about this before and it definitely helped so yeah. any advice would be appreciated and sorry if my english is weird because its not my first language. .

also a quick question, what would you think if you saw like a ridiculous looking 12 year old girl with really bad posture and no self confidence? just be brutally honest please i want to know what people thought of me back then, good or bad. 

good night and thank you for reading this :)"
1329,How to just...let go and be happy with who I am?,"I've realized that I'm horribly anxious because I keep treating myself like I'm broken and need fixing, like I'm constantly coming up with rules or miracle cures for myself that are really just detrimental. Essentially, obsessing over any little issue or anxiety I may have is what's making me anxious in the first place. I walk around acting like everything I do determines my worth. How do I let go of all that crap and learn to accept me for who I am right now?"

1331,"hello, what advice can you give me?","Hello, I am a random person, and for the past 3 months I haven't been able to leave my bed for anything besides occasional work, meals, and bathroom. I've slowly lost my appetite and normally only eat about half a sandwich to one meal every day. i want to find the motivation to leave my bed, i want to be inspired by something to make me want to go out into the world and face it on my own, but sadly i cannot find anything, having an opposite effect to where i just want to leave society and live as a wandering soul. It is as if nothing interests me, and therefore i cannot find any form of potential purpose in my being. I am void of emotion except discontent, without the slightest clue of what path to take in my life, and it paralyzes me. Speaking with my family is difficult as they try to force their religion on me at every chance they get, which i have no affiliation to anymore. In my life currently I have one friend who will be gone for the next several years in the military and is too entrenched in his own issues i cant bring up my own, and one ""friend"" who, imo, only keeps me around to try and make himself ""look better"", only wants to do what he wants and whenever i invite him to do something he will flake at the last moment, to the point where i've come to expect it. To cope with the emotional and mental anguish i find myself in, i've developed an unhealthy dependence to rather recreational substances, and no matter what ive tried to do i always end up going back. Its almost become a part of my personality. I feel like I am at a crossroads in my life and know what can be done, but i need the motivation to do so. What can be said to help me through this time, or to help me find motivation in life?

Thank you for reading"

1333,Having a rough day,"I didn't sleep at all last night (went to bed around 7 am and slept on and off until 1pm) and I just feel anxious and restless for some reason. I also have noticed that my appetite is gone. I don't feel hungry and I can go all day and all night without eating. That is how I lost 30+ lbs. in prison...I just didn't eat because the food was just horrid. I am so overweight now from eating so much over the past 4+ months (real food!) that I am afraid to eat. Good grief. This really fucking bites. I haven't eaten since last evening (it is now 3:00 pm here) and I dread putting anything in my body. :(

Sorry for the vent...I just feel so lost today."
1334,Dealing with sudden wave of depression,"So during this isolation I feel that my stress levels are really low. Over past weeks I started to have some flashbacks from my childhood and teenage years. It’s quite scary as I feel like I was sleepwalking through all these years. As if my brain was constantly blocking most memories. As memories are coming back I’m trying to understand what I actually was/am now. It’s not like I’m suddenly a different person, but I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. 

Some context: I’m 21 years old, gay, grew up in a really homophobic country before I moved to UK.
Last year my roommate committed suicide after which I felt really numb and depressed for about a year.
I was suicidal in high school and have social anxiety which may have contributed to this as well

I know I should take this to therapy, but I’m waiting before lockdown is over, and I thought it’s the place to just hear some opinions, how do I deal with this?"
1335,Bipolar hell,"
I don’t know how to get thru life anymore . I’m pushing everyone away that I’m close to. No one. Even this guy that was like in love with me. Even him. I can tell they don’t want to hear it anymore. Of course I’ve thought of ending my life now because at least I could go and escape these thoughts. But I think of my family especially my dad and sister and I can’t . My mom would be so sad but I think she would get thru it ok. 

I can’t stop looking at other people. How their lives are so normal . I do remember a time I liked life . However I remember and can’t forget all the terrible things I’ve done . I can’t let it go. My family and the couple friends I have left are tired of it. They miss the old fun me and so do I . They want me to stop complaining, stop making life all about me but I don’t stop . I remind myself of my elderly aunt who’s in a nursing home . She was so negative and also hide from life. I’m just doing it at a younger age then her. There was a time she was successful and so smart . Now she’s living her life in a nursing home and I haven’t had much contact with her for years and years . She was always there for me but I was never there for her . I wasn’t there for a lot of people and it haunts me. I lay awake not able to sleep and I lay and crack my jaw over and over again . I live my life strangely but there was a time I had such great opportunities and I had hope but I ruined my life with bipolar ,drugs and horrible choices. I also was a really shitty person and have gotten I cannot have a baby I’m almost 42 old as you get older people don’t care as much. I had a chance to be in groups like AA:NA I ruined that every time . By complaining and being negative I feel so scared to return. I’m scared people won’t welcome me as they did before ."

1338,I just don't really see the point anymore. Just need to vent.,"I know that I don't have a lot to complain about compared to other people. But I just don't really see the point anymore. I have absolutely no positive vision of the future. I feel that whatever I will do, it will always be a struggle, a fight, a battle with myself to do things, to work or to try and enjoy things. And frankly speaking...I'm just tired of it.   
On top of my regular insecurities, anxieties and issues...I recently broke up with a wonderful person and I regret it, I blame myself for it, and it's been like that every relationship before as well. I just feel that whatever I do, it doesn't matter, because I will end up hurt, alone, and sad and numb.   
Just the thought of her doing something with other men pushes me closer to the edge....and I caught myself building up the courage to actually do it. I don't want to die...but I don't want to keep on living either. 

I just wish she would send me a message, that she is with me and that she will support me...but I know she won't. I know she will move on and be happy with her life, find another guy and that's it. 

I just really don't see the point in life anymore. I just want to finally relax and not be in pain every day. I fucking hate this shit. Life is a fucking pain in the ass."

How did you seek help for the first time?"

I used to live alone at home there and it was quite better than living with my family.. it's been almost a month and I just wanna run away from everything.. my family,friends and my work. 
Lately I just find everyone annoying around me. Last week I wanted to end my life because I am just done with everything. I dont like my family anymore. They don't treat me like I am member of the family. 
I was supposed to complete my internship and work somewhere but now I am locked inside my house with all my family members and my room has been taken away from me.

I had already attended some beauty school in the past but had to drop out due to my declining mental health &amp; being harassed at school. I was on my way recently to reenroll and discovered that they now background check in PA for the state board test to receive your license. Going back to 4 years ago when I was 19, 2 of my friends at the time and I were jumped by a large group of people. The cops came to my house next day to tell me I would be having a court summons sent to my house and I tried to explain the situation but since they said that they only saw me the day after and night the night of that they were taking the opposing parties side and then discovered one of their household members was calling the cops behind the scenes as the fight was happening. That led me to go to court and I couldn’t afford a lawyer at the time because I was only making 8.75$ an hour. They MADE me plead guilty to simple assault and harassment charges as well as disorderly conduct and told me I couldn’t even defend myself even though this was my first ever offense. They made me pay a 500$ fine in full. So now I discovered the state board can and most likely will turn me away from my license. So I have to withdraw from school. I am destroyed .. it’s already impossible to find a full time job as is. Everyone views me as a criminal/monster even though I am nothing like that. I do suffer from mental illness such as PTSD, BPD, OCD, ADHD, depression, anxiety. I do have a part time job but with very limited hours , I’m currently still laid off from it due to the virus. I just feel like what’s the point of existing if you can’t even do what makes you happy? When you can’t even grow and learn to be on your own? I feel so empty and sad. I’ve been crying for days and I haven’t been able to eat. I just want people to see me for me and give me a chance because I have so much empathy for others yet nobody has any for me let alone understanding."
1350,I feel like the abuse was my fault,I think the reason he started touching my privates was because he saw that I had an erection while we were okay wrestling in the water. I wasn’t attracted to him so I don’t know why I had an erection but I did and I think he saw it and thought I would like it. When I told him to stop he asked if I was sure and I said yes and then he touched me once more then stopped. But I was 12 and he restrained me while he did it so I don’t know. And he was so nice the entire time both before and after like nothing had happened. It’s all so confusing.

1353,Im scared and I need help I don’t know what’s going on,"Hi guys I dont know if posts like these are allowed and I do apologize in advance if they’re aren’t. 

I’m scared, I feel like I’m out of my mind. I feel like I’m not me. I’m hurting everyone around me especially the ones I love the most and I try not too but I still do. I say things that I don’t mean out of spite and it ends up hurting them. I lie all the time and I can’t control it. I blow things out of proportion all the time. I’m in a relationship and I know this is immature but I always breakup with my partner when we get in fights. I do love her a lot and she means the world to me and I don’t actually want too and honestly I don’t know why I “break up” with her.. I don’t want too but I always catch myself afterwards and I feel bad and regret the decision immediately. It’s not fair and I need to help myself. I don’t know what I can do to improve I feel hopeless... please if anyone has any suggestions let me know. I know a therapist is one but money is tight right now and I won’t be able to get into one right away where there is normally a waitlist for one."
1354,I've been stuck in bed crying for hours and am worrying about my mental health.,"Today wasn't a good day, for no particular reason. I didn't do anything special, woke up and ate breakfast, played a game. I even got motivated to make a workout plan, so I did and exercised + showered. No friends had messaged me yet and my partner was busy, so I decided to watch anime. At this point my mood switched and I was not happy or relaxed. My mother asked for my help outside, to which I asked if she ""had to do it today?"". I didn't want to directly refuse, but before I could explain that I wasn't feeling good she made me feel very guilty about my reply. I hadn't told her no, but she gave me no time to elaborate on it. This made me extra sad, and because of this I've been in my bed for nearly 4 hours crying.

This isn't the first time I've gotten extremely emotional over something stupid like this, but it's starting to get to me. Last time I had this long of a cry, I felt invalid and fake (which I still do).
I saw a psychiatrist for nearly a year after I had a number of panic attacks in public, but didn't get diagnosed with anything specific. ""You have more 'problems' than the average person but it doesn't affect you enough to set a diagnosis"". Since my visits ended I've been thinking a lot and I'm not sure if I'm faking things or not. What if I'm just lying to myself that I have problems but I'm perfectly fine? It seems to be possible. Even making this post seems like a cry for attention. I am thinking that making this means I'm only making up things. I sucked up courage to tell someone some weeks ago about self doubt and invalidating myself, and was told those were signs of depression, but I can't have that... my psychiatrist said I didn't.

There are a million things I could say, but I don't think a long post is going to do anything. It's probably the wrong subreddit too, please correct me if it is. I have not told anyone of my worries today as I don't want to create fake pity. Please excuse me."
1355,Im really not sorry anymore. i dont know how to feel about that.,"im losing my mind. i have a feeling i have really explosive cptsd and i dont know why my therapist hasnt called me this week. i dont feel sorry for lashing out anymore. i cant control myself. i completely lose control of myself a lot of the time. any harsh, blunt critism makes me feel like i black out and i just want to scream and kick and cry so whoever made me upset will leave. anyone yelling at me ill yel back or start crying. even a small raise of voice will make me freeze. but its happening for so long and the only solution people have is leaving me alone. but i want someone to just ask me if im okay. not whats wrong with me. but if im okay.so much is wrong with me yet they still get mad when i respond with “everything” when they ask “whats wrong with you?” saying im such an asshole. a selfish prick.

i dont feel genuinely sorry anymore. im so tired of feeling so confused to who i really am. if i am a selfish prick. i dont know how to empathize anymore. i dont know how to get them to understand. im so tired. i cant handle crying everyday. i cant handle the headache and the tightening feeling in my chest that happens so often. the out of body experience i feel when something just flips that switch to make me be someone else. 

im tired of apologizing. i feel bad. but saying sorry leaves a sour taste in my mouth now."
1356,Post-concussion... Feeling pretty depressed.,"A month ago I had a bike accident (I had six stitches in my face) and I tried to return to work sooner than anticipated (I'm a teacher working from home regularly).

The entire accident and aftermath has been horrible. My only parent passed last year, so the accident brought up a lot of the grief. I'm also upset about the scarring (27F). I am single and because of the pandemic, people are still social distancing too. Feeling pretty alone.

It's been isolating. I was up north with my brother and his family for the first few days after my accident, but I returned to my city as all of my appointments were here. I've had a few friends stop by... and thankfully I have a cat for company, but I'm still bummed.

I feel ugly because of the scarring. It's above my lip and on my chin. I've never had a head injury before either, so lately I noticed ringing in my ears and a really bad headache. I tried to resume my normal lifestyle as much as possible after the accident.

I'm going to see my doctor in office next Tuesday, hopefully for a proper assessment. I've had appointments for various things, but I haven't had a proper neurological exam since the accident. My chiropractor did a small neuro exam and my eyes were unable to focus or follow properly - yikes. I've also cried hysterically (a combination of pain/headache/frustration).

So I'm left feeling isolated, bored, lonely. I had to give up my July job (summer school) and my doctor said no exercise, avoid sunlight.. etc. for now. So I've been sitting in my basement with the blinds closed. It feels hopeless with no resolution in sight.

Any advice for a sad girl with a concussion?"
1357,Are these normal things for a kid?,"So when I look back to when I was younger I remember being a weird kid. Not too sure if these mean anything but I just feel like venting about it. Here’s what I experienced. This might be triggering/ nsfw.

I have a really good imagination, but sometimes I would scare myself with it. For example, between the ages of 6-8 I would sometimes see shadow figures right before I went to bed.I also remember watching doctor who and being terrified by one of the aliens. Later that week I saw one outside of my window, it stared at me and then it ducked, it scared me so much that i can recall it so clearly. I would also mistake hanging clothes as people or faces.
When I went to the toilet as a kid I would have to push the cupboards door shut because I felt like something was watching from it (i still deal with the feeling of being watched, especially from hidden cameras, from time to time)
I was very shy and lacked confidence. I have so many cringe memories from awkward situations that I put myself in as a kid.
I found it hard to concentrate in school, no teachers noticed as I was the quiet kid and it wasn’t like I was disturbing the class. I would always day dream.
When I was younger I self diagnosed myself with Parkinson’s disease for like 2 days, I never told anyone though. I’ve done this before with other health issues but none of them were that extreme.
I feel like I had a big ego as well as having very low self esteem as a kid. Like I thought I was special, like Jesus or something, even though I wasn’t that religious. At one point in time I remember trying to train my brain to do telekinesis. I was also a depressed kid, I had very little interests, and I still feel depressed now.
Sometimes I feel like people are watching and judging my actions.
I used to hide in the corner of my room when getting changed in case something was watching from a different corner of my room. Like a ghost or something.
I don’t put much effort into my relationships with my friends.
I also used to lie a lot, but I guess most kids do that anyways.
I’ve always found it hard to trust people and I can’t open up to people
I had suicidal thoughts, tried to starve myself, and did self harm as a preteen.
I think one main reason to why I’m venting about this is because I’ve never felt right. I’ve never felt like I could properly relate to anyone. Because of this I always felt lonely as a kid and still do now.

I don’t like thinking about a lot of my childhood memories but finally typing them out does seem feel Im finally letting my thoughts go, which is relieving."
1358,resources for mental health treatment during covid?,"i’ve been feeling seriously suicidal recently, which is somewhat unusual for me, and i’m not sure what my options are as far as emotional care. my university provides therapy for students but i cannot receive counseling due to covid. my insurance also doesn’t cover any local mental health professionals so i feel like i’m stuck. i really can’t afford to pay out of pocket but i am really worried about myself. any help or advice is extremely welcome, thank you"
1359,Went on a walk today - helped more then I could of previously imagined!,"I've only posted once on reddit so I don't know if I'm typing anything out right (or there's a specific way to type at all) but I just wanted to share today!

I've had a rough evening today (which I'm not going to get into right now as I want to keep my good mood) and my thoughts after what happened just seemed really loud as they seem to be lately. I'm not really one for walks or going outside - especially during this time. But I thought I might as well as it's the evening and there wouldn't be many people around.

Initially I just wanted to get out of the house and get lost in self pity and sad thoughts but as I left I thought I might as well get something good out of my rare moment outside. And it went so well!

My mind was clearer then I have ever remembered at this point. And I was noticing things about my neighborhood that I never had before, despite living here all my life. Subtle things like the different shades of green in the bushes, the way the flowers somewhat matched the colour of the sky, or how the two trees outside my house faintly resembled a heart (they didn't really I just like to think so!)

For about 20 minutes or so I just sat on a swing in the park, swinging back and forth, going around in small circles, and just sitting there listening to my music and the various nature sound that got through my headphones. The dull lighting that you get just before a sunset was so relaxing and, despite having a sad smile on my face the sad thoughts didn't accompany it.

It most probably doesn't mean much to a lot of people but it really helped me today. I feel like it's common knowledge that walks are supposed to help your mental health but I didn't know how much it really did until I felt it myself.

The only regret I have is leaving without telling my mother as she was still upset about earlier that evening. But after reassuring her I was fine and wasn't going to do anything reckless it was really enjoyable.

I'm sorry for droning on about this but it really did make me feel so much better - as I've said many times at this point.

I hope anyone who read to this is doing well. To those who aren't doing too well, I hope you have a great day and know you can get through the rough patch you're currently in, no matter how big or small. And those doing well, I hope you get even better then you currently are! :)"
1360,New medicine,"I was prescribed lamotrigene the other day. I've been on antidepressants most of my adult learning life. This is the first time I've been prescribed a mood stabilizer. Are these traditionally prescribed for depression, or are they more used for bipolar?

I only had a telephone conversation with the psychiatrist, but he was asking a lot of questions about bipolar, mania, impulsivity, and suchlike. I'd just prefer to know if he's diagnosed me with that, rather than just written it in his notes. To be honest, he wasn't very helpful, and I feel like he's just throwing more pills at me."
1361,I'm almost certain I have the capacity to become a serial killer.,Talk me out of it
1362,Desperate for help with shame and guilt,"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but as the title says I am desperate. If it’s relevant, I have diagnosed bipolar II and anxiety. 

I’m 25 now and a girl, but when I was 21 I went on the site Omegle which I frequently visited to talk to people, especially when I was feeling crappy. I met a guy on there who was 17 and also feeling crappy. I should mention I live in Canada and he lived in America.  His life experiences made me very sad and I offered him time to vent and gave whatever advice/encouragement I could think of. He asked to add me on Facebook in case he ever needed to talk. He messaged me often and it became clear he had a crush on me and would send flirtatious messages. Especially in the beginning, I would brush it off or ignore it and say something else. He would get offended/upset at times so eventually I started reciprocating. I now feel sick about this. For reference, the age of consent where I live is 16, and it’s gross I even feel like I have to mention that. He never sent me any inappropriate photos or videos, nor did he say anything particularly explicit, but some suggestive things were said and I’d sometimes just go along with it because he was so self hating and I didn’t want to contribute to it. I eventually just got too comfortable with the flirtations because we became quite good friends and I’d react/initiate the same way I did with my other friends who flirted with me, and I shouldn’t have. I felt pressured to be a good person and be there for him but I should’ve drawn the line. I guess I thought because he lived far away and was over the consent age it wasn’t an issue, I never even thought about it that way because I’m stupid. I referred to us as friends often, and I know he agreed but I also know he still liked me more than that. 

He was obviously aware we weren’t dating and we both dated other people during the 2 year period we were friends, but he would get upset especially in the beginning if he found out I went on a date or something like that. Eventually, our lives just got very busy/different and we stopped talking much. I barely ever thought of him until about 5 days ago and I didn’t really remember the content of the messages until I went back to read them and now I hate myself. I feel gross and creepy. I’m disgusted at my past self for talking like that to someone who’s under 18. I can tell from reading how I spoke that my maturity has developed a lot, but still. I have never done anything else like that nor would I do it at this age (although I shouldn’t have at that age). I suffer from anxiety and have been feeling ill for the past 6 days over this. My anxiety also has me paranoid about being charged. I recently reached out to him (he’s now 21 himself) to ask if he’d delete the messages because I feel so ashamed of them existing in the world, and he said that made him sad but he would delete them. Now I’m paranoid that maybe he didn’t. My friends tell me I‘m over-reacting about all this but I truly don’t feel like it. 

One of my big concerns right now is that everything I read online tells me people in their 20s who talk to or flirt with 17 year olds are creepy and gross and honestly I agree but I did it myself and I’m so ashamed and anxious about this. I keep reading about celebrities being outed for assaulting 17 year olds or for grooming and I get triggered reading it because I associate myself with that and I feel like such a bad person, but I have no right to be triggered by something like that when it never happened to me, it feels wrong and just makes me feel more like a bad person. I feel like I committed a heinous immoral crime. I obviously agree that grooming and being predatory are bad, but I feel like I have no right to think that even though I know (and my therapist has reassured me) that it isn’t at all what I’ve done. To add to this, I can barely watch anything. If I watch a YouTube video or a show and they condemn someone for doing something wrong or bad (even something small) I feel like it’s attacking me. I’ve never felt this way before. How can I move on?"

1365,yikes,"I mean I'm gonna say this but I don't wanna have people replying saying ""hh nooo it'll get better life will get better don't be sad"" and I also don' t want people to tell me to not say about stuff cuz it makes them depressed too because that doesn't help either, but I kinda just feel like killing myself rn. Ik it would be selfish and I don't want the people around me to hurt but I don't feel like I'm cared about by the ppl I care about and I try to ignore these feelings and just get on with stuff but its not working I just don't care anymore. I just want someone who actually knows me and stuff to talk to me and help me feel better but they can't deal with it. idk"
1366,"Scared to go to a doctor, but something might be wrong?","So hi, I’m not really sure if this is the right place to post this, but google isn’t really helping me find answers of what might be causing this so here I am. 

Over the past few months I’ve been having increasing incidences of seeing things out of the corner of my eye move, but when I look there’s nothing that could have moved. I often sit alone in my room reading or listening to music and have no pets. Often times it is coupled with the sensation of something crawling on my toes, leg, arm, or face. 

At first I chalked it up to bugs cause I live somewhat in the south of the US so it’s kind of common place to see a roach every now and then, but I’ve never actually seen any bugs in my room. Closest I have is, like I said, seen something move out of the corner of my eye. 

I suffer from mild depression which I go to therapy for, but could this be a warning sign of something mentally or physically wrong with me? I’ve very healthy otherwise; I am 22, I eat well, live cleanly, work out regularly, have 20/20 vision, and work hard to take care of myself. 

The only adverse things I can think of are that I have trouble sleeping (I usually get 6-8 hours every 24 hours, but I don’t really have a schedule, it’s just whenever I can manage to fall asleep), and I drink quite frequently. I rarely drink to the point of getting a hangover the day after or blacking out, but it does help me sleep. 

If you know any other subs I could find answers in that would be great. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Hopefully I can find some answers. I just worry I might lose my job even though it’s not critical that I’m 100% a-okay."
1367,"Worried about my issues with my identity , if there's more to it or not.","After a while of questioning this I've decided to join Reddit in hope that maybe I can find an answer from someone with similar experiences to my own.

To start this off, I'm a fourteen year old with a history of mental health issues. Since I was about 10 years old or so, I've developed things like depression and a severe case of anxiety, along with an autism diagnosis which I believe could be a bit of a factor to these things. After a suicide attempt and multiple appointments with my GP, I've been prescribed a high dosage of antidepressants which I believe has finally given me more stability with my moods, and since then I've been experiencing more positivity than I used to.

But now that I'm getting treatment for that, I think that there's more to it than just my depression. For years I've had a very unstable and shifting self-image; my personality seems to be sort of all over the place as if it's fragmented and I often lose my sense of being. Looking at my reflection in the mirror becomes scary, I see the person in front of me and think 'is that me?' because what I'm seeing feels wrong, out of place. My mind doesn't seem to register that it's really me I'm looking at. And it's not just in the mirror. I usually feel disconnected from my own actions as if I'm watching it all play out but I'm not there *mentally*. It's like some kind of mental fog and my brain feels hazy. 

When I find a character I like from a certain source, such as a movie or series I'm interested in, I tend to grow unhealthily attached to them and my identity kinda morphs into theirs, as if I've become just like them. Sometimes I experience gender dysphoria or dissatisfaction with things related to myself, like my name, because it feels wrong, as if it's not actually me. And when this happens seeing my own body and face makes me feel disoriented, confused. I'm always changing my gender identity, my chosen name, my behaviour, and my appearance because of it. And I'm sick of whatever it is. It confuses everyone around me and I break down because of the fact that I really don't know who I am anymore, and how I've lost some of my closest friends since it's started.

I'm not sure if it's normal, if it's just a sign of my depression or another problem which hasn't yet been addressed with my doctors. An armchair diagnosis isn't what I aim to get here, but to anyone who does see this post -- I'd really appreciate your thoughts. And I'm hoping that maybe someone can relate and share what they think about it. Thanks :)"
1368,Help my anxiety is to much,"Hi my name's Tyler iv been dealing with anxiety and depression for years but I'm getting my breaking point.Iv been having thoughts that are very disturbing  and vile constantly.I also think I mite be hearing voices,does any was have this?"
1369,Obsessional jealousy? Anxiety or something more insidious? !,"Hi Guys,

For some background information: I have been diagnosed with GAD and OCD. I currently see a therapist once a week and a psychiatrist around once a month. I had a really bad case of schizOCD a few months ago where I would monitor my thoughts and try to look out for paranoia, hallucinations, etc. During this time, I would get thoughts that my significant other was cheating, even though I know that it's not based in reality. For example, if I would read a post online from someone and it mentioned their boyfriend, a thought would pop into my head like, ""what if this person is talking about my partner?"" If I would watch porn and the male didn't show his face, I would think, ""what if this is my boyfriend?"" I understand these are incredibly irrational thoughts. But I then became distressed that this signaled I was in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. My doctor upped my SSRI dosage and monitoring my thoughts have subsided. 

However, yesterday and today, I have gotten jealous thoughts about my significant other. I know they're insane, but they are causing me distress that I am going into psychosis or that I have something like a personality disorder. My partner and I live with my parents and my mom is very attractive. My mom was laughing with my partner, and I got this twinge of jealousy. WHICH IS SO WEIRD! I completely trust my mom and my partner 100%, but I still got jealous! I get these dumb, ""what if mom is flirting with him,"" even though that thought is SUPER crazy. Today, my partner went into work and didn't wear his scrubs in (which he usually does). I began to think, ""what if he's going to another girl's house?"" or ""what if he's going on a date?"" I feel like I overthink everything and I joke with him that he's cheating on me instead of in at work but it's more my way of asking for reassurance.

My question is does anyone else suffer from this? Can this jealousy be rooted in insecurity and anxiety, or do people think it's something more serious? I have a psychiatrist appointment in July and I will be telling him these symptoms, should I try to reach out to him sooner than that? Do people think this is an emergency symptom?"
1370,THE ANXIETY PARADOX (AND WHY YOU CAN'T RECOVER),"If you suffer from any kind of anxiety, you're probably all too familiar with the ""fear of the fear"". You know how anxiety is the worst feeling in the world. It's very hard to put into words how helpless it makes you feel whenever you're in the middle of a panic attack, worried it might never end. I suffered from anxiety for more than 2 and a half years myself.

Exactly *because* it feels so fucking horrific, it shouldn't come as a surprise that for nearly all sufferers, *eliminating their anxiety* is their biggest wish. It definitely was for me. It is, however, this fixation on eliminating anxiety, that paradoxically keeps reinforcing your anxiety. It's like a feedback loop from hell.

I'm not a scientist, but I've definitely done my fair share of research. Anxiety is regulated in the amygdala. It's supposed to protect you from enemies, animals, dangerous situations, etc. Your amygdala, however, doesn't really function based on rational or logic. It functions based on actions, reactions and behavioral feedback. If a certain event causes you a great deal of stress or pain, your amygdala ""learns"" that that is a danger. It will then try to prevent you from said danger by sending you signals (feelings of anxiety) whenever your amygdala recognizes a potential trigger.

So how does this correspond to my claim that the recovery of anxiety is a paradox? Well, let me try to explain: Panic attacks and very strong feelings of anxiety can be absolutely debilitating. You reacted to this by fighting these feelings, trying to avoid triggers, etc etc etc. This has TAUGHT your amygdala that the feeling of anxiety in itself is something dangerous that needs to be avoided! This is a terrible thing because it makes us scared of the anxiety itself. It can turn a slight feeling of anxiety into a full-blown panic attack! Your amygdala will recognize a potential trigger, for example, a bodily sensation that you feel during anxiety or panic, and it will send you more signals to try to warn you of the anxiety! (*Oh no, I'm feeling anxious! I can feel my heart beating fast again! I can feel my stomach feeling weird.. Oh no, I'm going to have a panic attack again! I'm back to square one! All my progress has gone down the drain!)*

This can make recovery from anxiety nearly impossible. Fixating on getting rid of the anxiety is a behavior that reinforces the belief of your amygdala that anxiety is bad. It will also keep your amygdala firing signals any time you might feel a little anxious. Recovery from anxiety is **not** possible as long as we are ***anxious*** *of anxiety.*

So, how do we turn this around? Its quite easy actually. Its called doing nothing. Like I said before, the amygdala functions based on actions, reactions and **behavioral feedback.** This works the other way around too. We can literally *unlearn* our brain to respond to specific triggers, and even make it less sensitive in general. We do this by practicing acceptance. Acceptence is, in my opinion, the only true cure to anxiety. What I mean by acceptance is not fighting the anxiety. Not fighting the feelings. Not trying to get rid of whatever you're feeling in the moment, not trying to avoid, not trying to escape, not trying to distract yourself. Instead, accept. Sit with it. Float through it. Not reacting to signals from your amygdala is a beautiful thing. It teaches your brain that there is no danger! We need to teach our brain not to fear the feeling of anxiety, for that is a completely natural feeling! We need anxiety! Okay, you're right, we don't need it as much as you are feeling it right now! But still, the feeling of anxiety is not something we need to fear in itself.

This is not something that will fix you in an hour or a day. But keep practicing it. Keep sitting with the feelings of anxiety, and you will feel them subside. Don't try to convince yourself you will be okay, for that is ALSO a reaction to amygdala, and like I said before, feedback and reactions will only reestablish that it is a genuine danger, and that your brain is right in sending you these signals! Float through the anxiety. Instead of seeing those moments of anxiety and panic as obstacles, start to see them as opportunities to train yourself! Try to place your worst enemy in a positive perspective, and you will see how fast your perception changes. Everytime you get a panic attack, that’s an opportunity to teach your brain to be less anxious! Those moments of pain are the only moments where true change happens. It is definitely one of the hardest things you can do. Sadly, the only way past anxiety is to go right THROUGH it. You need to completely submerge yourself in it, and, the hardest part, not fight it. You need to look for the anxiety, even invite it from time to time. Make it your friend.

The good news is, that going through this will eventually give you a mental toughness that very few people will ever have. You will be so much stronger than anyone else you know. It just takes a lot of courage to start the progress, but I’m sure you can do it .

I hope I explained it properly, but English is not my first language so yea. If you have any questions or if you feel like you want me to expand on something please just ask! :)"
1371,Not sure what to do anymore,"I want to die. The thought and plan have been constantly in my head since I was 15 (now 25).

I’ve been in and out of mental hospitals, on just about every major anti depressants and a hand full of anti anxiety meds, I’ve seen Doctors and therapists but can’t ever seem to get my depression and anxiety under control. I can’t bring myself to actually go through with my plan due to I know how many people it will impact and how much sadness it will bring. I’m just tired of living this way. Any help?"
1372,My mom is severely affecting my metal health.,"First off I'm only 13. My mom always treats me like an animal and she yells at me for simple things. She always says I'm going to be a beggar on the side of the street asking for change, or that I am a useless piece of trash and that I have no brain. She has been saying these and many more things to me for years and I just can't take it anymore. My dad on the other hand does not say anything, but the problem is that he's not helping. He is just kinda sitting there watching my mom yells and hits me. I don't know what to do. the only thing that kept me sane were my friends. but recently my parents won't let me contact them. The worst part is the this happens when I do little things that don't matter. just today I forgot to add salt to something and my mom started saying I'm going to be a drug addict on the side of the street. It feels like my parents have let go of me and my life. I don't know what to do at this point as I'm very depressed now and stuck at home so I can't even go anywhere just to get away from them. Does anyone know what I should do?"

1374,"Why do I have such a hard time showing empathy, expressing my feelings or showing affection for people","I’ve always had a hard time showing empathy or being there for people when they are upset,hurting or etc I just avoid the situation bc I don’t know what to do or say. 

Some examples are one of my best friends dad died and I saw him in person at the gym and just avoided him bc I didn’t know what to say to him. In my head I felt bad for him but I just could not communicate it to him in any way so i avoided it.

Another example is my mom deals with really bad depression and sometimes I can tell how bad she is doing and I feel bad for her but I just cannot communicate my feelings to her so I usually just will go upstairs and think about and think how horrible of a person I am. 

My gf says I do this all the time with her as well and says I don’t show her empathy or that I care. Why do I avoid things like this? I just feel like I cannot properly communicate my feelings ever. I have social anxiety and as a result do not have really close relationships except a friend or two and my gf. I have a really hard time talking to someone I do not know well also if that helps. How can I change this behavior or what helps for people who are similar?"
1375,Kleptomania/Hoarder? Please Help My Grandpa,"If anyone educated in psychological disorders can please help me I'd be so grateful.  


My grandfather (85 as of a month ago, married happily) has been hoarding things for the past twelve years.  
In storage units, their bedroom (It was completely unusable until emptied/cleaned three times), even leaving things at other peoples' places like leafblowers, lawnmowers, gas cans, stereo equipment you name it.  


90% of this stuff is complete junk that doesn't work, can not be fixed or it isn't worth it.   
He's always been sly trying to get things for free without ""actually stealing"".  


But today broke the last straw.   


He came into my work yesterday, took a tag off of something (Stereo cabinet + equipment) and rewrote it as Paid. I realized it today when rearranging things in the pickup room.  


When I confronted him (Politely, I always try to defend him and reason with him to understand if he did in fact do something wrong) he flat out lied, denied it, got angry when caught in several lies during the conversation, and made things up on the spot.  


I have 1000% proof that he did completely steal these items.  
To sum it up; We use a certain method (same color inks, stamps, etc) to determine if something is in fact paid for. He made up the person on that day at the counter, saying it was an old woman. She was in fact a 50 year old blonde with not a gray hair. He said it was 10$ USD. It was 65. My coworker wrote the ticket and set the price just the previous day. He denied writing the ticket but it had no price, was in blue ink (we use red) and the half we give the customers was written 'Paid Off' in the same writing and blue ink, but we only use stamps on that half to prevent theft in situations like this.  


I love my grandpa and he is generally a swell guy, but this is getting absolutely out of control.  
Does anyone out there have any clue what could be going on with him?"

1377,How useful is counselling for symptoms?,"Bit of background: I consider myself to definitely have something wrong with my mental health, and have for years. I more specifically would guess I have depression and probably anxiety too (and I mean all/ most of the symptoms for the past four years). I tried to get help when I was 14 (5 years ago) but my parent nor the GP provided much help and sort of pushed me away from attempting to get help any further. Also experienced some disordered eating too etc, point is theres definitely something up.

Anyway, struggled quite severely for a long time, and had a big life change or two late last year which helped quite a lot. However I still struggle with depression and anxiety symptoms but luckily am in a place where I acknowledge that for the sake of myself and those around me I need to try and do something about it. I’m considering getting some free counselling  sessions because I don’t think I’m a severe enough case to warrant a proper mental health intervention (I was in the past but no one noticed enough to intervene and I didn’t want help). 
I don’t entirely understand the benefit of counselling sessions. I have nothing specific to talk about and I know what I’m thinking is irrational and untrue but it still happens and I can’t control it, same with lack of motivation and self-esteem. I feel like a counselling session would be no better than what I do in my head to try and stop it. What is it like? Has it helped you, or should I seek another form of help or none at all?

(I’m in the UK)

TL;DR: I have struggled with my MH for years without help, now I’m a bit better I want to seek help but counselling doesn’t seem much like it can help with the symptoms I experience beyond what I already do (which doesn’t work). What is it like, is another form of help better?"
1378,Is it normal to want to self harm?,over the past weak or so ive felt a huge urge to start cutting my legs ive recently just been feeling worse and more alone to the point where i cant play video games anymore (what i use to use to distract myself) and i just genuinely want some kind of break from the mental pain. In the past when i was in class or something like that I would scrach my self to the point of skin tearing but now that dosnt work the same so ive thought about going to cutting i know its not a good idea but i need some kinda break from the mental pain

1380,Falling asleep when people are angry at me,"Strange story and it is not really a mental 'issue', but I was wondering about something. When somebody jells or shouts in an angry fashion at me, I become very sleepy. I could fall asleep immediatly. I am a very calm person and I almost never cause or join in a fight (it is kind of one way aggression), but I am surprised that I feel sleepy when attacked verbaly (or even physically).

I do not have other sleeping issues and this only occurs when somebody behaves negative towards me; can someone explain what this is and what I should do to avoid it? People do not really believe me when I say I become extremely tired during a fight and they think it is a lie in order to end the fight. It sometimes makes them even more angry, especially if they are looking for a reaction."

1382,Am I toxic?,"I loved this girl. I really did. But she brought out a part of me I thought was gone. We broke up because i felt i was being taken advantage of. I did a lot for her in the relationship naturally but once she got her own car things changed: she stopped coming around and talking to me as much. We broke up recently after a long period of time spent arguing. I should have given her space but at this point we have done this before and came back no problem. I never left her alone. She ended up going to hang up with the guy who i basically saved her from. I had every good intention with this girl. I wanted to make changes in my life and relationships were one of them. I got really clingy after she left and again i couldnt just give it up. She then had someone make a post blasting me saying how toxic i am. I really felt like i was good to her. I really did. I hate myself for not being able to let things go. I overthink too much and i really thought we had the type of relationship where we would both be able to sort it out and be respectful but i felt a little dirty when she became friends with him. What can i do for myself? How do i learn to just get over it? I have so much trauma with past relationships this one was supposed to be different. Im a great guy until i feel manipulated and then i do things that can be considered as toxic. We aired each others dirty laundry and hurt eachother really bad, except she has friends that are backing her up. Can anyone give me any advice?"
1383,i'm losing my sanity.,"nothing feels real anymore, i keep getting these urges to do not very nice things to people, i want to harm i want to kill. i have this plan, i keep seeing things, the voices are so drowning everything is getting to much and not a single person nor professional understands. 

I thought i was getting better but no everything changed i'm scared for the safety of the people around me and myself. I've came so close to ending the people around me, I'm not leaving this world without taking tenfold people with me.

I want to do it but i don't want to do it. I don't want help but i do. Every time i reach out i get slammed into a mental ward. I'm losing grip. I don't want the dark feelings to take over but they are."
1384,Afraid of deteriorating,"I (M22) struggled with multiple mental health issues since I was a child, and it is a semi-miracle that I am able to function at such a high level in my life. The thing that terrifies me is that the miracle won't last forever. One day my mind will deteriorate to a shallow nothing and I will not be able to live a productive life. 

I often feel selfish for getting engaged and having a relationship when this is hanging over me, and that my soon to be wife will become my caretaker.

This is on my mind constantly and has become my accepted reality. 

Has anyone else had experience with these kinds of thoughts, how have you made it through? Should I just deny the possibility of waking up and not being able to function one day?"
1385,Timeline towards mental wellness,"I have a friend who is new to addressing her mental health challenges and I want to offer her a realistic timeline for achieving ""stability"". 

I have been working on my mental health (depression, anxiety, some OCD tendencies) for about six years now through therapy, medication, mindfulness and self-care maintenance strategies. I'd say just in the last year I reached a stable place with my mental wellbeing. It sounds like my friend who is new to addressing her depression thinks a few weeks is all it's going to take to feel stable. I know everyone is different but figured the wisdom of the internet could help. 

From your lowest mental health point(s), how long before you felt okay? how long before you felt in control? How long before you felt mentally strong?"
1386,Mom told me happy Mother’s Day ( this May) and I want everything gone,"The title is true

I’m back home this summer from my jr year at college. This is the first summer I’ve not worked on my campus - everyone had to be sent home. 

I’m becoming really aware of how toxic the relationships is but I feel terrible bc she is my mom

It’s always been this way but it’s getting hard on me 

she’s been very depressed- has been cut off by her family for freaking out and having panic attacks- and her family is full of jerks- she has these when I don’t do things she wants me to do/ or when I was playing soccer on travel teams she would have them after a game where I played bad - when I started to resent soccer - and talked about quitting she said that she would kill her self bc she would no longer have reason to live 

my dad is verbally abusive to me and her (used to be every morning before school) (but now he mainly just rages to her and tells her how worthless she is , he is an alcoholic)

But he can’t do any paperwork for his job - bc he either wasn’t educated or doesn’t try but I guess he can’t read or write well/ my mom does all these things for him - and does all my taxes and school forms and doctors stuff

When I tell her I need to do this- I’m an adult - she gets sad , she does it anyway, I let it happen, she insists on buying all my clothes, and does before I get a chance to 

She is very obese(has been my whole life)- with age she can hardly move now- being at home I have to do, move , get everything for her - and when I get frustrated she’ll use guilt language 

I’ve started exploding like my dad and I hate it 

I’ve had many failed relationships my time in college, and many rumors I’m unstable- I’ve trying to beat my drug addiction problem- which I’m doing better, i got very addicted to acid , weed , adderall 

The rumors were mainly after a bad break up where I found out I was the other woman- and wrote the person poems and letters , partly calling them jerks, but also apologizing - so I got labeled obsessive and angry bc she told her gossipy friends 

I know that’s tangent but - I feel so lonely and I’m still obsessed with that girl and it’s been a year since she ghosted me (after receiving poems) 

But I’m getting very angry at my relationship lessons from my parents- and being removed and coming back - I’m going into rages all the time- my mom knew a bit about my lsd addiction but when I say Im craving a tab she tells me I can do it - and I do

we don’t really have money for rehab 
I keep hoping they will die , so I can take what’s left and move on 

I love them and try to do everything for them - but it’s so much and I don’t feel like the friends I have are in a point in their lives where they have ability to help me"
1387,Positive news,"Hey guys, 

I've fought serious depression and anxiety issues for most of my life. About 4 years ago, I started a journey taking celexa after a particularly difficult period in my life. Citalopram made me significantly less anxious and depressed, but really made me feel numb. After taking it routinely for nearly a year, I weened myself off of it and went medication free for about 2 years. My symptoms and anxiety and depression slowly began creeping back  (but at least I could feel 'something'). I eventually decided to get back on medication as a of a couple weeks ago. I went and talked to my doctor and relayed my complaints regarding the 'zombie' feeling I would get taking citalopram. He put me on lexapro (escitalopram) instead. .

I cant tell you how much of a significant difference I'm already experiencing. I feel more alive that I have in nearly half a decade. I've had to courage to start going to the gym regularly and life generally feels like its heading in an upward direction.

To summarize, have hope that things can turn around, recovery is always possible. Tweaking your medication with a doctor can be worth it. I wish I had done this sooner."
1388,Feeling lost and like I'll never be satifsfied with my life,"I'm a university student pursuing a BS in Physics with a minor in Math. I feel really lost because I don't have any ambitions/dreams for my life. For example I have a friend who is also a physics major who wants to go into scientific journaling and/or astrophotography and she is passionate about those things. I think physics is really interesting, and I do decently well in school (3.72 GPA, which is pretty ok for a physics major at my school), but I have no idea what I actually want to do with my life. I feel like I'll never be smart enough or knowledgeable enough to do anything worthwhile when there's already so many people who are much smarter than me.

I often (almost constantly even) imagine scenarios in my head of myself, but a better version of myself, in a different life. Sometimes these scenarios involve physics, but more often they don't. This worries me because maybe I picked the wrong major. But I'm just going into my senior year of college so I feel like it's too late to change and I would have wasted 3+ years of my life on physics if I change majors. And you might try to tell me that if I enjoy imagining these scenarios then I should try to achieve them in real life, but the problem is that most of them are completely impossible to achieve. And I'm not being pessimistic - I mean they are literally physically impossible (like fantasy/sci-fi).

I also feel really lonely. I have close friends but haven't been able to see them because of covid. But since we're at different colleges, we rarely got to see each other in person even before covid. I love seeing my friends in person and feel very touch-starved without them. I also worry that no matter where I go in life, I'll never be able to make such close friends who I feel so comfortable around. I feel like it's hard to develop strong friendships as an adult.

I know this probably doesn't sound as serious as a lot of the other posts in this forum but I'm literally crying as I write this and I think about suicide often. I think I won't do it because I know I would hurt my friends and family, but I'm worried that someday I'll be in an even worse state of mind, and someone will say something inadvertently that makes me think they don't care, and it will be the last straw for me. I just don't know what to do about all of this. Any advice is appreciated."

1391,am I depressed or just pessimistic,"I've been struggling with being down for the past 2 years and it's recently been really effecting me. In the beginning of this, I was cutting, excessively drinking, thinking about suicide everyday, and feeling shitty altogether. I'm getting close to that point minus the cutting and constant feeling of being suicidal. I convinced myself for awhile I was depressed and had anxiety but my friend made a good point today. He noticed I focus on the negatives in life too much and I only really look at the bad. I used to be the person that people saw as the only optimist and always energetic. I still am, but with certain people I'm horribly pessimistic. He also pointed out how good I have it. I'm a white chick living in good conditions, not much to worry about. I have a lot going for me and have a lot of my life handed to me on a silver platter. I can't tell if I'm choosing to be this basic pessimistic bitch, or if I'm truly depressed. I understand only a doctor can diagnose me, but I came to reddit for your guys' opinions:)"
1392,Depression = me,"I broke down at work which is always fun. I work in an ER so people were trying to get me to check in. My friend, who I work with, got me to agree to go back to therapy and together we left a message at my old therapists office. 

I pointed out that this was my normal. Keeping my head above water, but never swimming to shore. I keep my depression at bay enough to function, but it’s never gone. 

They want me to not be depressed at all anymore. And guys, that’s who I am. I’m scared to lose the only me I know. Who will I be without mental illness? I can vaguely say happy and unburdened, but I don’t know that person."
1393,My mental illness puts a strain on my relationship with my dad,"My dad just doesn't know how to handle it or how to treat me when I'm feeling low or anxious. Like he cares, I can tell that, but he cares in the most unhelpful way. I'm thankful he cares but it's just so irritating and messes with my emotions more.

I'm super thankful for my relationship with my mum because my mum understands depression. She's told me before that she threatened to kill herself a lot when she was a teenager and she didn't get the same enjoyment out of life and I also know that after having me she had postpartum depression. (Oh and she has a degree in psychology). She understands that repeatedly going on at me about applications and things will make me anxious and stress me out. She knows to not push me to do something when I don't want to. My dad doesn't have that. He'll be completely oblivious to the fact he is causing me to start panicking. He will pester me to do something with him until I give in, not because I want to but to get him to shut up.

I know I'm lucky in the first place to have such caring parents and also that my mum has experienced mental illness so she really understands my needs. I just find it so frustrating that my dad does things that fuck with my mood. That's kinda why I'm crying at the minute. It seems silly but for some reason it's triggered some intrusive thoughts.

ALSO I WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY SH TOOL IS! It went missing months ago when my parents tidied my room and it's not like I can just ask hey wheres that sharp object I mysteriously kept hidden in my room?"
1394,Deciding to make a change,"I am no longer going to constantly research what’s wrong with me—I am perfect the way I am, even if some mental health issues are present. All reading about it does is give me anxiety. I am done.

I hate feeling like this. Does anyone get similar feelings?
1396,Preparenthood anxiety / substance abuse,"Throwaway account because reasons.

So, Ive always been a pretty chill dude. I manage stress well and dont really dwell on stuff too much. For context, Im in my late 20s, well employed young STEM professional.

Myself and the wife are expecting, planned, and very happy about it. However, reflecting upon stuff, I guess Im feeling anxious about the whole radical life role change. The whole situation might be augmented by the covid thing, being locked up and concerned for the wellbeing of my loved ones.

Ive noticed in the past few months that Ive been seeking out reasons to party, moreso than usually. Not only that, but I actively seek out parties where recreational drugs like coke are common. And when I do party, I tend to go all out, coming home in the morning, etc.

Ive always enjoyed a good party (though until recently only alcohol), but I feel lately its been getting a bit out of hand, by my own doing. Im not sure why Im doing it. I mean, its fun, I forget about any worries or stress I need to deal with day to day, but I also think it might be due to the whole parent thing. Maybe I feel that these are my last few months, where I can really go all out and party  to my hearts content before I am loaded with responsibilities for a life other than my own.

Something that I consider a bright red flag is that for the past week or so, Im just sitting at home, watching tv after having a few beers prior (=no big party), but decide to go ahead and do a line anyway, alone. Maybe because of the fun times it reminds me of?

1397,Mini panic attacks in intervals?,"Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone has experienced this. 

In a couple hours I’m going on a long road trip (500 mi) from nor cal to so cal, and I am having anxiety about driving. 

I couldn’t sleep last night, I tried to sleep for the past few hours before I left, but my anxiety about it is getting worse. 

I’m currently experiencing almost waves of panic for a couple seconds, paired with a couple minutes of being okay. It’s cyclical, and the intervals between each wave of panic is getting shorter. 

I was wondering if anyone has experience with something like this. This is not the first time I’ve felt this before, last time I remember this happening was after a breakup 6 years ago. 

How do you cope? What can I do to calm down a bit before my trip? Thank you all in advance."
1398,Lonely,"I am so lonely, and I don't know if it is just the time but I do think that I will be lonely forever. There is no indication that the feeling will subside, and even if it does for a moment, it comes back as if it had never left. I don't believe I have ever fully escaped this feeling, this intense fear of other people. Even when I am around others, I feel like I am miles apart. When people talk to me, I duck for cover as if I were on a battlefield. Every question another person asks me is another shot from a battlement. I wish that my interactions with others weren't duels. Intimacy is a fraught business for someone like me, who lives in constant fear of abandonment. If I do find someone who I can be close to, I will be sure to never let them go. That is how valuable love is to me. But for now, I consider suicide every day. And if I had the means and the anonymity, if I didn't spitefully want others to see me live, I probably would. But I don't want to give people the satisfaction of witnessing my death. I hate the world too much to leave it. I know that doesn't make sense, but it works for me. I am done wishing for a better world. I have survived this far, and I will survive another day. Sorry friends, I am not going away any time soon."

i feel like talking about it/venting so i'll do it here ig:

i went through a really bad breakup 2 years ago that i still think about every day, if i ever see a picture of him or someone mentions his name i will immediately start having a really bad panic attack. i still act out a lot of it pretending like im 14 again and saying the right words to him (this sounds weird as hell but idfk). i feel like i will never stop feeling guilty and horrible about what happened.

this year i was in a relationship with someone really manipulative and got stuck in it for months. it was so emotionally straining i feel like theres no more feeling left in me. i also feel like this has permanently put up a wall and i dont ever want to get close to someone againN

i was also molested by my music teacher 2 years ago and i really hate thinking about it but it always pops up at the most random moments and i can feel his dirty old hands all over me and i just space out for the rest of the time. i really loved learning that instrument too but i never went back because i was so scared he would do it again.

ive been struggling for years with restrictive eating, binging and purging and all that fun stuff. i feel like it isnt even worth talking about cause i still have a normal bmi.

i have such bad concentration its just infuriating

1403,close friend of mine took his own life,"close friend of mine took his own life

over a year ago i got the upsetting news of a really close friend of mine taking his own life. Ever since that day like everyone does I cried alot. 

when he was alive he explained what he was going through and i didnt understand it. i just thought everyone gets sad and that we all go through tough times ( we were in grade 12). 

now its a very long story on how everything went down but to keep it short he ended up getting some upsetting news of his own. With this,his mental snapped in the worst way. He was admitted to the hospital because he was a danger to himself. Later while he was in the hospital i found out he was having delusions about me, thinking i was trying to ""expose"" him and i was putting a virus on his computer. With me being a trigger to his emotions i decided i should stay away because he wanted to ""kill"" me in order to stop me. i put kill in quotes because i knew he was so sick and that the real him would never want to hurt me. When he was in the hospital (for about a month) we started to message eachother. He told me how sorry he was about the threats and what not. 


Ofcourse i told him not to worry and to focus on bettering himself. When the hospital thought he was getting better they let him out, which then another event happened ( i dont know what to call it, an episode?) where he wanted to hurt me when he was home. he ran away from home to get to me and nothing ended up happening, but with this i quickly learned he is still very far from getting better. 

I ended up distancing myself. A few friends and family told me to let the doctors help him and i shouldnt message him to check up on him anymore since he still has these thoughts about me. so thats what i did. i lost a very close friend for like 6 months. i would check on him by asking his brother and get updates that seemed promising. 

Anyway after several months,he was released. it was unclear how he was doing because i knew he was still talking with doctors and taking alot of medicine. So i continued to keep my distance and wondered when it would be okay to finally talk to him. The night he took his life, my older brother was gaming with his older brother and my friend was actually gaming with them. My brother didnt have a mic at the time and the call was on speaker. it was interesting to hear his voice after so long. He seemed okay but clearly he was good at hiding his emotions. the next day i got the news. i always wonder if i wouldve just said something if it couldve changed something. atleast tried to reach out to him. 

a good friend of mine told me to celebrate his life and that he was gone long ago with how sick he was. reminisce the good times. i feel guilt and  it hurts me alot. after all this time i still cry atleast 5 times a week. even if its for 10 mins the feelings come back. 

sorry for the long post, my first close person to pass away. i have not yet gone to therapy. i kept alot out of the full story in respect to him and the family. i tried to put only major things that affected me. thank you for any advice for thise situation."
1404,How do I talk about what’s bothering me with feeling like I’m just transferring baggage?!,"I’m worried about talking about my problems to people. I feel like it might help but I can’t help but feel I’m passing responsibility for my emotional state to the person I’m talking too. Even if they’ve told me “you can talk to me anytime” then I feel even worse. I can sense I might be overthinking things, I just don’t want to make myself somebody else’s problem to solve. Any tips would be appreciated."
1405,The one thing that keeps me happy is no longer constant,"Today I should’ve been happy. I went out for the first time in months because of coronavirus. I went to my aunts to get a haircut and play with her dogs, I went antique shopping, and had pizza for dinner. But after I ate dinner I realized how awful I felt. For the past three days the person I care most about besides my family has basically begun to abandon me. We play video games together and talk pretty much daily for what used to be for hours. Two days ago he said he’d be right back and didn’t come back until the next morning with no explanation. I didn’t push in case something was wrong and just asked how he was and he said fine. Then a day later, he said he’d be right back, went to go play a match with someone else, and never came back. Today we were playing with a mutual friend and I joined their group, mutual friend said hi and he didn’t. He was more focused on talking to our mutual friend and wasn’t paying attention to me. Usually when I’m quiet he’ll ask if I’m ok, today nothing. Then he said he’d be 5-10 minutes for dinner, it’s been 2 hours with no explanation. Yesterday I asked where he’s been and he’s avoided the question. I care about him so much and just want to spend time with him like we used to. We used to watch movies, listen to music together, or just sit in comfortable silence and coexist. Now he never reaches out to me, I always have to reach out and this only time we talk is when we play video games. Recently every time I’ve tried to talk with him it’s just short answers so I thought something was wrong but when he’s talking to someone else he’s his normal self. I don’t know how to be happy when one of the people I care about most is slowly drifting away"
1406,Maybe I just need help from unreal humans (no offense),"I’m so convinced life isn’t real and that I’m in some kinda faze after life before afterlife. It’s like my soul wants to be free but I’m not ready to let go. I’m horrified. Because what happens when you die? It’s up to me to decide what I believe in but it’s so overwhelming. I can’t distract myself from this cus everything and everyone are more distant to me than ever before. Nothing around me doesn’t seem recognizable. Say I look at a picture of my family and I remember when it was taken and all, but the memories feel like they were from when I was alive and I won’t be able to make more. Basically I feel dead, I’m convinced I’m dead, but I’m extremely anxious about this. I feel so alone and unable to change the fact that I’m alone. I can’t reach out to anyone. Cus they’re not real. And it’s weekend so even if calling my counselor could help, I have to wait till Monday.. And I can’t get myself to sleep which makes me even more scared. I feel so silly for sending this and you can all read it and judge, but I really need something to be something right now so"
1407,Diagnose me?,"I still don't have a diagnosis from my psychiatrist so I wanna reach out on here and see if someone can help here are my symptoms.

1. Social and General Anxiety
2. Depersonalization/derealization
3. Leaning backwards when standing or walking
4. Changes in voice
5. Feeling like I'm under the influence all the time (high)
6. Visual snow/hppd
7. Shaking (Tremors)
8. Sensitivity to light
9. Feeling pressure in head AND feeling like I'm going cross eyed though not sure if I really am

That's all I can think of right now and yes I've tried hallucigens(drugs) in the past this all started around age 18 and got worse overtime I'm 21 now the doctors think schizophrenia but I'm not sure if that's it if anyone might know what this is please let me know thanks!"
1408,What’s happened to me?,"I’m not entirely sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I’m going to give it a go, when I was younger I used to be really good in school, really motivated, had a lot of ambition and I was very naturally intelligent, I remember proving a room of teachers wrong one time about a maths question and they were all shocked, I got 100% on all my end of year exams and my future looked very bright. But now I feel like I have lost it, I don’t know what’s happened to me but I feel like I have had some sort of cognitive decline, I used to have a very good memory and now I can’t remember basic things such as easy numbers, my grades have definitely gone down in school and as much as I try to motivate myself, because I do want to do well, I just can’t, I just can’t do things like homework anymore I go to sit down and I know I want to do it I want to do well but I just can’t I end up just leaving it or pushing it off and never getting things done, maybe this is a medical problem where something has happened to my brain or maybe it’s just me, maybe a combination I’m not sure but if anyone has any idea what might be happening here, please let me know.
Thanks."
1409,my paranoia is getting worse,"my paranoia prevents me from having friends, visiting a therapist and now from trusting my girlfriend, for heavens sake somebody tell me what to do its been a long long time i just wanna live normally"
1410,I don't know what to do anymore...,"Long story short I have a sibling who suffers from body dismorphic disorder (let's call her kate). She thinks that she's a physical monster, that shes disfigured, is too fat (even though she is extremely thin) and gets anxious going outside as she feels that people will be disgusted by her. 

I also have another little sister (Iet's call her kass)who's pretty slim, just the typical lanky teenager. Kate absolutely despises her just because she is slim and is ""prettier"" than her in her eyes. If Kass enters the same room as Kate, Kate will look her down and examine her. Then it'll trigger a rant to me, or my parents about how she's ""the ugliest"" or that she's ""never been thin"" and that she needs to get all these surgical procedures done. When Kate goes to my parents for that it gets pretty heated, my father won't give into her delusions and gets very frustrated and passionate about it. If you don't agree with Kate, or if you try not to engage when she gets like that she'll throw a fit and harm herself (ie, cutting, downing meds, etc). 

I've always been the one to try to talk her down so that she doesn't self harm, but its really getting to me and affecting my own mental health. As soon as I wake up she starts (I hate phrasing it like that but im not sure how else I can phrase it) she'll talk to me about all the weight she needs to lose and that its not fair (this bothers me a lot since I've been struggling to lose weight and get talked down to by my parents anytime I eat anything) . Or she'll find a picture of someone who isn't conventionally attractive and shove it in my face stating how she looks like that individual. If you tell her no, she'll go off about how you're lying to her and then trail off to talking about non existent wrinkles or that her jaw is supposed to be ""x"" centimeters from whatever. 

I try to talk about something else but she takes it as me dismissing her feelings. I just want to focus on more positive things, or things that we can work on instead of obsessing. I know she's suffering too and I really want to help but nothing sticks, nothing I say or do helps. 

I'm scared for her because I know she's suicidal, but she's also admitted to doing other things to Kass to try and sabotage her weight. Kate will ask her of she wants a coffee and she'll add in a bunch of sugar, or she'll go out of her way to buy her junk food and frappuccinos and watch her eat it. If Kass doesn't eat something right away because she's distracted doing other things this will trigger Kate to no end and she'll get in her face and become physical. 

Kass walks on eggshells and spends most of her days locked up in her room on the computer because she doesn't want to deal with Kate's outbursts. Kass also never wears tight or form fitting clothes around Kate as she knows what that'll start. 

My father wants to throw Kate out, because he's done with this and figures some tough love might help her but my mother is afraid that if he does that she'll off herself. 

Its literally like this everyday. My hope is for her to go seek treatment but she thinks it's pointless since she's gone through therapy and not much has changed. No one can commit her either since she is over 18. 

I'm sorry that this post wasn't worded the best, im just feeling defeated and out of answers. I THINK at this point I should look out for myself but I feel guilty leaving her to suffer.."
1411,Any good therapy apps/website?,I’m looking for a therapy app or website where i can talk to someone without charge. I’m going through a lot right now and don’t have the money to get an actual therapist or do the monthly fees of a lot of these platforms. It would mean so much if i could find some soon!
1412,"This is my first time on reddit, and I need help","Last year I became suicidal. It took a while, but I was eventually able to open up to my closest friends and family about what I was going through. I was dealing with the guilt of being an abusive brother and friend. Over a period of a few months I was able to set up a really good support system with those closest to me and get professional help from a therapist, but then it all came crumbling down around me. The person I trusted most thought that I didn't appreciate their help and they cut me out of their life, so my biggest support was gone. That threw me deeper into suicidal thoughts than I had ever been before and I broke my hand as a form of self harm, and kept hurting it every time it started to heal, I think I've done irreparable damage to it as I never asked to see a doctor. Then, when I started to get over some of the issues I was working through, I decided to tell my dad about them, and as I told him about my trust issues he called me a narcissist that is incapable of forming real relationships. That threw me deeper into loneliness and isolation and I still haven't trusted anyone since then. Then covid and and I wasn't able to see my therapist anymore. Any friends I trusted don't want to hear my problems anymore or don't know how to handle them, my dad thinks I'm evil, my mom is extremely toxic and I would never talk to her, and my therapist is unavailable. On top of that I'm still struggling from my original problems of guilt and feeling unworthy of love. Before, I was scared that no-one wanted to help me, now I know it's true and I've never felt more alone. I guess this is just my way of crying for help and trying to find anyone who cares for me."
1413,My now ex Girlfriend's mental illness,"This story is about my Friend/Girlfriend.  
I have known this girl now for about a year, and we sat together every day. This past month I have started dating; she has been struggling to find her true self and finding her gender and who she likes. She has dated many different types of people over the years, and with each ending in lies and cheating. She had admitted to struggling with self-harm, and it was clear that she didn't have good mental health. Moments ago, I had started a conversation with me saying that I feel like she doesn't have feelings for me. This is how the conversation went. I stated that I didn't feel like we were doing the same things that I had seen her doing with her other poly gfs and bfs(At this time, all complements to her were one-sided, and we didn't video/voice talk all by text). It went on to a point where she believed I was saying that I didn't like her being poly, and ""if I don't like it, I can leave."" She then began to allude that the reason for being poly was due to her bad relationships, and if she is poly, ""It is not cheating."" I asserted that maybe being poly isn't right and that it is not what she is, That she can be happier in a different relationship. She said, "" That she doesn't want to be happy."" This was when I understood what was going on. At this point, I tried to get her to realize that there is a possibility that she doesn't need to be sad. This only leads to her not wanting to talk to me anymore as well as breaking up.   
I can see that I did quite a bit of wrong, but I want to find her the help she needs or find a way to fix this."
1414,"TW: self harm, sexual assault","My grandma is on her death bed, my sister and I haven’t talked in 3 years because she’s toxic and my parents think she’s the golden child (and has a kid whereas I don’t) and I managed to push all my friends away and only have my boyfriend. He’s wonderful and supportive and I love his family for the most part. 

However I did it. I used a tool with a sharp point and slammed it on my hand multiple times until it bruised. I have ptsd and recently remembered in 2013 around Memorial Day I was drunk and high (weed) and smoked some salvia and I woke up to my friend on top of me-I was passed out. 

Idk anymore guess that’s it."
1415,i’ve never really told someone this before but no one ik follows my reddit so here goes..,"i’m not exactly sure when, because my earlier grades have all blended together, but sometime in between kindergarten and like second grade, this happened. 

and it never really sat right with me, but it wasn’t until years later that i realized how fucking disgusting it is. 

even back then i instinctively lied about it. i knew something was wrong, but i couldn’t identify what it was. 

but now i know. 

i tried to convince myself that it was a horrible nightmare. 

but i know it wasn’t. 

when i was younger, i used to go to one of my neighbor’s houses a lot and hang out with their kids my age. we got along just fine. they have a brother who is multiple years older than us. 

there was one day (and pardon this retelling, not all of it is particularly vivid) on which he told me to come into his room/closet or whatever. so i did, being the naïve little child i was. 

he asked me to undress myself. 

he told me he was curious about what a girl’s body looked like. not knowing better, i obliged. he didn’t do much, though i think he may have touched my legs or something. 

i do vividly remember him telling me to turn around and to pull my underwear down further. i hate that i remember it, but i do. 

and then, a few days later, he asked me to do it again. 

and i obliged. i didn’t know what was going on. 

for years, i’ve blamed and shamed myself for what happened. i’m embarrassed. i can’t look at him without wanting to vomit—and i’m still friends with the others. 

now i know why i don’t like going to their house or seeing their brother. now i know why i’ve never liked changing in front of people. 

i feel like i might be making a mountain from a molehill. and i feel like i should’ve known better. but i wanted to get this off of my chest. i’m not really sure what to call it either but yeah.."
1416,is this healthy ?,"i have really bad anxiety w depression but i can’t do anything about it because my family. they are the main cause of my trauma. i used to go out partying and out with friends, before quarantine i didn’t go out for around 3 months. after quarantine restrictions have been sort of lifted, i haven’t been out. so technically i haven’t been out for 4 months without force. i don’t want to go out i can’t be bothered. i am doing more schoolwork and working out. i really don’t know if i’m maturing or getting worse. i’ve been crying at school, i’ve never done that before. i’m starting to be harder on myself on my schoolwork rather than my appearance. i am starter to become mean to my friends, it’s an in the moment thing. they are the ones being really loud and annoying in class. idk if everyone pisses me off or i piss myself off."
1417,I can't do this anymore!!!!!,"WHY IS EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!

THAT'S THE ONE THING I CAN DO SAFELY WITHOUT SPREADING THE VIRUS HOW IS THAT WRONG!!! How am I so evil for doing that!!!

Cases are going up EVERYWHERE like crazy. I can't do this anymore. I don't think life will be normal for two more years. Why is THIS ALL HAPPENING???? I thought things were getting better?"
1418,How do I improve my mental health after helping a friend get through a really bad depression. TW: Suicide and Self Harm,"I was around 14 when one of my close friends told me they were depressed and began to self harm. They told me they would cut their thighs until they bled and got to the point where they were contemplating suicide. I was devastated and terrified. It was so difficult to see someone I care about in such a bad mental state. 

They refused to get help at first because she felt her parents could not pay for therapy long term also her parents thought it was just a phase. So at age 14 with no proper mental health training I became their make shift therapist. I’d stay up at night texting them begging them to get help. I became so afraid to go to sleep because I thought most night if I closed my eyes I’d wake up and my friend would not be there anymore. 

I remember on a school tour and on the bus. My phone died and people were playing music. Some song like “you got me suicidal” and trying not to scream or start bawling crying in front of my classmates. 

Eventually it got to the point where I showed my mom the texts. I remember just crying into her arms because I didn’t know if they were going to be ok. 

It’s been over 2 years and my friend is clean and seeing a therapist. Yet I’m still not completely over it. How can I heal?"
1419,I Do Not Deserve What I Have. Help Me.,"I really do not have any name for what mental problems I have but I feel like I should never treat myself. I always feel like I am a bad son for my parents and I always think about poor and unfortunate people when I am about to buy something for myself. When I rationally examine my situation I know that I deserve to treat myself from time to time. I am a successful law student and a great musician and I've always made my parents proud since I was born. But I feel like I am not enough and I think it is connected to what happened in my first year of college.

Last year it was the first year of law and I fucked up big time. I was broken up with my first serious girlfriend just before the start of the year and I fell into self-claimed depression. I started a new relationship to make the transition from my previous relationship easier and albeit it made things easier (we are still dating and I love her quite dearly now but it was different in the first couple of months of our relationship) and I joined the college orchestra to distract myself from my feelings.

However academically, I lost all the previous motivation that led me to the best college in the country. My GPA at the end of the year was 1.8. Moreover, I am a fat person, and the whole of the last year I just stayed in the school dormitory eating shit food and getting fatter and fatter (I am on a diet right now so that problem will be solved in a couple of months at least). Furthermore, I have IBS so I felt like (and still feel like) even though I was intellectually very well capable I thought I would never be able to be a lawyer so that also made (and still makes) in my mind the money and effort my parents gave to college a waste.

The situation right now is I am on a diet and my grades improved quite drastically. It went from 1.8 to 2.9 in a year and I am planning on being an academic if it will be possible at the end of college (and I feel like it won't be possible). I still have the IBS ( even though I am treating it according to my physician's plan it did not go away and it has been 5 months or so since I started the treatment) and I am still overweight (though I am improving upon it by doing intermittent fasting).

I still feel like I am not enough. I feel like I do not deserve to buy nice things for myself. I feel immensely guilty even though I would be considered in 1-2 percent in my country. Yeah, times are tough because of COVID but we are getting along financially thanks to god and my dad. But still, I do not think I deserve to buy a nice headphone or an amplifier for it (I am an audiophile or at least I  believe so). Even after I buy those things I feel guilty for months. I bought an iPad for my classes and yes it was not necessary but I bought it for the sheer goal of using it in class. It has been 6 months since we bought the thing and I still feel guilty for making my parents buy it.

I think about how I could have a scholarship if I acted differently when choosing a college and how I am a burden for my family. And as a burden, I do not deserve what I have. I do not deserve to have a gaming PC. I do not deserve to have 3 different instruments. I do not deserve my bed, my lifestyle, my books. Considering the poor children,who have way worse than me, I really do not deserve to have a some-what wealthy lifestyle. 

A YouTuber I watch (CallMeCarson) talked about a notion called Imposter Syndrome and I feel like it is compatible with what I might have. My parents are and always been proud of me. But I am unable to be proud of myself even for a second. I passed all my 2nd-year classes with good grades but right now I am scolding myself for not taking a summer course.

&amp;#x200B;

Help me."
1420,No hope or motivation for the future. Im useless.,I can't do anything so I do nothing 24/7. I have no friends or hobbies. I've been depressed for years. I'm a waste and a burden. I hate myself. Sometimes I think that one day I'll get therapy and maybe life will be bearable but then I remember that I will never get therapy. I put it off like it's something I'll do later while knowing I never will. It's not even worth it because I'm not worth it. Why have my mom waste all that money when I know deep down one day I will kms. I don't know how or when but suicide is an inevitability.
1421,Quetiapine (Seroquel XR 400 to 800mg) benefits vs risks when taken throughout pregnancy and breast feeding as a mood stabilizer?,I will have to decide with my psychiatrist when the time comes but I would love to hear your personal experiences. Thank you💗
1422,I'm really trying,"Spent all day looking for a therapist the only one accepting new patients and my insurance said that I was too ""severe of a case"" for them to treat.

1423,Does any one else some times feel like a third wheel in a friendship group?,"Got a big group of friends I've known for years and years, but sometimes when I'm out I feel like such a fucking third wheel. Like I've been close with a lot of these people at one point or another and now just feel like nothing would change if I weren't there. I feel like I wouldn't be missed.

 Its so frustrating when you think your still close with a friend, only to realise that time has passed. Now feeling just like another casual friend. 

I feel as though me distancing my self is to blame. Like God damn, why did I have to be such a medicore friend ffs. Sorry for the rant"
1424,Has anyone else been feeling especially sensitive recently?,"Recently I’ve been super sensitive about every single little thing. Like the smallest things can send me into a raging mess of tears. I’m not sure if it’s just been quarantine that’s been messing with me but I used to not be as sensitive. I used to be pretty thick skinned and I could deal with emotional pain, but for some reason now I can’t.

It’s either that I’ve been hurt more and more as of recently (not their fault in all honesty), that I’ve gotten my first real stressful job, or that being cooped up really isn’t good for my emotions. 

I’m not sure if anyone else has been feeling especially sensitive recently, but I’m pretty sure that I’m not alone and that other people are feeling the same.

1426,Why I don’t wear a mask in public,"Here is my explanation please don’t hate too much 


I can’t for 2 reasons...

1) I have OCD and the thought of breathing in air that has came out of my mouth makes me want to throw up

I have problems with breathing things in such as farting... if anyone including myself farts I will spray deodorant or something so the bad smell doesn’t go inside me (I’m aware this is stupid but I can’t help it)

2) I have anxiety so I would be too worried others are looking at me and judging me or laughing at me... even if I knew it was the right thing and they are wrong if even 1 person pointed or laughed in my direction I would break down and cry

Nobody understands and when they look at me they think I’m ignorant or don’t care but I have personal issues and getting judged like this without all the facts makes me really uncomfortable

I’m sorry I wish I was normal and could do this stuff I hope this helps you because even though I can’t explain to everyone at least you now know it’s not always a choice"
1427,Receiving diagnosis in an inpatient placement?,"So at my recent therapy session, I told my therapist that I really don’t want to get better. She knew I had been on antidepressants and basically asked if I was taking them, to which I was honest and said that i wasn’t. I’ve been very resistant to her advice and she said if I don’t want to get better than what am I hoping to do living like this. When I didn’t respond she started questioning if I was having thoughts of ending it. I told her I do, but they’re more plans of giving myself like a year to get things sorted out (financially mostly) and she brought up that the other option if I’m not going to try taking my medicine would be an inpatient placement. Although I know they can be good (I previously worked at a behavioral health hospital and she is aware of this), I don’t want to end up in inpatient. Mostly because I feel like it would be a waste of time and money since I don’t want to be better. I am curious though if there is something more than anxiety/depression going on and whether an inpatient placement might get me a little more insight on what is going on because I feel like for the most part I’m outwardly functioning in a fairly neurotypical manner, but there is a lot going on inside my head that feels off. My therapist and I have recognized that I really have a lot of shame and guilt, we suspect there is some trauma I’ve been through but I really can’t remember anything specific other than having a dad who is pretty emotionally abusive and the fact that I’m transgender and likely suffered years of not understanding where I fit in as a kid and have carried that with me. I feel like taking the antidepressants might get rid of the depression, but I don’t think it will change anything about my lack of confidence to do anything and my inability to make and maintain any kind of relationships."

I've gotten to where I can't stand to hear any noise while working on school work or else I totally lose it and I have to put on ear muffs. I get distracted easily and I can't focus for long periods of time  which is needed in college. One moment I'll be looking at calculus problems and the next moment I'm like ""hey let's see what the news is today ."" I'm not lacking motivation at all; I will spend extra time and take away any free time I would have had and instead study to compensate for my issues. I was so nervous and strung out all of the time that I ended up losing 10-15 lbs my first year ( when I get nervous I don't eat as much ). I can never seem to stay organized with school work either and set reasonable plans and goals for each day and week. I have a tendency to run late to everything too. I'm also a little more irritable and I snap easier than I used to. I ended up doing well my first year but I don't want to go through another year living like this. I'm not sure what to do and what's wrong with me."

You don't know me and I don't know you but; my philosophy in life is to never ever let someone have no one. Whatever your problem is, drop me a message and I'll try to give my best advice or even make you try forget about it. I can't promise to solve your problems but I promise you won't go through them alone. 

I'm here and you got this 👊

1436,Should I Wait to Change Insurance Before Starting Therapy,"TLDR--Switching insurances is in a month.  Should I wait to start therapy until then, or would it be worth it to use a service like BetterHelp in the meantime?

Hi Everyone! New to this subreddit, not new to a chemically imbalanced brain.

So right now, I'm not going to therapy/counseling (though I have done free counseling at my University in the past) and while my partner is really supportive of me and my struggles (we've been together for almost 4 years) being the person I go to about my mental health issues (namely food anxiety, guilt, stress, and hopelessness) is taking a toll on him.

I start a new job in a month that has a health insurance package much more comprehensive than the one I currently have (which I know is a huge blessing and I am very grateful as not many people in my U.S. get this type of support).  I'm wondering if I should wait to start therapy until I switch health insurances, or if I should sign up for a service like BetterHelp in the meantime?  Would it even be worth it to see someone for only a month?  Or is there a good chance I won't get to take advantage of my new company's health insurance package right away, so the interim would be even longer?

In the meantime, I'm also working through ""Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life"" workbook.

Thanks all, stay safe &lt;3"
1437,Getting frustrated/stressed out by any noises,"I don't know why, but I can't stand too much noise or certain noises. I don't know if it's some sort of anxiety I'm feeling, but I can easily get annoyed/frustrated/ stressed out hearing noises. 
I started noticing it when I couldn't take the eating/mouth noises that my parents make while eating next to them. It was always so loud and disgusting that I lost my appetite most of the time and got frustrated. I tried to focus on anything else but couldn't. To this day (I'm 30) I hate hearing them eat. 
When I moved out for college, I lived in a quite apartment without noisy neighbours and I really loved it. Of course, i could here the traffic outside but managed to get used to it using earplugs. 
I'm an incredibly light sleeper, too. I wake up when I move during sleep, I wake up when someone else moves next to me (partners or friends sleeping next to me), any little sound in the apartment can wake me up. As I said, earplugs help, but only to a certain point. 
I hate it if my nose whistles a little bit while sleeping, I hate it when I can hear my heartbeat in my ears against the pillow, I hate the little crackling sound that my nose or ears make sometimes (those are barely noticeable during the day but I can't stand them when I'm trying to sleep). 
Now that I've moved in with my SO and our dog (his house in a small village), I think I might go insane. I basically walk around/live with plugged in ears all the time: My SO loves to listen to loud music while vacuuming, he plays video games loudly, watches youtube videos of motorcycles and ups the volume because he loves the loud noises of them, he needs to listen to the TV to fall asleep, when his friends are around they talk very loudly and stomp around the house because they never take their boots off. Our dog is also getting somewhat annoying as well. I nie it is not its fault, but those licking and swallowing noises that it makes are worse then my parents eating noises. It also whines a lot when my boyfriend is not in the same room. 

I know it's really insensitive to say this, but I really wish I was deaf just to get a little piece and quiet. Not only during the day with my SO and dog, but also just to be able to sleep without any disturbances. I'm tiping this now while not being able to sleep for 6 hours, because I'm so frustrated from all the little noises my own body is making. 

Of course there are noises I can tolerate like cars driving by, a working fan or rain, those are soothing during sleep but still wake me up all the time. I like to listen to music or watch videos during the day (with headphones on) because those are noises that I chose to listen to. But I can get frustrated again, if I hear other loud noises/voices in the background again. It really stresses me out and I have to leave the house to get some quiet time. 
I really don't know what to do, I have a feeling that it's getting worse over time and I sometimes even want to cry out of frustration.... 

(Ironically I have trouble understanding people when they talk/whisper to me in different settings. I hear that they say something but can't always make out the words on the first try. This doesn't frustrate me that much but I get frustrated hearing voices in general (while trying to sleep, in commercials etc))"
1438,Is this normal for a teen?,"Hello everyone. Over the past 3 months, I have been getting these feelings of death, and the inevitable demise of myself. To further explain, I'm afraid of dying in general. I lose everything I love doing when I die, it will all just disappear knowing that ill probably never become a human again nor know it. I just won't even exist anymore. It has gone so far that I have been thinking about it almost all the time now and have trouble sleeping as I think about it every night. It scares me. Any form of help is appreciated to help me not think of this fear."
1439,i have voices in my head..,I always..i mean ALWAYS feel like my neighbors are talking about me. no matter what I do. I always hear voices. distant chatter. I don’t know what to do. I try to ignore it but at this point I feel like the problem is deeper than that. I need help. serious help.
1440,First Good Sleep In A Long Time,I’m still getting over a someone that meant so much to me. He was the most important person to me besides my family. Anyway every night I get nightmares and cold sweats and I try to cry in my sleep but I end up choking and waking myself up. But last night I decided to think about something positive while going to sleep. I decided to think about puppies. And I slept through the whole night without any cold sweats and choking. I feel proud of myself.
1441,Sexual issues as a result of childhood molestation.,"As a young child, roughly 6 I was touched, penetrated and forced to do various sexual acts incited by another child. He and his brother also showed me a lot of porn. As a kid this just felt normal but eventually my mother came in as he was molesting me and everything stopped. Police were involved but ultimately nothing came of it. I now find my self to have a lot of sexual frustration, I have a need for sexual release quite often and have quite an off sense of boundaries with people. While I haven't ever hurt anyone or done anything horrible  I've lost some friends due to drunken mistakes. I feel like I'm a horrible horrible person and I have a constant cloud of shame over me. I don't know how to sort this but I want it to stop."
1442,Too many compliments,"Hi. I have a boyfriend that compliments me too much to the point where it's tiring. It annoys me, makes me uncomfertable and I feel shit about it. I have alot of mental health issues but I have noticed I am struggling alot with this. Yes It's nice to be complimented. Sometimes. Not 17 times every day. The intentions are good because he knows I have alot of issues with my self but when I let him know It's too much then he gets upset. It's Impossible for him to understand that I don't want it. It makes me feel really shit when I can't just say thank you and get over it, because I will do that the first few times and then he keeps doing it through out the day there is nothing but mentioning how cute and pretty and sweet I am. It is making me insane. 

I have low selfasteem, depression and anxiety so it's hard to recieve a compliment in general. This is just overkill, it's the only topic sometimes and I have the attention. He will compliment me infront of friends and it's making me hate myself. It's horrible. It's also horrible to know that someone is trying their best to make you feel better but it's rather causing damage than anything else. 

To me it seems like he has an unhealthy view of me, like he doesnt actually see me for who I am. Is it a desperate attempt of fixing me or is it just that he genuinely thinks about this all the time? Anyway when I say it's a little too much he gets sad, annoyed and feel bad about it. I am not okay with making anyone upset because of my response to something. At the same time I do have every right to speak my mind about something that is bothering me but it doesnt seem to be accepted or respected. I am a person with many faults and especially when I am depressed I need to be met in a different way than overcomplimented in an attempt to make me happy. 

I know my mental state has alot to say in this situation but Ialso think a mentally stable person would feel somewhat the same.

Any thoughts on how to deal with this? Anyone been in the same situation?"
1443,The Glass Box,"This is going to be a long post so I’d like to pre thank anyone who takes the time to read it.

Anyway, I feel alone, as if I’m the only one suffering and there is no hope or help for me. When I try to reach out for help I’m met with judgement and ridicule as if I should just suck it up and get on with life. At the same time I can see why people act like that. There are much more serious things going on for other people and I should be thankful that I have my health and people around me! Right? 

The title is a term I use to describe how I’m feeling: I’m in the centre of a very busy city with 100s of people passing by every second and I’m trapped inside a small glass box full of water, drowning, whilst watching everyone else breathe, even though I’m in plain sight and crying out for help.

I don’t know what caused me to start feeling like this, I don’t want to die... I just don’t want to feel like this. After plucking up the courage and marginally convincing myself that I deserve help I’ll go to my GP where I will explain how I feel and then get handed a prescription for some SSRI’s and get told to come back in a month. Rinse and repeat. I just feel like a tranquillised mattress, just sort of existing. Not really achieving much... you know?  I have no drive or motivation to do anything with my life.

Again, I’d like to thank anyone who reads my little outlet and I’d like to apologise if this is the incorrect sort of thing to post to this subreddit."

1445,Feeling lonely and like I can’t do anything about it,For a long time I’ve been spiraling honestly I’ve lost a lot of good friends recently and for most of my life I know friends come and go but I hate feeling this lonely and everyone just says well do your hobby where my hobby’s are people related such as video games or tabletop games which for neither do I have any to play with I’ve been feeling this constantly loneliness and I just wanna make it stop but I can’t
1446,Need someone (Ed),Nobody knows about what I do. I have nobody I can tell. I haven't eaten in 3 days and I'm gonna start passing out soon. If I eat I know I'll throw it up. I need the strength to eat just one meal. If someone could please give me the strength I'd appreciate so much because I can't make myself. I know it's a lot to ask but if someone could check on me in about an hours time and make sure I haven't purged it would be super appreciated. Thank you.
1447,Trauma is not a competition,"Looking back on my depression:
I put all this pressure on myself. Why aren't you happy??? You have everything you ever dreamed of! A home, a loving boyfriend, a good job. You're so lucky. You're so privileged. 
Lots of people are homeless. Alone. Hungry. Unemployed. Count your blessings! Look on the bright side! Be positive! Snap out of it!
You should be going to work. You should go see your friends.
But I can't.
I can't stop crying. I can't get out of bed.
I can't boil an egg without spilling water and forgetting if it's been on the stove for a minute or an hour.
And this goes on for months.
Some days all I could do was fight against hurting myself. Some days I lost that battle. 
I'm still here.
Depression is debilitating. Depression doesn't pick favorites. Just because your life looks like a Hollywood movie doesn't mean you aren't suffering inside. You are allowed to feel what you're feeling. 
If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or others, please ask for help. Call a friend, a mental health or suicide hotline. Thank you. Comments welcome.⚘"

1450,"Trapped in a Dark, Dark, Void","I have no idea what these are signs of, but I feel severely lost and in total despair. It's an on and off switch, one day im fine and superbly bliss, the next I just feel absolutely hopeless and start to have suicidal thoughts and the thoughts just reply and replay and replay in my head over and over again. I just feel like all of a sudden I was automatically lunged toward the deepest darkest pit possible. I don't even feel sad, just full on despair/hopelessness. The void just keeps pulling and pulling, and I can't see anything at all, just pure darkness, and then all of a sudden, the heaviness of the gravitational pull of the void slowly creeps away, and light starts poking through the darkness, and all of a sudden im extremely happy, bathing in the sunlight, but soon enough, likely a week later, the void comes back. The only time I'm happy when in my episode of despair is when I'm talking to my girlfriend, but when we stop it hits me like a freight train. I just want advice, and I don't know what subreddit to post this on, so I decided to come here where it's a lot more versatile. Any help is absolutely appreciated. I just feel so, so, so lost."
1451,Blue Light,"Blue light is a color in the visible light spectrum that can be seen by human eyes. Blue light is a short wavelength, which means it produces higher amounts of energy.

Blue light is everywhere.

Sunlight is the main source of blue light, and being outdoors during daylight is where most of us get most of our exposure to it. But there are also many man-made, indoor sources of **blue light**, including fluorescent and LED lighting and flat-screen televisions. 

Blue light suppresses the release of melatonin in our brains, which leads to a lower quality of sleep, which in turn can contribute to a variety of negative health effects.

Blue light glasses enhance your focus and reduce eye strain, making your eyes feel more awake. This can also boost your productivity since your eyes will not be impacted as much due to higher than average use of screen.

1452,I’m afraid about people in the next part of my life finding out that I have Aspergers.,So I just graduated high school and am about to go to college and I am afraid that people there will find out that I have asperges (high functioning so most people won’t be able to tell) and how they will treat me. So for the first 2 years of high school nobody new and I never had any problems with it. But I can’t remember how but some found out and then some people (not a lot but enough to get under my skin including my friends) found out about it then proceeded to “bully” me about it. I’m afraid that somehow someone will find out about it in college and proceed to do the same thing. I don’t know if they will but it just scares me because I already had to go through all that shut and I don’t want to have to go through it again
1453,I’m having a hard time dealing with fame,"Hey guys, I’m an 18 year old from Brazil and I’m diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have a Tiktok account where I’ve managed to get 100,000+ followers over a period of seven months. I was really happy with the growth at first but now it is making me go crazy and really upset. I feel judged, there are so many people talking to me, is really overwhelming. I like posting the content I make but I can’t bear the hate comments, the fear of saying something I shouldn’t and such. I’ve also lost almost all of my will to even do the videos and I can’t have any ideas anymore. I don’t want to leave the app, since I like it a lot and have some friends that are also creators, and I really like doing the videos. I’m just extremely overwhelmed and upset about feeling that I’m being judged, afraid and going through a really deep crisis in my brain about all of those things.

Anyway, I hope you guys take it seriously, since some of my friends didn’t, and say I’m complaining and being annoying cause fame is supposed to feel good. It really is tiring and making me sad. If someone can help me, please reply to this. And don’t be rude, I’m feeling really bad right now and that wouldn’t help. Thank you."
1454,I feel like I can’t go back to “real life”,"At the beginning of quarantine I was a wreck, an anxious mess. Saw no one, did nothing. As time went on I freaked out and needed interaction and had way too much of it with way too many people, that was probably April or so, I began my quarantine and not working in mid March. 

I backpedaled and became more responsible and have really only hung around the same couple of people who I know are also being very safe and see no one else. One of them still hasn’t even gone into stores. 

I’ve become VERY accustomed to being home. My job randomly called me back to work w 2 days notice and I declined and extended my furlough. There’s more to this, it also came w a big enough pay and hour cut that I would be making approx 20 k less a year. But that’s not what did it for me. My anxiety is so so bad about being “normal” again. I feel like I can’t do it. I feel like I’ve fallen back into what I did in high school (now 27F) where I stayed home for 2 months and refused to go to school because my anxiety and depression were so bad. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed but I’m absolutely an anxious mess. I’ve been job searching nonstop and have actually had some luck. However, I’m reluctant on following through with interviews because I can’t imagine going back to any type of work environment. I sit in my bed and just think about how I would literally rather commit suicide then have to go back into a day to day environment. I don’t feel like I can handle it. The thought shakes me to my absolute core and I feel so sick.

It doesn’t help that I’m basically in the process of firing my entire treatment team. I was actually supposed to meet with a new therapist via Telehealth today and I cancelled an hour beforehand. I just can’t imagine talking to someone new.

I’m not sure how to get out of this funk. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be a productive adult again and I never want to be. I just feel so defeated and sick over this but just needed somewhere to vent!!"
1455,Idk what to title this I just wanna know that I’m not alone,"I’m a positive person; I love people, I love certain things in life, I am thankful for my job &amp; friends &amp; family. I honestly think that everything happens for a reason &amp; you can’t fuck up what’s meant for you. That there’s a plan to this all. But I also feel like I’m fighting every day; from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I overthink what I eat, what I wear, how far things are, the people who surround me. (&amp; it’s not like self conscious “what are people thinking” stuff) it’s OCD &amp; anxiety related. Contamination, going crazy, not being in control. My brain never shuts up, I overthink at least 50 things a day. I can’t remember the last time I just did something &amp; didn’t think about every tiny thing that could go wrong. It’s like I have so much faith that things will get better but also I’m torturing myself every day &amp; I’m trapped with a brain that wasn’t wired right."
1456,Validation is Critical!,"If you’re feeling invalidated by everybody and everything in this world.... know in your heart that you are allowed to feel that thing and it doesn’t matter what anybody else thinks.

You see other people going about life so confidently and wonder how in the hell they do it.

We will all continue to be invalidated by everything 😭 it isn’t going to stop. But you can change your behavior and do little things to validate yourself  so you’re not buried under a mountain of complaints. 

How in the f do I validate myself, you ask? 

First of all, starting NOW: no more negative self talk! Catch yourself in your thoughts and flip anything negative “god I am such an idiot” to “how silly of me” ... small, small changes. 

Plant little seeds of joy in your mind and water them by taking that step back, not engaging in that thing that always makes you cringe.... I like to call it mental gardening.  

This process gets heavy and it can take months, years sometimes  to dig out of and this journey has no destiny it is a part of your life. 

But when you align your behavior with your morality and aspirations, you will begin to experience magic and validation will always come from within. the negative feedback will quiet and you will find balance and stasis.

Mental health is a spiritual journey.... be the architect of your world.  I hope this is helpful to somebody ❤️"

1458,"Quarantine, mental health and chronic illness.","This quarantine is seriously messing with my mental health. Before all this happened, I was going through a flare up with my medical condition. My plan was simple, once my flare up was over I would find a new job and get back on my feet. 

Than this all happened. I haven't worked since January, and my anxiety about going back to work has gone through the roof. Every passing day I get more and more anxious about returning to work. 

The icing on the cake is that next year I planned on teaching abroad. But I'm so scared that if I don't return to work soon I'll loose my motivation and hope to work abroad. I'll be too scared of my medical condition having another flare up that I'll take the easy way out. It's been my dream to teach abroad since I was on highschool. 

I know I can do it, I've lived abroad successfully for 4months during my undergrad. But because I had a flare up and than covid happened, I'm so worried about it. 

All my plans are falling apart, and it's stressing me out."

1461,I don’t think there’s a way out for me,"I struggle with horrible self esteem issues.

I feel like I’ll never be able to know that I’m not a disgusting approximation of a human being until I have friends and a good relationship, but I know that I’ll never have those until I learn to love myself. But honestly, I don’t think I deserve to be loved. I have no personality and jack shit in the way of social skills. I have no confidence in myself, and no way to gain confidence from social interactions. I tell people I have social anxiety, but the truth is that I just have no clue what to say in any circumstance. I’ve tried to go to therapy but I never get anything other than ‘these thought processes are wrong and you need to change them’, but I already know how illogical and maladaptive my thought processes are, but I have no way to actually change them.

To keep my anxiety down I am trying meditation using the insight app (slightly better than a regular timer because it tells you how many minutes in total you have meditated and how many days in row. Gamification helps). On most days, I just sit there with my eyes closed while my mind wanders. it been about two weeks now and I though I would have a better hold on my wandering mind but it is pretty much the same. However, my anxiety has definitely been down in these two weeks."

1464,A message for myself,"Right off the back there's a problem. I title this a message for myself but is it really? I already know what I know, but I must express what my mind is going through. I am changing in a way I never thought and I'm afraid I will regret it. I am afraid I won't be able to pull myself out of this mental blackhole. One that has grown wider and darker since I first started fighting against it. 

I know that seems vague, so I need to find a way to put it into words that someone else can understand. What I want someone else to understand from this I do not know. Why would I trust someone else with this weakness I am experiencing? Enough of the rambling I must share my thoughts now. Excuse my lack of direction I really don't know where I'm going with this.

Growing up was rough. My entire life does not make sense. I've always had to be the arbiter to resolve everyone's problems, but at the same time I feel like I can't be taken seriously by many people. For what reason I do not know. I've always been a sort of jack of all trades and the kid excited about learning new things and doing everything because I genuinely enjoyed life. I got into literally almost everything. I played sports, made friends, learned instruments, did things. I was normal. I'm average looking. Not too bad actually. Not too self conscious. I'm tough. I've always been able to get through the hard times and there were plenty. 

I don't want to get into specifics, but my family have some major issues that are beyond complicated. Those issues still carry on to this day. I would feel bad for anyone I'd have to give the specifics to because all that information is a colossal burden for the mind to absorb. I'm about to finally move away from my family completely to live alone. I want this. But moving will change nothing between me and them. I still love them and don't have grudges with any of them, but the scenario my family finds itself in is a monumental clusterfuck. The pain and the confusion is still there and I find it easier to just not care or think about it anymore. I owe nothing and am not depended on by anybody, so me walking away from the family issues will not bring consequences to anyone.

Something I've learned about this world a few years ago is that people only care about now. They don't care what you've had or what you will have. They only want to know what you have now. I believed that almost religiously. I still do, but now I feel I may have lost control of myself. I can't make ""now"" happen anymore. Maybe its my ADHD. That or I'm just not even trying to be the pilot anymore. The pilot in my head is asleep and the co-pilot doesn't care. We are beginning to nose dive. That's how it feels. I simply don't have an ability to care anymore. I used to practice self love, but now I can't even imagine that concept. I don't feel anything. Just sort of numb. I can't really speak the way I want to anymore and I think this is a big one that bothers me.

I feel like my face can't make the sentences my mind has made. I don't consider myself antisocial, but I don't think I've put together a sentence longer than 10-15 words in the past few years in person. Only rarely. I don't really talk anymore. I still interact and socialize and get excited for things but it's like somewhere in the pipeline from my brain to my mouth my thoughts choke up on laughing gas or hard liquor or something. The sentences I produce are basic and plain and don't reflect who I really am. It frustrates me but I never show it. I say a lot of captain obvious no brainier shit and people call me out for it and I just don't react. It's because I know. It's like I'm numbed or super relaxed and don't care. I think I'm disassociating.

Another subject. I do all that is asked of me. And all the things I should have been doing. I did chores. I stayed in shape. I went to school everyday. Studied. Figured out what I wanted to do in life. Went to trade school. Worked. Graduated. Built a perfect resume. Got a wide range of skills. No bull shit ever. Good work ethic. Pay my bills and always on time. And it's like I'm not getting anywhere. I used to set a lot of goals for myself. I'd achieve them, but they would never pay off. I feel cheated and like I'm being used. Was working dead end jobs until maybe recently. It too early to tell but there might be a turn around on the job side of things.

I used to want to find someone at some point and raise a family of my own and sort of ""reboot"" my family tree. Not only for that reason, but because I genuinely wanted to raise kids and live a wonderful life with someone I love. I still do. I always believed my purpose in life is to help those around me and those I love to live the best lives I can possibly give them.

I gotta admit something. I'm not ready to die. I am afraid to at this moment and if you were to send an entire army through my front door you'd better believe I was going to fight like hell. Here is how I know that for a fact. I sometimes I get really bad sleep paralysis but not even that phases me anymore. It's when I get night terrors that reach deep into my subconscious and pull out my worst fears and I wake up screaming. I had a really bad dream recently and I died in my dream and I squeeled in my sleep ""I'm not ready to die for real"". There are things I still want to accomplish in this life. But lately I have discovered a secondary optional purpose in my life and I am terrified by it. That is to fight for a cause that would possibly give the world a better future. 

A certain country is in a very interesting point in its history, but it's waiting for people to act. I don't align myself left or right. I love this country, but our current gov. has failed on both sides of the table a long time ago. They aren't here for our best interest and if they are they have a lot of convincing to do. But to stand up to them as a serious threat is the same as suicide. I would die in an effort to give those I love the best possible life I can give them, which fulfills the same purpose as my first option. I don't want that though and I hope the gov can get its shit together. I really really really want to avoid this option for as long as possible and I can't express it enough. I do not want this.

But that can't really be all of it I think. I don't know what I'll achieve by posting. I really don't. It's getting late and I'm tired and I should probably end this here. I needed to get this out for myself. I guess I completed one goal today and to actually acknowledge myself a little. To anyone who sees this. I dont know. Just understand me. Maybe some motivation or some words of advice. I dont know what I need."
1465,confusing parentheses and quotation marks,"I'm not sure if this belongs here, but if not and you know how to redirect me please do. 

I often mistake quotation marks for parentheses. it's not a vision thing I'm pretty sure but when I'm typing something and use parentheses (like this, I use them a lot) I'll accidently make the closing parentheses (idk what the singular word is) a quotation mark instead (like this""

I have no idea why? they're not next to each other on my keyboard and I've done it forever. it's not the only thing I get mixed up, just the biggest example. I've been told (not by professionals) it sounds like dyslexia an that other things I do sound like it, too."

1468,I think I need help,"I am not trying to starve myself!

I have had issues with mental health in the past, but I need help figuring this out. (I don't live in a country with free healthcare)

I am relatively small for my age and height. I'm 90lbs (41kg) and I'm 5'4"" (162.5cm). I don't eat a lot and when I eat about half of a normal meal I feel sick. 

I never really ate a lot in the past and I've always had a relatively small apatite. Sometimes, completely randomly I get dizzy. Other times my legs don't work and I can barely stand. But the thing is I never really feel hungry.

No matter how much I eat, I don't gain weight. I'm not even doing anything to burn calories! 

My friends say I probably have anorexia. Do I? Also how am I supposed to overcome it?"
1469,DAE imagine their life without someone and it makes them extremely down?,"I sometimes imagine my life without my best friend of ten years, and it makes me guilty, and I start telling myself that if they were to up and leave, I would kill myself - like my purpose here is over or something. I wish I can put it into words.."
1470,I hardly sleep anymore I’m so paranoid,"I’m 18F and I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore. I’ve always had depression and anxiety and I’ve gotten to the point where I can handle my general anxiety I’ve always had and my depression. But this is way different and seriously affecting my life. 

For a while now, my paranoia has been kinda rising. I’ve always had to double check my doors were locked, then lock my bedroom door. After that I could usually ignore any noises and was able to go to sleep. I always had bigger, more nagging paranoid thoughts in the back of my head but I could ignore them. 

Now once it starts getting dark, it’s like I shift into guard mode like a caged animal. I usually have to pace because my body just feels so ready for something to happen. A typical night looks like- 

I’ll try to distract myself and stuff until about 9, and sometimes I can fall asleep around then. My body will wake me up around 1-3am and I absolutely can’t sleep again. Lately it’s been 1am or earlier. Once I’m up I obsessively look out the window, pace around my room, and get extremely tense if like a noise is on like the tv where I can’t listen out for sounds. I can usually keep myself in my room for a hour or two but eventually I leave the room and can’t help myself from checking the peephole a million times. The only place I can feel safe is in the bathroom with the door locked because there’s only one entry way to guard. 

I’m not sure what’s going on with me. If anyone has advice or had been thru something like this please help me out. I can’t sleep anymore really and I’m always so tense at night."
1471,Do not worry,do not worry please
1472,Reality feels far away,"I've been feeling very strange lately, like everything's not real. It's not an intrusive thought right now, it just kinda sits in the back of my mind. If I focus too much on it then I start to lose all sense and meaning, like nothing makes sense at all and I forget who I am while still knowing who I am. Reality is still a thing that I feel I'm experiencing but at the same time I feel kinda removed? Not too sure what's happening. Depersonalization? Depression? Psychosis? Derealization?"
1473,Can someone help me get an idea on what this may be? And how to proceed?,"I want to vent a bit - and maybe someone else who has similar issues can give me some solid advice (I'm not exactly in a spot where I can receive good medical help if I wanted to) but ever since I can remember I've had this issue and it's only grown more prominent as I've gotten older. Whenever I get very overstimulated, like for example, I'm under extreme distress, and my mind is running in circles over and over again - and things get more stressful because I'm stressing myself out. It's like my mind completely disassociates with my body and I lose my motor functions. It's embarrassing to talk about, but my body jerks around and fingers twitch, curl, my head feels tight and I'm clenching it enough it gives me a headache. I jerk around and this happens while I have no control and I'm not able to prevent it for a good while. It's miniature episodes that I can't explain and it always happens when I'm overstimulated. Think of it like this - you're overthinking, and you're getting overwhelmed, and as soon as you snap out of it, you realize your body has been jerking around and your head feels insanely tight and hurts. But you didn't know it the whole time, you didn't feel it happening. I just always feel bad discussing this because I'm not someone who does this around others for fear of being judged, but because I'm ashamed of it myself.

Can anybody help give me a clue on what it could be?"
1474,I hope it's not so!,"Im not sure if im a sociopath, vulnerable Narcissist, or something else. My ex psychiatrist before I got banned from the mental health facility ( yes I scared my therapist and started a lot of trouble) told me they were looking at Anti-social Personality Disorder but they didnt diagnose me because they came to the conclusion that they couldnt help me lol. But my mother is a Narcissist. She regularly emotionally, mentally abused and manipulated me growing up. My father was not around by choice. I have been abused a lot. The most important I think was when I was a teenager my older cousin and his friend drove me to a dirt road while out drinking and beat me up numerous times, and tried to rape me, that incident and other people who cruelly abused me in my early adulthood has caused me to be a shell of myself. I cant get close to people, even though I want to and sometimes can get close by pretending to be someone I'm not,(but I dont know who I am) and they eventually see a bad side to me and cut contact or think I'm strange, or crazy. My mom often said when we use to talk(because I cut her off) that it seemed as if I was staring right through her.
    But I dated a bpd last year who landed me in that mental health facility because she brought my own mental health to light. Until then i thought I was just different. My ex hurt me, yes I was hurt! I felt betrayal. I never let someone get so close. It was toxic, and yes I may have verbally, emotionally abused her, and controlled her but I'm a good person at least I think so.. 
   I question if I have aspd because when my bpd ex left me and lied i became sad, isolated, yet enraged by the betrayal, and manipulation. I mean I actually loved her or thought I did I'm not sure if I just wanted something I couldnt have or wanted that control back. But, I tried to destroy her life! Attempted to get her fired from her job by calling her boss and making up lies about affairs. And mind you she was several states away.. I contacted her mom and spread lies and told her mom her deepest secrets lol, I plotted on her, and even sent sex tapes of us to her mom under the guise of her current boyfriend that she left me for. And I dont know if I feel bad about the things that I've done or if I'm trying to make myself feel bad. I love the rush and power of intimidating and maybe hurting someone. But I like kids, and havent hurt any animals. I just want a diagnosis so I can control whatever pushes me to have bad relationships with people, I mean every relationship I've ever had has ended terribly. They start awesome but end bad! I act impulsively, people think I'm manipulative, I purposely antagonize people and put them against each other for my entertainment or to gain power over them. I'm a pathological liar, and im fascinated and impressed by serial killers."

1476,Im losing motivation,"Before quarantine, I was able to gladly workout everyday, play video games on the weekends with my friends/brother, and i was just doing fine. But as I stayed home for so long, my daily routine just gets more and more draining. I wake up insanely late everyday, i always forget about dinner, and i dont really exercise as much as i used to. I just feel like my life is gonna be empty until school comes back. Im getting upset at myself for just playing video games all day everyday and i feel like my body has become so obsolete compared to what it used to be. I had so much confidence in myself, but now i just feel like a lazy sack of crap. What can I do to feel more motivated and have more energy to go through the day?"
1477,Situation,"20 year old male here. Currently in a shit situation. For the last 2-3 years I have been doing nothing but hard work on myself mentally and physically and I still feel like I’m depressed. I exercise everyday eat clean/healthy and basically live like a monk 😂 i at least expected the way I think about myself to change but it hasn’t. I’m lonely sad and depressed for most of the time but I don’t buy into it and try to just push through to the end of the day.  I do most things right and I’m just not sure why I feel like this. I have never had a girlfriend and I have little to no friends or anyone that I’d call a proper friend. I have over 300 matches on tinder and despite being called good looking or attractive it just doesn’t change the way I view or think of myself. All I can think of is the bad things. I always think people are laughing judging me and this makes it hard for me to go out. I’ll literally drive to the shops and back and think people in there car are laughing at me. It’s a shit way to live. I’m just sad, it’s kind of a weird feeling like it hurts but at the same time it doesn’t. It’s kind of like feeling nothingness. Even with all the work I’ve done on myself to change from where I was I’m still in the same kind of boat. I drive a nice car and have an ok job. Don’t have much to do with my family but I don’t really want to. I’m just not sure what else I can do. I can’t keep living this way. It’s no fun, I know life isn’t all fun but this is kind of like torture it’s like dying a slow death literally feels like I’m sinking. I can’t keep faking that I’m ok or good. I think working out eating clean and all the other stuff I’m doing is giving me a fake sort of feeling like everything is allgood when really it isn’t. I haven’t been ok since I was 16-17. I don’t know why but I just can’t be happy it’s not fair to live like this it honestly fucks me up. Another thing is every time I go out and meet people or even just have a conversation with them I always feel like they’re hating on me or they don’t like me. I don’t know why but it’s just the way it is. What can I do? Because right now I don’t feel like living. I’d never kill myself but if the pain gets to much I don’t know what else I can do like what’s the point of doing all these good things to “improve” myself if I’m just going to feel the same at the end of the day. Maybe my expectations are to high."
1478,Intense fear of violent situations/memories ive never lived,"Cw: intense violent thoughts

This happens every once and a while. Ill be lying down on my bed and all of a sudden ill get. Thought like


""No! Please dont put a razor in my eye please!! Just kill me, please!"" 

And ill start sweating. Im imagining the cell walls and the perosn in front of me. Im imagining them kickiing down my door. Im genuinely afraid. But what do I have to be afraid of? Ive never been a POW, im a 20 year old trans guy. 

Or 

""Please dont hit me please!"" 
 And ill be in a house ive never seen with a man angrily puffing up. Im small and afraid. 

The worst ones though, are where I am the monster. 

Is it just an overactice imagination? Why would my brain do this while im trying to sleep?"
1479,I just have this on my mind so I'm saying it somewhere,"I have a tendency to blame other people for my emotions and my mental health has been over the top bad with isolation and everything going on in my country.

Long story short I'm a couple years shy of 30 and was/am(?) getting bullied by a group of people who I've been friends with since my early 20s and I had 2 suicide attempts in a row last week while I was having a manic spike and obviously I failed and I dunno I've had attempts in the past but after this recent time I think it clicked that I shouldn't die because these people are stuck in high school I should just make friends with people that don't gossip. I dunno I kind of feel like less toxic and more self aware? I just wanted to share this somewhere outside of my personal journal so I am."
1480,how do i tell my friend’s parent that i think my friend needs professional help?,"my friend recently moved to another country and their mental health has taken a turn for the worse. they haven’t been able to make friends or click with anyone in their new school and coupled with the crushing homework, i think she keeps relapsing into a depressive state. lately, it’s gotten worse because she keeps saying about how she wants to die and kill herself. i’m really concerned and i reached out to her mom, but i don’t think the mom understands the severity of the situation. her mom just says she’ll bring my friend out to socialise more often, but my friends is past the point of making friends to heal herself. i’m trying to hint at bringing my friend to a therapist/psychologist yet her mom keeps brushing the idea off. what can i do/say to convince her mom that my friend needs real, professional help?"
1481,I don’t know what’s going on with my life,"I don’t know if I have anxiety or depression, but I know dang well that I’m suicidal. I just want help, but I feel like my parents would just think that I’m overreacting. They’re not really open about talking about mental health, they just think everyone’s okay. I’ve gained like 20 pounds, I went from straight A’s to B’s, C’s, and D’s, and I have breakdowns way to often. I don’t know if I’m just being silly, I don’t know if I should privately talk to my doctor or not. Because if my parents find out, they’re just gonna be mad that they need to spend more money on me. I already have medical issues, and that has made me feel like a burden. How do I reach out for help? It seems so simple to call a hotline or something, but I know I can’t do that. But I know that if I don’t get help soon I’m gonna lose control of my life."

The Ballad of Poorman T






Let me tell you about the mockery and cruel ballad that I dance,
About how some people have so much for so little while others don’t have a chance,


Some men have too much and they laugh at others,
Men can’t share their luck with all of their brothers,


You drink bottled water brought in from a spring or a hill,
Mine got shut off and I couldn’t pay the bill,


You eat steak and roast ham,
And I eat beans and canned spam.


You ride in a limousine or have any car that you like,
I hitchhike everywhere, I can’t even afford a new bike,


You spoil your kids with things like Disney and summer camps,
While I barely feed my five kids on welfare and food stamps,


You can afford to eat good food with women like lobster and expensive caviars,
While my girlfriend puts money for ramen when I’m behind bars,


You went to Harvard or the best schools in the state,
I dropped out or finished late.


You can be wholesome and that must be nice,
I can only give my girlfriend nuggets and ice,


You go on escapes to france and Italy,
All I want is to be part of your family,


You are so rich people hate you, it makes you sour,
While I can’t get a job at a McDonalds making 15 an hour,


You’re addressed by titles like doctor, even at home,
I go by many names, but my main one’s Tyrone.


I don’t know why you do it, I don't know why, 
Because no matter how long and hard you think you can try,


You will bust your ass, having a hard life,
while I will fuck your daughter and even your wife.

1485,do bullying memories ever leave you?,"i have been bullied a lot, it sucks. i have developed severe paranoia and anxiety since then and i just dont know what to do, i have an obsession with being ""Strong"" so nobody can hurt me and shit. i hate myself what to do??"
1486,I am tired of living in the past. It's annoying. I have been living with guilt and anxiety and somehow I am not able to get over it. I was fine until I saw that person again.,"It happened last year in October. I met this guy on tinder and he was living in another city. 1½ months of knowing each other he called me to his city. I flew down to meet him. When I reached, I met him nicely and greeted him warmly. He booked a hotel because women aren't allowed in the residence he stayed in. The same night we got drunk while we were having sex, I kinda slapped him for fun (maybe I slapped him hard and I think it's my fault because I should have asked him) and then later, while he was trying to penetrate, I just said you are hurting me and he got up suddenly and said , ""That's it. From the moment you have come here you are only ruining my mood"" I started crying by the way he said it. 

He said ""Wow now you are crying. This means you are messed up"" And I screamed ""What kind of a man are you!"" And it only escalated. Later I said, ""Fine I'll book my flight ticket for tomorrow and leave."" To which he said ""Fine by me"" But I was unable to book. He took his bags and said ""Whatever. You'll get your breakfast tomorrow, I am outta here. "" And at midnight he left me alone in that city, in a place where I didn't know anyone. 

Next morning, with my swollen eyes (because of all the crying), I checked my phone and saw his texts from last night which said ""we will start fresh tomorrow 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗 relax take care"" And I was surprised ""Is it the same person who left me alone in the hotel room?"" Anyway, he came to meet me around 12 and said ""It wouldn't be nice if someone came to meet me and I just left them like that."" I thought of apologizing and said ""Okay... Well I have been meaning to say something from last night and---"" he snapped ""Um no I don't want to talk about last night. Be ready by 4:00 pm we will go outside  with my friends"" I was okay with it. He even promised to have lunch with me but he didn't show up. Anyway, I met his friends and they were really nice. He didn't talk to me properly while we were hanging out with his friends, except for a few couple of times. Anyway, the day ended, I tried my best to show that I am having fun but I was not actually. He stayed the night. 

The next day in the morning he said we will go out in the afternoon and I was happy because I thought ""Yes finally some time together!"" The very same night I had to return back to my city. He went back to his home, got ready and came back, took my bag and kept it in his car while I walked out and locked the room, I saw his friends again. I thought why doesn't he want to spend time with me and sort things out. It was awkward but I was happy to see his friends because they were really nice to me. He took us all to a mall and went to a restaurant. While he was ordering he was pretty rude to the waitress. I asked him there ""So what time will you leave me at the airport?"" He immediately replied ""After you finished eating."" I was shocked. It was 3:00 in the afternoon and my flight was at 10:00 pm at night. I felt my heart sink but I tried my best to not feel bad but it was evident on my face. After an hour, he dropped me to the airport, him and his friends said goodbye and I didn't even look at him properly.

 When I went inside, I couldn't see my flight information anywhere. For 5 hours, I just cried and cried at the airport . I felt awkward, embarrassed and I felt so horrible after the incident. I didn't know what to do. 

Exactly a month later, I saw him post pictures with another girl. He didn't even take a proper picture with me. In fact, he told me to take pictures with his friends. I wasn't jealous but I felt as if whatever happened did not affect him. I looked like a fool over there. It has been 8 months and sometimes that event comes out of nowhere in my mind. I keep thinking  , ""Was it my fault? Did I make a mistake?"" I remind myself everyday that it is all in the past now and I will apologize if I made a mistake. But he never said anything or told me. In fact, he didn't even message me when I reached my city. He called me once after 2 weeks just to tell that he is coming to the city with his friends and invited me to meet him. I had my exams coming up too, did not want to mess up, but I was down to meeting them all again. He came to the city but didn't ask me if I wanted to hang out. 

I mean, I am not able to put it properly here but my confidence has really been shaky after the incident and I just want to forget it. I keep thinking if I made a mistake then I am ready to apologize to him. I am only in touch with 3 of his friends. I saw his picture today on his friend's profile (I unfollowed him a long time ago) and whatever happened just flashed in front of my eyes. 

I feel really horrible. What do I do?"
1487,Bugs.,"I feel them crawling all over me. I see them if I turn on the lights. They nip at me.
I think most of them aren’t even there. The type of bug I’m looking at doesn’t fit the description of anything that’s existing. 
I don’t have a big fear of bugs, but whenever I see these it tips me over the edge into a panic.
I’ve had this every night for almost a week. I’m exhausted. I can’t sleep.
The only way I can feel clean of them is by scratching. Shredding my skin. 
My medication can’t help the feelings caused by this either. I don’t understand why.
I hate them. 
I just want to bash my head into a wall until it goes away."
1488,Looking for withdrawals help and advice,"Hi first time posting here and well asking for help and advice, I've been years of taking on and off celexa and xyprexa, I've gone cold turkey on celexa and xyprexa I no longer take from doctors recomendations,...

Now ok, I'm just super lost and emotional, I feel 100% better off my meds, but hmm I'm having trouble, alot of trouble from confusing what's real and what is not, it's all just pilling on me and I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster and honestly I'm scared, I don't know what's going on with me really, I feel much better without my medication, I think I don't need it anymore but of course takes time and I want to say I feel better and wanna keep pushing without taking my medication, I just feel better, but I am struggling mentally and feel really scared and alone, any help would be appreciated and advice"

I always start out a post well and then it just devolves into this bullshit. This is what's constantly going on in my head. It doesn't make sense. I can't what? Who am I talking to? I don't know. Every time I can't stop thinking about something this happens. I want to curl up into a ball and just stop everything. This is why I can't sleep. I think about anything and it always turns into suicide, hating myself, or existential crisis. No matter what it is it's always existential crisis. And then it's too much. And I just need to stop. I have to stop it. But I can't.

I can't

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Get me out of this stupid fucking brain. But I'm in it. Who am I. I am my brain. So the only way is to die. I want to die. Kill me. FUUUUUUCK

1490,150 Days today without self harming!,It’s been 150 days since I last self harmed and I’m really proud of myself. Thank you for the support here!! 💕
1491,I want to go down,"I'm tired. Of everything. I just want to die but I dont even have the motivation for that. I want to give myself reasons to. I want to make recovery inaccessible. I know recovery's never going to happen, but if the chance is even vaguely there then I'm stuck wasting my time ""trying"" to get there. It feels like I'm letting myself get dragged behind a car justbecause I feel like I can climb back up. It's easier just to let go. it's what I should do. I know myself. I'm not gonna be happy with life. I'm not gonna be happy I kept going. I'll be sitting here in four years asking why I didn't end it when it would've been easier, just like I am now."
1492,"[USA] [UNDER 18] do I have a mental illness, should I get this evaluated, and if so how urgently","I constantly need to double check things like doors, locks, and some others. I have autism, and low severity anxiety. I don't feel the need to clean, be organized or do things along that matter, but I always have a fear of messing something up, no matter what I'm doing. I constantly analyze everything that I do after I do it, or think endlessly about any possible consequence beforehand. Sometimes I feel the need to consult others. I sometimes have thoughts, nothing major but things along the like of ""I want to hit him"" even though I know I would never act I feel the need to apologise in my head or even occasionally out loud, even if that means finding something unrelated to apologise about. All of this feels like it's feeding some urge to make things right socially, and not make mistakes. I keep trying to hide it but I really think I may need help. Any advice?"
1493,I feel like I’m getting dumber and I don’t know why,"Hi I’m only 16 and for a few months now I’ve felt my brain down drop by a lot. It takes me much longer to process things I can’t seem to process simple things still. My thoughts feel foggy. I have trouble concentrating, etc. anyone know why? And what i could do to reverse this please."
1494,What should i do im having extreme fatigue and hallucinations,I dont know what to do help. I dont know what's happening to me it like im in a nightmare.
1495,Dunno what to do honestly...,In Canada.... (Quick aside... I use ellipses a lot... It's not really something I can control.... Sorry...) I... Am in my mid 20's and male... And... To spare anyone from painful details.... I had a bit of a messed up childhood... And have PTSD and extreme social anxiety as a result... And struggle with doing anything day-to-day... I want to seek help but... As far as I know can't afford it... And don't even really know where to look... And the biggest issue... The main cause of my PTSD involves a therapist... And I get panic attacks being near them... I am ready to just give up.... And I hate the people who did this to me.... And want them dead... And I hate myself for feeling that way.... And it feels like a great big circle of anger and rage.....

1497,Is this some form of dissociation?,"Not trying to replace seeing a professional, but just trying to get an idea of what's going on. There are certain moments where I ""black out"" in the sense that my mind loses control of what my body is doing and my body kind of just takes over and I'm not in control of my actions. I have to ""snap out of it"" in order to know what's happening."
1498,Feeling tired at the end of the week.,"Hello, I have been feeling tired at the end of a week,  not just physically but mentally. I have to take a day off to sleep just to recover and feel back to normal. It usually comes with a lack of motivation and a generally bad mood. During our lockdown, I had a burnout and had to take a few days to recover from it. It was my first time experiencing this but I have always been afraid of getting there again. Is this normal or should is this a symptom of a potentially larger burnout like the one I experienced during our lockdown?"
1499,I was violated when I was 9,"When we were kids it turns out my brother was raped by the neighbor boy repeatedly. When our parents divorced I was 8, he was 10, my sister was 3. We moved and never saw that kid again.

We lived with my mom, and our stepfather, yes our mom moved on quick. 

My brother started getting more angrier, more manipulative, made me feel like everything was my fault. The ""games"" we were playing made me feel very uncomfortable. He would push me to roll around naked with him and insisted it was normal. It made me feel uneasy and dirty... He would bring my little sister into it too. He would pull out his penis and make her lick it, made her think it was an innocent game. Please keep in mind, I was 9... He yelled in my face often and he scared me. My sister was 4, he was 11.

This night is the highlight that scars me till this day. My sister was fast asleep. He said he wanted to have sex with me, of course I didn't know what that was. He explained to me he would put it in my rear end. I was repulsed by the thought of it. I kept on saying no, but he started to manipulate me. He told me that no girl would want him in the future if she knew he was a virgin, and it will be my fault he doesn't have a girlfriend. I was a little girl who was heavily into disney. He told me sex makes a girl grow boobs and that prince charming doesn't like girls without boobs. He pushed me so much I was scared and gave in. 

The second he put it in I was squirming, it hurt and I begged him to stop. He did, because he'd wake up my mom if he didn't. He still insisted. He said ""it's less hard, let's try again."" I was hugging my legs and told him no. He then said ""let's not tell mom about this."" 

I spend the next 7 years forced to see his face every single day. He didn't try anything, but his angry and mentally abusive ways didn't change. He managed to convince my mom I was crazy. I walked eggshells around them every single day. My mom and brother had all family and family friends convinced I was a disobedient child. My brother got the amazing grades and all the praise from my mom for the littlest things. Meanwhile, I didn't get praised for the things I did right, it was all looked over. 

When I turned 16, my brother turned 18, and went off to the air force. I cried, at the time I thought it was tears of sadness. I now know they were tears of joy. 

My mom was still mentally abusive once he left. She still found every opportunity to shame me in front of my friends. Talk badly about me to her friends. 

When I turned 18 and started working, I started helping around the house and she's improved drastically.

I'm 20 now, my mom doesn't know. I have a healthy relationship with her now. I hide my mental problems from her. My brother is still in the military. When fights get serious with my boyfriend I use mentally abusive words to my boyfriend like they did to me, then I instantly regret them and feel like dying. We rarely get into fights. He knows about this because I got drunk one night and told him."
1500,The role we have in the psychological condition of others,"Inadvertent repercussions aside, I tend to think a lot of people today (especially those in various forms of wide-reaching media) have a tendency to be ignorant of and, at times, even blatantly intent on inducing psychological issues/phenomena in manners that they know their actions have the potential to bring about. I want to bring this up for the purpose of discussing how this might have an eventual effect on this country's freedom of speech laws. Quite frankly, I think it's quite short-sighted to play around with the minds of others intentionally, especially via media which can easily have consequences that one cannot monitor. The biggest issue with this being that it, like many other psychological issues, has a tendency to run rampant after pushed past a certain threshold. One day it isn't a problem, then progressively someone could end up snowballing into a psychotic break. 

I bring this up because I feel the vast majority of the country is predisposed to having some sort of psychological issue right now during the epidemic. We are all participating in quite irregular lifestyles that are predisposing our minds to turmoil as we are creatures of habit. I'm certain that many groups in society have seen a particular increase in the average amount of media being consumed as well. This unique set of circumstances gives the potential for vast changes to a person's mind and lifestyle, both good and bad. I think it's worth mentioning though, that there are certainly those in the media that seem to not mind (and from my perspective, quite obviously being intentional with) their tendencies of provoking delusional thought. There is a lot of fear mongering going on in the news with very little in the vein of positivity, more television shows than ever have plot lines that are so ""out there"" that the bring about ideations of a reality that will bring one to institutionalization if believed to be real (yes I know these are fictional but when you see it from enough sources, you may start to question if you've been ""lied to"" and begin participating in conspiracy theorizing), and there is a quite real tendency for subliminal association that I personally feel. That last part is up to you to decide on, call me crazy but I see plenty of forms of media subliminally associating things together to create correlation and consequence where THERE ISN'T ANY in the mind of the observer. (That damn Verizon commercial comes to mind, where the lady is talking to her coffee cup and some other object with googly eyes like they have feelings and are her ""best friends"" in a way that isn't even funny).

The problem is, in my mind, when enough half blatant things get done the mind becomes hyper associative and begins thinking EVERYTHING is doing this. Those who are doing this intentionally are not thinking about the long term consequences and are legitimately playing with fire (gaslighting is real and is definitely the descriptor I'd use to describe such things). Give this a few years and you're going to have people having a psychological meltdown because they broke their prized object that they're falsely associating with an irreplaceable person or concept in their life. I know it sounds extreme but the concept spreads over time. Eventually, those afflicted will think that they are somehow afforded supernatural power by owning something, doing some activity, or completing some ritual they've seen results from before. 

I promise, before long it will become everything to people and those not properly armed with the understanding of human psychology and science in general will be participating in psuedo ""magic"" and actually thinking they are making things happen through their actions. It needs to stop. I'd liken it to Pandora's box and the media is spearheading this."
1501,Severe Anxiety for over three years.... man do i need help......," 

Hey Reddit! I am an 18 yo (M) suffering from severe anxiety for almost 3 years now, and almost none of my friends know about it. It has made my life worse, from countless sleepless nights to being unable to concentrate on studies (I am a studious type). The mind being always occupied with negative thoughts is not a very good thing. So here is where it all started.

So, when I was about 2 months old, I caught Bronchitis from a hospital that I went to for a regular check-up. The condition worsened, and I was shifted to a main hospital on oxygen, where for two days it wasn't sure if i would make it. Well, as you guessed, I did make it, but with a very hefty (literally) price…. I was kept on a lot of steroids. One of its delayed effects- as told by the doctors at that time- was gaining a lot of weight.

Fast forward to 2017, I was an overweight boy…… But, as per the doctors said, it was finally starting to go away - much of the extra weight I had. I was quite active - going for walk/running in the mornings, training and playing basketball in the scholl, and usually badminton in the evening. But then, I accidentally broke my ankle, which resulted in a 6-week bed rest, during which I gained quite some weight. It was during vacations at school, and I am really thankful to a very close friend of mine, who literally daily came to my house to have some time with me, and we built a lot of science projects….. When those 6 weeks were over, I thought everything was going to be normal now…….. I was wrong.

When I got gradually back to my active life, my body started hurting, starting with my arms (which is quite normal as the muscles get relaxed during the whole bed rest thing, didn't realise at that time). I googled my symptoms - “Pain in arms” - and what comes up - “Heart attack” and other issues. I feared the worst and over a course of a few days, I had developed anxiety that something is wrong with my heart.  

I had my first panic attack a few weeks later, and I was presenting the symptoms that I had read online about heart attacks, but didn’t look that serious - so my parents called my primary care doctor - who called us to his house (abt a 100-150 m away from our home at the time), and he sent us to the hospital (Govt hospitals are not really a good option unless you know someone there). My EKG is done and surprise, it's a normal one. The next time it happened, he went with us, and faxed the EKG to a specialist - and again, it's very normal. Both times, I was sent home with antidepressants…….. (They did do some additional tests and they were all normal). The third time I got there, (this time with my close friend with us), and my SPO2 level was around 89%, and I was given oxygen therapy. The cycle happened a few times again, and my doctor knew that it was anxiety. He suggested that for my satisfaction, we do an echo cardiogram, and the next day we went to a bigger hospital for that. My Echo is done and what does the doctor tell me - that my heart is actually stronger than average……… This did help my anxiety a bit, but the overthinking and stuff still continued to grow bigger and bigger inside my head. Almost none of my friends knew about it, and I think that made it worse. (Being bullied for being fat really doesn't help anxiety, but it kinda worsens it…..)

Now, in 2020, all that build up came crashing down - as many people experience anxiety over the whole covid situation. I had to go to the hospital the other day- as i was having difficulty breathing. I was nebulised, and al was normal. But, if anything happens to my body - eg. My arms are hurting nowadays as i started to try to lose weight again, and my brain quickly overthinks about the situation. Think about all this all day long- and lack of a very good social life just adds to it, i guess. If you guys have any questions or suggestions on what i should do (I Literally don't know what to do at this point - I do need some support though).................. I want to just go back to normal life…..

Lesson to be learnt - NEVER GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS (Its known as cyberchondria)"
1502,An improvement,"Last October I started going to a psychiatrist, after a whole 2 years of cancelation. My mom offered to take me to a psychiatrist, ever since my dad found me with a slit in my wrist (which was 2 years ago). 

Afterwards I was diagnosed with severe depression with psychotic tendendies.  My depression was it's peak ever since. I would continuously self harm, regularly plan my suicide, eat once a day (there are days I won't eat at all), sleep a whole day or doesn't sleep at all. My psychiatrist even offered to have me confined but I refuse since school means a lot to me.  

Then I noticed on late March my period came again, when I just had it, but the next month when the week usually my period usually starts, my period didn't came, and by the end of the month I have my menstruation started again. Then I realized my period starts way too early. I searched it up and I learned since my eating habits and sleeping habits are too unhealthy, it started affecting my menstruation. Not only my mental health, is at it's worst but so is my physical health. I lost a lot of weight and I would often get headaches.

But then the pandemic started, school was moved online. School became less stressful due to it's flexible hours and it soon ended. I started eating twice a day but my sleeping hours is still frenzy.

 Soon I started eating regularly and my sleeping hours is stable. Then the end of the month came and to my surprise my period didn't came. I speculated since my habits are now normal, my menstruation would be too. Then the middle of the month came and HOORAY! my period is back to normal. 

I still have suicidal tendencies and would occasionally cry myself to sleep. But I am happy my physical health is back to normal."

1504,Does anybody else have poor impulse control?,"I feel like I'm kind of impulsive. I've been trying really really hard for years to be more level and thoughtful in what I do before I do it. I've gotten much much better at it but I still find myself coming up with random ideas sometimes. Or thinking I want something immediately. I'll think of something and then instantly want to do it. No, it can't wait until tomorrow or next week

It's really annoying. My family has a history of intergenerational substance abuse and some have mental illness so I wonder if it is hereditary. I want to be stable forever!"
1505,I just had a very strange experience and I’m not quite sure how to interpret it,"I’m not sure if this fits here and if not, I’ll just delete this and apologize for wasting everyone’s time. Just 15 minutes ago I felt something very strange come over me. It was 5:00 AM and I couldn’t get to sleep. Very suddenly I had this odd compulsion to leave the house without giving any notice to anyone I live with (something highly unusual for me, I’d usually leave a note or a text and I wouldn’t leave at 5 in the morning in the first place). It was a strange dreamlike state, I was basically on autopilot. I quickly got dressed, put on a face mask, grabbed my keys and wallet and the compulsion to leave was getting stronger. As quickly as it came, it left and now I’m not sure how to interpret it. 

What concerns me is that I have a long history of suicidal ideation and my plan a year ago was to leave my house and go out of state to commit suicide. Since that’s obviously not feasible (or particularly intelligent) now I’m wondering if it’s just the result of cabin fever and basically being stuck in my house for months. I don’t have any hope for my future and am extremely lonely really so I don’t know if that’s linked to it at all. Maybe this has all made me more impulsive than is usual for me.

All I know is that my overall mental health has declined and that I’ve never had such a peculiar experience before. I hope I never have it again. Maybe I’m just being ridiculous and neurotic like usual but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading"
1506,Today I kicked my low mood’s ass,"I just worked out, cleaned my room, showered and put on comfy clothes. I feel badass because it was only days ago where I could barely move out of bed.

I’ve been experiencing such impulses and I’ve been so confused of why they happen and wether someone else experiences them as well. If you what do you do ? And please educate me about it? Thank you"

1511,Why does it feel like I have to charge headlong into something to actually start it?,"People ask me why I can't do anything normally. Since I'm a bit lazy and an anxious person, it feels like I can't ease into something because the resistance from myself is so strong. It feels like everything I go to do towers over me like Everest and I just have to close my eyes, battle cry, and run with all my might into whatever it is I'm doing.

When I try to ease into something, I stumble, take steps back, teeter back and forward, and usually waste all of my time trying to get around to it. It's exausting having to push myself so hard to go do my homework or to start a skill or whatever.

Do you guys have any advice for me on this? 
Thanks!"
1512,Anybody willing to talk?,If anybody's PM's are open tell me cause I'd like to talk about my state of mind.
1513,I keep getting different diagnosis from different mental health professionals whose therapy and meds don't work on me,"First psychologist (at age 15) thought I had MDD. Therapy wasn't working so she sent me to my first psychiatrist (at age 16) who said I had MDD, an anxiety disorder, a PD and an ED, but he wasn't sure which specific disorders I had out of each of those three groups. He prescribed me some antidepressant (I can't remember its name) which I took for 1-2 weeks only due to severe side effects, and quit therapy.

Fast forward a few years, 23-year-old me was still having lots of issues so I went to a neuropsychologist who after a bunch of tests said I met the criteria for ADHD (ADD - Inattentive Type) but would require more sessions to rule out anxiety disorders in order to give an official ADHD diagnosis. I got scared and didn't go back.

A couple of months later though I was still doing badly and went to a second psychologist who informally diagnosed me with GAD, MDD, Mixed PD (A-C) and potential ADHD, BDD and an ED (unspecified).

His therapy didn't work on me so I switched to a third psychologist (at age 24) who told me labels don't matter and wouldn't officially diagnose me but implied I had PTSD and sent me to a second psychiatrist whose opinion was that I had SAD and prescribed me Klonopin and Prozac.

The first worked in reducing my anxiety for a few hours after taking it but it is too dangerous to take daily due to its addictive nature so it's useless, and the second one reduced my anxiety very minimally only and I had crazy dreams and fatigue as side effects so I quit cold turkey after about 3 months.

I got so frustrated that ended up switching to a fourth psychologist, the last one I am currently seeing, who yesterday (at age 25) officially diagnosed me with ""Adjustment Disorder mixed chronic"" and BED, ruling out everything else as just me having ""schizoid traits"" and ""adhd symptoms stemming from anxiety"".

So in 10 years I have gone to 3 psychologists, 2 psychiatrists and 1 neuropsychologist. Tried 3 different meds. And yet none of them can agree on a diagnosis nor make therapy nor medication work for me.

In the meantime I am still to this day dealing with chronic insomnia, fatigue, recurrent anxiety and panic attacks, difficulty concentrating and having my head in the clouds too often, forgetting or losing things almost daily, having no social life, overeating on a diet due to lack of self-control, workaholism, dissociation, suicidal ideation and so much more, and not to mention the impact everything has on work, university, family, etc.

Honestly at this point I think all those so-called mental health professionals have no idea what's wrong with me but something is and their therapy and meds aren't working. I am losing hope that I'll ever find out what exactly is wrong with me and what I can do to get cured or at least to get better. 

Talk therapy is pointless by now and I can't just try out all the meds out there until I find one that works without side effects because I have a job I love and I can't go on sick leave for 1 to 3 months for each new medication I try.

Please can somebody advise me on what I should do going forward? I don't trust the mental health system anymore, I've wasted so much money to get nothing out of it, but as years go by I only seem to get worse. Is there someone in this world who can actually tell me what I suffer from and what specific medication I need to be a fucking normal person?"
1514,Borderline Personality disorder,"My doc said I have bpd and it makes sense to me. My fear of being alone, my inability to have a healthy relationship. I dont want to be a walking drugged up zombie. Does anyone else have BPD?"
1515,Declining mental ability and health,I miss those days when I was better than now. I never cared about what people say/think about me then. Idk what's going wrong. I just feel extreme low.
1516,Dry month,"Tonight I decided July is going to be a dry month for me. I don't like the way I'm using drugs lately, or maybe always. It's no longer about the people and connections, it just becomes me and the drug(s). 

I'm trying to figure out the best way to hold myself to this, whatever little reminder would help. Something as simple as a phone background or calendar reminders come to mind. I would love to hear some suggestions, and thank you I appreciate you.."
1517,I'm not sure what's happening anymore,"DISCLAIMER: this might be a little messy and very long but I have nowhere else to vent

So, to set the scene, I'm (21M) severely depressed and anxious and it's seriously bringing me down to some extreme lows. I can hardly enjoy things anymore, and if I do, that feeling of joy only lasts a few days. I am always expecting that drop in my mood to return. I should also mention that I may have ADHD and from time to time I contemplate suicide and whether anything really matters at all.

I am deeply passionate about music. Everything about it makes me happy yet equally as frustrated (that's how you know you're passionate, right?). 
I have been playing drums for 8 years and can also play guitar and bass. Been in multiple different bands over the years and am grateful for the people I've worked with. Currently in a serious band that's hanging to gig once COVID settles.

ANYWAY

I've had a pretty rough life to be honest. There's definitely people out there who have it much much worse than I and I feel for them, but for me to ignore my own issues is absurd. 

Depression and anxiety runs through my family, it caused my own mother to attempt suicide when i was only 16, and my gran has also attempted as they had been transitioning from male to female. 
My dad is just as depressed as that was his father who was not exactly much of a father figure for him, as well as being in early retirement/being diagnosed autistic fairly late in his life. 
When I was 12 years old I was assaulted by my uncle as he was trying to push my mother down the stairs in midst of an extreme argument. That's kind of where the problems started. Always had anger issues but they've just gotten worse and worse over the years.
And then there's my sister who I fear the worst for. She's physically disabled, has epilepsy and possible ADHD or ASD. So, dark thoughts and whatnot are kind of a reoccuring theme in my family.

Back to me.

All my life I've struggled to fit in, I still don't really know who I am. I've attended many different schools as a kid, all in different areas. My family doesn't come from money so moving around was what we had to do. 
I've had lots of different friends over the years but in the end I always tend to see through their bullshit and get sick of them, or come to conclusion that we aren't meant to be friends. Relationships have also been the same, as they always are.

Recently, I've also dealt with the breakup of a 2 year relationship  that I ended over a year ago, and ever since then I've been feeling lost and can't seem to fit in. 
I have friends here and there, some at work, some outside of work. But one the problem is that I don't really have a group to hang out with, I don't really have people I talk to every single day. Most of the time I'm just alone. I only recently realised I've actually been bullied and segregated in my current friend group and it fucking hurts. I've even brought it up with them but they just turn the blind eye. Some friends, hey?

Anyway, work is also becoming a problem. I find every day I come in, everything seems to be against me, everything triggers the start of a meltdown for me. I can hardly talk to my coworkers without thinking they hate me or don't like me as much as they like other coworkers. I feel like a constant fuck up. Every single day. 
I recently voluntarily took two weeks off from work to focus on myself and try to feel a bit better. I had to work the night of my 21st birthday (May, literally in the middle of iso), worked 4-8:30pm, only woke up like a few hours before to open gifts and get ready for work. Then had to work the following morning 6:30-2 but ended up having a meltdown when I was trying to tell a coworker I'll be having time off. I cried man. I fought it so hard, I tried not to cry in a place i feel so vulnerable, but it happened. I felt a little better as he was understanding and told me it's best I take time off. Left work an hour early thankfully. 

Now I'm usually one to express my feelings, I cry, not ashamed to. I wear my heart on my sleeve but lately it's been hard to release those feelings at home, somehow it's been easier to cry at work?? Either way, I hopped in the shower when I got home and started fucking bawling. 
So much to the point i was physically aching. 
On my fucking 21st birthday. 
A day that's meant to be special for most of us, was honestly the worst fucking day of my life and I won't forget it. 

Those two weeks helped, but the second week was a bit empty and anxiety set back in.
The first week I practised drums every single day and i was really proud of myself for doing so. I was really productive. But again, I'm back to square one and I'm making everything worse for myself. I struggle to talk to girls I like, I overthink everything about it. I can't live in the fucking moment anymore man. I'm sick of it. I want help but I can't yet sort it out until things settle down. 
Everything feels like it's caving in on me, I feel hopeless, I feel worthless, and I feel like some days it's better I didn't exist at all. I can hardly sleep at night, I've tried so many different ways to relive the depression/anxiety but it keeps coming back the same way.  I want to run away and hide, yet, I keep going. The same thing every single day. 

I don't know if any of this will make sense or be easy to understand. But at this point in time I just wanna vent.

1518,Sister was raped on way home from school 13 years ago.. has always had addiction too something.. now it is ICE.,"Bear with me.. this is a long one. TL:DR at bottom. 

My sister an indigenous Australian was raped at 13 on her way home from school. Since then her life has been turned upside down. She started drinking, dating guys that were abusive. Gambling. Smoking weed. She had my nephew when she was 19 with an abusive man. My Nanna has always been closer to her than my mother. My sister has a lot of anger and mental health issues which are borderline personality disorder we feel. She seen a psychologist for a few years but found it didn't help. She has always been addicted to something. It is currently ICE. She was living with my Nanna and her son in a house and was meant to look after my Nanna as she got older but due to her addictions and coming down she would lose her mind and go off leading my nephew and Nanna to be scared and no longer wanting to stay there. They are now living with my mum, brother &amp; step dad. My sister is banned from my mums house so is currently off down the other end of the state with cousins drinking and doing drugs. She loses her mind very often. She promised she would be going to rehab to get help but she just wants more money to get back from where she is to where my family is about a 19hr drive. She threatened to kill my mum and Nanna to take her son back. She thinks she doesn't get rights to see him but even when she lived with him she didn't take responsibility because my Nanna was doing all of the parenting. She felt like she never got much of a choice in raising him and being his mother but that's because she would up and leave for weeks on end and be out of the picture. My nephew is currently seeing a child psychologist as he is suffering from anxiety constantly worrying about my sister and my Nanna and if my sister would be there when he gets home from school. How can we support her? We have tried encouraging her to go to rehab. We have given her so much money which is spent on drugs and alcohol. She tries to use her son as a bargaining chip knowing that we are worried if she takes him what will happen to him to be able to get what she wants. She'll go from saying she wants to take him away from the evilness/satan (Nanna and mother). I do feel like she has blamed my Nanna and mum for so much that happened. I never knew she was raped until 3 years after the fact where I lost my temper and begged to know why she was treated differently and then she yelled at me and told me. I love her and we all do but we don't know how else to support her. She threatens to kill herself at times. We are worried about calling the police on her as we don't currently know where she is exactly and we worry about her being an indigenous woman being treated by the police. There's so much more but I know this is long enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: sister has mental health issues developed from being raped at 13. Has used addiction to cope. Wont get help. Wants her child and threatens to kill herself."
1519,Can you be suicidal but NOT want to die?,"I’m depressed and I self harm, but I don’t want to die. I’m scared to die and I have been happy in the past and I believe that one day (hopefully soon) I’m going to feel better again. 

But at the same time, lately I’ve caught myself thinking/tricking myself into believing that I want to die.

Today I saw my grandmother and haven’t hugged her for a while because of COVID but I did today because I thought “well, soon I’ll be gone so I should hug her one last time”

I was sitting talking to some friends and felt really sad suddenly today because I “realised” that I’ll “probably never see them again” 
Holding my friend’s baby ... “he’ll never know me” 

And I’ve been having intrusive thoughts whenever I’m near anything that could be a suicide strategy - steep cliff, long rope, medications, sharp objects, train, fast traffic. “You should ...”, “you could...”, “why don’t you...”.

I know that I don’t want to die. But I’m scared of the thoughts I’m having and I’m scared I’ll lose control and do something.

I also don’t want to hurt myself, but I do anyway because I can’t control myself. Cutting - (recently started again after not doing it for 10+ years) 

I’m seeking help but everything takes time and I’m scared that things are getting worse."
1520,My girlfriend with and eating disorder refuses to go to therapy,"We've been together (long distance) for almost 2 years. During these two years there have been period of time when she went to therapy regularly. For instance, she had online therapy once a week for a little over a month during quarantine. 

Now she has stopped going (she hasn't gone in like 5-6 weeks). A few times she has said that she was gonna go. For instance, she said a few days ago that she unfortunately can't afford it ATM. I told her I could pay for it until she gets her job back and sent her enough money for at least one session. She said that she would go and booked a session.

But, when the day came (yesterday) she cancelled the session and sent my money back. Now she says that she doesn't want to go and won't go there anymore.

This is so frustrating. She NEEDS help. Her disorder is serious, and she has a lot of physical symtoms as well. Sometimes she has said she's gonna go, but she always cancels it in the end. She refuses to get help. I have tried convincing and/or motivating her into going seeing her therapist again, but it seems like my efforts are useless.

How should I deal with this? My attempts to make her go doesn't seem to be worthing, but it's so frustrating to just watch someone you love slowly self-destroy. 

I think her mother could play a role in this: She most likely has an eating disorder herself and tells my girlfriend all the time that she's fat, has a disgusting body and needs to lose more weight. My girlfriend believes her very easily. 

So... ""Forcing"" her to go isn't possible. What else can I do???"
1521,I feel so alone.,"I have friends, really close ones whom I’m so grateful for. But right now, I just feel like no one really cares. I’m never the first person people go to. I’m never the one that people love and like. Maybe if I stop talking to people they wouldn’t even care. 

I don’t even want to talk to anyone anymore. I get so easily affected when people don’t reply or seem to reply in a way that make me think they are angry or something. I get so easily affected every time I check my phone for notifications and there are zero. I don’t even want to check my phone anymore because I just get so disappointed each time. 

I know it’s not right to think this way. That I shouldn’t value myself based on how many people are talking to me. But when there isn’t even a single person who seem to care... I just can’t help feeling like a loser."
1522,"My mom is struggling with quarantine, what can I do","My mom has been very stressed lately with the lack of routine quarantine has brought, I know that for my country at least things are going to start easing up towards the end of the month but I still want to help her if I can.

She feels extreme anxiety during this time due to grandparents being weak, and she is a worrier normally too. But also it is with having nothing to do such as visiting or work that is getting to her.

Any ideas of what I can do?"
1523,The loneliness we do NOT talk about,[removed]
1524,I feel like I'm going crazy,"I know it's an age old saying, and I also feel like I understand that people who are rational can understand times where their mind is going askew and makes them think in different ways which is why people may use the phrase ""am I crazy?"". But I genuinely am finding that I'm questioning myself in regards to this everyday. I'm not even sure how I feel anymore. I just feel low, I feel undermined, undervalued, under appreciated - I feel so below mediocre. I've been through some really rough times in my life, but for the first time actually nothing really horrible is happening, so why do I feel like this?

Previously I've had divorces, family deaths, family shootings, suicides and drugs involved in my family which felt like an explanation and source for any negativity or depression. I got away from that and made a life for myself. However I feel like I've hit a pit (mentally) far lower than I had when going through the rough times.

I find that my thinking doesn't end up being as rational as I think it is in my head and I infact have been questioning whether my thought processes are crazy. I've always found myself thinking about things that are not good - for example, thoughts of cheating on my partner or even thinking about if I was dead."
1525,Coworker just quit... 😢,"Upset is an understatement right now😩 She decided to quit because our manager is a massive c*nt to staff it seems. 2 people have already left out of about 5 that have been there and the assistant manager has just been laid off because of the whole corona thing. Even though it’s breaks my heart that she’s gone I’m happy for her if that’s what she feels best, she’s done a lot of things for me and deserves so much more respect than what she’s been given by him. But the thing is, I actually had a gut feeling last night and this morning that she might leave 😭 there’s only 3 of us working there now and it’s just not gonna be the same anymore. I love the days that we were on shift together and it made me wanna carry on working because I could look forward to them days. Now that’s gone 😔 the only person left that I actually enjoy working with is in fact the girl I like (have a crush on) but we don’t get put on shift together as much so I don’t see her to often. I’m hoping she doesn’t leave either that would just be the end for me, really the only reason I carry on working there is because of the amazing coworkers I “have” not many anymore a part from one. Sorry for the rant I’m just very down right now, I’m hoping she’s ok though 🙏❤️ I just don’t understand why my manager is like this, he’s perfectly fine with me but I feel he picks on certain people to talk to and treat them like shit. That’s where I’m in a sticky situation because he’s not done me any wrong but he’s made my coworker who I consider a good friends of mine now feel the need to quit 😡 so I’m obviously gonna side with her as much as I hate picking sides I care about her a lot and I’ve seen first hand how he speaks to her so yeah."
1526,Urgent Help - Lockdown,"I am living in India and my parents want to take me to a wedding in a few days. 

We all already know what's going on with COVID-19 but they're suddenly acting blatantly ignorant because it's a ""close"" wedding. 

The place where the wedding is a red zone. I told my parents that no matter what they do, I will not go as I care for my life and they can do what they want to do as they're grown adults. 

I'm 17 years old and I'm ready to do anything to prevent them for going. I also have a 3 year old brother for whom I feel it's unfair to go in such danger when he can't make his own decisions. 

The thought of even killing myself so they don't go crossed my mind. 

I am so lost.  Please give me a way to stop any of us from going.

1528,I feel lost with who I am,"Hi reddit,
Before I start I want to say this is my first post, and I already knew little about reddit so i certainly know less about how to use it, so I apologize if I somehow posted this on the wrong “subreddit” or even somehow type this wrong. 

Anyways, I need help explaining these emotions i’m feeling right now. Bare with me because it sounds so edgy and weird(at least to me)and I don’t even know what it is that i’m experiencing. 

Basically, I feel like i’m some sort of antichrist or that I was made to be an example of an “evil” person and then go to hell......this sounds so stupid when I read it so let me explain. I don’t feel like i’m the antichrist in the sense that I am the pure definition of evil itself and will cause the end of the world, but more so in the sense that I bring out the worst in everyone and everything. Everything I have had a passion for has been ruined somehow, and I can’t help but feel it’s my fault. As if it got ruined because I started liking it and I carry some kind of bad luck around me and it spreads to everything I love; and that if I just stay away from most people or hobbies then they simply won’t be ruined. And I feel that I was never meant to be a good person and live a long life, that I was just meant to ruin things and then die for hell. I’m not even sure if i’m explaining this in the way that I truly feel, because I don’t even know what this all is. It confuses me as well, because as a child, I always thought of myself as some irrelevant background character or npc, that was just meant to live a simple life and pass normally. God, I don’t even know when these feelings of me being some sort of evil entity even started. Is this even something psychological? Am I just weird? I don’t want to have these kinds of feelings but I can’t help it. Like my supposed-to-be real self just goes on airplane mode and then i experience these weird antichrist emotions. I’m too embarrassed to even proof read this. I’m sorry for rambling, I just don’t know what’s happening and it’s scaring me. I feel like i’m losing myself. I’m sorry"
1529,I don't like eating when other people can look at me.,"I know it's a weird title, but it's something I've noticed that makes me irrationally uncomfortable. I've began to delay my meals or even skipping them, just because I don't want to sit down at a table with my family.

Its not normal and I know that. Just been wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar or knows what it's about? 

(Also feel like I should clarify my family is not mentally or physically abusive.)"
1530,Does anyone find that breaking habbits like picking nose helps with their mental health?,I know its weird but more people pick nose than you might think lol
1531,Can somebody tell me what this is?,"Hi,
I obsess over certain people. I can get sad, suicidal, depressed etc. over them. I think about them all the time and can’t stop. It’s exactly like a FP in BPD. I don’t show other signs of BPD though. I only fear abandonment from that particular person. I have no idea what this could be. It really fucks me up.... Can somebody please suggest what it could be?"
1532,My mum is breaking me,"I (13 F) have been struggling with anxiety, depression and panic disorder for as long as I can remember but only now is it getting diagnosed. My mum constantly puts me down. I can hardly do anything anymore. It's takes me hours to get out of bed and I am no longer hungry. My mum constantly goes on at me until I do it. If its late and I just can't wash up she just starts yelling at me. I understand I need to do chores but I already tidy my room daily, clean kitchen floors daily, clean sinks daily, wipe kitchen and living room surfaces daily. I haven't been in school this week because of my depression. I have been in therapy for about 2 years and it really helps but my mum just makes me feel awful about everything I do. She said that I was a horrible friend for pretending to be happy when I wasn't. She has said she would rather not be in this family. I love my dad but he just doesn't see how she is a bad mum. My mum always treats me better when he is there. My aunt (mum's sister) listens and helps me. She has been bribing me to do exercise. I have been doing exercise in my rooms rather than in the summer house. Today she started saying that I was breaking the spirit of the challenge that my aunt set me by doing it in my room. Even though there is no rule that I can't do it in my room. I think about killing myself all the time and am considering that as my route out because I can't go live with my aunt. She lived in a very nice apartment but it is quite small and only has one bedroom. I do sometimes self harm and my mum just looks at the bruises and says that there is no achievement by doing it and therefore what's the point. I say I don't feel up to doing something (my therapist has told her not to push me) she starts saying that I can't do anything at all. Including stuff with my dad. She just doesn't get me. Everything I achieve or like gets made fun of at some point. I need to get away from her but I can't. After she has upset me she just acts like nothing has happened. Am I just being a drama queen? My dad says my sister would stick up for me but when her best friend bullied me and told me to go kill myself she didn't care and just carried on being friends with her. I just feel so alone and nothing matters anymore. I do well at school but am bullied. And my sisters best friend are coming to my school in September. My sister and her friend are 11."
1533,Slowly getting better. And healthier. Thank you redditors for the support.,"I have been struggling with depression for a few years now. The past 2 months since the quarantine have been a lifesaver.
I am slowly getting better. Started eating better, sleeping better, showering every day. I know it sounds silly, but those were big steps for me. Singing along to songs was something I rediscovered again too 
Also bought myself a new bicycle and getting back to a healthier lifestyle.
Just wanted to say thank you to all the kind strangers here on reddit (new to this sub but the other subs helped too) for pushing us strangers along the way. r/cico and r/intermittentfasting were also a great help. I still have a long way to go, but these steps feel amazing right now. 
And also offering my support here if anyone needs a shoulder or an ear."
1534,Telling Other People About What You've Been Through,"Hi. I hope everyone is safe and healthy. :)

So has anyone in this sub been to a behavioral hospital for self harm or attempted suicide and recovered? I was wondering, when and how did you know you were ready to tell close people about it and who? Like, how long did you wait, what were the determining factors for telling someone, was it too soon, was it a mistake to share it with a certain person?

Sorry for asking so many questions... I am kind of in that phase and I have been a lot better since my medication and I feel like I'm ready to share but it's only been a few months. Kind of going over the pros and cons. Let me know if there's a few of you out there who have been in similar positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. I hope you are all well. :)"
1535,UK - MH services,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to start working on a project to develop a model of nursing that better suits the needs of service users. I am in the process of recieving my medical files and  I am going to compare the professional viewpoint to my own (I kept very detailed diaries and these will be used to demonstrate the perspective of the service user).
I was just wondering if anyone had anything they felt needs to be changed, or if anyone would consider sharing their diary entries or experiences of UK MH services. 
PLEASE NOTE: This is going to be a longgggg project (years) and this is very early days so don't expect any speedy results. Also, this is not acedemic research at this stage, this is more about gathering information for where there is room for improvement and if it would be a worthwhile acedemic venture in the future."
1536,how to deal with anger,"since the beginning of my childhood up until now, i always remember feeling irritable and easily getting angry. i usually bottle it up because otherwise i would explode. it has only gotten worse (probably due to me bottling it up). how should i react when situations irritate me a lot and how do i release all the bottled up anger?"

1538,Not recognizing your younger self?,Like looking at childhood photos and not seeing yourself. Like it's a whole other person. Does anyone have experience with this? Thanks!
1539,Got triggered or something,"I (15f) was at my aunt's from Monday to wednesday and it was actually pretty fun. The bad thing is my aunt talked me into going to a hairdresser even though I didn't want to (also always made comments like 'your hair is just boring', 'short hair fits you more', 'you'll look better after'). 

My hair turned out great (she still made comments like 'they could've cut more hair' and always said how boring my hair looked before), but while I sat in the chair and they cut my hair just had the feeling of not being in control and I felt so empty. Up

That kinda triggered me and now I have to deal with suicidal thoughts and the want to selfharm again, but my therapist is on vacation for the next week.

And if I tell her about it I probably have to go to the hospital for a few days again, but I don't want to because I'll be as a 'crisis' there and the room just makes me feel like there's really something wrong with me, I'm homesick and can't really do anything so the days just stretch out.

I'm sorry if this is weird to read, English isn't my first language"

1541,How 2 Lonely,"I’m 30 I have no friends. I haven’t “dated” in maybe five years, if you would even consider what my dating life was like was “dating”. 

I can’t seem to get other people to care for me. It’s something I’ve always struggled with and I just always feel so incredibly lonely. I completely realize too that it’s something wrong with me and not everyone else’s problem with me. I just don’t know how to fix it. 

It’s not that people dislike me, they just don’t ~like~ me. I want to have a bestie to text and to talk to. Someone to get me a birthday gift (someone to celebrate my birthday with me even lol).  

I would absolutely love to date someone too, but I think maybe I should take baby steps and maybe figure out how to make friends first. I’m not ready to date anyone anytime soon, I’m just ready to not be lonely. 

I just see everyone doing all these things all the time so naturally and so easily. I feel so left out of like... being a person. I just need to find someone who I can talk to and who cares about me like I care about them.  I do care about a lot of people. I might be socially awkward and unattractive, but I still care about the other people in my life. Even if they don’t give me their friendship. 

Again, I totally and completely comprehend that there’s someone wrong with me and people not liking me and not there’s something wrong with other people not liking me."
1542,"Does anyone else deal with all forms of ""rejection"" with complete self-isolation?","Whenever I feel rejected in any way, I completely shut down. I'm not really talking about romantically because I'm in a long term relationship. More so with friends or just people in general. If I feel like I'm being annoying/unlikable or if I think someone is showing me that I am (like not answering a text or slightly ignoring me) I assume that they dont like me at all and I'm a burden. I just shut down and isolate. Last year I deleted a form of social media that I primarily used to communicate with my closest friends because I felt like I was always messaging them and they didn't care as much or communicate a lot. If someone tries to reach out to me after I do this I'll assume they feel bad for me and just sabotage the relationship. I've never fully ruined a relationship doing this but I feel crazy. I just feel like no one truly likes me and everyone pretends to. 

Sorry that this was so ranty and long winded. Just reflecting on this and wondering if I'm the only one."
1543,Do I have anxiety or is this just my personality?,"I've always been an anxious person. I was really shy as a kid, until I turned 18 or so, to the point where I was too scared to make friends or go to parties, it was very isolating. The ironic thing is, during stressful times I cope pretty well and feel less anxious, like during school/college exams or even the start of the pandemic, compared to other people I was way more relaxed. Now I'm in lockdown for over 3 months, unemployed and with no college work and just my family and boyfriend for company and my anxiety is so much worse. 

In the last 2 months while in lockdown, my anxiety has gotten worse and worse. Just today I started crying cos I was so sure I had skin cancer because I panicked over a mole that I was BORN with that my parents got checked a few times and it was clearly benign and hasn't changed at all. I was Googling and Googling about moles and I couldn't relax. A few nights ago I heard a funny noise and panicked it meant I was schizophrenic and I freaked out too. I manage to calm down for a few hours and my brain immediately panics about something else, usually something I had already ""sorted"" months ago. I obsessively look for any sign my amazing boyfriend of almost 2 years is bad/ a creep, when there are none. It's stupid things like ""oh he thought I was attractive in a picture from when I was 16, guess he's  a pedo"" (bare in mind we're 20 and I pretty much look exactly the same) or ""oh he didn't react as strongly to a celebrity sexual assault allegation as me, I guess he doesn't like women"" (simply because he didn't like a few things I retweeted about sexual assault, it was so irrational and stupid of me). 

Only 2 weeks ago, he muttered something like ""can't wait to propose to you in 4 years"" when he usually says 3/4 years and I somehow convinced myself he didn't love me anymore?!?! I often Google relationship problems and compare them to my own or read articles on signs you're with the one/in the right relationship because I'm so scared I'm not, even when I really love him and would be lost without him. I'm starting therapy soon but I don't really know whats up with me."
1544,Anxious boyfriend gone MIA,"My partner has recently gone MIA now for around 6 days and he’s not answering or opening any of my or my friends messages/calls. He seemed to be going downhill leading up to this but there was little indication that he would spiral this hard. He has severe social anxiety and occasionally slips into very low points. He has done this before but it only lasted a day and he reassured me that if it happened again he would warn me, but there was no warning. We know he’s physically safe but we’re all worried about his mental health. Has anyone else experienced this? How can I help him? I’m worried sick and I just want to be able to understand what he’s going through."
1545,Coping with crisis,[removed]
1546,Finally told my (f16) mom (f51) about my sexual trauma after years of wanting to commit suicide,"A little back story: My uncle, let's call him dickwad, a few of my cousins (both male and female), a now dead neighbour, sexually harrased me since I was 6 til I was 10. These were all on different occasions, and they did it one at a time. I won't disclose any details since it is really painful for me to remember. After all that trauma, I have been wanting to commit suicide since I was young, and have attempted it on multiple occasions.

I told my mom all of this last night, after getting into an argument about me not wanting to get touched. She was horrified and furious. I was scared about what she would do if she didn't believe me, but she thankfully did. Now she wants me to go to therapy, even though we don't have a house, and we are currently living with her brother and his wife. 

I told her I didn't want to go to therapy because of the costs, plus the meds I would have to take, because it just seems so atrocious and self centered of me to go to these expensive therapy sessions when we didn't even stay at our own house, and I didn't want my mom to work herself to the bone just to afford therapy. 

I feel kind of relieved that I told her, but she keeps prying me for details of what happened (when it started, how it started, how did they do it, etc.) I try to avoid the questions as much as possible because it really hurts and just remembering details makes me want to throw up and want to die. 

Part of me thinks that maybe I shouldn't have told her, but honestly I feel kind of relieved since I've been carrying that emotional baggage all alone for years. I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my chest.

My mom and I want to get the justice I deserve, but I'm honestly terrified that no one would believe me, specially since I don't have any proof as this all happened years ago, so if you guys have any tips to suggest, it would be extremely helpful.

Thank you for reading throughout the end. I hope you all have a wonderful day!"

He was telling that the police is after him. He was showing me something(google map showing that he walked in circles around the house) on his phone that didn't made sense. Now he behaves antisocial(before he was a shy guy), he also started to bite his nails. After a long time asking him about his time spending, he admitted to take drugs, I don't know a of them, but definitely cannabis is one of them. We dont have any previous records of schizophrenia in our family. I want to bring him to a psychologist on Monday, but before that I have no idea what to do. Is it an emergency that requires immediate action?"
1549,The Key to Happiness: post your insights.,"I would like to gather people's insights into what has worked for them in terms of finding happiness. This post is for everyone no matter how low they find themselves as it is never a bad idea to dwell in the possibility of a bright future.

My mental health journey has been long. I've been diagnosed bi-polar, have had a few hospitalizations, and have been dealing with a particularly rough phase a depression which is about to reach a four year mark.

However, lately I find that when I'm not experiencing a strong tangible presence of symptoms, I have this sensation of flatness and a potential fall. Like I'm teetering on some point in the sky and if I don't learn to fly I'm going to find myself falling again.

I guess what I'm experiencing is a result of not cultivating happiness. I guess this happens when you are so preoccupied with symptoms for so long. When I'm outside especially I have this experience of reaching outward, a feeling that I'm on the verge of experiencing some kind of profound feeling. But I always end up short, not grasping anything lasting. What I'm really reaching for is happiness I suppose or some other similar notion but I don't have the vocabulary for it. I've been unhappy for so long.

I would like for anybody who has insight into finding happiness, purpose, or any other positive feeling to post here for me and any other who could use a redirection in their thinking."

Some of mine are I could hear my deceased mother’s voice in my head, telling me that she would be very very disappointed in me if I did something so silly (you can think of another loved one) To help the rough patches I would watch my favourite movie on Disney and snuggle with my teddy bear and eat some ice. When it’s the blood that I’m craving, I have some ice cubes with lots of red food dye in them which i run up and down my arms and legs or wherever else I want to cut. I also have some essential oils which I use on my pillows and my teddy and I use some non nicotine vape juice in a vape device to force myself to control my breathing, I prefer the peppermint mint flavoured one because it helps with the nausea.

I learned most of these while inpatient in a psychiatric facility and while in the CAMHS system and now the nhs mental health centre (just a warning for those transitioning to adult services from CAMHS, nhs mental health support isn’t very good at all in my opinion, even before the coronavirus stravaganza and I highly recommend that you go to private care if possible, it’s surprisingly not that expensive! Send me a private message and I can suggest some support networks and facilities with you, some of which I use for my specific conditions such as ptsd, borderline personality disorder and others)

I’m excited to hear yours! What works for you may work for others but don’t get disheartened if someone else’s doesn’t work for yourself as we are all snowflakes, unique little bunnies and we all have our differences!"

1554,My past self-harm seem normal,"I used to self harm around a 8 months ago and haven’t thought about it much since, as I’m in a better place mentally

People freak out when they see my scars for the first time but even though I know it was a sign I was not okay, I think I’ve normalised self harm to the point where it’s unhealthy just because I’ve lived with scars for so long that it was just always apart of my life. 

I feel as though my mind has downplayed the severity and impact self-harm in my life, and I’m not sure it is healthy as now I think it will be easier for me to relapse into if I get into a more depressive state. 

I would just like some thoughts and opinions, or if this has happened to you, what should I do about this and is this bad?"

1557,I am climbing out the prison.,"Remember that scene from the Dark Knight? When Bruce was climbing his way out of the prison? I analyzed it into my own situation, made me think much differently.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I sound like a geek but this quarantine has helped me to do the following things

* Meditate calmly and organize my thoughts even in the most irritating situations
* Exercise without weights and rely on myself to be creative
* Motivate myself to regulate all my habits and stop bad habits
* Learn new things everyday and adapt to changes
* Endure any pain and turn it, into my advantage as a lesson

all of these things I come to realize despite of my ADHD or Autism or my rest of my mental health issues. I seen myself in a prison forged and designed by my own self reflection and self doubt, all the negativity that I had in my life all the bad things that happened. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, I have experienced what it's like to be weak and crawling on the floor, so it's time I try to rise up from that prison once more even if it seems impossible you might call it a fool's hope but it's hope either way.

I have set up my new goals and objectives, Im going to finish my Highschool and go to college then take an internship then travel to stay with my girlfriend. I will do it one way or another, I've given up enough times, now's the time to experience the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

note: this is what was played during the prison scene btw  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCG0c7\_xll4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCG0c7_xll4)"
1558,help,"I’m not diagnosed with any mental illnesses because I haven’t sought any help. I don’t know what I’m actually feeling or going through.

These past few weeks, I’ve been feeling anxious all the time. There’s a constant feeling of uneasiness and my stomach is uncomfortable all the time. I get chest/heart pain as well and am constantly having a headache. In addition to these which I experience throughout the day, I’ve been constantly breaking down at night and crying for hours. Sometimes there’s absolutely no reason for me to cry but I just do. 

All these are affecting my everyday life which is why I’ve decided to post this. I’m currently 18 and I’m having exams in a couple of days. However, I just can’t find the motivation to study. I’ll think about studying and I want to study but every single time, I end up not getting anything done. This gives me a lot of stress and I end up getting a headache all the time. I don’t know how to deal with this problem and I’m afraid. Not doing well in my exams will have a huge impact in my life and I fear my mental health will deteoriate further if I don’t do well.

What should I do? I’m just extremely helpless and desperate at this point. I hate the way I’m feeling but I can’t control it."
1559,My friend is developing schizophrenic symptoms. Venting out and asking for advice.,"For quite some time I’ve developed my social life only with a small group of friends (since I’m quite the introvert type). All things were running smoothly until last week, when one of them started spewing out stuff about meeting God and spiritual stuff like that. It was kinda odd since none of us (even him) are the religious type, bit by that time we shrugged it off as maybe some kind of epiphany he had.

That was the case until a couple days ago said friend began sending +6min voice notes to our group non-stop, talking nonsense and low-key like a madman. We were trying our best to keep it cool but it all blew up when yesterday he went to one of another friend’s house, speaking nonsense about growing up, adulthood and specifically how he went to our old high school and made a ton of deals with the principal (we all come from the same high school, same generation). Then he later explained how he entered the principal’s car with him and would later be thrown out of the window of the car. 

Also, he began smoking indoor in my friend’s house. I want to clarify that my (probably sick) friend had stopped smoking for a month by that point and he’d obviously know how disrespectful it is to smoke indoors without permission. He was also turning red and sweating profusely while talking nonsense. My friend had to kick him out of his house out of fear that he’d break something.

Later on we contacted his mother, who was extremely afraid and worried about his mental state. She confirmed to us that indeed he had imagined all that supposedly happened with our High School principal. In addition to that, he’s become extremely sensitive, shifting from suicidal thoughts and sheer optimism in a matter of seconds.

We already contacted a psychiatrist and are expecting an appointment, however I honestly don’t know how to deal with this. I’d love some advice from you and even a raw speculation about what he has. Any question you have I’ll try to answer ASAP.

Peace to you all.

*Addendum: Guilt.*
I feel quite guilty about the situation my friend is facing. Mainly because he invited me to take an acid trip with him, and I accepted. I actually got the acid for him. By the time I had little concern about it as he’d already taken acid trips, without repercussions. I don’t know why the outcome changed this time, and honestly feel like garbage about accepting this acid trip with him."
1560,I genuinely wanna die,"I am tried of writing about my mental health online but that's the only thing I can do 


I am a male 18 yo
And since I was a kid my life was terrible  ( abusive father , we were poor , bullied at school since kindergarten to high school ) 

I thought that my life would get better over time but it got worse I have been struggling with depression I don't even remember when it started and since 2018 ( the downhill of my life also I was 15 ) I developed bdd ( body dysmorphia ) the past 3 years were terrible I feel this pressure on my chest ( SO FUC*ING TERRIBLE PRESSURE ) it make me want to kill my self  Also my father started to abusive me and my mother more we got kicked a lot out of out house ( and I don't want to go on more details since I am so ashamed of that ) we can't really do something about it since my country is  terrible and the laws here can't protect women and children   

The worst thing so far is my bdd it's so hard and I can't take it I feel so ugly ( I was told I am good looking by girls however I don't believe and I feel deformed ) I wish I had enough money to get plastic surgery AND I FUC*ING WANNA DIE 


Sorry this is too long I I am just so tired and angry and I just chat do this anymore"
1561,"When is enough, enough?","I work 10 hour days in a big box retailer right now as a manager. I’m taking my medication daily and I’m dying inside. I dread going to work daily. Every week it’s either verbal abuse from a guest, things like my team members calling the hotline on me because it’s too hot (I can’t control the AC?!), nothings ever good enough and I can only do so much with the payroll I’m given and the team doesn’t care because they all want 40 hours when we don’t have that to give!

I’m trying to find my purpose but daily it’s a struggle. I watched someone get set on fire and die while I was in high school. I was raped 3 years ago and then was sent to a new store that week which is notorious for being unsafe. So I kind of compartmentalized all of that. I’m in constant fear I’m going to get fired. So there is some unprocessed trauma up there. 

I need help. I’m unhealthy. I’m stressed. I’m sick to my stomach. I don’t know where to start. I try to fill my time with positive projects and books to read when I’m not at work. I am on a job hunt and a mental health professional. I think I need to take an LOA from work but that always comes with the stigma of failure."
1562,i stumbled across something really disturbing and now it won't get out of my head. it has been 3 weeks.,i'm not into it at all and i'm scared it will be in my mind forever distracting myself doesn't help
1563,Think I may be depressed,I gave birth roughly a month ago. The birth did not go well and I'm still recovering. I'm also on long term medication due to the birth. Ever since I've not felt my normal self. I keep forgetting to eat some days. And when I do eat I can't stomach much. I struggle with simple things like just getting dressed or doing things around the house. I constantly feel bored but at the same time I have 0 motivation to do anything to alleviate the boredom. Dont get me wrong I do everything for our baby. My SO works so I am the one with our baby all day every day. But I'm struggling. I end up crying alot most days. And I just feel tired and exhausted all the time. Where we are a doctor will only see you in person in an actual emergency. Everything else is done over the phone. I'm not good at talking about my emotions and I dont know how to word something like this over the phone. And I dont know if I'm maybe just overthinking it and making things worse than they are. But my SO says it's not normal for me to be as exhausted as I am. Especially when i end up sleeping for maybe 10 hours a night. Which I've never done before. Does this sound like depression?
1564,i just want to let this out,"i want to share something on here because i dont like sharing my problems with people i know in real life. i am 22 years old and i have been crying most nights because of this problem. i am sorry if you think this is a petty one. 

i have really bad body issues that my self esteem is literally on the floor. im sure its because my father would always comment really negative things about my weight and body growing up. as young as 7 years old i could remember my father calling me fat.

i really hate how i physically look, especially my body. it irks me so much. i believe thats what prevents me from doing things i want to do like going out with friends, seeing other people or other social situations. 

throughout high school i hated when people would take photos of me so i never joined in with my friends. they always thought i was weird for hiding from the camera. its just that i couldnt bare to look at myself. even looking into the mirror back then would ruin my whole day because i hated how i look.  even trying on new clothes in front of a mirror would make me cry.

i believe no one is ever going to love me because of the way i look. i have never dated anyone and never had a bf/gf. no one has ever confessed to liking me. i am too afraid to put myself out there for the way i look disgusts me. 

i dont know what to do now and i dont know if i explained it enough. i just want someone to talk to about it or maybe give some advice :("
1565,A celebrity suicide has affected me deeply Please hear me out. Would also like to discuss how common is a wave a suicides after a celebrity dies.,"Last week, a prominent Bollywood (Indian) actor called Sushant Singh Rajput died of suicide at the age of 34 and this news has triggered me like nothing has in the longest time, partly because I was going through a tough time already. 
I can give a little bit of context about this actor, but my concerns with this link are still universal and pertain to human behaviour in general. 

He was an actor who got into acting later in life, struggled a lot to get his breakthrough in Indian films, but was careful about whom he associated with and what kind of films he signed. He was quite underrated but popular. 

He was supremely intelligent and a big time intellectual. Not something you'd normally see in the entertainment industry. He loved physics, poetry, art, philosophy. He was way ahead of his contemporaries in terms of the understanding of life and nature he had. A Cambridge scholar even went on to call him a genius and mistook him to be a scholar. 

He died on the 14th this month. Every day since then, there are so many people talking about how brilliant and intelligent he was, and to a great extent, I feel guilty to have not taken him as seriously. I knew he was good, but I didn't place him right at the top of public figures I admired the most.

 I am watching his interviews, movies and songs over and over again and tearing up every single time. (Indian movies and actors become popular over their songs and dance routines in movies)

We all have our share of misery to deal with, but what's been making it particularly difficult for me is that when someone this intelligent and self aware couldn't find hope, what makes me and my problems any different?

It's the same case for other high profile suicides which have shocked us the same way. This one was particularly a trigger because of timing. 

This guy even had a bit of a monologue in his last movie in which he said suicide wasn't the answer. 

When you are trying to recover or heal in any manner, you are suggested to go back to the things you enjoy doing and even find new things which can make you feel better. 
So when such high profile figures have the resources to seek help and make these small amends, how is it that they still don't find hope to live for those reasons? 

Please note that I am not trivializing or advocating a misconception that wealthy people have no reason to be depressed. I am just saying that it can help in acting as the smallest bit of hope where you have some liberty over these small amends you can incorporate in your life. 

So to be more specific, it's two concerns which are overwhelming me  - 

- How can I be hopeful about getting better or learning how to deal with stuff when such brilliant and successful people couldn't? Even take Chester Bennington's suicide for instance.

- How does anyone defend saying ""Go back to the things you love/ find what makes you happy"" as a step to recovery, when these things didn't even matter to those who had various interests and resources, but still couldn't live for those reasons? 

- How do you even cope from a celebrity suicide?

Thanks a lot for hearing me out if you've come this far. I would love to read what anyone has to say about this. 

How do you even cope from a celebrity suicide?"
1566,I don’t know...,[deleted]
1567,"How has the lockdown affected people, vis a vis mental health?","I don't think it's fair for me to rant a lot about this lockdown, let me just begin with this. I (22f) live with my family, don't have to worry about finances/ supporting a family, I don't love my work but it's temporary and probably won't be what I do in the long run, I don't have any seemingly obvious problems. 
But I just feel so...done. Like everything is so pointless. And that's my response to everything now, at least in my head. To simple tasks like cleaning, eating, work related tasks, even hobbies that I used to enjoy...what's the point?
I ignore everyone I know, save for once a week when I text my closest family/friends to reassure myself they still exist and are in good health. I cannot bring myself to have conversations on the phone or even in real life. And whenever I do, I feel the need to complain. I've pretty much stopped talking to people, I don't want to bring everyone down and a few people have pointed out to my face that I don't have enough to complain about, too. 
I'm so tired and annoyed and I cry every afternoon (so I try to take naps in the afternoon to avoid crying) and I have no interest in anything. I want someone to talk to...but I don't want to talk to anyone, if that makes sense (?)
I don't know how much of this has to do with the lockdown, I was always a little sad since as long as I can remember, but I suppose I had a lot of distractions before, that have now just...withered away. 
I guess I just want to know I'm not fragile, everyone else around me seems to be doing better emotionally, but am I really the only one who feels this way??"
1568,My dad has a chance of dying and it's seriously fucking up my head,My dad just got discharged from the hospital and told he has about a 60% of living. It's not covid. He was also told due to the procedure he can't see anyone other than my mom and doctors due to being venerable to infections. I've spent the last hour crying and I can't talk to anyone about it. My head keeps telling me to jump off my appartment balcony and I don't know what to do. Normally I'd drink but I'm trying to quit (2 months sober) but I don't know what to do to calm down. I tried playing video games but I just feel guilty.
1569,Help with phobias,"Hello reddit, I’m currently pursuing a career in the navy and I have a deep fear of the ocean/water beneath me. I wouldn’t say straight up thalassophobia per se, just a fear of open water/deep water/the water itself beneath me. Now am I scared of a puddle? No. Am I scared of a river where I can’t see everything below me? Yes, most definitely. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen the US Navy indoor ocean, but that thing is literally the manifestation of my deepest fears. As it would be probably that I would have to work in or around things like that, or that itself, I really need help conquering my phobia and need help/ideas in doing so. I have talked to many people with this same phobia and it would be interesting to know how to help them and myself. Thank you!"
1570,What are some of the most stupid things you've heard about mental health?,"Mine is that, it doesn't exist."
1571,What is the exact definition of a depression? And how do I know if I have one. Do I need a therapist to actually identify depression?,
1572,Tongue biting and intrusive thoughts.,"Recently, for some reason, I have been chewing my tongue a lot to the point where it’s extremely painful. I enjoy the pain I guess you could say? I tried to stop but I just can’t. It usually happens for periods of about two weeks or so and then stops, then comes back. Why do I do this and how can I stop?

Also, recently iv been having problems with intrusive thoughts and call of void. It’s been really frequent. These thoughts just pop into my head while I’m doing stuff like driving, I could drive into people. I am not suicidal. How can I control these thoughts?"
1573,Called the crisis line.,"So I called the crisis hotline and I remembered seeing a post about how when someone else called and no one answered they couldn’t help but continuously laugh and it made them stop thinking about suicide. 

Well I called and was on hold for a couple minutes, granted I wasn’t contemplating suicide. But I started talking to the guy who answered after they picked up and it felt like a bad actor in a movie where I was sitting on the Freudian couch and they just kept asking and how does that make you feel. It weirdly made me like laugh at it. I was honestly just looking for someone to chat with about like shit that isn’t my life and that’s all this dude get saying. Like I wanted to see what his hobbies were and how he takes his mind off of things but I felt like I couldn’t ask it. The whole experience was weird lol. I wanted to talk about mental health issues in men and how it isn’t talked about that much and things like that but I couldn’t get over how fake movie like the whole experience felt and it just made me laugh and want to get off the phone. 

But in all seriousness if anyone needs help call them. 1-800-273-8255"
1574,Life is changing and im scared,"In September im about to start my new life and i have so much i want to do but im not sure where to start. im also pretty scared because i have a long history with depression and problems with
commitment. pretty much anything i try to do i give up on even if i really want to do it. 

I want to learn, get a new job and move out of the house i know exactly what i want to do but i just cant get myself to do it. 

Im just really frustrated with myself. :|"
1575,"If somehow the punishment for a failed suicide attempt was death, do you think suicide attempt rates would increase or decrease?","Idk if this kinda thing is allowed here but i wasn’t sure what other sub would work. I recently saw a meme about a man being sentenced to death after a failed suicide attempt idk the country or the validity of the article

But this got me thinking, do you think suicide rates would decrease because people want control over their own life/death or would they increase because they know if they fail they’ll still get to die? 

Might be a stupid question feel free to remove the post, idk just doing some thinking out loud"
1576,Why do I hate myself so fucking much!,I am utterly disappointed and disgusted by who I have become and changing feels impossible.
1577,I think it was destined for me to be like this,"Sorry, I just want to vent ... Long story short, I had a happy life and was grateful for it. One day, I took some drugs and got depersonalization from it. From there it only spiralled down. It happened one and a half years ago... Now I am taking meds from psychosis , since I get a lot of weird thoughts most of the time. I just cant be happy for a complete whole day. Sure I get some freedom from my thoughts, since I can cope now with them, but during the day I will feel like shit, since I cant feel normal(because of dp) and I have weird psychotic thoughts stuck in my head. I am so envyus of people who have a normal head, not like mine :/ it is hell inside there. I just wish everyone was happy and didnt feel crazy for having thoughts like this that torture people..."
1578,"I have no where and no one to talk to, so I’ll just post this here. Please no hate comments, I genuinely need guidance.",[deleted]
1579,I feel like i’m going crazy,"I don’t know how to feel anymore, my mind is my worst enemy, I don’t know if i’m bipolar, i don’t know if i’m schizophrenic, i just know there’s something wrong with me and no one will believe or listen to me because i’ve obsessed finding an answer for years and my therapist told me not to research or try to self diagnose anymore, but i know my own feelings and i know me best and something isn’t right and i could feel it. I just can’t pin point my finger on it. 

Yesterday i think i experienced depersonalization-I felt like everything was a dream, i felt more confident than normal (like overly confident) , i was very impulsive, i was like watching my life in a movie and i was the main character but i wasn’t in control of my body. 

Today, i’m hung over, and i feel like absolutely like shit. Alcohol usually makes me depressed as hell the day afterwards and i usually get suicidal thoughts and think everyone hates me, the world would be better with out me. I’m always scared of someone would come into my room at night and kill me so i keep the door locked, i’m paranoid at night and i’m not sure what else to do.

I would never try to commit suicide, i just have a lot of thoughts and get scared of myself
i make poor decisions because i’m very impulsive with my money and my choices,
i’m also an 18 y/o girl and i’ve always had anxiety and depression but i started to get these delusions not very long ago"
1580,I figured out out how to navigate through my Quarter Life Crisis,"If you’ve struggled a decent amount throughout your 20s with almost every aspect of your life: career, identity, relationships, etc, you’re definitely not in the minority.

A quarter-life crisis is far more common that you’d think. Almost 75% of 25-33 year olds go through tons of stress and anxiety about understanding who they really are. I kinda feel like I’m still working my way through it too. There is pressure to figure out what you want out of life and fear that anything you’re working towards will not work out.

As I’ve navigated this for myself, I’ve discovered that having perspective, and doing some introspection into what fulfills me has allowed me to channel my energy in the right places. I break this down so much more here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c43MY3xxaVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c43MY3xxaVA).

If anyone else has gone through this, I’m sure you’ve felt your productivity has been affected and the stress has been exhausting. Just know that there are millions like you that are going through the same thing and that it will get better."
1581,If ur on this subreddit ur prob looking for attention. Here you go.,"Hello. 

There. That was my attention.

Also, shut up. Wait sorry it’s my impulses. I got mental health issues lol

Looking for help for my mental health! Got autism sorry.

Me is wanna die lol

Sorry I got depression.

I am autism. I do not have social skills. Excuse my mistakes"

1583,Hey Again Guys!,"Hey guys, I hope you’re all doing well. 

Just want to give out another reminder that if you’re in need of a conversation, to vent, rant or to simply pour your emotions out, I am here for you. I’m only a message away, I’m more than happy to listen to you, to try and give you the best tips and advice possible. But, more importantly, I know some of you are looking for one, especially at times like these, I’ll happily be your friend. 

PM is open whenever you need me. Thanks a lot guys. 

Always remember to keep smiling and show positive vibes at all times!"
1584,An interesting title,"Rant. I've suffered with depression most of my life but I've been managing better the past few months than I ever have before. Today started out so well then out of nowhere BOOM, I'm low as shit, no idea why, can't shake the feeling, and for the first time in years I'm considering suicide. It's so exhausting and devastating to be back here, I don't want to go through this again. Fin :)"
1585,does anyone else have this problem?,"so ummmm my boyfriend and I are long distance and have almost opposite timezones. a lot of times when he leaves to go to sleep I feel my heart drop and I feel myself already start to pull away. sometimes I cry for a bit. I think it's something that has to do with my mindset of ""leave before the other person leaves first."" but in this case he's only going to be gone for some hours, and I know very well that he's not trying to avoid me or anything, but I always feel this sense of...abandonment? and then I get upset and often take it out on him. 

I've had this problem with other people as well and I always get annoyed with myself because I WANT to respect others' alone time but I'm so afraid of people leaving and I always think that people don't really want to talk to me. I also don't want my boyfriend to feel like he's being a bad partner every time I feel like he's abandoning me. it's just frustrating and...yeah."
1586,Im so sensitive and everything stresses me out. What can i do?,Im so sensitive at the moment. My brain shuts off at any slightly complicated task or question. Anything that makes noise stresses me to the MAX. I cant really do anything. Everytime some body wants something from me and comes knocking on my door i emmediatly get stressed out. I cant handle anything rn and i have no idea what to do.
1587,I feel this way and I don’t know if it has a name or not. Maybe learning it had a name would help me learn more about it and understand why I feel this way?,"I feel like I am in a “bubble” isolated from society.  It’s like I can see society around me but I don’t know how to really interact with it. 

I have a very hard time making friends much less romantic relationships..

Any ideas if this would have a name or if I’m just screwed up.  I do have ptsd, BPD among a plethora of past mental health diagnosis that change so much I really don’t know what fits any more. 

Just tired of feeling this way, maybe someone else could have some insight?"

1589,Media where bi-polar is portrayed...different?,"Hi, sorry if this doesn’t belong here, I can delete it. Ozark show spoilers ahead. 

I just finished a Netflix show called, “Ozark”. One of the secondary characters is bi-polar, and he ends up being a “liability” to his family—so they nix him. Body bag. Gone. 

Are their any portrayals of bi-polar disorder in media where they aren’t killed off for being a “liability”? Where the family learns to live a cope together? Where they figure it out. It’s a difficult message of hopelessness. Thank you"

1591,I need help.,"Hey. Im Kai. I've been pretty mentally unstable, by that I mean, sad, scared and anxious for a while, over everything. (a few years). Everyone is saying ""just reach out, the tools are there!"" But when I get over my fear of reaching out, everyone just says, ""there's nothing wrong with you"" or ""your just causing trouble"". My school's 'therapist' isn't helping at all. I've vented and all she did was say it's just my imagination. Am I really making it all up? I don't know anymore. What should I do? I need advice."
1592,Sisters friend / roommate thinks we tried to kill her dog. Has anyone else seen or experienced paranoia like this?,"I will give some background and am curios if anyone else has experienced something like this themselves or seen it in someone you’re close with and what your / their diagnosis is. I am in NO WAY looking to diagnose the person this story is about. I am not a professional. I know people on the internet have no way of knowing, especially hearing this story from my perspective. It is more for my own curiosity of what the bigger picture might possibly be and to try and understand it more. 

My sister and I have always been really close and she always tries to see the best in people. So she is the only friend to her friend / roommate. Let’s call the roommate Kate. Kate has always been a bit “off”. Not very social, which is fine, but she gets angry very easily. 

A few people slept at my sister and Kate’s place last night because they had a party for my sister’s birthday. I have two dogs myself and brought them after making sure it was ok with Kate and my sister. Kate has one dog. Everyone that spent the night last night are huge dog lovers. 

This morning one of my dogs and Kate’s dog were scratching to go outside. So we let them out into the fenced in back yard. Then we started to clean the kitchen and the living room. Kate came into the kitchen while we were cleaning the living room and started slamming the cabinets and the fridge and throwing cups. She started screaming at us “you think it’s ok to f-ing kill my dog?!” She had a similar freak out the night before over the AC but we figured it was just from drinking and she would be fine in the morning. Clearly the morning was not ok. She continued yelling at us that there are cigarette butts and charcoal in the grill and we were trying to kill her dog. Keep in mind we have no idea if her dog actually got into any of these things and she seemed perfectly fine. We apologized and said we were not thinking. she was still freaking out calling us dog killers so we got everyone breakfast then came back. she wouldn’t let her dog near us and kept calling her dog away from us saying to her she doesn’t want to be around these mean dog murderers.

The other guy who let the dogs out with me loves Kate’s dog and slept with her on the ground all night. We all started to get our things to leave and she said to me how she hates people and we, as in all humans, are all mean intentioned and I said that’s a really sad way to think. And to not assume the worst intention is the reason behind what people are doing. And she said “you all tried to kill my dog” where I explained that we saw two dogs who needed to go out and so we let the dogs out and I am sorry for not thinking of the stuff out there (keep in mind the dogs were outside all night with all of us with the charcoal and the cig butts and never got into any of it. But I wasn’t going to explain that to Kate in the moment because she didn’t seem to be in a place she wanted to listen). 

NOW THIS IS THE PART THAT HAS ME REALLY CONCERNED: she said to me she thinks that we were trying to harm her dog. So I said “is that what you really think? You really think we let her out with the thought process that we want this dog to get into stuff and die?” And she said “yes. I know you all hate me and I know you were trying to get back at me by killing my dog”. We have never talked about or showed signs of hating Kate. In fact the night before was the most social and enjoyable I had ever seen her. We chatted a lot and I really enjoyed her company. I just turned around and left at this point. Everyone else was waiting outside for my sister because they were too scared to come in the house. 

I think I should also add that we were drinking the night before but there were no drugs involved and my sister says Kate has never even smoked weed. Kate is very against drugs so I definitely don’t think that’s a factor. 

The whole freak out part was a lot worse than I am able to explain with one post. Just trying to get most of the words said out there. 

I have never seen this level of paranoia and was wondering if anyone else has. I genuinely hope she gets better. I am trying to educate myself and understand better. Thank you for reading!"
1593,Can someone tell me what i am going through? Basically I get angry by remembering bad memories and it happens randomly,And sometimes (rarely)I have laugh or two in the same way I develop the anger
1594,"I am too fat, like so fat, I ask myself sometimes “Am I responsible for maybe a child dying in Africa?”",I keep thinking about my pity state and then think about such things and suddenly I don’t feel too bad for myself
1595,"I was today years old when I realized that self-care is for making you presentable, not making you feel better","I’ve always had trouble understanding what self-care meant. When my therapist asked me what I do for self-care I started listing things I do that make me feel better. She told me that none of those things are self-care, and listed some things that were. All of the things she listed were either mandatory ADLs I was doing on autopilot already, or things that were a lot of extra work and would definitely waste time and make me feel worse. I was so confused.

But now I finally get it, self-care isn’t care as in “makes you feel happy” it’s care as in “keeping you physically healthy and not looking bedraggled”. Which is a valid point. Though it comes at a cost of making your emotional state worse most of the time."
1596,struggling with ergophobia and depression,"before i start, i know that this probably won't make much sense to most people but it feels very real to me. i currently have no reason to get a job. i have a full ride scholarship and a successful online business, but i can't stop thinking about the fact that some day i'll have to get a real job in order to be independent and sustain myself. every time i think of getting a job i get massive surges of anxiety and my head fills with thoughts of my employer abusing me and watching my every move.  and thoughts of customers screaming at me and  getting me fired for making a small mistake. the idea of working behind a cash redister literally makes me want to throw up. before quarantine i was taking steps to overcome this fear by volunteering and it was completely stress free for me. but the second the manager hinted at giving me a job i became too terrified to ever go back. even though i really enjoyed what i did there. now ive been getting constant depressive thoughts about how worthless i am for not having a real job and how id be better off dead. i know that i don't need one right now but these thoughts just wont stop no matter how hard i try. other people see my fear as irrational but i just can't see it that way. the only advice ive gotten is to stop being a bitch and get over it. i would really appreciate if someone could help me."
1597,I have extreme anxiety around driving.,"When first learning to drive, just taking my foot off the brake and having my car roll would send me into a panic attack. Iv since gotten better and more proficient at driving an automatic. But now I'm in the situation where I(21f)need to learn how to drive a stick because its the only type of car available to me and I need a car to get a job. But learning to drive stick is alot harder than I anticipated and my anxiety attacks feel much more frequent and intense than the first time I learned how to drive. I'm struggling to get over this and my husband(20m) is so frustrated with my anxiety that he no longer will teach me. 
Does anyone have advice on how I could get over this?"

1599,i have the symptoms of depression but i dont feel depressed?,"someone here told me i have all the symptoms of depression but i dont feel depressed. during the last school year i was teased and i guess you could say i was feeling down during those times but not exactly depressed. Since around that time i have felt mentally slower, been having trouble remembering things, etc. Can i be suffering from that event still? How can i be depressed without feeling it?"
1600,Childhood Memories / Change in personality,"Is it normal to not have any memories of your childhood up until the age of 8?

My dad passed away when I was 5 and I just found out (at the age of 23) that I never really cried after his death.

Also, my family says my personality changed after his death. Became an introvert after his death.

I have no memories of my dad, don't even remember his voice.

I don't know how to process this.

All this while I have been relatively high functioning ( good grades and job...)

Thank you"
1601,Factitious disorder,Lemme tell ya what you got. All you asking what illness you have? It’s factitious disorder. It’s the only disorder there is. Losers.
1602,I don’t know if I should go to therapy,"Hey... so I (15) have got some mental health issues. I have had suicidal thoughts, though I never acted on it. I thought about cutting myself, but I haven’t done it because I don‘t feel like I have a valid reason for it. If I am honest, I do self harm sometimes, but nothing to bad (digging my fingers into my skin, biting my cheek etc.) to keep myself from breaking down in class, or things like that (I don’t know if thats self harm, sorry). I have also got some kind of phobia of being touched or being close to other people and it has bothered me, because I can’t hug people without breaking down crying. I can’t really stand in queues or go to crowded places, but I can avoid these things most of the time so its not that bad? There is also some other stuff going on (trust issues, family stuff, a chronic headache etc.) but it is not that bad. (Sorry for complaining)

So, I would have started therapy and I have already been going to the school counselor for some weeks before the Lockdown, but I never felt like I deserved the therapy and I thought I would just take someones opportunity.

That doesn’t really matter anymore, as I got into a fight with my mom some days ago. She got really angry at me for going to the counselor, told me I was just imagining everything and forbid me to go to therapy any longer. I don’t know what to do know, because I feel like it is the right decision, because I am just a piece of human shit that needs to get a grip and doesn’t deserve therapy, but on the other hand... I can‘t really continue like this. Most if my problems are continually getting worse and I have really tried to help myself for the past two years but it hasn’t worked. I am afraid that it will just get worse until it is to late and maybe I should get help know and... I don’t know. 
I just need some advice what I should do. Maybe if I started the fight with my mom again it I can go to therapy? Maybe I am trash and should just kill myself to free the world of my presence? I don’t know. (Sorry for any mystakes, English is not my first language)"
1603,Fear of having mental illness,"Hi, im so scared of having mental illness it became a problem for me. I analyze my thoughts (i dont do that 24/7) just to check if i have symptoms of some serious mental illness. Im googling every day my mental health and i also have intrusive thoughts (im exhausted of them). Im tired of this, im feeling like im going crazy, i have little panic attacks when i see some similarities between me and some random mental disorder. I know i should see specialist but in this covid era its hard to do. i wanted to see if someone has something like me or similar. i want to know what it is:("
1604,Close friend &amp; bpd,"A person Ive recently become very close with mid conversation started seeming annoyed so I said “Are you good” and they said “No, I’m very mad, stop talking to me” which was strange. I asked them if it was me that was the problem and if I did something I was not aware of. They just responded with “Idk” followed by “bpd”. I assume they were talking about Borderline Personality Disorder. Is hostility a common ‘effect’? Should I be worried? What should I do?"
1605,Envious over my homeschooled partner.,"My partner has been homeschooled for a while now, he has had medication and countless meetings with psychiatrists and therapists, however, all of said medication is unneeded, and he has gotten countless of misdiagnosis’.

Something that has bothered me since the day we started dating was the fact that he was homeschooled, I personally don’t have anything against it, I think it’s good that he doesn’t go to that shitty school anymore, however, I can’t help but feel.. how do I say this.. kind of envious? Jealous of some sort?

I can’t exactly tell why I feel like this, but some time ago, I posted about this problem, and a Redditor suggested that I might be feeling this way because “I never had any of this sort of help”.
I love him more than anything, he’s the center of my heart, but I just cannot get rid of this thought that he’s homeschooled, I don’t know why it bothers me so much, like I said, envious because I never had any of this type of help.

Suicide attempt at age 11, verbally abusive father, undiagnosed autism until I was 14, sexuality and gender identity crisis since the age of 12, absolutely no help. I have spoken up, but no one seems to act on it.

I guess I’m just jealous of all of the help my partner is getting, it’s really really stressing me out ajd I don’t know what to do about it..


Is there a way that I can get rid of this thought?..
Please help, I am in need of it.."
1606,"I'm 18 years old, and I've suffered from mental health issues nearly as long as I could form memories.","Starting with my parents divorce when I was 4 years old, I experienced a lot of confusing and sad things starting from very young. The hardest thing for me though, by far, was my father's death when I was 9. While my mom was fit to watch TV all day and pursue her romantic interests, my sisters and I were left to raise eachother and with our dad on the weekends we saw him. But that changed when he died. People got involved I never wanted being that involved. My mom never stepped up. I lost my friends from school because nobody wants to be friends with the depressed kid.

So where am I at now? Well now I smoke pot and cigarettes and build my tolerance to all sorts of drugs until I'm forced to switch because my tolerance builds and builds until they're ineffective at keeping me high. But the truth is they don't help. 

So in closing never do drugs. Especially if you're vulnerable. And if you have kids it's your fucking responsibility to at least dedicate part of your day to them. And if they ever come out to you and ask you for help with their mental health. Do, not, tell them that you are scared of them. Or what they might do to themselves. Do, not, tell anyone who they don't want to know. And lastly, do, not, fucking discuss their mental health in the middle of a restaurant.

Please stop teaching your boys to be stoic, I don't want them to end up drug addicts or anything like me.

And if you're another guy, another guy like my dad who never went to the doctor's, and has kids, you owe it to them to schedule that appointment. Make regular check-ups."
1607,Can’t sit in silence,"I constantly am listening to music or listening to podcasts. Even while studying.

1608,My house is a fucking hell,"Hey. So these couple of days /months I feel that the discussions at home between my parents are getting worse and I cant cope with that. I cant move out the house, It's not healthy to live in this fucking house. Sleeping is the only thing that can make escape from all the noise. I feel like my head shuts down for a while. Do you sleep when you're anxious or sad?"
1609,Self harming friend,"So i just had a chat with my ex/ best friend, and found out he is harming himself again. We have talked about it before, but i havent convinsed him to stop. Can i get some advice?"
1610,Sigh...feeling depressed again.,"Our eldest daughter and I had a long talk over text the other night, and she told me some things that I hadn't known about the days right after I had been arrested (Jan. 3, 2019).   


She told me that my husband had said as soon as I got out of prison that he was going to leave me. Well, that hasn't happened and it doesn't appear that he is going anywhere anytime soon, but that hurt. I think he might have said that out of frustration, but my heart is broken that he would even suggest something like that and say it to the kids, nonetheless.   


She also told me that once my husband had said that to the kids, that our 12 year old daughter had run away and they had to go find her. My heart hurts thinking she would do something like that, and that she was so distressed by that statement by her dad that she would take off like that.   


I just don't know...he has been different since I've gotten home. He seems to be developing early-onset dementia (his dad and mom both had it and he is almost 60 so it really isn't THAT early) and he is just not the same man I remember. He doesn't have any ambitions anymore, he is loving towards me and the kids, but he doesn't parent them anymore. I have to do everything along with our 2 daughters, one of whom is leaving for college again in a few weeks. It will be just me and the 12 (almost 13) year old to run the whole household. Now, I am NOT complaining because that is what needs to be done and I don't have a choice (and I kind of love running things in a way) but as a young teenager, our younger daughter shouldn't have to bear the responsibilities she has had to bear. I want her to just be a teenager...and I told her so. She just says that she sees me struggle and just wants to help. It hurts me to see my husband so depressed and we are trying to get him to talk to someone again, but he won't go.   


I am at the end of my rope. I would kill myself, but that would mean they would be stuck with just our eldest child (she is 21) as a ""parent""...so that is out. I just don't want this pain anymore. I can't bear it any longer.  


Sorry for the book, but this is what is on my mind right now. :(  


Anyone have any suggestions? Help? Kind words? Thanks."

1613,My Anxiety has me Fucked,"So putting it simply I have this really common and aggravating tendency to over-analyze every little interaction or slip up on my end. I even feel like I've done something wrong or bad when in reality I haven't. 

Today at my job was awful. I basically was racing around trying to get all this shit done all at once and feeling like I was ultimately failing. Panicking and sending texts to the next shift lead (who is my BF) basically being like ""Hey, it's a shit show you may need to come in early.""

But in reality, the shift wasn't THAT bad. I got out almost on time and my staff got out on time. I got all the stuff I needed to get done, done, and it was ok. But I left work feeling like my brain was fried, feeling like I messed up somehow, and feeling awful for snapping at my BF a bit. 

I sent him a text after leaving saying I'm sorry and that I was going to be turning my phone off. Then when I sent it I felt like it was manipulative somehow and sent another apology text. Then I panicked and typed up a two-page document, basically analyzing and talking about my feelings. What led to them, and if they are logical or not, and the conclusion? 90% of it is illogical and irrational and I'm freaking out because I can't stop feeling the way I am feeling right now over stuff that I KNOW isn't legit.

What makes it worse is I know I should tell my boyfriend (and I plan on telling him) but I'm also beyond terrified because it's ingrained in me to prepare for rejection, anger, and exasperation at my mental and emotional struggles and problems.

The other issue is that I'm terrified this mess will drive him away in general because I know how nuts it seems and I KNOW that so it makes me that MUCH more scared to say anything. I don't want him to listen to this for the millionth time and realize how much of a mess I am. He's legit so amazing and I don't want to ruin it with my fucked up brain."
1614,Where to find help if you have no one to turn to?,"My mother is narcissistic and my dad is emotionally/physically abusive. I get yelled at or beaten if I am to cry about anything. I haven't felt ever felt safe in my household. Trouble here is I have nowhere else to turn. My mother cut off my few close friendships because she felt threatened due to the time I spent with them. My grades have been suffering as well, the only thing my family does care about, so being in quarantine (in the summer) I am afraid to leave my room. 

I don't know who or where to turn to. I have absolutely no current close friendships except for friends I have met online, my extended family is more or less the same in terms of toxicity. I have extremely high insecurity and my parents have told me they hate me more than they love me. All in all, I am just so scared for this summer and what it'll do to my mental health, being stuck here and then having to face another school year with possibly no progress at all. I am a minor still, with no freedoms at all. If they knew I was typing this, it would become 10x worse. Where do I find help in a situation like this?"
1615,Can you go to an urgent care and walk out with a prescription for antidepressants?,I have been considering this because my my job sucks and the insurance make me jump through hoops before getting anywhere and am currently in a waiting game but i really want antidepressants soons so has anyone done this before. Just saying This is from a United states perspective.
1616,Can someone just let me know it’s okay to feel how I feel?,"I’ve been self isolating with my mam and sister since March and in that time I’ve felt lower and lower. I feel almost suffocated here because I’m not allowed to feel the things I do without being told there are much worse things going on. My mental health hasn’t been great for as long as I can remember and a lot of it seems to be tied to my self worth, which itself is tied to my purpose in life, and I recently was let go from a job I loved so I have no purpose and no worth.

I understand that what is happening in the world now is horrible, and I understand that as a white male I am privileged in a lot of ways but fucking hell I don’t need reminding every time I feel down. I also don’t understand how hearing about the pain and misery of others is supposed to snap me out of feeling like this.

I wish the world wasn’t as fucked up as it is and I wish everyone could get along regardless of skin colour and sexuality, but is it selfish of me to also wish a few things for myself?"
1617,I don't understand feelings.,"I'm 30 and I never had any kind of feeling towards anyone, I mean i obviously love my family and really like my friends, but I've never really understood deeper or more complex feelings like love.
I don't really know where my actual disposition ends and where coping mechanism ends though.... i mean I have a pretty big hunch that my really low self esteem plays a big role in this it imposes me to take some distance from others in order to maintain my facade, I know i dont have a chance so in order to not get rejected and get hurt I simply don't even develop interest in others.
But frankly I really struggle to grapple any kind of complex emotions, to a point were I started to question if I become emotionally dumb from  the depression and anxiety that plague me...
Or maybe I'm just like this, there are plenty of people who have sociopath tendencies or simply on the spectrum and I can't rule out this possibility since I can't be one hundred percent objective about myself. 
I just sincerely feel empty, a shell of what a person should be, and I don't know if that's just the result of me not being able to idea of person that I have, or have been conditioned to have, for myself or if it's actually a yearning for something that I can't put a name to."
1618,I'm not at the lowest point in my life anymore but I've totally given up on making myself happy,"I'm hanging on by a thread and the only thing keeping me going is my family, I guess. Though my relationship with ny mom is sometimes problematic, it would hurt her a great deal if I passed.

I can't leave my sister. God, imagining how life would be like for her I pass is enough to reconsider things.

I don't know what to do anymore.

Is feeling suicidal everyday now normal because I've felt it everyday for the past 6 years? I want to get better, I really do but sometimes I feel like J can't be helped anymore like I'm a lost cause.

Does things actually turn out good for you in the end? Do people really get better? Or is that just another myth?"

1620,Need some help with an assignment from my psychiatrist,"Yesterday I saw my psychiatrist online and told her about a long standing issue I have where I can't cry. I gave her an example of when my grandma died last December and I couldn't cry about it. She told me that before our next session I need to identify the reason why I can't cry. The issue here is I really don't know. If I knew the reason I could fix it and cry. There are times when my emotions are SO intense that I need to cry. I can feel the tears behind my eyes but no matter what happens it just won't come out. Like sometimes my fiancee gets upset and says terrible things and I want to cry but just can't. No matter how hard I try I just can't. Can anyone here help direct me to how I can identify the reason? Like how do I begin figuring it out ?

Edit from a comment: Honestly now that I think about it this issue has only been since about 2014ish. I remember in 2014 planning a suicide and crying over it but I feel like that may have been the last time I truly cried."
1621,Memory issues and where to look for help,"This is going to be hard to explain but it feels like most of my life has been a blur. I am only 19 but I can almost never remember things anymore. How I felt an hour ago? Gone. Amazing anniversary dinner with my girlfriend? Forgotten.

Like I know I went to these things and that they happened, but I couldn’t tell you what was said, how I felt, nor describe anything around me very well. Some days are much worse than others in that instantly after I do something My brain throws out everything. 

I use to go to therapy for depression and anxiety. It’s hard for me to remember of course, but I think when I was in middle school and high school I was severely depressed. I don’t know if this has had a permanent effect on my brain? Moreover, I never seem to be able to focus on things as whenever I do it’s like my brain forgets it’s focusing on something.

Does anyone know how I should go about for treating this or even if I should? Should I go back to a therapist or try a different type of doctor?"
1622,someone tell me what this feeling is,"everyday, every few minutes my mind goes blank and all I can feel is sadness and dissapointment. Like a sudden reminder of loneliness or intense feeling of embarrassment. I cant talk and can't and don't want to move. Its like in the middle of doing something I just stop and hate myslef then slowly move back on. I want to know if other people go through this. Its getting so bad people are starting to notice me consistently spacing out. it hurts so bad please tell me whats happening to me."

I find myself agreeing with every negative thing they say or everything I can think of..... It goes as far as if someone accuses me of something, even if it's untrue and I know it, I find myself doubting the truth and potentially believing their lie.  


It's not that I don't know the truth, I suspect it's that the best way to prepare for pain is with pain.... and so I mentally hurt myself..  


Is there a term for this?"

I know how many depressed and suicidal persons there are and that I‘m nothing special but I just want to write down my numbness. I dont know where to begin.

1625,Advice for living on your own,"Im not sure if this is a good post for this sub reddit but I figured id ask here.

My sister is going to move away for school and live on her owb for the very first time. We are not close but we both experienced trama and are both in coucneling. 

To just kinda reach out to her I wanted to give her a giant card some money and a booklet. In the booklet I wanted to put some fun and helpful advice on how to adult. 

I was wondering what are some things you learned from adutling and living on your own that made life easier? Somethings you wished you knew before learning the hard way? Some tips and tricks to stay mentally healthy too?  Id love to stick in as much as possible. So what would you tell your past self as advicre to live your best life?"
1626,Being abused physically and mentally as a child affects my adult mental health,"So after whole pandemic started I've came back from university I'm studying in (different part of the country) back to my home. To my parents and my sibling. For the past 3.5 months I've been half-consciously avoiding any emotional attachment towards them (being at University far away let my emotions cool down a bit), by rejecting their attempts at connecting. But today I'm coming back to the city I'm studying in. And all I feel is overwhelming guilt and fear. I'm terribly scared that it's the last time I see them. It's really common fear for me. Feel it super often when I think about the three of them. When I was a child, my parents would often joke about them not coming back (mostly my father), or insinuate they are going to die soon. My father often after arguments and beating me&amp;my sibling up would go on a long walk and before going he would tell he ain't ever coming back. One time after huge argument he got some kind of asthma attack. He couldn't catch his breath. I was sure he is going to die and he is going to die because of what I've done. But fortunately nice man from the hospital came and made him calm so he could breathe again. One time also after an argument he came back home after his typical never-coming-back walk and took the biggest knife from the kitchen. He said sth about being gone forever before so when he stood there with that big knife I really thought he is going to kill himself on my eyes. He only cut off the cables.
So now, coming back to the main story. I have terrible fear of leaving everytime I'm leaving for university. It happens more often too, like if one of them ain't coming back home early enough. My brain starts to panic and I have the worst scenarios in my head. It's calmer when I'm at University city, I seem to detach from them a bit. But now, I was forced to stay with them, and my semi-conscious attempts to stop attaching back made my guilt and fear even bigger. So for the past week I've been crying myself to sleep and it even affects the only trully healthy relationship I have. I just can't focus on anything without obsessive thinking about my parents dying or sth bad happening and me not being here.
I'm really sorry for the chaos. I just really feel that I need help and I don't have anyone to support me with it rn."
1627,Any tips for not feeling isolated?,This weekend has been very isolating. My parents are gone for the weekend and my brother does not really interact with me when he is home and not at work. So I have been feeling extremely alone today. Anyone have any tips on how to not feel so isolated? I’m honestly open to anything right now.
1628,I feel younger than everyone my age?,"Howdy. I’ve been on reddit for YEARS and I think I’ve posted less than a dozen times, but isolation has made me reflect a ton on stuff I’ve been feeling recently.

I am 20 years old, I’ll be a senior in college this year. I’m pretty well accomplished and I have a great group of friends, but I feel so so different than everyone. It’s hard to describe. I feel like a don’t have very much agency over the stuff that I do, and that I’m a big ole phony. 

When I was in high school, I had everything pretty easy, I played sports, and my mom was always so proud at how much I “didn’t care about what other people thought”, and that I was fairly independent. I genuinely don’t think I was emotionally mature enough in high school to be introspective though, and I didn’t give a shit what people thought because I was still me own “main character”, and I didn’t even consider those around me.

Since being in college, I’ve become a lot more empathic because I have friends that I have to be there for. I’m sensitive now! Now my mom doesn’t really think that any of my struggles are genuine, and that she wants the “old, badass” me back. 

Because it’s taken me so long to be (what I consider) as a normally mentally functioning and empathetic human being, I feel behind somehow. I genuinely always feel like I’m 17 years old. I always think I’m too young to do cool things like other people my age. I have found that I always freak myself out of going on dates and speaking up at meetings because I am perceived as someone who doesn’t really have the capacity to do stuff like that. 

I’m not depressed, and I’m not clinically anxious, but I want to know if anyone even understands what I’m saying and feeling and if there’s ANYTHING I can do to prove to myself that I take up space like everyone else."
1629,sometimes i have “episodes”? i don’t understand them,"I have these “episodes” and I freak out and uncontrollably twitch with my arms/hands and punch/scratch myself super hard , and i feel really angry and upset . i felt like i was going crazy earlier. it’s usually when i get frustrated , or really anxious about a situation. i don’t reallly know why this happens . i just wanted to share"
1630,What's NLP?,I was looking for breathing exercises to help with my phobia of needles when someone mentioned NLP. I don't know what that means or if it's healthy. Can somebody explain? (Sorry if this doesn't belong here.)
1631,Facebook friend suggestions just sent me spiralling,[deleted]
1632,Wanting to self harm again,"Feeling full of emotions and unable to get them out. Talking doesn't help because I can't describe them. I feel like screaming all the time. I want to cut again but the only thing stopping me is the scar it would leave. I have some scars already and I don't want more, I hate them. I just don't know how to let it out."
1633,Low self esteem.,"Grew up not being the best looking and quite fat, and naturally I wasn’t popular and had no friends which people bullied me for. I’m 18 now 6 ft tall and 194 pounds, way too fat for Asian a standards. And all this wasn’t helped by the rejection I faced from girls I asked out.

I feel stuck in my own mind and still cry myself to sleep hating who I am. I really don’t know what to do...."
1634,I Question My Sanity,"I was in a very toxic relationship about a year ago and I still question if I'm a bad person because of the things she would accuse me of. I know I probably wasn't the best boyfriend to her but I don't know if the things she said about me were true or not. First incident was when I caught her cheating and she told me I was being overbearing and obsessive with who's she's talking to and who's she's with. Then she would bring in her friends in it and ask them if what she did was cheating and they all side with her and I just didn't know how to feel at that point and honestly I still don't know if what she did was cheating even if it sounds painfully obvious to others. She would also use the fact that she would cook for me sometimes or buy my food/gifts and use it against me saying she takes ""care"" of me. At the time I didn't notice how much she used that word until I looked back at our texts. There's been one thing that stuck with me, when we were breaking up She said I sexually assaulted her. I've tried with everything to remember if I had or not but I can't remember but I'm slowly starting to accept that I did do it, without knowing for certain and I feel so guilty everyday I want to improve as a person but another part of me wants to die because I feel like a horrible person but then knowing it was a gaslighting relationship I won't ever know if what she was saying was true and that's been killing me"
1635,my mom will probably die in the next 10 years,"My (20) mom (61) is no longer taking care of herself and her health and I don't know what to do. My parents separated around 10 years ago and my mom's health quickly deteriorated, she has depression but refuses to take care of herself because she's ""going to die anyways"". She smokes 3 packs of cigarettes a day, has cardiovascular issues (2 heart attacks), osteoporosis, migrated disks in her spine, basically more issues than I can keep track of. She takes around 20 pills daily. Her body is slowly giving out and I don't know what to do, I don't want to lose my mom so soon. She's the one that raised me and even though she can be disgustingly emotionally manipulative she's still my mom. She's given up on her life and just rots away at home. I managed to get her to a psychiatrist a few years ago but she stopped taking her meds and going to therapy because it wasn't ""helping"" at all. She's playing the victim card and wanting all of us to pity her and what my father has done to her. Every day when I look at her I'm just reminded how she'll probably never see me grow up and it really upsets me, living with her absolutely destroys me but I'm afraid something might happen to her when I'm not there. I just finished my first year at university on the other side of Europe, the entire time I was there I was worried sick that she would die and I wouldn't even have the chance to say goodbye to her."
1636,Lifes going to shit,Depressed. Possibly autistic. Bipolar as fuck. Sucks at coping with bpd. Im in an abusive relationship and can't get out. Now I'm throwing up my food and taking pills. I'm barely in high school. What the fuck did I do wrong. I have nobody to go to. No way to get help. I can't talk about this to anyone and even if I did I wouldn't get any help. I've already attempted 4 times in the past. I've had a clean streak but now it's getting so much fucking harder. God help me.
1637,Thinking,"I really haven’t been one to be emotional or even think about my mental health. Although I have an issue. Basically, for the past few years I feel as if I’m constantly thinking about how fake people are, and why people do the things they do. Which makes me have such a negative outlook on meeting people and even keeping communication with friends. Even things like me having a certain opinion I’ll look for people’s reactions to see why they would react and so on. It’s pretty hard to explain tbh just coming to see if anybody has the same problem??"
1638,It’s me. I’m the problem.,"My partner and I always fight. Today I realised I’m the problem. I am so used to shit going wrong that I can’t not be on the defence. 

I hate that the abuse I endured as a child has fucked me up for life. I’m on antidepressants but they only level things out. I’m never happy. I don’t remember what it’s like to be happy. 

I should just leave and take my problems with me, then I can’t bother, hurt or make anyone angry ever again."
1639,"Help, i cant sleep(serious)","Hi yall, im having bad sleep problems for couple months now.

1640,Need help comprehending,"With this post I seek nothing but an answer to my question. Which is “why?”. I’ll start off with my childhood. My dad left me at age 3, and this didn’t really bother my mom. I was around lots of gang violence and terrible people overall. All my stepdads beat me, but that’s not something that even begins to bother me today. I do feel like I lack the “fathers half” of being raised. Which is all the sports and whatever else. (Sports was an example. I do as many school sports as possible). Here’s where my memory gaps. I don’t remember court or what made me live with my grandma. I’m biracial (African American + Caucasian) my grandma is white. I had heavy slang because I was around “the hood” very often. My grandma always corrected me “it’s ‘with’ not ‘wit’. You aren’t a clown”. Down the line, in elementary school, I remember a girl saying my voice sounds weird. I feel like it’s because of my lack of that “hood slang” that my voice would go hand in hand with possibly. I do thank her, because I wouldn’t be as decently smart as I am today. From 2-5th grade I’d constantly act out and throw very big tantrums. Most were caught on video and we laugh at them today. My sister had also probably caught onto this and her tantrums/fits still continue to this day. I never had a good relationship with my sister. Constant back and forth annoying each other. There were grace periods, but very short. Fast forwarding to my middle school days, I had always been locked in the house in the country, but now I was able to walk to Dairy Queen on Friday’s and then go stay at my biological grandpas in town. I never put the pieces together at the time, but my grandma and bio. Grandpa had split and I haven’t yet asked why. Anyways, this is around the time telling your friends who you had a crush on was a popular thing. I remember I would have feeling for girls pretty strongly, and I was such a decently innocent child. One of my crushes had somehow found out, and not much happened. It was really just awkward between us for a few days. Eighth grade was a year that I’d changed. I didn’t mention previously that from 4-7th grade I’d been completely silent. I would barely even speak when spoken to, and I made no eye contact until my friends mother taught me it was rude. In eighth grade, I don’t remember much, but I finally got a girlfriend and was way more vocal with my classmates. The girl had a boyfriend as we were talking, yet I was completely oblivious. At the start of the relationship  I was warned by a lot of people that she would cheat. I just blew them off and went on with it.  I’m going to skip parts of the relationship, but to sum it up: my innocence was lost to this girl (I was still a virgin though). Nearing the start of the new year Several clues towards her cheating surfaced rapidly. One of my favorite examples, that I like to laugh at today, is when she created a fake message screenshot saying I gave permission to cheat like some cuck. The guy sends me the screenshot she sent to confirm, and It’s a picture of an iPhone conversation. Well, she had an Android. She definitely was not the smartest. This had pretty much launched me into my “I’m 13 and this is deep” fake depression. I started therapy and I was told it’s a type of ptsd, and my next girlfriend mocked this idea. My next girlfriend was this girl who broke up with my new best friend a few months before me and my girlfriend broke up. We were “best friend couples” or something. This girl and I had talked every night about how I was gonna find a better girlfriend, and we’d hangout when we could. She set me up with one of her friends who I didn’t really like, and I had to tell her the nicest way possible. I’m not going to lie and say I had fully liked my friends ex, but I played a game of chess with my feelings.(idk if that’s a good analogy cause I’ve played only once). This girl and I considered ourselves best friends, and I didn’t want to ruin things if she didn’t like me. I basically stayed neutral in showing any hints towards it. It’s pretty hard to describe. I ended up picking up none of her hints though, because she pointed it out when we started our relationship. This girl was actually the greatest I have ever been with, and this time around my ignorance sorta ruined it. We were basically the same as we were when we were friends. Later on in the relationship I did sort of get jealous because I was still inexperienced. After a few good months the relationship came to an end in an unexpected way. I’d recently done a prank on my friend (girl-A) with my other friend (girl-B). We pretended to be a kid in our class, who had legitimately done this before, and we asked for nudes and harassed the people who started messaging us. This was pretty funny at the time, but we undermined the fact that they said they were calling the cops. What was our response to that? We just logged off, and got on with our lives until this kid got punched for it. My best friend since I moved to town had done it while I watched 2ft away. I still wish I would’ve stopped it, but yeah I got community service and any charge I could’ve got was dropped. A few months later in my downward spiral I ran from the cops while under this thing. It was not very pleasant, but I got away. Before that, I was doing great in school, I had no friends, no girlfriend, and everyone called me sex offender for the first semester of my freshman year. No one really knew that girl-B had also been in on it. After getting winter break started. I hungout with the kid who I could’ve stopped from punching the perverted kid. He was heavy on weed so I ended up trying it. I would smoke with him quite a bit, and at one point we did get some laced with meth possibly. We just know it was just weed in that tinfoil crackhead pipe. Around this time I got back with my second girlfriend, and we can just ignore her for a bit in this section. (I did forget: my mom went to jail shortly after I started living with my grandma.). I tried to buy a weed vaporizer online, and my grandpa got the billing info or something. I got caught and was seen on the same level as my mom. One night it was too much and I called my mom to get me and I was supposed to move in with her again until I posted about it. My grandma swiftly changed her mind for some reason then got mad that I posted about it. Fast forwarding another few months. (Very briefly: the second time around with my ex was terrible. She had become very jealous and slightly emotionally abusive.).  I had friends throughout the summer that I’d always hangout with. They were basically a parallel universe version of my friends, but even my friends thought they were weird. I thought they were great though. I’d always smoke with them and we’d go to weird places in the country or show up to school events intoxicated. When the school year started I wanted another relationship pretty bad, and I ended up taking to around 6 different girls with none to succeed. I was pretty close to tying the knot with this one girl, but she was very indecisive. She said she needs a break so I talked to another girl. A few days later she changed her mind and so I was faced with a decision. Instead of being a decent human being i ghosted the other girl. Then a 3rd girl came in and I switched over to her. (This is a moment I regret to this day. I wish I could go back and choose none of them. They deserved to know what was going on, but I decided to leave them oblivious until later on. Nearing present day here, this girl that I chose over the other two was a bit old for me. Let’s just say she just graduated the year before. The main girl I talked to from my “summer friends” said she was perfect and I believed it. So we’ll skim over a lot until we reach the red flags. I got her a few gifts that I actually worked hard to buy. For example, I love guitar so I bought her a guitar with the best painting I’ve ever seen on it. It was themed around amazing grace, and it was just a sight for sore eyes. This girl smoked weed every single day, and I had been clean for months because of my negative experience with it. I did smoke with her a bit, but I feel like that was just a standard I couldn’t fulfill with her. One day she asked for money, so I gave her a 20 and told her keep the change, cause she was buying weed and they could get an extra gram. This gradually expanded into her passive-aggressively asking for money, and me giving her cash. After she got Apple Pay I started sending her money on there. In the midst of this she took my virginity. (I was told her body count was pretty high.. above my moms even, and man.. if you knew my mom.. haha). Anyways, I counted the money I sent her towards the end of the relationship, and I can safely say I spent near $300 on her out of my pocket. One day she wanted a break, and this was the final straw for me. My emotions were caught in a jumble. Swiftly, she changes her mind but the damage was done. This happened a second time with the break actually taking affect. I did get very suicidal, and insane. I sang in the mirror while I cut myself, and it was an odd thing to me after i snapped out of it. This is the first time I’ve ever gone crazy in a way, and it’s over something arguably so little. Things were just very dark for me, and I was too out of it to end things with her for good. Then all of a sudden I picked up a new hobby which was “hacking”. I dual booted Kali Linux onto my computer, and for about a month I was dead set on learning how to pen-test. I wouldn’t be on my phone for hours at a time. My girlfriend was mad and my friends confused. This died down a little bit though. My favorite summer friend helped me through the rough time I was having at the best of her ability, but it barely worked until my girlfriend finally broke things off herself. She did it because of how distant I was. During a lot of my mental breakdowns (basically) I’d mainly just sit there in a hazy state and stare at myself in the mirror. In worse situations I did cut. (I’m fine now, and I don’t do it). One time we decided to shower while on FaceTime, and she saw my cuts. She asked if they were scratches from a girl as if I had some bdsm kink idk. I replied no and she kept questioning but I felt to awkward to say. She got upset and wouldn’t talk to me so I told her finally. Her response: “you should’ve told me that the first time. I thought they were from a girl.” To which I apologized. She asked for the shirt I was wearing and I had to quickly wash the blood off. They were very small patches but noticeable. We never hungout except in her car, She’d been to my house a handful of times and I’d been to her house slightly more, but 90% of the time was outside of my house. When I got into the car to give her the shirt, I took it off, and she touched my cuts (on my left arm and the left side of my chest) and said she was still mad about it. I honestly felt like garbage about that. despite her being quite a toxic person I actually was really sad when we broke up, and I asked for all my gifts back and she gave them. It’s been one or two months since this happened. Ever since I’ve been glued to a computer optimizing my grandpas WiFi, and doing lots of mischievous things with what I’ve learned about pen-testing. I’ve picked up a bunch of healthy and fun hobbies like pen-testing, inventing using things like raspberry pis and arduinos, I still play several instruments, mountain biking, and photography. My Instagram account has never gotten too many likes, but as soon as I implemented some photos that meant something to me and reflected my mind. I went from 90-100 likes down to 10-20 likes. Before school abruptly ended. I had the reputation of the stupid kid that was actually smart. Except, a lot of people didn’t get the “smart” half of that. So I was just the loud and dumb kid for them.  Recently I came across a lot of the people who have thought that, and they seem kind of surprised. However, beyond all of this positivity surrounding me. I still find myself in a dark place more often than not. A lot of my past doesn’t bother me. I don’t like weed, I’m a bit more organized, and much more.  My summer friends all don’t talk to me. Nor do any of my friends. I still talk to my recent ex girlfriend, but I don’t get on any messaging platforms for hours at a time. To me, that feels unusual. I’m happy that I’m doing good for myself, but they sometimes don’t keep me busy for too long anymore. I don’t even answer my mom really. I got a new room inside of our garage storage room also. (A lot cleaner than what you’re probably imagining) I’ve gone days without seeing my grandpa who lives in the same house. He usually only sees me when I go to the bathroom or get something to eat. I don’t know how to comprehend a lot of my emotions. It seems obvious that I’m sad bout my breakup, but it feels like there’s something else. I did get into conspiracy and talking politics with my sister (who is veryyy left wing). I did for a bit, believe that the government does lie to us, and It’s inevitable really, but I believed it to quite an extreme extent. There was some uproar about the kkk coming to my town also (I’m one of three colored people in the town) so I was extra paranoid aswell. I felt like a man had a gun inside of Walmart and he was about to shoot me, and I kept close eye on his hands and such. He saw me looking at him and I think I looked pretty scared from the look he gave back at me. I tried to see if there was any steganography on the printer paper so I could track these people who advertised the kkk. I obviously had no luck. Because of my terrible grades I’ve also been taking amphet which is basically adderall. My grandma told the doctor it wasn’t working so my dosage was raised. I also had bug bites all over me and when my doctor prescribed a pill for it. My “government control” meter when off the charts. I don’t believe any of those conspiracies much anymore because I just gave up. There’s really nothing I can do even if I knew the “truth”. So if this is even able to be posted because of its length. My question is: why? What does it take to completely forget/remove whatever is keeping me in this hole? Is it because of something that happened previously in my life?I’d appreciate even 1 or 2 replies. Feel free to even share your similar experiences. I will try to attach some of my photos here aswell. Also sorry for any typos. Grammar/sentence structure is my strong suit, but I’m better with a computer or paper."
1641,"Constantly remembering my past mistakes, panicking, feeling the pressure to tell my bf about my every intrucive thought and suicidal thoughts. I'm a terrible person.","Two years ago, when I was 16 I've done a terrible thing and stopped when my bf told me that's fucked up. I won't go into details but at the time I thought I was doing nothing wrong and I'm super cool and quirky (Jesus Christ).


So I stopped and forgotted about it for almost a year but then, 8 months ago I had a panic attack for unrelated reason and that's when I remembered it. Now I'm 18


 From that day I have panic attacks or crying attacks every day. I fear I'm the same ducked up person I used to be and I'm convincing myself that's true. I have disgusting intrucive thoughts, they're causing panic attacks and I can't sleep because of them but the thought they wouldn't appear if I wouldn't be scared is comforting me.


Recently I almost succesfully convinced myself that I've changed and I don't want to do things I used to do. I thought this will solve all my problems but boy was I wrong. Not only I have to deal with what remained after that but I'm also panicking about cancer and cheating on my bf (he's not controlling at all). 


I'm panicking over things that happened months ago and then overthink it. Today I remembered a year ago I imagined me, my bf and my classmate having a threesome for some reason and I cried the whole day because of it, I feel like a cheater and terrible gf. I don't even like threesomes. I really want to tell my bf about it but first, I don't want to make him tired like I used to and seccond, I don't want to destroy his self esteem. I love him and he'll always be the most fantastic and handsome man in my eyes.


I feel like I should die, like I'm a bad person and I'll be hurting him or others and the world is better off without me. He deserves much much better. 


I also feel like I can't go to therapy because I deserve what I'm going through. I just wish I was dead or my brain would stop functioning properlly and I could just blanklly stare and hear everything but couldn't think."
1642,Molested by someone who was also being molested,"I’ve kept this secret for a while because I didn’t know how to cope. I’ve always felt like my story was weird so it’s hard telling people about it. After 16ish years, I still don’t know how to cope. Who to hate, who to blame. Anyways, when I was between the ages of 3-5 I was molested (specifically touched) by my female cousin. She is 3 years older than me. So she must’ve been 6-9 years old. I don’t remember how many times it happened I just remember one instance. The reason I think I remember it so vividly is because my grandmother caught us and literally beat us. Which I still don’t understand why she beat me considering the fact I was the one being abused. And when I say beat, I’m talking about she made us kneel on rocks, took a thick electric cable(like the ones on lampposts) and beat us with that for what seemed like hours. Anyways long story short, years later I learned my cousin was being abused by her step grandfather. I don’t know if he just touched her or if he ever r*aped her. I still talk to my cousin. We talk almost every other day. We have never talked about this and I don’t think we ever will. I’m just still very confused about what to feel knowing she probably had it worse. I don’t hate her, I honestly feel bad for her. What should I do? How does one even cope with something like that?"
1643,"Why is it I find myself preferring to sit, stare at the wall and think in my head about everything rather than watching netflix/doing something else","I always would prefer to watch Netflix/YouTube to silence the voices in my head and to distract myself.

1646,Going blind with a condition nobody scientifically has. But depression is something many have,Hello everyone I won’t say much about my personal information.  I’ve had a lot of medical health issues in my life and always suffered with depression and anxiety. I feel the last year I’ve actually been really good. However the last two weeks especially the last few days I’ve been fading back into that dark whole I was not my suicidal state I was but my depressed state and just can’t get out of it. I can’t just speak to anyone as I just lie as when ur comes to speaking to a professional I just lie as I know what they want to hear or due to stuff in the past I refuse to go as I don’t trust them anymore. I will go to a doctor for sight issue but I can’t go to a physiologist or something similar and I just feel lost. I feel lost any ideas or advice?
1647,My mom is making my life hell but I'm trapped living with her and I don't know what to do,"For context I'm a 21 year old male and my mom is 43.




My mom's horrible. She's drunk and yelling all the time and always has been, she gaslights me and says she never does anything wrong, throws fits when she doesn't get her way, smokes 2 packs a day in the house, insults me and puts me down, even though she knows how depressed and suicidal I've been for so long she doesn't seem to care.





All that matters in her world is herself, alcohol, and cigarettes.




She tells me I'm not doing anything with my life and am a failure because I dropped out of college (due to almost killing myself) and now she says I'll always be a nobody. She calls me fat, lazy, irresponsible, etc. When I was in the hospital she came to the rescue like she had cared all along but she never has clearly.




But I can't do anything about it. I don't have the money and won't for so long. First thing is I need a car and don't have that, and I'm working the best paying job I've ever been able to get but it's still bullshit pay. And all my student loan and medical and credit card debt (from me being an irresponsible idiot, yes) means I have almost nothing left over every month to save.




I have all these thoughts of hurting her but ultimately id just hurt myself. I don't have any family or friends to move in with either, but all the places around here cost too much. Even the absolute cheapest shitty places are out of my budget.




Please if anyone has any advice I'm at my breaking point."

1651,"If you need to talk, I'm here",If you need anything at all please dm me. I really want to help with anything I can and give back to the community that supported me so much.
1652,"After 17 years, I’m finally properly medicated","At 22 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and put on Zoloft. After 4 years it stopped being as effective and my new PCP decided I was bipolar and put me on Cymbalta and Lamictal. A couple years later a psychologist/psychiatrist (I always mix them up lol) said that I wasn’t bipolar, but I was reacting poorly to my anxiety, hence my outbursts. She put me on 3 meds, then took me down to 2. Over the past 8 years I’ve been on several different medications, some worked, some didn’t, some made me sick. This past January my new psychiatrist/psychologist put me on Vybriid and my whole world has changed. I’m cleaning the house and cooking dinner and going for walks. I have motivation for the first time in my life!!! My husband doesn’t feel like everything is on him since we got married 11 years ago. I’m finally an equal partner and it feels glorious. I’m just thankful that he dealt with my anxiety and depression issues long enough for me to get the proper help!!! 🥰"
1653,I feel bitter because I don’t have a social life on the daily,"I was at the pool today, watching young people having fun and enjoying themselves. I noticed I was the only person there swimming back and forth because I don’t know anyone at my gym. Then I got jealous/wanted to be part of a group but I’m shy and try to remain hopeful that someone will want to talk to me there (I’m 20 male)

I’m tired of being the “lone wolf”. I just want a friends group."
1654,Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?,"I am very prone to spiralling, or snowballing, when something bad happens to me. 

Recently, I've been getting into arguments with my mum and it's been making me feel like shit. She tells me I'm brainwashed, makes me feel stupid, and a lot more. When I brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology I got was a 'sorry you feel that way' 

This isn't something small, I don't think, but i also feel as though I'm overreacting, but that just makes me feel worse, and so the spiral begins.

And it always ends with a 'you should just kill yourself'. Almost always followed with a 'no you retard thats a bad idea' 

Because other than little things like that, my life is fine. I have friends, a loving partner (long distance atm), a roof over my head and hot meals. I'm fine. Yet I'm not. And, again, it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so, so badly, and yet I have the audacity to feel the way I do?

I do not want to bring any of this up to my mother. She would just gaslight me again. My partner knows, though, and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation. That's all I can ask for, right?"
1655,Scared I’m going to be abandoned/ghosted again,"(Idk if it helps but for reference I have Asperger’s syndrome and (suspected) ADHD) 

When Quarantine started I was really worried about how I’d cope, my routine at school and regular meet ups with “friends” there are what kept me going. For the first month or two I really struggled keeping myself sane but managed to get through and after that met a group of people online I’ve really connected with and found comfort in.

Only issue is I’m terrified they’re going to abandon me or forget about me. 

Okay, for some more context, I’m an extremely social person despite my lack of social skills, I love talking and hanging out with people who get me. Problem is they never seem to wanna hang out with me. It was probably year 8 (12) I came to this realisation and it kinda hit me like a ton of bricks. The thing is I’ve always had friends but never people who’d talk to me on a one to one basis and don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried so hard to make close friends but no ones ever really cared. 

If I ever want to go somewhere with friends, I’ve got to sort it out, I’ve got to pay or I’d never see them outside of school. And I don’t get why (though that’s an issue for another time).

My current “friends” from school, would never reach out to me and between the three of them over 2 years have hosted like 2 get togethers while I’ve probably organised 100+ because otherwise we wouldn’t ever see each other. And since quarantine started I haven’t talked to them because of my bad state of mind but at the same time it’s been 4 months and none of them have bothered either.

Now I have these friends I met online who I’ve really gotten close to really quickly. When we started talking we’d stay up together all night, talk for hours and hours but over the last month we probably now only talk for like an hour? Half hour every day? And I know I’m overreacting but I’m scared they’re gonna end up ghosting me like everyone else in my life has. They say they won’t but I can’t get out of that mindset.
How do I deal with this? I know they all have lives but I don’t do anything anymore, they are all I have."
1656,My friend dumped me?,"One of my closest friends told me she was done with me. She has severe mental conditions which we bonded over. I have done my best to be supportive, knowing how bad my depression is without any reason for it when she has plenty.

She told me it is a downfall of hers and not an issue with me. I understand that people can do just about anything because of depression. I'm not mad. Just kinda sad and confused. I don't know what to think about it."
1657,I have no spare time for myself and do much anxiety. It’s depressing the shit out of me,"I’m in high school so This may seem stupid because of the fact it’s only high school

I want to get a good degree In physics and need to get into a calculus class next year so I need to get above average grades in math.

All I have been doing is work and That’s about it

I normally talk to my friends and study at the same time but only a few of my friends like doing that so the rest I only go online with if I am playing a game with them.

Not just that but I want to ply some more games by myself like the new last of us game but don’t have the time. I also want to practice guitar cus I’m teaching myself that but again don’t have the time. I just keep on saying to myself it will be worth it in the end but it still depresses the shit out of me that Im not able to do some of this stuff I want to do. My teachers say how well I’m doing in school but I don’t feel achievement on anything. I don’t feel smart enough or I have done enough. I’m not suicidal or anything just fucking sad I guess. 

The only time I’m happy is if I’m talking to my friends and then other than that I’m miserable.


I have so much anxiety as well from school work. So much I feel physically sick everyday. And For about 2 years there has not been one day in my life where I am stress free. It’s mostly school work and that but other shit too

I don’t know what to do other than just power on through it. My family knows I’m stressed out but don’t know about anything else."
1658,My Parents Don’t Understand,"I told my mom I was always sad in 7th grade, all while having a panic attack and sobbing. She said that she used to also, and that everybody does. In 9th grade I would constantly “drop hints” to my mom saying how I was always so unmotivated and tired and just total drained, so she said to “drink more water”. After this summer I’m going to be in 10th grade, and yesterday I texted my mom while at a sleepover (with the encouragement of friends) a reaaaaally long message basically saying that I think I have anxiety and clinical depression and asked her to please not take me back to my pediatrician (whom is friends with my mom and doesn’t take anything I say as serious as it is and gives a weak solution). She responded that she would talk with my pediatrician, and she’s been telling me all day that “she feels bad when she doesn’t get good sleep either.” I’m at such a loss. I have a feeling that nothing is going to come from this, and it’s beginning to feel hopeless. My older brother told my parents and got therapy for like a year and is now on medication for his anxiety/depression (it HEAVILY runs in our family- another reason I can’t understand why she won’t take me seriously.) I’ve literally told her before that she keeps dismissing me, but she still does. What can I do to make her stop making me feel like a little kid?"
1659,What's wrong with me? I don't even know where to ask help.... sharing my ROCD stories. Help me,"Hello, I just want to share my rocd stories. And I desperately need help.

excuse my english please since I am not a native English speaker... and I'll talk about sexual topic so if you don't want to read, please skip.

first of all I have huge trust issues against men. from my cheating ex boyfriends and betrayals I've been through...
and, I've been diagnosed as major depression for 10 years, I am on anti depressants.

so, one of my biggest fear is being cheated on.
I have a boyfriend, we've been together for 1 month, recently we had sex. he brought 4 condoms and they were colorful. (purple, green, orange, yellow) lol
we used all of condoms, yellow, orange, purple before and green 2 days ago(sorry for t.m.i.)

but the memory was vague, I wanted to remember that we used the 4 condoms clearly but I couldn't remember clearly and neat, so I got very anxious and paranoid.

so I asked my boyfriend, 'did you use the colorful condom with someone else?, did we use all the condoms?' and my boyfriend dumbfounded and laughed, he said 'what? of course not! and yes, how do you not remember, we used the 4 colorful condoms together! purple, yellow, orange, green!'
and then I asked if he cheated on me and if he used the 4 condoms, only with me. 

of course he said he didn't cheat on me and I actually know we used the 4 condoms together... I really don't understand why my brain is working like this.🙁

after I wrote my symptoms down I am realizing I need help. thank you for reading my story. feel free to tell your opinion about my symptoms... also I give you folks virtual hugs. you are strong!"
1660,Low Self Confidence,"Ok, so this is a little uncomfortable for me to talk about but whatever... so I’m a naturally very sexual person, I think about it very often and oftentimes sexual/sexually romantic fantasies are my mental safe space and when I’m bored I tend to scroll through or watch porn for enjoyment. I could have some form of sex addiction but that’s not what I’m here about, I think. I always have a high sex drive and am almost always available and ready to do anything with my partner, even though I’m fairly inexperienced and often get nervous. The issue I’m having is that very randomly my self esteem or self confidence will drop to a near zero. I have a very bad diet and I don’t exercise which affects my libido and that definitely contributes a lot to how I feel.

 It’s worse when I’m alone, and since we are both students and live with our parents separately, that’s all the time. When this drop happens, I become for the most part, repulsed by sex. I feel hate towards myself and can’t even masturbate most of the time, and I know that it’s a very good thing to do for stress especially.

 It’s so uncomfortable whenever this happens and I’m not sure how to deal with it or how to build up my sexual self confidence and my self esteem.
My self confidence is low in general when it comes to anything other than sex, so it’s extra low during this time.

Does anyone else experience this? And if so, how do you manage it? I appreciate any input.

1661,Any tips on how to find a girlfriend?,"I'm in my 20s, so I'm way too old to be posting something like this, but this is Reddit so fuck it.

The issue I'm having is all the people at my job are guys, and with this pandemic all the AA meetings and even churches in my area are closed.  I'm kind of weird and nerdy, so I don't necessarily fit in with mainstream society.  I don't use Facebook because I don't really have a large social group that I care to inform of my every thought and action...and social networks are designed to be addictive and are psychologically unhealthy.  Inadvertently, I'll compare myself to the inaccurate projections of sheeple that arguably don't exist.

I mean, they exist, but the way people portray themselves on Facebook doesn't line up with reality.

I bought new clothes and I'm starting to buy nice shit, but beyond that I'm out of ideas.  Am I supposed to walk around aimlessly until someone talks to me?  I mean, I'm no ken, but I'm not a monster.  Any pointers?

I know this is kind of pathetic, but I eventually want to start a family.  I don't want to die alone, and my isolationist tendencies obviously won't get me there.  I'm no longer crippled by my social anxiety, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do."
1662,Where to go if suicidal ideation is a constant not a momentary blip.,"Posting on behalf of my partner with their permission and oversight.

When seeking help if my partner mentions their suicidal ideation then they will be pushed towards if not forced into being institutionalized. Taking them out of their life and being put in holding for 72 hours is both not going to cure them nor is it going to help and when it's all said and done it will likely actually be harmful for them. So how do the seek out help and start working their way towards being healthier mentally. 

I've had my own experiences with depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, self harm, etc however mine were never constant and at this point in my life I have pretty good control over my mental health however that's really all I have to go on to attempt to help them on my own. Where do you fucking turn when you have to lie to get any form of help that doesn't rip you from your life and expect that to be the solution because suicidal ideation is just a blip for everyone so you just gotta get through it then you're all good on the other end."
1663,I can’t deal with this anymore!,"I’m furloughed with no end in sight because of the pandemic. I hardly ever leave the house because to do so requires a valid reason, which I never have. 

I feel my sanity slipping away little by little. I am an outcast already. I can’t remember the last time I was genuinely happy about anything. 

In all honesty, I’d resist an armed robber just for an adrenaline fix. If that gets me killed, so be it. I don’t care if I live or die."
1664,"Sometimes, i think i’d love to die. but it’s mostly because i desperately want attention.",that’s it that’s the post
1665,I’m confused and am about done.,"I’m a very emotional person, but I can never really tell anyone. I act extremely tough around my friends and other people so they don’t pick on me but I’m really sensitive. I have a pretty big friend group and I always tell them how much I appreciate them, but I never heard it back. I have a lot of issues with myself, I have bad anxiety, depressed and I have aspergers. I get called retard everyday, no one cares about me they just use me as a joke. I recently found someone I really liked and they made fun of me, saying I like a man or “oh she’s looks like a guy, your dating a guy”. I went to counseling, but then I just got put in a hospital it made me feel crazy. I need someone to care about me, I’m about done..."
1666,My fucked up family is why I’m mentally unwell,"I (25f) spent the day with my mom, my older sister, and my niece. In the morning my mom had one of her usual freak outs because things weren’t going her way (we wanted to leave earlier than she did to go swimming) so she was screaming, stomping, slamming doors, etc. While my mom was never physically abusive and never said mean things to us, she always did behave this way and she sees nothing wrong with it. Her and my sister were yelling at each other, my niece was crying, and I was there trying to calm my mom down. 

This whole thing made me really upset not because it was shocking, ‘cause like I said I’m used to it, but because in that moment I realized that growing up in a house like that is the reason that I am the way I am. And on the flip side, my dad doesn’t talk about his feelings. When he’s upset, he’ll ignore you. Flat out. So I had two parents who never showed me how to properly manage my emotions, or told me that my feelings were okay. Any time I was upset I was yelled at or punished for it, which I think contributed to my social anxiety. 

And so to tie that into another problem I have of desperately wanting a meaningful romantic relationship, I also realized that it’s because even though my parents, siblings, and extended family loved me, I’ve never felt truly heard, held, and supported unconditionally and without judgement. So because of that I have sometimes felt like I wasn’t truly loved. And I want to be loved. We all do. I know that my family will not change, so it’s something I want to find for myself. I want to find that security and peace that has been missing my entire life. I’m realizing that it doesn’t have to be romantic after all, but just someone. Someone to help me not feel so alone in my fucked up family."
1667,Any advice on how to express my anxiety to my family without being written off?,"I’m going to preface this by saying that I do have diagnosed anxiety, and the specific fear I’m going to talk about may sound completely ridiculous to some. I understand my issues may seem minuscule compared to others, but I really need help, and thinking like that only makes it worse.

I’m allergic to tree nuts. I have been my entire life, though the panic attacks are more of a recent development.  It’s never been fatal for me, the worst reaction I’ve had is the worst stomach ache I’ve ever felt. Never anaphylaxis or anything severe. As a kid, I had the same laid back attitude towards it as my parents - I never even checked nutrition labels. I was diagnosed with anxiety in middle school (specifically centered around socializing), but I never noticed that anxiety in any other facet of my life. Until I accidentally ate a bread dip with walnuts in it at a restaurant. My throat got all itchy and, once I was informed on the allergens, I began to panic. That was the first time I’ve had a panic attack over food. Ever since I’ve been obsessive. I check labels constantly, at minimum triple checking the ingredients list and the warnings at the bottom. At restaurants, no matter what type of food, I bring up my allergy somehow so they can warn me about possible contamination. If I don’t check, if I don’t know for sure, I panic. Even if they assure me I’m okay, I worry that they don’t take it seriously. I’ve always been very subtle, i tend to react internally, but I’ve gotten close to fainting. I know, it sounds absolutely ridiculous. Trust me, I’ve heard it all before. 

However, the main issue is that my family does not understand the extent of this fear of mine. It’s been going on for at least 2 years now. They’ve noticed me being uncomfortable, but have done nothing except for tease me and, if I’m lucky, maybe try to ease my anxieties. A part of that is my fault, I’m not very easy to read and I’ve never truly communicated the extent of my anxiety. But at this point I’m too scared. I feel like I’m going to be ridiculed. And I don’t totally blame them, my fear is unfounded and illogical. I know I won’t die. But I’m scared. Every day I live afraid and I just don’t know how to tell them how much it hurts to be bullied for something I have no control over. 

I just want to stop resenting them and tell them the truth. I love them, I know they mean well, but I can’t do this anymore. Any advice on how to express this to them in a way they will understand? In a way that sounds serious that they won’t laugh off? Or, if anybody has any experience like this, how I should deal with my anxiety?"
1668,I need help forgiving myself for spanking cat.,"When I was 12 or 13, my cats were mean. All of them would attack or bite me when I’d pet them or play with them, and one would run around the room and bite me if I tried getting it out. I used to spank them. I’ve never caused permanent damage, I’ve never hit them hard enough to cause pain extreme enough to cause permanent or even lasting damage. It was in the moment spanking. I don’t do it anymore, and I won’t do it again. I can’t seem to forgive myself and I need reassurance. I’m not a bad person, I just have a short temper with cats."
1669,Thank you for all the support here,"Means a lot for all the support here. Definitely makes me feel like I’m a lot less alone, being suicidal and stuff."
1670,"Unusual question, but I'm wondering if I've done irreparable damage to my mental state","So, I take in a lot of horrible stuff. True crime, gore videos, countless horrible stories about things that have happened to people. I've seen things that still keep me up at night years later, just lying in bed thinking about horrible trauma people have gone through. No wonder I'm depressed. But I don't want to be this way anymore. I realize now thatinsatiable curiosity is not healthy, and no matter how many terrible things I watch, It will never help the victims and it certainly harms me. Now I'm worried I've done irreparable damage to my mental health. What do?"
1671,I think i need to get help.,"Hello, i think i might need to see a doctor about my mental state. i have not been doing well over the years and hadnt realized it really until i was 22 years old, im 25 now. i have no insurance and dont know what to do. i live in the united states, indiana."
1672,I finally made a therapist appointment,"I'm struggling with mental disorders as long as I can think of.   
I already did therapy my whole life till I was 18 and stopped there due to several reasons. But i was never actually opening up to my therapists because my parents dragged me there and i was trying to hide a lot (eating disorder, self harm, suicide attempts, etc.). So I barely told them what's going on with me, just as much so they would think I'm opening up but in fact I wasn't...  
To my own unfortunate I'm a pretty good liar.

For the following 4 years life wasn't easy and I've put my apprenticeship over my mental health over and over and thought because of that, I wouldn't have the ""time"" to continue therapy.   
This eventually would make everything worse.

In fact i was trying to avoid it, because I knew opening up is going to be a tough one... (there's a lot of trauma I wasn't ready to approach just yet.) But now my mental health is at it's lowest and I know that I can't go on like this. I came to the realization that I would need professional help to deal with my problems at this point.

So I've made an appointment with a therapist in my area. This time with the intention to actually open up.   
I don't want to be like this anymore. I want to be happy.  


The appointment is in 11 days. I know the first one isn't going to change anything.   
Just introduction and getting a picture of the problems. But I really want to get better.  


So wish me luck guys, maybe this is the start of a change."
1673,About to eat my last meal,"Good burger, some fries, and a milkshake. Afterwards I'm gonna watch some TV, maybe have a few drinks and end it.

Thank you guys for being so nice to me.

1678,I'm a little okay with my body now,"For as long as I can remember I haven't been happy with my body. Everytime I looked at myself in the mirror I'd think ""my boobs are too small, my hip dips are too deep, I'm not skinny enough, my face isn't good enough, my butt isn't big enough, too many stretch marks... This is not the body I want."" 

I kept comparing myself to all these beautiful girls on social media (I still do) and getting super jealous. It doesn't help at all that I have a super dry skin. My torso, hips, sides of my chest, inner arms and inner thighs are dry, patchy and a little darker colored. I don't know if it's a skin condition, both my siblings have it too.

I have been working out for almost 5 years now and the changes aren't even that drastic. I can see the muscles developing, I'm getting toner, but I do feel better physically.

I know I'm not going to be 100% happy with my looks but I'm slowly getting there. My goal has always been to go to the beach wearing a two piece bikini and feeling super good with myself. I know this is that big of a deal but I really wanted to share it with someone."
1679,Second guessing every,"Sooo, I'm just gonna tell the majority of what's going on with me at the moment. Basically I have a very close group of online friends that I've known for over two years. We generally hang out on voice chat and vrchat sometimes. Recently after one of my closest friends asked out my closest friend, and getting caught up in the middle of the fallout. I've been constantly second guessing every friendship I have with these people. For example last night we were on vrchat, the mentioned closest friend was talking to someone else. A voice in my head kept on telling me that she doesn't care about me. This has happened to me multiple times. Thinking that nobody gives a shit about me.

This has been going on for a month now and has cause some problems about me overthinking situations and causing more damage. Right now I'm in a good spot, but I'm afraid that if I second guess all the time, sometime I'm going to overflow and cause damage to my friendships, and I don't think I would be here today if it wasn't for my friends.

I'm asking for any advice or maybe a possible name for what's going on so I can get help."

1682,The thoughts that go through my head before I fall asleep (slight rant :/ ) need some support honestly..,"Honestly, I feel empty. I know I’m cycling through my bp2 and I just want it to end soon, I’ll go from being okay to just depressed in literally minutes. I don’t now why, well I do but I just still don’t understand.. the meds I’m on help a lot more than before when I took latuda, I do feel calm, but empty inside.. and I really wish I just knew what this was stemming from. That’s what makes me the most upset, not knowing why besides the fact I’m not getting enough dopamine&amp; seasoning release, it’s just.. pain. I want to be happy like I was when I was 5 or 6, playing light saber battles with my 2 best friends, Lauren, and Weston. We lived on the same street just one house down each way, we hung out everyday. Weston died in 2016 of cancer and  my heart has been sad ever since. Ever since my grandma and popop died. They were my second parents.. they were the best people that ever lived to me. My idols, who I want to form myself after. They were brave, courageous people who suffered greatly in the teens-40s, my popop died at 102, I was told he stayed alive for me. When he had serious dementia, he only knew me. Not his wife or kids, just me.. I loved him more than anything. He’s my hero, my grandma was my best friend in the world, she was so intelligent. She died extremely unexpectedly the day before we were supposed to have our annual Friday night sleepovers. It shattered me to pieces. I fear something bad will happen to my family, my dog, who was my best friend in the whole world died February 16th 2020. I’m suffering inside, I miss them more than anything. I didn’t even say goodbye to my grandma, I’m sorry for the rant I just needed to say this. I just feel so empty without them here. If they were here, I feel like I wouldn’t be as hurt in my mind. Both sets of grandparents died so close together and it hurt me so badly, I couldn’t bear it. I miss them. I would do anything to cuddle with my baby happy, my dog. She was the light of my life, my little baby, I would do anything for her, she was with me through every single bad thing that has traumatized me. Anyways. I’m sorry for the rant again, I just needed to let this out. I just hope heaven is real, I want to see them again. I need to."
1683,Who do I see to get evaluated for possible mental illnesses?,"I don't want to make this post too personal or long but I think for at least the last 10 years I have had depression, and always had anxiety. I've never actually been formally diagnosed, but something I've always suspected. On top of that, I've had sleep issues for at least the last 5 or so years. Also last July I got injured playing sports which caused my leg to be amputated. It wasn't traumatic in the sense that I'm mentally scarred or depressed from that but I find myself having my anxiety, depression, and insomnia increased. On top of that, I think I might have some sort of PTSD as I'm extremely laid back, but I find myself way more inward and outwardly angry to the point where I actively think about verbally yelling (and already have) at my new coworker and boss. Granted there's a long story and a few reasons, but I'm used to keeping my emotions in check. I just moved cross country and my old job and position allowed me to go to unlimited talk therapy twice a week (for free), but this new job I'm struggling to even get approved to be allowed physical therapy despite telling them I'll only take the position if I could continue those things and ADA existing... but I digress.

While I don't think it's super important for me to be diagnosed, I do think it may be helpful from the standpoint of at least getting medication assuming I can't go to therapy. Does anyone know who I need to go to or what I need to do to have a formal evaluation?"

I've been diagnosed with major depression and my family since then has constantly called me crazy or ""mad man"" in Jamaican terms, and have done things for the sole purpose of messing with me. It's not as bad now as it was before but I feel like something is wrong with me, and I'm scared to go to a doctor because I know they're going to just do it all over again."
1685,Weird thoughts,"I am 16 and very recently I have been having random paranoid thoughts. Yesterday I spent a night at my friend's house and when I went in their bathroom to go change my immediate thought was to think ""are there hidden cameras in here.""

After that I slept for 15 hours after being exhausted and today I went through multiple mood swings about every 30 minutes. I went from happy to depressive extremely frequently. During one of these I think people are trying to manipulate me and that I'm being brainwashed by people. I also thought that mosquito bites must have given me a parasite or a disease and that's why I'm acting this way. These are not normal I'm aware. I have forgotten to take my antidepressants Prozac I believe in 3 days so if that has anything to do with that oh well."
1686,How to stop suicidal thoughts,"I'm 23 (F), and most of the time I think of the ways about ending my life. I imagine hurting myself by slitting my wrist, banging my head so hard  on the wall that my skull will burst and blood will come out. Sometimes I slap myself uncessarily, even imaging these things gives me immense pleasure n peace. About 10 months ago I made a cross( ×) on my wrist with glass and I just want to something like this again on my body. Besides this I also suffer from anxiety attacks. I have never consulted any doc about this, I really don't know what to do how to come out of this darkness. PLEASE HELP"
1687,Are therapist on PsychologyToday better quality than those in-network?,"Assuming both therapists can treat the problem you're dealing with, for example PTSD, have you found it true that therapists in-network tend to be less effective than those out of network? Is that why they are willing to accept insurance and get paid less?

So if you have the money and are willing to spend $100+ per session more for the out of network therapist if it means better quality, would you say it's better to go with an out of network therapist on PsychologyToday instead of one who is in-network but not on PsychologyToday?"

1689,Is this DID?,"I've been searching for some kind of label that describes my experience and I can't find one. I don't think it's true Dissociative Identity Disorder, but that's the best description I have at this point. I feel like I have only existed for about five years, before that someone else lived in this body. There was a period of time where those two identities wrestled with each other and I eventually won. And I feel guilty about that, like I don't deserve to be here, taking over someone else's life. I completely dissociated from my past, I didn't feel anything towards my friends and family, I had to get to know them all over again. It's a horrible, confusing experience and so far I haven't found any therapist who can help."

1693,I'm not sure how to help myself out of this,"So, I just want to see if anyone experiences the same thing and has any way to deal with it. 

I (f24) have some sort of a fear of something randomly hitting or cutting my face time to time. Sometimes when I'm walking down the street it hits me out of nowhere and I feel like covering my face in instant. It lasts a few minutes and then it disappears just like that.

It doesn't happen always but I can feel that it started to happen more and more. Currently I'm overseas and I can't seem to find an affordable way to talk with a professional in here. 

My friend, who is on her way to become a psychologist said it sounds like anxiety yet we couldn't really talk about it much. Does anyone experienced something like this before? Thank you."
1694,Having a panic attack triggered by this relationship I’m trying to rekindle,"Recently reconnected with my ex girlfriend of 3 years. We made out one night and felt like everything was back to normal. I had moved cross country for a job and fell into a bad pit of constant panic attacks and depressive episodes and substance abuse and ended up ghosting her and completely losing myself for a few months. 

I had to move back home bc of corona and i gave her back some of her stuff and we talked for hours and hours like old times then talked about our relationship and made out and decided to take it a little bit slower this time. 

We’d broken up before due to me falling into a depressive and substance abuse episode. But I sobered up and got better and we were friends for a few months, but I’d always have really bad panic attacks about jealousy. Being jealous and feeling really low self worth when she was hanging out with a guy friend. 

So right now we’re taking it slow and making sure that we actually have a healthy relationship this time and don’t get too obsessed with each other. 

And I saw one of her guy friends on her story and it took me right back to where I was last year. 

I’m gonna talk to her about it tomorrow, because my big like anxiety thing is that I don’t know if she’s been with anyone else or if she like thinks we’re like not saving ourselves for each other or something idk. I’ve always been madly in love with her and never wanted any other women. Even during the times we were apart I couldn’t bring myself to even kiss somebody else, it just felt wrong. 

And it’s fucking me up because of how everybody seems to just hook up with people without caring for others feelings and I want to trust her but I have no way of knowing. Like my friends talk about people doing stuff like that. And that if you aren’t in a relationship it’s okay to sleep with other people and stuff. And maybe I’m just old fashioned or something but I like the idea of only being with one other person. 

Idk. Tomorrow I guess we’ll talk and I’ll bring it up like an adult and tell her that Id like to know if she’s been with anybody else or if she sees us as like exclusive or whatever. Because I see it that way and I haven’t been with anybody else and I like to think she hasn’t either, but I’ve never directly asked her about it and I deserve to know, since it impacts my view of our relationship drastically. Right? Idk. I doubt myself a lot."
1695,Video games are impacting my mental health negatively,"I seriously need help. For years now I have been hooked onto the Fifa franchise, for those who don’t know, it’s a soccer video game. I have played this game ever since I was 9 years old (now 18) and it’s just something that has become a part of my life. Here’s where my problem lies. I am at a point where i behave beyond reason because of this game. I become irritated, angry, sad. I make terrible financial decisions by spending more and more money to make my team better. I destroy my controllers which causes me to spend even more money. I can’t seem to see myself without this game, but it’s ruining me inside. And now all I seem to be riddled with are thoughts that I’ll never be good at anything because Fifa was the one thing I feel I am good at."
1696,At a new low while living with parents...,"Hey guys. I (26F) lost my job and moved back in with my parents temporarily until I find a new job, which could be a little while til I find something good. Very shortly after I moved back in, my dad, who has bipolar, got into a manic phase and stopped taking his meds. Long story short, things got out of control and we had him involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. He eventually stabilized enough to be functional and go back to work but is still in a mild mania. He and my mom have had marital problems over the years, partially related to his bipolar and partially just major personal differences. When my dad is slightly manic, he pushes all of my mom's buttons even more and she is always getting frustrated with him. This has led to a nearly constant tenseness in the house, sometimes with them arguing and fighting, sometimes just passive agressiveness. They will each make private comments to me about the other and I have made it clear multiple times that I don't want to be put in the middle of things. I can see both sides and feel like I know what they need to do but it's obviously not my place to be counseling my parents, nor do they want me to do that. They're just frustrated about each other but don't see how to fix the issues. I have told both of them multiple times that they need to seek counseling individually and together because they HAVE to work through things, but they always end up putting it off and not doing anything to really try and resolve their issues. I am a sensitive person who HATES being around tension and fighting, so I just completely shut down anytime that has gone on. I also am recovering from the trauma of my dad's major manic episodes and being in this continually difficult situation that I have no control over only seems to be making things worse. I'm getting more and more unhappy but can't afford to move out. I can get away to spend the night at a friend or relative's house when I need to, but I know that isn't a permanent solution. I did start seeing a counselor but being in so over my head i feel like a meeting once a week just isn't enough. Does anyone have advice on coping/survival skills to get me through until I can move out, or anything else I should be doing for myself or for my parents? I'd also like thoughts/your experience processing and healing from trauma and similar situations. Simple words of encouragement and support will be much appreciated as well. Thanks in advance, Reddit community :')

Tl;dr I'm in a really low point due to a distressing home life. Looking for thoughts on coping skills, encouragement, and other advice to get through this period!"
1697,Could I be bipolar? Something? I'm just trying to figure this out...," So I have noticed that sometimes I will go several days and be happy that whole time, and then suddenly something negative happens, or something happens with someone I love that triggers me feeling anxious and like I'll lose them and it can ruin my mood for several days. For example, sometimes I will feel like I am loved and cherished and then a friend can say one negative comment or can react badly to something I do, or I do something embarrassing and it will ruin my mood for days. 

And sometimes it takes serious work to dig myself out of the low points, like talking with myself, talking with my friends, talking with God, but other times (and more often here lately) it's like I'll sit and try to talk myself through it for hours and then I will have some random thought that appears almost like a ""realization"" and it's like a switch flips in my brain that very second. 

Sometimes the ""flip switch"" even gives my a physical feeling along with it. Like today for instance, I've been upset for two days over the fact I \*might\* have embarrassed myself while drinking, and suddenly I thought of something someone else did embarrassing and realized... I did not care. And nobody cared what I did. Suddenly I got tingles all over my body and I felt a weird sensation in my head and it's like the bad mood was just... gone. I had a hard time believing I had felt that way. Why was I so embarrassed over something so stupid I \*may not have even done\* when I could not give anything less what the other person did?

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I will go for weeks and feel so sad and like this world isn't worth being a part of, and randomly over the course of a few days and sometimes instantly I will get to feeling good again, but when I get into the good and okay feelings it really feels like I just woke up and all the negativity was a dream and almost like it didn't actually happen. Sometimes I just can't understand why I get as bad as I do... like there's a disconnect somewhere between the moods and almost like it's two different people because we cope with stuff in entirely different ways and have whole different outlooks and perspectives... if you made it this far thanks for reading. Any kind of comment or advice is appreciated."

1699,"I'm not suicidal, just finding it hard to keep up the will to live","It's been tough. Family has been very toxic lately. Taking care of my child has been difficult. The career is on a halt. Spouse is struggling with his career. I would never do anything to myself, and I don't have ideations or anything, but sometimes living is just so hard. I don't really know how I'm gonna get through the rest of life if it is so mentally and emotionally exhausting."
1700,This is evil..,[r/RadicalMentalHealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalMentalHealth/) is a dangerous subreddit that denies the existence of mental illness and the whole psychiatric field. They brainwash mentally ill people by making them believe psychiatrists are monsters and that the medications cause only harm.
1701,"I really need help finding resources right now. I’m at the end of my line. I don’t wanna die, but I don’t wanna live.",
1702,I feel like I'm worthless.,"Im sorry but I'm suicidal and so if you have any nice words I'd love to hear them, thanks. I feel worthless and I don't even understand why. again I'm very sorry about this I just would like some small compliments thank you"
1703,I feel like I have different personalities/alters. Is this normal?,"It's not DID because I have full memory of what's happening. But there are times where I feel like I have different people in one body. And they are polar opposites.

It gets uncomfortable, because for instance I would be with a group where I was quiet and timid and then my other side comes in the next day, then I feel extremely trapped. It feels like I'm living in another person's life. But I have the full memory of it.

There are times where I feel uncomfortable with my gender or my outward appearance. And people have told me my actions and tone change from time to time for absolute no reason. I could be laughing and giggling then full on serious and emotionless in the next second without even wanting to. (Kind of like having a on/off emotion switch)

I react differently and talk differently it's weird and sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy.
I have gone through some sort of trauma when I was 8~9 years old not to mention I've been feeling like this for 17 years.

Does anyone have an explanation for this or is this natural?"
1704,"I put on a happy face during the day, but I have cried myself to sleep every day for years",When do I give up on ever being happy and just end it all?
1705,Could someone help me with this,"Basically, I’m gonna keep it short. I cringe at a lot of stuff, like I can’t watch a movie about romance without cringing and finding it weird. I find it weird when people make themselves vulnerable and show emotion, I guess. Also I find it repulsive when people are optimistic. 

Is this insecurity? How can I get over this? I am currently in a very toxic school, as in you get ridiculed for making mistakes and stuff. I think this has caused me to curl up into a shell, with barriers constantly up. How can I escape this?"
1706,"Fat, ugly, and moved to new city right before Covid started, so have had no meaningful social interaction since February","I have always had depression issues but things got worse in grad school, my health went to shit due to poor rating and no exercise, since I was working full time while also going to school. I had a few months where I only got on average 4 hours of sleep per night. Then I got a job in a city where I knew no one and moved.

Then Covid happened and I have basically only interacted with my coworkers via email and called my parents who don’t know how to actually talk without lecturing or complaining.

I am trying to eat better and have been running but I realized even if I lose weight, I will never be able to go swimming or to the beach due to horrible stretch marks I have, because of the rapid weight gain. 

And my face will still be my face. Which having no current contacts in this city means I would have to due online dating which is impossible for  guys that are &lt;5s .

So am faced with either just living alone for the rest of my life or just giving up now."
1707,Feeling are hard,"I'm 30 and I never had any kind of feeling towards anyone, I mean i obviously love my family and really like my friends, but I've never really understood deeper or more complex feelings like love. 
I don't really know where my actual disposition  and where coping mechanism begins though.... i mean I have a pretty big hunch that my really low self esteem plays a big role in this, it imposes me to take some distance from others in order to maintain my facade, I know i dont have a chance so in order to not get rejected and get hurt I simply don't even develop interest in others.
But frankly I really struggle to grapple any kind of complex emotions, to a point were I started to question if I become emotionally dumb from  the depression and anxiety that I'mgoing trough...
Or maybe I'm just like this, there are plenty of people who have sociopath tendencies or simply on the spectrum and I can't rule out this possibility since I can't be one hundred percent objective about myself. 
I just sincerely feel empty, a shell of what a person should be, and I don't know if that's just the result of me not being able to idea of person that I have, or have been conditioned to have, for myself or if it's actually a yearning for something that I can't put a name to."
1708,Occssional self-loathing - normal?,"Hi everyone

I’m a 21F. I didn’t know where else to ask so I came here. I’ve been experiencing altering feelings of confidence and self-hate. Often times I would wake up in the morning feeling very confident and accomplished, even special etc, later that day that feeling turns into guilt, thinking how I even dare to think of myself so highly and feel good about myself, feeling worthless. Sometimes I don’t even know if there’s a reasonable trigger. Yesterday I had a relatively good night out on my own just hanging out at a bar and talking to people, when I got home I felt like I’m embarrasing and should never go out or talk to anyone again. These mood swings happen on a regular basis, usually once a week if not more often. Is anyone experiencing similar feelings? I’m not sure how to cope and feel about this. Thanks and hope everyone is well."

1710,Mental Health/Sociopathy question.,Long story short I am 20 years old (21 in a few months) and since this quarantine started I really started thinking about who I am as a person and what I want. For some reason the thoughts of me being able to use and manipulate people can’t to mind. Like I knew ways to manipulate people and almost started thinking like a sociopath. Almost like I’ve been in solitude for soo long I just felt I will always be like this. So why not get what I want if I’m going to be alone like this (if that makes sense). Although my question comes when my moral compass kicks in. So my question. Is it normal to think that at any moment I could turn off my moral compass and become basically a sociopath? Also no I have never acted on my sociopathic thoughts because of my moral compass I said above. Thanks for your responses!
1711,Had a panic attack and been feeling really strange ever since...,"So never had a panic attack before this year (34 M). Had a lot happen in the last 6 months and definitely had a lot of stress and significant life upsets to deal with.

Has little panic/anxiety attacks earlier in the year and, while scary, was at home and they only lasted 10 mins or so.

In Thursday  night after going for work drinks (where i definitely drank too much) i got home to find myself without my bag, coat, keys etc. Was very cold and raining- don't remember too much but after an hour or so i got in touch with a friend who lives in a different city and was basically hysterical saying i didn't know where i was or what was happening (which is really unlike me as genuinely a very calm and stable person).

Without going in to too much detail was in this constant state of panic for about 2 hrs and then another friend got me and took me to a hotel.

Since then i have been feeling really odd - been feeling absolutely exhausted, been feeling as if i am constantly shaking and when i went to the supermarket today i felt really like nervous or anxious being outside. Never had anything like this before and not sure if it is something that will just pass or not.

Anyone had a similar experience and able to shed any light?"
1712,Did anyone else really dislike the movie “365 Days” and got upset with it. (i’m a rape survivor),"So if you don’t know, the plot of this movie is fifty shades of gray meets beauty and the beast. 

Basically the mafia boss kidnaps her and gives her 365 days to love him and basically he achieves this (i didn’t finish the ending cuz i started crying) by yelling at her, tying her up, calling her a whore for almost getting raped by one of his friends, buying her a bunch of expensive shit, taking her to the most expensive places, and having another girl suck his pp in front of her. 

Idk this really reminded me how i got pushed down and raped by a guy with the same dom power and he poked holes in the condom to get me pregnant so i can fall in love with him and this movie makes me so uncomfortable.

I think it’s fine if you like it, i just needed to rant about it cuz i’m upset about it and it’s really late at night and no ones gonna listen."
1713,PLEASE JUST TALK TO ME,I CANT STOP CRYING WHY WONT ANYONE TALK TO ME?
1714,Please read this. (Specially parents),"Telling someone who suffers from anxiety that he or she is crazy will only make things worst. We're not crazy, we need someone who can understand us, who can comfort us and the one who can communicate with us. We don't need judgements just because we are suffering from something that we can't control. We know what kind of illness we are dealing with almost everyday. People who doesn't understand it is lucky coz they are not experiencing it. But please try to understand. That we need help. Not just ""it'll be alright."" we need someone who can be here for us."
1715,Maybe life truly just doesn't worth it.,"Mine, at least"
1716,Someone please find a silver lining,"I’m 20 M and my parents have always been very sheltering and prioritized education over everything but God. I was top in my class all through grade school motivated only by my parents nagging. This constant pressure to do better because deep down I wasn’t good enough gave me very severe social anxiety.

In high school I was peer pressured into applying for the IB (international baccalaureate) program by my parents and of course got in. IB is a highly intensive program that dives into each subject and forces the students not only to be well rounded, but above average in each category as well.

I got my drivers license sophomore year and that little bit of freedom went a long way. At that point I was smart enough to maintain average grades just enough to fool my parents into believing I was still motivated. It continued like this through the rest of high school. While my parents may have been suspicious of my steadily decreasing grades and bad attitude, my freedom grew and I continued to slack off. 

As soon as I was old enough, I moved out and I went to college with an undeclared major because I had no idea what I liked. I was pushed so hard that I was never able to pursue one specific thing I actually enjoyed, and because of that, I had not the slightest resemblance of a path for my future. My freshman year of college was mainly composed of completing gen eds and wasting time. 

By the time my sophomore year rolled around, I had declared a business major and quickly realized I hated what I was doing. I dropped all of my classes without telling my parents and by the second semester I had no motivation to do schooling anymore. I got up the nerve to tell them I wanted to take a ‘gap year’ and despite my parents being mildly, it was ultimately my decision. 

This entire time I was working a full time minimum wage job to pay for school, rent, car stuff, etc because my parents would not pay for anything once I moved out.

Once I started to mature enough (senior year in hs about) to have the insight to look towards my future I quickly fell into depression. Nothing I do is fun, I have no friends because of my crippling social anxiety, and I can’t go to my parents with anything besides news about going back to college. When the corona virus started spreading, I got laid off and money quickly started to run out along with any remaining hope for happiness. 

I have tried to meet girls and stuff but anything that might have a chance of becoming real fizzles out in a few weeks leaving me heartbroken. My lack of companionship my entire life (romantically or otherwise) has lead me to catch feelings for anyone who will give me a second glance. That, along with social anxiety and no real practice with commitment continues to chisel away at the dark stone that is left of my mental state. The only support I had ever previously received came from work, where people were forced to interact with me. My depression became obvious and shortly after we were all laid off. So with no work, no support from parents, and no friends, I’m left with the dark and impersonal responses from people over the internet just trying to do some good. I’m forced to grasp onto this because it’s all I have left to hold onto. The only thing that separates me from a purposeless life that will quickly dissolve even further into debt. 

Hold on I need to go respond to another girl who just wants to be friends. Little do they know that friends would be enough, but even this will fade."
1717,"My life’s a perpetual state of darkness, misery, and sadness","It’s 3:22am in NY and I’m crying as I’m writing this post. “Mr Blue Sky” by Electric Light Orchestra is stuck in my head and it symbolizes an end to the perpetual pain and misery in my life.
Background 
For starters, I’m 18, graduated community college (virtually) with an AS in business administration, finishing some online summer classes to comply with graduation requirements, and will transfer to a school in FL this fall, but I haven’t decided where yet. 
Now
Since I stopped taking online classes to complete the spring semester, I have no routine and often wake up at odd hours, usually 11am or later, since I don’t have a job and not much of significance is open around me. Since I’m Autistic, I have a weak social circle and I have a hard time making new friends. I’m struggle to relate to people so it’s not surprising that I have no sexual experiences with women, which has frustrated me more and more in recent years. I also struggle with my weight which is exacerbated by my family’s consumption of takeout and the closure of gyms. I’m overweight, Autistic, can’t relate to others, and my family gives me poor advice and I feel insulted by them and by wider society. I wish people would accept me for who I am, even if I’m self-interested, individualistic, and sometimes offensive. I don’t want to change myself so others will accept me, as I feel I don’t need fixing. I need to find the right people."

1719,Everything is everything,"What's the point in thinking of good intentions when everything in the world is going to shit? Everything sucks right now and because of it I haven't felt like myself in months.

I was happy, not too worried, anxious enough to function. But the way the world is like right now with social injustices, viral pandemic and an uncertain future, I've turned into my own shell and hiding from the world. I was better last year, keeping positive and mentally fit. Now I'm 3 months in binging daily on coke, anxious and paranoid and really angry with myself on how the world has affected me."
1720,I need help/advice - really confused about my mental state,"Hey everyone.

I’m feeling really confused at the moment about my mental health. For a number of years I’ve suffered with really severe anxiety and depression and Ive come close to harming myself in the past. Recently I’ve been feeling a lot better but I’m really confused about where I am at the moment.

Some days I can be really happy and upbeat, enjoying myself and even having fun for the first time in years but then the slightest little thing that shouldn’t even have an impact on me makes me feel suicidal and really makes me feel low. It sounds really pathetic but something as little as someone reminding me that I’d said I would do something which I forgot about makes me feel like I’m a failure and instantly takes me to rock bottom. It’s like a mix of extreme highs and lows and I feel like I’m going crazy. 

Can anyone here she’d some light on what may be going on cos I’m really scared, I felt in recent months like I might be making real progress but then everything flips in an instant and I’m in a deep depression again. 

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this, I’m trying so hard to stay but these dark thoughts are creeping in again and I don’t think I can cope with it much longer"

Now he wants me to choose a sport to play when quarantine is over,I can’t choose no, he already started my depression and now i have to choose because we are - last names- I’m so close to just gutting him like a fish,"
1722,"[Question] Just double checking, Depression is not a curable disease, right?","I’m asking because of [this tweet](https://i.imgur.com/fcapWP6.jpg) from a very well known Bollywood actress, who I don’t think would spread misinformation like this on her twitter, all willy-nilly. Please tell me if she’s wrong or what she’s referring to/means when she says “Depression is curable”."
1723,I Don't Know What To Do About Eating,"I've always had a bad relationship with food. I struggle with cycles of binge eating, heavily restricting, binging and purging, and being extremely picky about food. I don't understand any of it and it's exhausting. 

I want to lose weight and have been slowly since I finally learned how to keep myself from bingeing, but now my eating habits are getting weird and I have no idea why. Since I've been under quarentine, it's gotten really weird. 

I'll seperate salad buy veggie in piles then eat with a fork, I'll get a sandwhich from a store or resturaunt but pick it apart and eat everything seperately. The other night my husband made spaghetti and I seperated the veggies and noodles then only ate the veggies once the sauce was completely wiped off with a napkin. 

I've also started mixing water with my food before eating it. It started off with me pouring some water on some bread because it was a little hard and I was hungry but we forgot to go grocery shopping. From there it just turmed into me pouring a little water on almost all of my meals and mixing it in before eating it. I don't know why. It makes the food taste bland but I just do it anyways. 

I haven't picked this up from anywhere and I don't feel nervous or anxious when I do it so I don't think it's some type of ocd thing. 

Each day I get more confused and frustrated but don't know what to do apart from see a therapist the second I go back to work. 

I'm worried now because yesterday out of weird impulse, I put a torn off strip of paper in my mouth and started chewing on it. I chewed on it for a while and intended on spitting it out, but didn't. I ended up swallowing it. 

For some fucking reason, today I wanted to tare of another strip off a piece of paper and chew on it again. 

I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know why. I think that's what's hurting the most. I want to at least know why things are getting so fucking weird."
1724,"Help! How do I get my brother to understand that the ""Law of Attraction"" is false and is harming him?","My brother has spent hundreds of dollars on audio files from a scammer named Robert Zink who purports that the ""Law of Attraction"" is the solution to every problem a person has. My brother wears headphones the entire day and during night, listening to these audio files that will help him manifest his dreams. He has said multiple times that he will manifest money, obviously when asked where the money is he doesn't respond. He also says that this garbage works because it has helped him deal with mental issues, which he won't talk about. It is extremely frustrating because obviously its the opposite and it has worsened whatever mental issues he has. He refuses to get help, and is extremely defensive whenever asked about how listening to this garbage has brought him tangible results. He consistently references famous people who also support this garbage like Conor McGregor. Who is known to be a supporter and believer of the ""Law of Attraction"" and visualization. As well as, other athletes who mention this and credit it for their success. With their huge platforms support for this garbage is really damaging to the public. Anyway, how do I help my brother? This has been going on for so long, at first we thought it was a phase and eventually he would realize that it brought no results. But, his delusion is consistent and we don't know what to do to help him."
1725,22 Yo brother died 7 mos go &amp; I went psychotic.,"Yeah, it was bad. My bro who was one of the most incredible people just fuckin up n died on thanksgiving. Fentanyl. The summer before he died, I was listening to Saba song and I had a panic attack thinking about my little dying. Some might call that premonition but honestly I was constantly afraid of him dying. I'm a social worker. I'm 26 yo but since we had a somewhat rough upbringing and Ive had some intense jobs I knew my little bro was high risk, even though I didnt know he was on drugs or to what extent... 

My mom was consistently loving and caring despite battling severe depression and abuse from my father and our cult. I understood why my mom couldnt get out of bed for days and why she told me she wanted to hang herself in our closet.. My dad and cult upbringing trained me to be helpful and pleasing above all else. I saw my moms weaknesses and I took over most of the duties. I made sure my brothers rationed the food, I interruoted the most violent confrontations and sometimes even managed to deescalate it. 

My brother and I were SO close. Some might think it was weird but to be honest we had been through too much together to give a fuck. We were poor a lot of the time and that meant putting our matresses in the apartment kitchen and bunkering down without internet. My mom, my brother and I found solstace in each other after my mom escaped my dad and the cult. We were all free to explore new things together and even the smallest freedoms made life worth living. On the hottest days, we would sit in the park and read a book out loud together until there wasnt enough light to read. My brother was the man that taught me how men were supposed to treat women. He was a fuckin knight and he treated EVERYONE with that respect. It was his biggest fault (no confrontation was missed if justice was at stake) but it also made him so pure. 

Last year, he had a psychotic episode and stole my dads car and drove it into the ground and got into a 22 mile car chase with ICE. He said his radio told him to... Remarkably, he escaped ICE and layed low until I came to pick him up. I spent a few days with him and persuaded him to go to a long term mental health program. My connections helped me get him into an amazing place, he loved it and got to be right on the oceanside. He made wonderful art and music while he was there.. During that time I didnt see him.. 

I moved away to Las Vegas to take car of my ex bf mom who got mad cow disease. It makes me mad that I spent that time away from him especially when I knew he was struggling.. 

My ex was undiagnosed schizophrenic for the firdt 4 years of our relationship.. He would fly into rages tell sometimes where he would scream racial slurs, sexist slurs, violent things etc. He would break my windows with his head.. Things wers hard..  

I got sick while I was with him. So sick I couldnt walk or stand.  My brother took 24 tabs of acid a few weeks before dying and told me that my bf was making me sick. I got defensive but we stayed cool. Ibtold my bro the dr put me on synthetic opiates for my sickness and he begged me to get off of them.. Told me to sip lean instead, ha. 

When he died I couldnt take any more opiates so I quit then cold turkey. The hospital wouldnt treat me without insurance they just offered me potassium lol. 

So, I stayed awake for 8 days. Wide awake. Running, sweating, vomiting, and meditating. By thd 8th day I felt AMAZING. Too amazing... It was my first manic episode with psychotic features. I started doing crazy math things haha and I thought I was going to somehow cure the abuse in my family like a goddamn savior. I randomly told everyone in my fam that my dad sexually abused me.. Which aside from him groping me and making me strip for belt spanking at questionable ages.. I cant tell exactly if he abused me to the extent that I think he did.. I have some flashbacks that are confusing and they correlate to a spot on my stomach that feels like knives when its touched. 

I was laying down on my back on the floor deep breathing when my mom came in and put her hands and head on me to comfort me. My response? I attacked her by grabbing her hair and arms so hard she said I was throwing her around like I was a 3pp on man... As I'm grabbing her arms hard, I start screaming about my dad raping me. Yeah. Idk what to even say about it. Then to make things worse inwas so delusional I didnt even recognize how violent I was. I thought i was justified because my mom didnt believe me? But my mom and I hadnt even talked about it... I also thought my mom was like possessed hahaha. Yeah it was bad. 

So MONTHS later, I'm clean from opiates and ive kicked out my ex and outed all my past abusers... i realize ive  been COMPLETELY insane and I make amends with family friends etc.. 

Now I'm just here doing life, trying so fucking hard to scrape up money for my car registration but crying in between pizza deliveries and working a dead end social work job. I cant afford medical insurance or therapy and I feel like no one in my family will trust me again until I get help. Shut- I dont trust me! I need help and its all anyone tells me... *get therapy*.. I found therapy and now its an intern who isnt even abke to give diagnosis"
1726,Your experience with quetiapine?,"Hi. I'm a 31-year-old female who has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and mood disorder. I have also been suffering from insomnia due to anxiety. Recently, i was prescribed to take quetiapine at 12.5 mg every night to help with my mood and to help with my sleep. I was able to get better sleep lately but still wake up at least two times at night. There are also days when i feel like i am so tired during the day even if i get deep sleep.

My question is, how is your experience with this medication? This is the first time i ever took drugs for my mental health and i have been taking it for about four days. Has it helped you out?

My worry is that sometimes after I take it, i feel very slight muscle twitches on my neck area. Not enough to make me move, but i feel the muscles twitch. This will happen immediately after i take it at night as i fall asleep but they dont persevere during the day. I have read about tardive dyskinesia caused by this drug. Should i be talking to my doctor again about this?"
1727,Is taking anti depressants and anxiety meds for life?,"Hi, what's everyone cases on meds? How long have you been on? And did you ever get off them and worked to clear your emotions and mind?"
1728,Have someone who needs help.,"Hello All, I don’t want to seem a problem but I am concerned over a fellow reddit user and I’m wondering if anyone can talk to the, but dm me first so I can make sure your a good person, thanks."
1729,Not belonging anywhere,"It sucks not belonging anywhere 

Hahahahaha, I’m from an Arab family living in an Arab body with a non-Arab language, dialect, culture and customs

I don’t belong to the arab society because of my language, dialect, culture and customs nor the non-Arab Society because of my name, family heritage and physical appearance as an Arab 

So basically I don’t belong anywhere 

Someone just euthanize me"
1730,Why do I get so tired,"Some background: I had a kind of shitty childhood. I don't really remember much from it but the parts that I do remember brings me to tears very often. 

I started opening up about this to friends and got a therapists appointment, but whenever I talk to people about my emotions or how I feel or even just plain opening up. I get exhausted really quickly. Tiredness sets in and I'll go to sleep for a few hours even If I just woke up 2 hours ago. It's just like super fucking tiring. 
Why is it this way? Is it normal ?"
1731,I feel ashamed of myself for not handling my anxiety better,"I have always been an anxious person, my parents joke that I don't just double, I triple guess things. I'm 20 now and my anxiety has gotten really bad from being stuck at home for the last 3 months. I feel like I can't let myself be happy for more than an hour or 2, my brain is constantly looking for any problem, which 90% of the time is irrational or I have majorly exaggerated in my head. Just this week, I freaked out that my boyfriend is anti-feminist simply because he didn't like my retweet about awareness for sexual assault. I also flipped out when he said ""can't wait to propose in 4 years"" when usually he says 3/4, and I convinced myself he doesn't love me because of this? I also freaked out I has skin cancer because of a totally normal mole I was BORN with that my parents got checked before and has looked the same forever.! I Googled excessively about skin cancer for hours and hours I was so scared. I did the same when I thought I saw something in the corner of my eye and I thought ""yeah I'm schizophrenic"" and I obsessively Googled too. These specifics are just some of my obsessions the last 10 days, I've had 3 nights in this period where I slept less than 3 hours at night. 

My mom saw emails when she went to use my iPAd from an online counsellor I'm going to start talking this week. She panicked and then told me ""oh it's all in your head, everyone has anxiety, you're just bored and need a hobby"" and she mentioned how people pretend to have mental illnesses cos they read about them online and that I don't need therapy cos I'm not that bad? I think she thought she was helping but I'm so hurt and ashamed. I think she believes I'm faking it?"
1732,do i have an eating disorder?,"i’ll try to keep this as concise as i can! 

-i’m a 21 year old girl, 5’6ish, and i weigh ~85 lbs. on average, i eat one meal a day, probably about 600 calories/day. 

-no matter how much i want to, i just can’t make myself eat. i usually forget to eat for an entire day or sometimes two, but i don’t really experience hunger when i forget to eat. sometimes i’ll go get food, but as soon as a smell it or see it, i want to throw up. on rare occasion, i want to eat so much that i feel like a big food trash monster, and i’ll eat a half dozen donuts, or a whole mcnuggets meal or something (that’s a Lot of food for me). 

-i am happy with my body right now, but i’m really skinny (my mom told me i look emaciated lmao) and i’m definitely not trying to restrict my eating to stay skinny. if anything, i wish i could eat more so maybe i could have some curves 

-i was diagnosed with persistent depression disorder and generalized anxiety disorder about two years ago, and i know those things clearly affect my eating habits and health, but idk how related those are in my current situation. 

-my lack of eating has been happening for about 6 months; there haven’t really been any substantial changes in my life, though. i’m a full time college senior, i work in a neuroscience research lab, i’m in a happy long term relationship, everything has pretty much been fine for a while. so why am i like this? 


tl,dr: do i have an eating disorder? i don’t really eat, i’m not usually hungry, but i’m not restricting myself because i want to stay skinny. any opinions/feedback is appreciated!!"
1733,Sorry for my bad English i got a 50 in it,"I pretty much have no friends i only have school friends people i talk to at school we don't hangout i feel lonely. 

My English is pretty bad im 15 and English is my first language. but i have problems reading, writing and talking nobody understands me when i talk i sound like a baby.

My parents always fight it doesn't matter what time it is sometimes they fight at 3am, 5am we could be having a nice dinner and my mom will always start a fight i hate eating with them i feel sick.

Im alway getting baby by my mom My brother is allowed to stay out till 3am and drink and do weed but i get yelled at for staying up to 1am.

If i tell her how i feel like shit or suicidal she will keep bring it up over and over again and my dad has no backbone he can't say no to his 'friends' if they need help doing a roof hes there but if i need help hes never there.

my dad is nice but i can't trust him because he left me 2 times with my crazy mom me and my brother had to walk to school it's a 30 minute walk.

i feel hopeless and suicidal like what the point in life i have nothing i own nothing in this house i feel trapped i have no one i.m starting to voice in my head telling me to kill myself.

Sorry for my bad English but i just needed to get this off my chest."
1734,Should I go to a mental hospital? [TRIGGER WARNING],"Lately my childhood trauma has been coming back up more often than usual.
I have a lot of childhood trauma. Both of my parents are narcissists and the abused and neglected me all my childhood. It's hard to admit sometimes and most times I automatically go numb when talking about these things.
I automatically go numb when talking about any of my experiences! So this has caused psychiatric hospitals and therapists to assume that I am okay.

I can be ""okay"" if I have enough distraction (Facebook and youtube all day everyday)
Recently I deactivated facebook and instagram and I have been trying to actually sit with myself.

It's been horrible. And I keep remembering my trauma and it has been throwing me off
I have many moodswings and it affects my partner a lot because they feel like they have to walk on eggshells around me.

I've been a bad partner and I'm incredibly controlling and clingy.
To the point that I follow my partner around somedays and constantly ask them questions as if I were a toddler.

I feel like I'm going crazy right now as well. I quit my job earlier in the year and haven't been contributing no rent because I feel unable to go work (because my mind and mood changes so suddenly and so much that I cannot willingly keep a job for too long) i isolated myself from everyone and have been at home falling in and out of depression. I either sleep all day and dont get out of bed or i am being this clingy and annoying and suffocating person to my partner. 

I've been thinking of submitting myself to a psychiatric hospital because the feelings have been getting stronger and stronger and I've been literally losing my mind 
Some days I feel like I cannot grasp reality and it lasts all day if not 2 days straight. 
I am constantly binge eating and completely hating how I look in the mirror to the point that I want to starve to death.
I've also been thinking of starting to harm myself again.

I'm incredibly self aware of everything right now
Every little thing I say and every way my partner reacts to me and I've been having panic attacks over not having control over these behaviours and not knowing where to go to spare him from them.

I don't want to be this way and it feels like the only way I can stop is by taking my life.

I am diagnosed with bipolar and ptsd 
Previous diagnosis have been social phobia and social anxiety and major depression.
I don't have any medications I am taking at the moment.

I have tried reaching out about my mental health to crisis hotlines but they have not helped."
1735,Can’t seem to figure out my exact struggle/issue,"I’ve posted several times here w no help or answers which is ok imma just use this to rant.  

I don’t know what to do or how to get help. I am overwhelmed every single day over things I can’t control. I have abandonment issues and I can’t let go of those in my past. I don’t like thinking about people I’ve had a falling out with because it feels weird and they would be uncomfortable knowing that. It’s not intentional. I just can’t keep thinking about them like this it’s unhealthy. Things happen for a reason and me thinking about it every single day is tiring. 

I’ve lost so many friends and ex’s and I’m not doing well. I miss those people so much and would do anything to have them back because life was actually enjoyable and I miss them. I care so much about them personally and well being. I never meant to hurt anymore emotionally. I’ve grown and I know rights from wrongs and I just wish to get another chance to fix things with anybody I’ve wronged. I’m not perfect at all and they know that. I just regret everything and I wish everything wasn’t real. I constantly think about what I should’ve did different or how I was in the wrong and how it could’ve saved me. I wish I knew how to forget. If I can forget I would be so much happier. It is painful to constantly think about everything and I can’t keep doing this. It hurts so bad I miss everyone and I hope shit changes. 

I’m sorry this was more of a rant and not really asking anything. I hope somebody can relate and help or tell an experience of what helped them."
1736,Bad anxiety about health- I know it sounds ridiculous but I need some unbiased reassurance.,"
I’m 19F with severe health anxiety. Non smoker, rarely drink, active, try to eat healthy, no chronic health problems. I got a high BP reading at the doctor today (145/90) and I’m so worried about having a stroke now. My dog had a stroke the other day, my mom has high BP, and I have regular panic attacks which raise BP. I know it was probably because I was at the doctors, I was getting a corona test, and for a minute I thought I had a fever this morning (turns out I didn’t) but I just can’t stop worrying about it. Please provide some reasons this is irrational it helps to hear it from others."
1737,"I'm really worried for my girlfriend,,","Possible TW-Sexual assault and ED

I'm not really sure where to start except me(17m) and my girlfriend(16f) have been going out for around 6 months now we've known eachother for over a year and have in the whole time of knowing one another shared mutual romantic interest,, we never go together because of distance,, I really want to be taken seriously with these concerns and not like I'm idk self diagnosing or diagnosing without a doctor's that's not what I'm doing, I just see behavior that I myself have done in really depressive states that she is doing and I'm scared, we are both living in different towns so its hard for me to really do anything

For starters and the first I'm concerned with is she doesn't eat a lot she's 5,0 and 96 pounds she keeps on losing weight she normally only has one granola bar or just drinks Tea,, she knows there's a problem with eating but she says it used to be done to lose weight but now she can't stop,, her parents don't understand mental health at all, they just think she's being stubborn and not a actual problem, plus even if they did want to see a dietitian or something like that there isn't even a doctor of any kind in her small town, just nurses, plus her family isn't exactly well off so it would be extremely expensive, 

Another thing I'm worried about is her lack of concern for bad things that happen to her, I myself have struggled with admitting there's something wrong I have gone through a lot of therapy to work through it and realize I should do what's best for myself and my mental wellbeing, but she doesn't probably the worst that she is going through, is her childhood guy friend is being really creepy and has touched her saying it was just him playing around or that she moved in a way where he had to,, or grabbing her phone and looking in her camera roll for pictures of her,, it makes me extremely upset of course hearing this stuff but she says she doesn't want to make things awkward by telling his parents or hers, I've asked her to confront him herself but she's scared I'm scared too I guess, I have no idea what to do

I want her to realize she is worth so much not just to me but to everyone around her, but she just tells me its fine and it will all be fine she just needs to wait for it to go away and she'll forget about it,, I've cried because I have struggled with the same view on things before and its such a deep pit,, I wasn't able to get out until I was forcibly hospitalized while it was the right thing that had to happen it was extremely difficult to not be able to make the decision myself I don't want it to come to that with her, I want her to make the decision on who to go with with her problems because I can't be her only resource, I'm still a kid who still struggles every once and a while I'm going to stand by her side all the way through but I can't be the one to carry her, I'm scared

Idk if this even makes grammatical sense sometimes I'm just worried and at a loss of what to do, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit this sub please direct me to one can is more fit and I will move to that sub, thank you I'm sorry idk where else to go, I live in the USA"
1738,What to do with my (possibly) mentally ill mother?,"This morning my mother began to behave abnormally. Her whole behavior was really off, she started to question reality and asked me (17) and my siblings weird questions. For example ""Did you hear any noises (talking) last night?"". She started to pack her stuff without any reason, walked up and down the stairs, asked us weird questions and was losing touch of reality. 

Thus far I have talked with her about what is going on. She replied that ""voices"" threatened her and questioned her aggressively. She also said that this was going on for about 2 weeks. I recommended her to conctact professional help soon as possible, and it has went well so far. Also I conctacted relative and told him everything what was going on, and he said he would come to check us soon. The situation is now pretty peaceful and my mother is cooperative.

 Now my question: What should i do to ensure that the situation remains smooth? Is there anything i should be concerned with or something i should know about?

(My siblings are 12 and 14, so i think they can somewhat manage. And we have place to go if the situation escalates. Now we are waiting for our relative to arrive.)"
1739,I need help,"I’m freaking out right now, I literally cannot stand how uncomfortable and crazy I feel at the moment. Everything is too hot, too bright, too loud, too sweaty, too dirty, too much.
It started with feeling too hot. I opened my doors to let more air flow but I just kept feeling worse when I noticed my forehead was oily then I felt sweaty, then I became super worried I smelt even tho no one can smell me. I feel the need to take 5 showers but I can’t cause I need to sleep. I need to wash all of my clothes, I need to sweep my floors and vacuum and steam my carpets. I need to wash my hands I need to clean shit and I just cant stand it. I need help. I need help trying to understand what this is. This isn’t my first time having this kind of thing either. It comes up every night but I usually can fight the feeling and fall asleep. But this I cannot stand. Please help me understand."

1742,anger issues,"Hello. I’ve got this thing that happens to me, I am not really concerned about it but I find it very weird. So I have this impulses to do things like swear or punch something and if I am pressured I do that thing that I think about like swear or punch something. But the weird part is that one second I am calm and the next I am angry but after I do that thing I calm down, and I can’t remember the exact moment when I do that thing, it’s just not in my brain anymore. To give you an example, a few days ago I was in my car with my sister and my mom, and my mom was yelling at my sister for some reason. I didn’t really care, but I was thinking about telling her to shut up because she was annoying. I was looking through the window and i was really calm. The next thing I remember is that I have just punched the roof of the car and told my mom to shut the fuck up, but I can’t remember literally doing that, punching the roof and saying what I said, I just know it happened. There are a few seconds that I cannot remember. Is this something normal, because I don’t think it is :)))"

1744,How do I stop feeling guilty and get rid of the need to tell everything I feel guilty about?,"I'll try to make it simple.  
I've (24F) been in a relationship with my bf (31M) for 4 and a half years. We have had a lot of fights and arguments. Mostly out of misunderstanding and also personal issues. We have worked things out always. I've done mistakes, he has done mistakes and we try not to chain each other. I was accused often of not being honest, and kinda like I was made to tell him everything. To not keep secrets in our relationship. But I was young and didn't really think things through. I used to be in love with this guy, but nothing ever happened, I just had a feeling that he kinda liked me, we were close. Anyway after getting into my relationship, the guy contacted me and we hung out, I sometimes had doubts about him, but it was all in my head. It was mostly like I wanted him to love me and I would reject him. I was obsessed with him before my relationship, like big time obsession and I think I just needed closure, I just needed to get him out of my system. He was to me my soul mate, I was young and in high school. Anyway all these things happened in my head, and we hung out like friends a few times. And once I asked him if he ever loved me and he said he did, but he didn't know how to act. Anyway I was happy cos now I know I wasn't delusional thinking that he likes me. I didn't have any feelings for him, and I still don't. But this caused a lot of trouble in my relationship, which is normal. But my bf is very accepting and we handled it. After some time about this year, random things would come up in my mind, of guilt the stuff I've done, all the thoughts I've had, and the only way to get free of them was to tell my bf. So I did, I told him some stuff which I thought were irrelevant, which are in fact because those things can happen to almost anyone. I told him about the guy what kind of thoughts I've had and that I feel guilty like I've cheated on him. We fought, argued but my bf said he didn't care he understands me and wants me to be happy and that nothing what I've done has hurt him. He wants me to be free and happy. So after this, everything started. I ended up telling him every single thought I've had, about him, about others, about my daydreams (being in movies, a celebrity,etc) things that I've done in the past which have nothing to do with him, thoughts I've had about him, etc. All of these because I felt guilty. I felt guilty for almost everything. He also got mad at why I'm telling him nonsense, but I can't stop myself. Then I'd tell him something about the guy I loved and he would get irritated and say maybe you're not facing your truth, call him don't call me to tell me this, it seems that you love him,etc. And everything is now very scary to me. I'll watch a movie and if there is a romantic scene, or idk something along the lines ""You still love me"", my brain connects it with the guy, but I know it's just happening because right now I'm questioning everything I did, and I'm just so scared and afraid of thinking. I told him that sometimes he didn't look attractive or that sometimes I would have wanted him to have bigger shoulders. But it was my mind, like I feel guilty for thinking like that, I'm not perfect and I love him so much he is perfect to me, but sometimes, rarely and unconsciously I'd think stuff like that. And he said don't worry everyone thinks like that ok, don't feel guilty about anything. He supports me, I can't into full detail, but now I just can't stop telling him everything I've thought and think. Now I can't stop this feeling of guilt and fear. I'll watch a movie and compare him to other men, or think that he is not attractive, and I'll just feel shitty and horrible. I can't see why I can't focus on the times where I didn't have any thoughts like this, where I found him so attractive and was so in love. We love each other a lot. We've had our ups and downs. But idk, I just feel so horrible for thinking stupid things, which aren't even my thoughts, thoughts are just information from the data we have collected. I feel so horrible, and have been taking pills to calm down my anxiety, I've had panic attacks, and I doubt everything. I have dreams where I've seen the guy I used to love, and then woke up feeling like I still like him, and it's just so unbearable anymore. I don't even know what I feel anymore, my mind is a mess, my body is a mess, I keep throwing up. I know I haven't done anything wrong. He knows that as well and tells me that constantly. Now he also obviously is not cold, but idk how to put it. He doesn't want to be attached to me and I to him. He says let's leave it to time, everything will pass, we'll see how it goes. But I also have feelings of fear that I ruined the relationship and that I fucked everything up, and I just can't get rid of these feelings. I don't know what to do.  
My bf says you don't have to tell me anything, it's your life, do what you want, you can't hurt me and you didn't hurt me. But I still feel so shitty, I don't even know if some of the things I told him were real, or just a product by my mind in this shitty state. I'll feel guilty if I said something to my friend, and I'll feel guilty that i didn't tell my bf. It's ridiculous!   
I'm just so scared of what I'm going to think, I try to face it and think about it, I calm myself down, but it still gets me.  
I'm scared what I'm going to think, or remember or dream about, because then I'm gonna feel guilty and I'll have the need to tell my bf, because that's the only way I feel idk forgiven or making things right. I feel fair if I tell him. He says that I've kept a lot of stupid things inside with fear and they are just leaving their marks on me while I get them out. But this is ridiculous! I admit I was scared in my relationship, he was jealous in the beginning, a bit paranoid and all. We had a lot of trouble, then I became jealous. But now he is like a different person, and I think it's all from the fear in the beginning. I'd eat myself up if I found a guy attractive, I'd forcefully make myself not to like guys, even my bf tells me it's retarded what I did, and that I should be free.  
I just don't know what to do. I'm in a chaotic mess, I'm just so scared, and delusional, I accuse myself of the most stupid things, I feel sorry for the person I am, I doubt myself and feelings, I really don't know what I'm thinking. I feel so guilty for the person I am and all the things I did, I know that I didn't do jack shit, but this guilt is eating me alive. It's been a month or so of me feeling like this.   
I just really feel sorry for everything I did. I never meant to hurt him or have any hidden agenda. I did mistakes because that's how much I knew back then. This is my first relationship. I was and still am a weak person, and this has always happened to me, if somebody said anything to me, I'd doubt myself and think maybe they're right. But this is too far, I'm seriously thinking that I'm losing my mind.  
I've been reading on psychology, mysticism and everything related to this state. I might have PTSD from relationship and I have all the symptoms. I also want to see a psychiatrist, but this whole pandemic gets in the way.  
Please if anyone could I don't know help me in someway. I feel so bad and that I've ruined everything. Even though my bf and best friend say that I haven't, but I just can't stop this horrible feeling!  
I don't want to be scared anymore, I don't want to doubt myself, or judge my thoughts!  
I myself am a mess. I have no idea what I'm doing or thinking! I just can't help but judge and punish myself and I would often think that I deserve this, because of what I've done!  
Please if anyone could say something, I don't know what, just help me or say that I am not the only one feeling like this."
1745,I can’t keep doing this.,"It’s getting to the point where I can’t even function through daily life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I would like some help. However, I am a teenager and I don’t want my parents to know. I can’t do the things I love because I just get overwhelmed, I have that voice just telling me to end it all, I don’t know. Honestly, if it doesn’t get better by the end of the month I might just... you know. I have no possible way to get a good future with how I am now. I need to become functional again. I need to be happy and satisfied and not so overwhelmed by everything."
1746,How can I help my girlfriend more? [TW],"**Trigger Warning**: This post is about Anorexia, Bulimia, self-harming and suicidal thougts

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where it would be the best to start so I'll try to summarize everything chronologically.

My (now) girlfriend is in a bad family situation. They're fighting a lot without the fights getting resolved. She started to feel worse and spend a year abroad partly to escape her family. In this time, she lived with relatives of the mother's family (her mother is Canadian). During this time she had something like a family and had a beautiful year. 

She came back last year in August. With the time she had to start her old live again (school, etc.) and then it became worse. In November she began eating less and losing weight (she doesn't look pathological skinny but compared to older pictures you can see a significant difference). With the time she start to harm herself with a knive at the wrist. Not deep and you would need to look closely to see it.

I know her since the kindergarden because our town isn't that big and we live only five minutes apart but we were never really interested in each other. Around New Year we started to write and do things together. Until February I had no clue that she has some problems. We both knew that we were more than just friend and in February, after watching a movie, I wanted to kiss her. That was when she told me she doesn't know if she could do that and told me a bit about her problems.

Over the time, she opened up more and more. However, she became worse and worse. She developed Bulimia (but not exactly how you would imagine it; she ate way less than others and tried to eat healthy). She tried to not scare me and didn't told me of it and pretended that she's feeling better (she's the kind of person who always tries please the others and forget themself). She planned her suicide in detail. She started to buy pills and wanted to take them the day after my last exam (I'm graduating this year). Luckily, her mother read her notepad where she wrote it down and had to went into a clinic for a few days. This really helped her (she even stayed longer than she had to and seemed way happier) but sadly not to long. Three weeks later she were so down that she didn't care about anything. Normally, she would have hid it from her sister but this time she didn't even care if her sister sees it. Later when we were alone she said the without really thinking about it at least six ways how she could kill herself would come into her mind. She also refused to call a hotline if her night gets worse (we're in Germany and the hotline is from the clinic, so it would have been helpful). As a reaction I talked with her parents and we brought her to the clinic for a second time. She were released eight days ago.

I'm pretty sure that she would not commit suicide for now because on Monday we had our first kiss and she is going to get a place in clinic stationary for therapy which is giving her hope.

A huge problem is her parent. They are about getting divorced but are fighting heavily. I'm about to be the mediator (not for the parents but the kids because they're really suffering). But I don't know how else I can help her at the moment. Yesterday she got really down out of nowhere. She cried loudly for over an hour which seems to be a good thing because she were unable to really cry for a long time. She used to hide in her room instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advices what I could do (except for just being there for her)?

It really can't continue how it is at the moment. I wrote that her parents are causing a lot of damage. To give you an example: After a fight one of her parents usually goes to her and complain about the other which turns her down. Two weeks ago I drover her to a hospital to get a wound stitched she did to her as a reaction of feeling bad after such a fight.

1747,Do I have depression or am I a sad cunt who needs to suck it up?,"So pretty much I was watching videos on depression and loneliness and found out I share some of those traits. I really hope I am not depressed and its just my hormonal changes. I am a super chrojic procrastinator. Like it has gotten to the point where I am procrastinating on eatin, sleeping, studying, toilet time and even watching tv shows. I feel overwhelmed and hopeless every two weeks and my only escape are video games and bjj (brazilian jiu-jitsu). But the hopelessness has spread to both. I have tried doing the action -&gt; motivation -&gt; inspiration thing but it did not work. I have tried the Pomodoro Method™ to solve my lack of motivation, didnt work. I have also tried just full sending it, it works like once every two-three weeks. I hope all I have to do is suck it up"
1748,There are only two mental illnesses,"Low iq disorder, and factitious disorder.

Anything else is just a part of factitious disorder.

Saying that other disorders exist is like saying that dog food eating is a disorder. No. It’s just a subculture of factitious disorder.

If anything schizoprenia, autism, and bipolar, and adhd are just SYMPTOMS of factitious disorder

Oh yeah. Here’s a symptom every single one of you people have. Attention seeking disorder.

Dick sucking disorder? Loser disorder? Dumbass disorder?"
1749,Is this a normal symptom of depression?,"I’m 14F, diagnosed with depression and anxiety. For about 2 years I’ve felt like I’m being watched, always. I’ve finally brought up the courage to talk about it with my counselor (not a school counselor.) and she said that it was a symptom of depression, but it’s a constant thing and I can’t do normal things like eating, showering, or laying in bed without feeling self conscious 24/7. (This ones a bit of a TW) I’ve also experienced very quick mood swings, one second I’m okay, the other I just feel extremely bored to the point where I start having suicidal thoughts just to have it end, it normally lasts about an hour or two. Are these common experiences in people with depression? And is there a way to help with this?"
1750,Help me figure out the disorder.,"Someone near &amp; dear to me has some weird narcissism that he thinks he’s a celebrity. He thinks that everyone wants to hang out with him, he spends money like it’s going out of style. He’s getting depressed which isn’t helping, but I think that is a symptom rather than the problem. 

Is it delusion? A personality disorder? I don’t know."
1751,Im stuck,"I’m genuinely stuck in the middle zone of hating my family for the toxic mental abuse they inflicted on me when i was young or for actually pursuing the relationship they’re trying to give me now.

I’ve battled with panic attacks all my life and I want to know what is the cause, but not even my therapists will give me a straight answer.

I’ve had disordered eating, sexual assault, self harm and i’ve lost family members to suicide while i was suicidal myself, it gets so hard but I still hold on to hope, i just wish someone would give me an idea to why my brain works the way that it does."
1752,Can anybody help with maladaptive daydreaming?,"Does anyone else have it? Do you know how to overcome it? It's getting serious and it interferes with my life, also had depression bc of it. Is it too late? I'd like to be finally be free of it."
1753,Funny losers,Funny how you posters are so mentally ill that the only attention you can get is from other mentally ill people in this subreddit. And even then some of you people don’t even get responses. Even other retards don’t care about you. Let that sink in.
1754,A Few Tips On Positive Mindset,"1. **Start The Day With A Positive Affirmation.**

Start your day off with full of smiles and a positive attitude. This will set you off for the day. Always start strong!

2. **Focus on the good things, no matter how small they are.**

When you encounter with a challenge, whether if it’s big or small, focus on the benefits. For example, if you’re stuck in a traffic, think of the positive this can give you. You can now listen to your favourite music or podcast for longer. Always think positive in bad situations!

3. **Find some humour in bad situations.**

However bad the situation is, make it humorous. If you can, try and crack a joke about it or think about how the situation would make a funny story in the future. This can work wonders in the darkest situations. 

4. **Turn your failures into lessons.**

Everyone fails at something. Doesn’t matter if it’s sport related, work problems, family, friends or a situation in the past you had committed, turn it in a lesson and learn from it. You’re not perfect, I’m not perfect, nobody is perfect - we are all humans, and we all my mistakes. Don’t be too harsh on yourself. You made a mistake? Take it as a learning curb and move on. No matter the situation, how bad it is, lift your head up and look straight ahead. Don’t live you life with your head down and upset over a situation you cannot fix as it was in the past. Learn from it and move on with your life!

5. **Focus on the present.**

AKA Live In The Present. As corny as it sounds, live in the moment! Life comes at you fast, live the moments that you are currently in and enjoy it. 

6. **Find positive people to be around. This can be your FAMILY, FRIENDS, CO-WORKERS.**

Fill your life with positive people who have a positive mindset, people who bring joy to your life and brings a smile to your face. When you surround yourself with positive people, you get positive outcomes, you’d be able to tell positive stories. Eliminate the negativity out of your life. This will work when surrounding yourself with positive people, AKA family, friends....

7. **Transform your negative self-talk into a positive self-talk.**

An example of this is “I’m so bad at this”. Turn this into “when I practise more, I’ll be much better”. 

Positive energy and mindset will help you throughout the days. I’m not an expert, I’m here to help as many people as I can. Here are just a few tips to help you out, if needed. 

Have a wonderful day everyone! And as always, my DM’s are open at all times. :)"
1755,Mental illness does not exist,"At least depression, anxiety, autism, schizoprenia, ocd, adhd, bipolar dont exist. 

It is a combination of attention seeking and bad parenting. It is a choice.

Not a single person in this subreddit actually has any mental illness...

Unless you call being a sick annoying attention seeker with parents who don’t give a fuck about you a mental illness? Then yes. Absolutely."
1756,Cognitive liberty,"Due to my very bad mental struggles and therapy not working,I have been starting to practice cognitive liberty.I started for the whole of last week with meditation and finding a spiritual connection and was interested in starting to learn lots of other things.However,this week I had a breakdown again and it's just been really bad and parents wanna get me sectioned into a mental hospital again.I'm asking for help cos I simply dunno what to do anymore I have lost all motivation to do cognitive liberty and been fighting these struggles(anorexia,OCD,depression,severe anxiety,emetophobia etc.) for 9 years now and it's consuming me.I don't know if it's a woree underlying problem that I have or just something that's wrong with me but fuck it,if you call me an attention seeker I Kept all this shit in for 6 years and tried everything for help and cognitive liberty was my last resort and now it's just fucked idk what to do anymore.I wish life had breaks:("
1757,Thoughts of hurting others doesn't make you a monster!,"There's some real stigma about thinking about harming others. But it seems it's actually not that uncommon in mental illness.

Years ago I had thoughts about harming completely innocent people. I wouldn't hurt anyone and I haven't had those thoughts in a long time. I'm kind of fed up of feeling like I have to keep it a secret. It's a real part of mental illness and it doesn't make you a monster. There's a small part of me that worries it will somehow get found out by a potential employer and put them off hiring me but idgaf (they probably won't find my twitter account anyway)!"
1758,Cognitive liberty,Anyone got tips for where to start on a cognitive liberty journey?
1759,Suicide attempts are only attention seeking attempts,The only reason people fail is because they seek attention. They purposely choose one that will make them live. If they really were telling the truth they wouldn’t fail because they would do something successful. So fuck off with the attention seeking aight?
1760,Obsessive thoughts triggered by seemingly random things?,"I wonder how common such thoughts are? They are some thoughts that I think to be pretty meaningless but stubbornly remains in part of the consciousness for some time. It had not happened to me for months, but today it happened again for some trivial thing and it was uncomfortable. Mostly it would be mild, the obsessive thoughts would just last for several minutes, but sometimes it lasts for several hours or days. It felt like some loophole or bug that gets kind of stuck at the front of the consciousness.

For example, I remember hearing someone saying 'It's the first time you do this. It's natural to be nervous. We all get nervous.' several years ago. I never thought it to be 'natural' to be nervous. So after hearing it, I wondered 'what??? everything is a 'first', every moment is new and the body becomes a new body, so they think one should be nervous at all time?' Then it became somewhat obsessive, talking to someone, I'd think, 'huh, talking to this person for the first time at this exact situation, so I should/would be nervous? NO!!! Don't think such useless thought.' It was similar when doing some other things. And the obsessive and intrusive episode lasted for several days."
1761,My DMs are always open. I’m always happy to help,"In this era with covid and everything else going on in the world, it can create a lot of anxiety and depression. So if you’re ever feeling down or feel alone, I’m here for you. Never be afraid to reach out"
1762,Does anyone feel like their suffering is just a burden to people now?,"I’m struggling with the true realisation that my depression and anxiety is just a burden to people now. I know that the people who are close to me still love me, but I understand that my suffering is becoming just an annoyance to them, and they just want me to feel better so they don’t have the supposed responsibility to continue worrying about me anymore. This is something I guess I knew all along... but I also felt like there was something more. Like there was something else there when they showed concern other than just wanting it (my depression) to go away for their sake."
1763,I’m an year 11 student (uk) and recently life has become entirely meaningless,"The though that i’m going to have to resit exams and have no friends coming with me to 6th form and etc and i don’t know what to do i have nothing to look forward to and everything that i should look forward too fuckin sucks and i don’t know how to tell my girlfriend i’m scared for future for life and i can’t even get weed to stop thinking.
Life is wank"
1764,Sometimes I'll be fine and then suddenly it feels like my brain starts filling with warm water,"I don't know how else to describe it. I'll be fine, not like amazingly happy but not sad either, then all of a sudden I feel this sudden weight in my head. And then as soon as I feel this weight I don't want to do anything and I start thinking about how I've got a ton of late assignments and work to do and that makes me feel worse because my head feels so heavy that I can't even imagine doing them. I just want to eat food and watch something, or sleep. I don't understand it. I don't even know what it is. But it's so annoying."
1765,are flashbacks of events normal?,i can’t find anything on google addressing this exact question. really sorry if i sound ignorant and careless.
1766,Here if anyone needs to talk 💙,"To anyone wondering why I may post something like this, it’s because I know how it feels to be feeling bad and all those negative feelings and I’m here to tell my story

At an early age, I was diagnosed with autism which affected the way I lived and progressed, I also had very badly epilepsy, had about 10-15 fits a day sometimes, but I’m more talking about mental health, It mostly started in 2015 after I lost my nan, I have thought about her ever since and miss her like anything, I’ve had some troubles making friends over the years but I had a great best friend all the way from the start of primary school till a few months ago which we happened to stop talking after her birthday which is odd and I miss her like anything, my mum has had some relationships which weren’t the best and got me worried sometimes, and then cams year 10, 2nd year of my GCSE’s which wasn’t the best, had some bullies to worry about which had happened through most of high school and I remember the time when me and my friend got shipped as - gay - like we was a couple or something when we wasn’t and it affected my studies abit and then earlier this year I spoke up and it got sorted which was a massive thing for me and helped a lot.

The last few months have been rocky and I’m not going to go into detail but it’s getting better and I have some great friends and am doing well, so just a reminder if anyone wants to talk to someone I am here for you 🌸

PS if you read that thanks but the main thing is you all know I’m here for you and just a message away 💕"
1767,I (27F) cannot feel happiness without guilt,"Because of different reasons while growing up (like a sibling who had faced health and educational/professional hurdles) I grew up fearing success. Because my success would hurt my sibling, even if they never showed it. Now we are past that point and are living our own lives. 
However I cannot shake this feeling. Everytime the slightest good thing happens to me I cannot shake this feeling of guilt. I am almost scared of something good happening because of it. I would rather it just stay neutral. 
But because of that I don't feel happy. Its been so long since I just felt some genuine happiness. 
I don't know what to do. I don't want to be like this anymore"
1768,Please comment supportive things,"I’m having a shitty time can I get some support please, anything would work, funny stuff is just as good as nice stuff, I honestly don’t care just please comment some support I’m desperate lmao"
1769,I don’t know whether I’m right or wrong ever,"I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember and I am also experiencing low mood at the moment and have been doing for a couple of months. The whole lockdown is making me a bit worse and I don’t think my job is helping. I work in a care facility where I have found multiple of the elderly dead. I have held their hands as they’ve passed or I’ve walked in to check on them and they’ve already gone. I’ve become more detached than usual and I feel like I’m alone. I’m missing my parents a lot as I’m living with my partner and recently we’re arguing a lot more and I’m struggling with this. It’s just minor arguments which I’m usually okay with and just talk it over with him and apologise or tell him how I’m feeling but I’m struggling to do this recently. For example today. We got ready and headed downstairs and he asked me if I could feed the cats, change their litter trays and clean the kitchen up. I complained a bit, half jokey, half real, and then I continued to feed the cats, clean the kitchen floor, clean the worktops. Then he came downstairs and did the litter trays. I then said that I was going for a run. He stopped me and said “when you get back you have to help me with the rest of the cleaning” and he said it in a way that was saying that I never do anything and then he gave me this contradicting look when I said that I do clean. I felt like I was completely being spoken down to. At the moment he is jobless and cleans whilst I’m at work but the majority of the day will hang with friends, play games and search for jobs. When he was working and I was part time I used to clean everyday and I never made him feel like he wasn’t doing anything. We keep having arguments like this and they upset me a lot but don’t seem to bother him we always make up in the end but I always feel like I’m in the wrong when sometimes I’m not and I feel like it might be my mental health. I’m at a loss and I feel alone. I don’t know what to do and it’s killing me."
1770,Finally opened up to some of my friends about my depression,"This is something I’ve never talked about with anyone in my life. I’ve kept it hidden for years for a plethora of reasons. But, the other day it was especially bad while I was on a trip with my friends so I basically had nowhere to run or hide with my emotions. I had gotten extremely trashed with some friends and they said I had started sobbing for no reason and I wouldn’t reply why while blacked out.

Eventually I sobered up enough in the evening and one of my bestfriends was sitting on the back porch of the cabin with me. He was asking if everything was good before the dam just broke. I told him that I was gonna tell him something he might not believe, but that I had been struggling with depression for years. He just looked at me and listened while I told him he was the first person I had ever told and that I never like to speak about it because I’m suppose to be the “beacon of happiness” for essentially everyone. I wasn’t ready for what happened next .

He came over and hugged me while sobbing. He said that he was sorry that I have had to go through this and that I’ve had to go through this all alone. He begged me to talk to him whenever I was down because he didn’t want to wake up one day and realize I’m not there anymore. We stayed like that and talked for at least 30 minutes and throughout the night.

One of my other best friends (and future roommate) came out and I told him I needed to talk to him. So he sat down and we started talking about it. He’s not really the most emotional guy, but we’ve been there for each other. He asked a few questions and immediately went off. He said he was determined to make me wake up everyday knowing that I’m loved by everyone and that I can look myself in the mirror and say I’m happy. He said that he’d kick it with me, watch stupid movies with me, do fun trips, honestly anything to make me happy. I told him that the reason why we’re bestfriends is because he already did all that and more without knowing my situation and that’s what has made me happy and that’s why we’re always hanging out. That’s when we both broke down and immediately started sobbing.

I truly am grateful for my friends. I’m hoping this will help me. However, I won’t lie, I feel exposed. Here’s to hoping for change."

1772,I feel extremely sleepy and tired every day idk what to do,"I'm a 21(F) and I've been diagnosed with MDD and anxiety. Even though I sleep early and wake up with enough hours of sleep, I still end up taking naps or sleep the whole day because of excessive sleepiness. 

I've recently began taking my meds again since last month, and there haven't been much excitement with them. Although it's making me think that they must be the reason with this? 

I've also felt really ""unreal"" this week, dreams and reality blending that kept me feeling confused as hell. I'm not sure though if it's because of the meds because I've been fine the whole month I was taking it?

Because of this and also falling into a even more depressive state, and I struggle even more with my daily tasks. I haven't even gotten myself to write my thesis or study for an exam that I have a few days from now. I'm really confused and want to help myself so I can finally get my act together because I really need to finish all my schoolwork as I am a graduating student. Help?"
1773,What is my purpose? help.,"Its been a few days I've been feeling this odd sensation. I don't understand the meaning of anything. Every moment, every occurrence first thing comes to.my mind is why? why this? why earth? why now? Recurrent nightmares are seeming to be a normal occurrence. As the world is going through a pandemic, my mind is also dealing with one. Nothing satisfies my question. Nothing stops those dreams. I a believer of science, not that I deny God. I believe in God too. But as the science says, everything that is now is because of an accident billions of years ago, so are we just the result of chaos?? are we just something that never should have happened? like cancer or a tumour to the universe. Does the universe in its vastness cares that we are here?? I don't see my purpose here. If I go towards religion for an answer all it gives me a vengeful God, Who made me in His image but hates me and is going to punish me for eternity because I don't follow His instructions. But then again if I do mistakes after mistakes, murder people, wreck havoc and become the worst thing on earth, all it takes is just repenting?? and all my mistakes are forgiven. I can't comprehend how it works. All these thoughts all these rambling in my mind is hampering everything. I don't see any purpose to my life. why am I here? if God sent me, why? If the God didn't send me then it doesn't matter what I do, the universe never wanted me here. I know I am just going towards a path that just leads to the destruction of myself. But the thing is I can't stop it. I can't just stop thinking about these things. I don't have any control over my mind. If I go to a friend or any person I know they will just laugh and say forget about it. Told my closest person and she laughed, thinks its just a phase, I don't know how or when, but I just want some peace. Can anyone help me?? Is there anything that can help me?"

2. Helplessness is the belief nobody or nothing will save him/her or can better the situation that person is in.

3. Worthlessness is filled with self doubt and loss of meaning in existence. 

All these three combined can make a person feel that life is nothing more than a torture and maybe he's not cut out for ""living"". 
The pain seems endless with no help and no hope.
But whether a person is thinking like that or not, to find that out, you have to be either their therapist or should have really talked to them extensively about their feelings. Nobody who is going through all this will ever pick up the phone and call you to tell you their story. Atleast we shouldn't expect them to. In majority of the cases calls up and says, ""Hey, I'm depressed"". So all that posts which say ""please talk, I'm here to listen"", in my opinion they are just a way to make ourselves feel better rather than really trying to help. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. And truth be told, they aren't actually there when you need them. An actor committed suicide and everybody is concerned about mental health for a week, and people want you to call them when you're low instead of them checking up on us? That's how real concern is shown? That's not how it works. Please stop making everything a trend and then trying to fit in &amp; being a part of it. No need to be a savior of thousand lives by trying to put up a status saying, ""I'm here to listen"". Just look around you, in your family, in your friend cirlce, at work. Don't wait till another famous personality commits suicide for you to be woke again. 
If you really care about a person, approach them if you notice
1. Low mood
2. Lack of interest in activities
3. Lack of energy &amp;/or concentration
4. Decreased sleep/appetite
Listen to them.
Listen to them, create a safe space for them to open up to you, ask them how they're feeling and empathize with them. 
YOU, ME OR ANYONE can never truly understand what another person is feeling, so we should listen closely and empathize with them. And please don't say stuffs like, ""why is such a small problem bothering you"" or ""c'mon it's nothing, cheer up!"" 
As soon as you feel it's beyond your comprehension, you should help that person seek professional help.
Please be kind to each other. Only humans have the ability to use language to communicate, it's not a joke, so please use your words wisely. 
YOUR WORDS CAN MAKE/BREAK SOMEONE'S MOMENT/DAY OR EVEN LIFE. Sometimes I talk softly to someone who has done wrong to me, but being that person, I make sure that it's okay if I'm polite with my enemy but never okay if I'm rude to my friends. So let's consciously make an effort to play our parts and be the change our society needs."
1778,I forgot the title,"I hope this is the correct r/

Human nature is to stick to known things in broad spectrum of meaning.
This would imply conservatistic traits would be dominant in population.
From experience I find more people to be impulsive and constantly wanting to change. Change anything, anyone, anywhere.
This urge 'to do something' most of the times leads to something, sometimes.

I can sit all day in the same position knowing the same stuff and I am well.
Life is constant and I know tomorrow.

Society labels me as a weirdo because my own mind can entertain myself, of course I need some stimuli now and then.

This is bad?

I find very few exciting or sad moments in life, its kinda flat. Im not depressed nor antisocial. 
Im very open and get on with almost all people.

I think of myself very low and can't change it but I understand that so its a cycle. I feel like dog, nah people tell Im good, I disperse that feeling.

I feel like psychopath wanting attention so I don't seek any.

Feel lonely sometime and return to my conservative self and entertain my brain with thoughts. 
Stupid most of the time. Stupid like me cause I laugh to myself sometimes.

I ask reddit if its normal.

1780,"Excuse the crosspost. just a bit.. well you know, Terrified lol. Intrusive thought caused what I believe to be a full blown anxiety attack.","So to begin this off, I week or so ago I found a subreddit that involved mass killings ect. I went down the rabbit hole, as I usually do when I find something that is interesting, even though morbid.

For whatever reason I research the hell out of it, their motives, their words ect, not that I sympathize with them at all, infact I find it creepy that people sympathize with them, it really weirds me out.

Anyways It's been a week of researching fighting with conspiracy theorist assholes, watching confession and interrogation videos, as well as a semi stressful day yesterday.

Anyways, I do this sometimes like with those reddit posts ""What's the scariest unsolved mystery or ""Scariest unsolved tape ever"" posts, I will comb through them until i'm paranoid. This isn't very often and it lasts a week until I just stop looking into it.

Okay.. heres the hard part. I had an intrusive thought, and it was homicidal (even typing that makes my anxiety flare up, if it's even anxiety) Now, I do not want to hurt anyone, and it a combination of reading that they had those thoughts among other things that with that single intrusive thought, I FREAKED out, I felt light headed, my body was heavy and the only thing I wanted to do was get up and walk, I rushed out of bend and paced for a little thinking ""Holy shit what is happening"" My body was hot, and I was panicked, this happened at 3:30 and its 8:36 now and while the main issue went away, I still have a lingering anxiety.

Heres the other hard part, I keep getting that same intrusive thought (Not really right now) but when I was trying to go to sleep after the initial anxiety attack (Which im not sure it even was) when I close my eyes, it was like a fluttering of random pictures, the intrusive thought and a song I listened to earlier on repeat, and this happened from like 4:30 to 7. I couldn't sleep and still havens, I don't even want to try because i'm afraid as soon as i close my eyes, all that stuff will come back, as i'm typing and thinking of other shit, it's not even close to being like that right now, no intrusive thought, no song on repeat, no fluttering of random images.

When it was happening it felt like I was not in control, but I obviously was, I could think semi-rationally other than the absolute fear of what was happening.

The only thing I can even describe that was like this, was when I first got tinnitus and the thought entered my head that it would be permanent, and my body just went into full blown panic mode (It did end up being permanent)

So yes, i'm afraid, I didn't sleep yet, I don't know if I can even sleep yet, I've never really had this happen except for the tinnitus issue, which happened 5 years ago. Am I dangerous? Is this normal?

So what I felt during, body was heavy, felt like I was dropping, dry mouth, body extremely hot with some sweating, tried to watch videos but couldn't concentrate, when the first initial wave was over, still had that lingering anxiety which would ramp up if I tried to sleep, I was also yawning a lot not sure if from tiredness or what lol

Jesus christ guys, you guys deal with this everyday? I'm so sorry. I'm fucking SCARED.

So yeah Initially happened at 3:30 am, it's 8:43 am right now and I still have that weird feeling in my chest/stomach.

Also I should add I don't really normally get intrusive thoughts, if ever, and not sure if relevant I also did have around 436 to 530 mg of caffeine through soda drinking (Yes I am aware of the health issues lol)

I'm afraid that this wont just be a one off thing and I just awoke some fucking crazy anxiety disorder ..which Ironically.. Is giving me anxiety lol.

So yeah, not sure what happened, but i'm praying to whatever god exists that once i finally somehow sleep, it will be gucci.

There were also some anxiety inducing events that happened earlier in the week, such as a root canal which terrified me (But ended up being ez pz) and I need to get crowns in a few days, but i'm not really worried about that"
1781,I wrote something about anxiety and I wanted to share it with anyone who needs to feel less alone,I shared it with a friend of mine and she thinks that I should post it because others who have experienced anxiety may be able to relate and feel less alone.

1782,Just questions for those with panic attacks,The past few days I think I've been having panic attacks. I assumed it was something much worse due to some varying factors in my life recently and the actual effects. For the majority of it I had trouble focusing my breaths which led me to freak out. I began to shake vigorously and my hands began to clench up so hard I could not open them. Is this common in experiences?

1784,I think I'm crazy can anyone relate ?,"My anxiety has symptoms are crazy...

The best way to describe it is i feel like im in a dream and struggle to do daily tasks. Especially being in a car and when its bright and sunny my dreamlike anxiousness hits me the worst.

I feel like I'm crazy and no one can relate my parents constantly judge me for not doing normal 20 year old things . My anxiety has gotten to the point were I don't and can't enjoy life without a bundle of anxiety that kicks in .

If anyone out there can relate it would make me feel better just know that I'm not alone. I have gone to therapy before for this and it comes in waves. I want to feel alive and that reality is real lord fucking help me."

1786,"No will to do anything, Any advice appreciated","Hello im a 21 year old male in need of some advice

so to start off i have struggles talking to people, looking people in the eye and sometimes it gets so bad that my friends have to do the talking for me,

this all started when i was 10 years old and i started having (IBS) which makes it very hard for me to go outside so i kinda never left my home except for school until i became 15 years old, when i became 15 i got my drivers license and i couldnt even enter stores alone anymore or even order food from mcdonalds.

this has became a little better nowadays but people still see me as super weird or they think i dont like them cause i can barely talk to them. this has ofcourse made it so ive lost all my friends except two.

so after losing almost all of my friends, barely being able to go outside cause of my IBS, ive been having alot of thought about killing myself and i have become very grey if you can call it that.

grey meaning that i barely have any emotions left, i can see people getting really hurt and stuff likes that where people usually react like: are you okay? or should we call an ambulance?. And ill just stand there or not even bother,

the worst part is the suicidal part, it has seriously limited my way of functioning combined with my IBS

like almost everynight i go out for night drives where i on purpose drive very fast on windy roads just for the chance that my car will lose traction and ill go out quick, im to much of a pussy to hang myself.

i got a job 5 months after graduating and was only able to work there for 3 days cause everyday i would just come home and cry myself to sleep cause of my suicidal thoughts, so i graduated 1 year ago and has worked 3 days of that time and i cant find anything that can make me happy.

like i wanna start working out but i cant find any will power for it, like i wake up att 3 pm then i just mindlessly sit and do nothing for 5 hours before i go to sleep again and repeat next day.

ive started doing digital art and that has helped a little with my suicidal thoughts but it will take years for me to be able to make a career of that.

&amp;#x200B;

any advice for me to get motivation or supressing these suicidal thought?

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr: just me ranting cause i have noone to go too for help and i just wanna find someone which have some tips for me to become a functioning person again so i can make my parents proud.

btw im new to reddit so im sorry if i did anthing wrong"

1788,"Bad thoughts, advice appreciated","I get bad thoughts of sexual things with people and such even though I have a girlfriend that I love. I get these thoughts and they do not seem to leave my mind even if I distract myself they find their way back. I want to know if there is anything I can do to get these thoughts away. I am upset about them because even if they are bad I still can get aroused. She, she being my girlfriend, does not like this as she has self esteem and self hate issues. I do not want to upset her but telling her I have these thoughts seem to reduce my worries and calm me I guess is the way to say it. Telling her puts my mind at ease and makes me calm down. Does anyone have any advice?"
1789,I'm too stupid to exist,"Hey everyone. As stated in the title, I'm simply too dumb to live. I can't keep up with my uni (I should be about to finish year 4 but I'm stuck in year 2), anything requiring mental focus is beyond tedious, I barely speak my mother tongue (let alone English and other languages). People think it's ok to call me up on it and say I'm ""simple"" as a euphemism for ""literally brain dead"". No, it's inappropriate. I've always thought I wasn't the brightest out there but not really that I'm the stupidest out of all the people who have ever inhabited the earth. I don't even feel like a person anymore. I feel inferior to the fly, stupid little fly.

It's a surprise nothing has killed me yet - and I wish it did. I don't deserve to be alive because of how stupid I am. The simplest of things overwhelm me. I shouldn't be allowed to contact actually thinking humans. It's so bad that I started having delusions that my brain is dead, just my cerebellum is active to provide me with the most primal survival. I can't even reach out to my psychologist as her office is shut down because of the pandemic.

I feel horrible. I think about killing myself to stop this misery and spare everyone having to deal with such an intellectual disgrace. 

I have a psychiatrist appointment soon. Should I tell her about it? Maybe it's one of my delusions (schizotypal here). 

Maybe, once my psychologist opens up, I should ask about intelligence tests. However, I'm terrified of them. I don't want to turn out to be intellectually disabled, which 99% I am. 

While I'm waiting for my appointments, I don't know what to do. This feeling kills me."
1790,A splurge of my thoughts TL:DR I am fed up with myself.,"Where do I start? I am a compulsive liar, I have anger issues, and sometimes I think my thoughts are a bit suicidal....

Let's start with the lies, all my life I have lied. Since I was a child; they range from tiny to massive. For example my wife will ask if I have done something like if I filled up the salt shaker, and 9/10 times I will say I have regardless if I actually have or not. She will then go to use and realise that I haven't, she will then come to me and ask again to which I become aggressively adamant that I have, when when she holds it in front of me. The worst was when I had been telling her when we were up to date with the rent and out landlord called her asking why we had only been paying half for 3 months; to say the least she was embarrassed &amp; furious. Things like this have been going on all my life, to the point were I can see it on faces of my wife and family that they don't believe a word i say. I have tried so many times on my own to sort it out. Scouring the internet for help but never actively sought professional help; my wife has encouraged me to but I haven't.

Through it all my wife is still with me but our relationship is soo extremely strained by it.

To be VERY CLEAR with my anger, I have NEVER once been physical with anyone. The only person I have ever hit with my anger is myself. Whenever the lying starts an argument it will get to the point of us screaming at each other i walk away and start muttering to myself and the anger continues to build and build to were I am soo angry I wanna lash out, so I punch myself; usually the jaw or cheek bone were I instantly feel it the pain to calm myself down. I will end up hitting myself a few times before it works. Try to hide it by switching sides to minimise bruising. I let the anger build up so bad it just explodes.

The suicidal thoughts I think about is when ever I wait for public transport. It can either be a bus or train, when it approaches I watch it and imagine myself jumping in front of it. I wonder what it would feel like, would it be quick &amp; painless, would i feel the train push me forward first, would I survive the hit and then get dragged underneath... 

The only thing that always that stops me is the thought of the damage I would do to my family, the driver and passengers; I also personally think that suicide is a cowardly way out but I is my personal opinion on the matter. I do understand that those who do commit suicide are going through a lot but I that there is always another way, that and the damage suicide does to everyone around you."
1791,I have no motivation to work,"Please don’t judge :/ maybe I am just lazy but I would love to know if there’s anyone out there who struggles like I do and how they deal with it. I genuinely have no motivation to get a job. It’s not dire, I’m in my early 20s in college and I’m really fortunate that my parents pay for my absolute necessities but I still pay for extra stuff (clothes, eating out, traveling, etc). I never ask them for anything. Anyway, I still want to make money and work because A. I have a dog and I want to obviously provide for him and B. I’m graduating really soon and want to save to move out. The only problem is I genuinely have no motivation to work. It’s not that I don’t want to, I do want to, I love the idea of making money and I’ve had jobs in the past but every time I think about working I get filled with this intense dread that makes me never want to move off my couch. I know my dog should be enough to motivate me to work but I feel bad saying it’s still not. At my old job I used to cry before and after work everyday because it was so emotionally draining for me. I tried DoorDash and it was difficult to even motivate myself to do that and it’s not even hard and I barely have to speak to anyone. I feel so ashamed of myself and how lazy I’m being, I don’t want to be this way I just genuinely feel like I can’t do it. I have an interview for a retail position on Tuesday and I need to get something to wear and I can’t even motivate myself to go out and buy anything let alone go to the interview. I feel like I’m such a failure because of it and like I said I feel so ashamed and embarrassed which in a way only makes me want to lay on the couch and do nothing even more. I’m just not really sure what to do to get myself up and moving. I used to be able to just force myself but I can’t even do that anymore."

1793,How can I get rid of of intrusive thoughts?,[deleted]
1794,A Life Within a Life,"There are essentially many types of diagnosed mental health “conditions” that many of us battle with on a daily basis. In my case, I am what my psychologist describes as a manic-depressive, obsessive compulsive man that suffers from severe panic attacks. My days are as normal as a “normal persons”. I am extremely successful with business, lead normal relationships (or so I think), and have 3 wonderful children. 

In my situation, I always feel I am living a life within a life, and never my own life. I feel like it’s borrowed time, almost like a borrowed body. I put on this mask to become daddy, to be this business extraordinaire but it’s never really who I am. And then that begs the question: who am I? A good friend of mine once asked who knew me, “who actually knew me”...and I didn’t have an answer so the reality is I don’t even know if I know myself. 

I don’t say that in terms of being down on myself. I say it in an uplifting manner. The life I am living within this shell of a life is the life I actually control, my life. I’ve spent so much time running away from my mental health problems instead of embracing them. Sure, it isn’t healthy to embrace psychotic behavior that is destructive. But the majority of the time, I just want to tell myself - or for gods sake just hear one time from my psychologist - it’s OK to be myself. It’s OK to blend in with my habits. It’s OK to feel down, or to feel up. I am who I am, I’m doing my best to lead a life and I am tired of being treated like a caged animal. I feel good, I look good, I’m successful and sure I have moments but I am OK! 

And so are you! What’s your story? Do you feel so abnormal from how others treat you, what the internet tells you, or how it feels good to recluse in your home to low rhythm music and feel deeply in your bones you’re not OK because that’s what the world tells you? 

Here’s to a new normal, a new chapter. It’s OK to feel this way. We ARE normal.

The answer is to just stop doing that. My life is spiraling out of control. I feel like i have nothing real to contribute to the world but I know that’s not true. Pretty much everyone in my life tells me I’m intelligent yet I never feel that way. I got a job as an electrical engineer when I was in high school. I know that’s incredibly impressive but it doesn’t feel that way. If I build something then people tell me “they could never do that” but anyone could figure it out. I know that’s not true but for some reason I don’t believe it. Why do I tear myself down when I make a mistake even though I understand that it’s normal and not a big deal?

When I get anxious or, for the lack of a better term, cringe I randomly say stuff that is out of my control. Sometimes, I don't realize I've said them until 20 seconds later. Most common are ""You fucking moron"" and (I love you (insert any ex gf/crush name here)). All my life, I've mostly ignored this occurrence but in the recent years it has gotten quite frequent, couple of times every day. Depends on how stressful the day was and did I have any distractions or I just sat home doing nothing. I realize that this could be interpreted as TS so I wanted to ask If anybody had similar experiences or knows anything about this because I can't find much other than TS on the internet.

1808,Why do I sometimes feel like I’m being watched?,"Am I just a paranoid person? 
Sometimes I feel like there are hidden cameras around my house and that someone (sometimes people I know) are watching me, especially in the bathroom.

And I know it’s a bizarre thought but it doesn’t stop the feeling, I’m not too sure how else to describe it.
When I go walking I sometimes feel like I’m being watched or followed. I’m also very self conscious of people looking at me, mainly when men in cars look at me. Not to say that I’m not friendly to those who do look or smile at me.


When I was a kid I would have to get changed in the corner of my room in case someone/ something was watching. When I went to the bathroom I had to hold the bathroom’s cupboard door shut because I thought something was watching me from the inside of it."
1809,Is this normal?,"I’m 19F - 
I remember years ago having a realization that it had been a long time since I felt ‘content’ regularly. I feel like my normal is down. Like there are many things in life that can make a person sad, even things that can lead to long-term sadness that are totally normal - I have very low self esteem, that makes me sad, I feel like a failure, I’m scared about my future, I’m insecure over my social life - these things all make me sad. And I can be happy. Getting an good grade, talking with friends, laughing with family - I have moments of happiness every day. But I feel like if I took all of the negatives and positives away I’d just be sad. Like ‘down’ is my default. 
Quarantine has made this so much worse, because I have no distractions and I’m stuck in my head, but this has been going on for years. I feel like I’m fighting a constant up hill battle to feel content, to just not have this pit of sadness in my stomach, and though I’m happy regularly I always come back down within a few days. The descent seems inevitable and inescapable. 

I’ve told my mom how I’m feeling before and she’s always said that bad times are normal - but is it normal to be constantly going down? Like do bad times happen to everyone for seemingly no reason every few days?

And I know I don’t have it bad - I’m definitely not and have never been suicidal, but I guess I’m wondering if how I feel is totally normal and I should just deal with it for the rest of my life, or if there’s something I could do to stop it, because its getting fucking exhausting"
1810,"WARNING: The user TheEpicKing777 is going around and telling people to put an end to themselves, as well as being racist.","Posting on an alt as I am honestly scared of this user's actions.

The user u/theepicking777 is going around this subreddit as well as others and using nasty remarks to put people down. He even says mental illness doesn't exist and is actually based on IQ, which is clearly false because many clever people have mental illness.

I did some investigating and his Instagram account is           . I am not going to post it atm because its just awful. He has another Instagram account which I wont name because of a terribly illegal post right at the top."
1811,I was sexually harassed. How to cope?,"A long time ago, I saw a girl who seemed to be walking away from highschool. They were very sexy. I felt harassed. I did not ask for them to be so sexy. It makes me impulsive and uncomfortable. So anyway, that wasn’t the worst part. I followed them and then later asked them for their instagram. And they didn’t give me it. This is disgusting and bating. You know those people in gta who use mods and freeze characters then have money drop in front of them, then they collect it and then release the frozen person and kill them? This is the same mindset of these sexy women. But women are much worse. Because this is not a game, it was complete reality. In fact by women being sexy they are setting up hundreds and thousands of men to be set up for prison. This is absolutely disgusting. How can I cope with women sexually harassing me?"

1813,Broken,"I think there something obviously wrong with me that I can’t see it and the people around me are too polite/caring to say. 

I’m 21 years old and have just finished university, I should feel over the moon but I’m not. I’m just anxious and depressed about the next chapter in my life, I’m living at home with my sister and parents again which i thought would be great but I’ve been hating my time here... all of my childhood friends moved away when I was a kid so growing up I had only my ptsd alcoholic dad and paranoid mum to hang out with(I’m ex-yugo so the ptsd stems from the war I thought), sometimes i question if they really know me at all.. I want to blame them for  me feeling this way but i don’t know... 

my best friends (only 3) have all coupled up which I’m very envious of.. I wish I had what they have and to be able to  build connections/ relationships with others.. I’m so lost in what to, I’m yet to date a girl and get stuck in this mindset where I just lock my self out. Mum and dad keep asking about girls ect which I f****g hate!! I’m loosing my mind, when will life become the way I thought it would growing up?"
1814,Pretending you're not suicidal.,"Hello,

27F, I'm from a middle class family, mother having trouble with expressing emotions towards me, rarely physical, didnt like to hug her children, rarely even told us she loved us. She's the type who will try to convince you she sacraficed everything to raise you, so that you were successful thus you should be forever grateful. She's very focused on keeping up the appearance of a perfect family life. Noone really knows what has been happening to me.

Father - an agressive type. Worked his whole life, made some money in his own company. Once he gets angry he looses it. Bigger guy, he will grab you by your clothes and push you towards a wall. He has frequently beaten me with a leather belt, no pants. I still remember the sound of the closet hinge he was keeping them in. For the outside people - perfectly nice guy. Too nice. 

Have 2 brothers, 6 and 12 years apart. They both did martial arts as teens so they were perfectly capable of choking me while holding me down to the ground. I was always bruised on my neck, arms, legs. They enjoyed doing that to me. And i was so young, then it felt normal to me. Now we very rarely speak. We have no family relations. I dont care for them... 

Last year while still living with my parents, due to my brother's mental breakdown, during an argument we had above the staircase my father almost pushed me off the stairs. While my mother was yelling ""shut the front door, neighbors are going to hear you"". She didn't defend me, the only time it really mattered.

I was scared. Ran to my car, frantically drove off, scratching the car door while trying to leave as fast as I could.  Drove 20km away, parked in the field and slept for the whole day in my car, ocassionaly crying my eyes out.

Everything was curated to look so perfectly from the outside I felt like my boyfriend felt like I was overreacting. Like it wasn't really happening to me.

Then came the depression. I was both working a dream job and finishing my university. A lot of stress, a lot of pressure. I starved myself because I was afraid to sit with other people at the work dinner table. I hated listening to their perfect lives because mine was so awful. 

Then I tried cutting. It brought me some relief. Noone even blinked at home. Noone knew. 

I moved out very shortly after but was left with a huge mental scar. I think of suicide every single day. 

I'm not worthy of living. I hate myself and people around me who wouldn't protect or understand me. I went to therapy for some time. Done antidepressants. But I saw no progress... so I quit. 

I just don't know what to do. I hate it so much, what it did to me. Who I am because of it. I disconnected from everyone I ever knew. I pretend I'm ok because it's the only way i know how to behave. I don't speak to my father, even though my mother desperately wants me to.

I just don't know how to cope with this. I want to get back to hurting myself.... what should I do. 

Please help me. 

P.S. If you are still reading this - thank you it means a lot to me. Sorry for any grammar mistakes. English is my second language. Thank you"
1815,Disassociaton,"It all started about 6 months ago, around February. I had a particularly bad week, and slowly felt more and more.... weird. It felt like the world around me wasn't real, like I was playing a video game or watching a movie. It has gotten worse every week since then. I told my mom, and began going to a therapist. He didn't really help me at all. He would listen to me talk, sometimes explain elements of anxiety in general, but nothing more. He talked a lot about what we would do to help me, but never followed through.

Last session he told me he was going on a vacation, and that if I needed to talk more we could negotiate after. The way he said it it seemed he thought we were done.

But the problem is, it's all just gotten so much worse.  I feel like I'm walking around half asleep. I get surprised every time I talk because it feels like I am just a passive viewer in my life. I constantly feel like I'm about to faint. When I look at nature or anything well-lit it looks completely unreal, like it's a painting or a movie. Sounds are louder, and I am more jumpy/on edge. It's so bad I don't know how I get through the day.

I honestly don't know what to do. I need help, but my mom is pretty mad about how much money therapy cost. I'm norwegian, so there is an option of ""public therapy"" which is much cheaper but 1. My problems apparently aren't bad enough (like my mom said, you basically need to be on the brink of death) and 2. I would get a child/teen therapist, who mostly deal with more child/teen issues. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. Please help."
1816,My best friend (17F) told me that she has been hallucinating for a few weeks now. She doesn't do drugs hasn't even touched alcohol in her life,Ik by the way she sounded that I wasn't.... Three instances she told me included one where she saw a woman instead of a pole. Second where she could see her mother peeking in her room when she wasn't even home(essential worker) and third that she can see the outlines of two ppl outside her bedroom window when she sleeps (lives on the 3rd floor)
1817,"Does anyone else hat the slogan "" stop using your mental health as a crutch""","Like thanks mom Im glad you realize how traumatized I am. I'm glad that my past doesn't matter and that after a I've been through only being 23 I should be doing everything everyone else does. This line always comes out when I explain that I'm having trouble making progress. I'm diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar disorder, bpd and PTSD. I wish I could live a life without my mental illnesses holding me back but I'm not at that stage yet. It feels like even people who love and support you have very little empathy for us. My mother was always good at taking care of us but I've received quite a few traumas during my short life and it seems to just rack up. I'm doing alot better now but due to having shit sleep for 3+ years have no energy to make the progress I would be able to do otherwise"
1818,I feel like I have no way out,I live in an emotionally abusive household. My depression is getting worse. My anxiety is constant. I’ve been dissociating (dpdr) and I can barely stomach eating food. I have no one I can talk to because no one understands and everyone leaves me eventually. My suicidal thoughts have been coming back because I just don’t see a future for myself
1819,Just wrote my suicide letter,"Haha I don't know, these days just feel like a nightmare that I can't wake up to and I really need to wake up, I wrote a suicide letter, didn't even cry or anything, I feel pointless I feel empty"
1820,I kept hitting myself for 20 minutes yesterday,"Slapping, scratching, pinching, punching and also talking to myself. I've never experienced this before... I mean sometimes I hit myself once or twice when get very frustrated or stressed but this time I did it for 20 minutes straight. and at the same time I was ""talking"" to the pictures on my wall (I knew I was talking to myself) and listing why I should/shouldn't kill myself. I kinda snapped out of it but I still have urges to hit myself I don't understand what's happening."
1821,My extreme need for sleep us ruining my life,"I hate weekdays as my sleep gets interrupted in the morning. If it wasn't for my work, I'd sleep from 10pm at least to 10am. If not even longer. 14 to 16 hours are normal for me before I feel refreshed. When friday evening hits, I'm extremely tired so that I'll sleep to 2pm of saturday. Sunday is completely ruined because I won't be able to sleep the next night until I fall asleep in the morning - and then sleep 16 hours again. It's now 8pm, I have completely missed the whole day, and now I'll will be tired on monday. Right after work on monday I'll fall asleep, but still be too tired on tuesday. This will continue to friday were I'll fall asleep after work and sleep until 2pm of saturday. The circle continues..."
1822,What the hell is wrong with me ????,"I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but for the past four months this feels much worse.....

I constantly feel like all my friends hate me. I'm always afraid that they don't want me and that they want me to leave them, or that they will leave me. I often get very anxious when I am alone, but I don't know how to reach out to people when I need help. Sometimes it gets to the point where I can't stop thinking people hate me and I feel paranoid. 

I've lost so many friends over the years. I try my best to be a good friend, but when my mental health goes bad, they leave. When upset I feel the need to hurt myself. I have impulsively cut myself without even realizing what I’m doing, and  usually I hit myself in the head or on my legs over and over until my legs bruise so I can feel something . I also have thoughts about wanting people to beat me up because my hate for myself goes so deep that sometimes I feel like pain is the only way to release what I feel. I have had suicidal ideations for nearly two yearss

I’ve been dissociating - I feel disconnected and like I don’t exist. I know I’m depressed. I find it hard to get out of bed and motivate myself. I cry a lot. I hate myself as a person, my personality, how I look. I have anxiety a lot too and I have self harmed

But I also can’t control my thoughts. I feel like my mind is out of control. I see mental images of me slamming my head into windows or. breaking down and becoming insane even though I am not currently insane I don't think. I am afraid that I will one day go insane without knowing. I hit myself in the head when I’m upset and I don’t know why. I make so many mistakes.

Sometimes I think I see things moving but they aren’t. I feel paranoid a lot of the time and think of all the ways that people I know can hurt me if they wanted to. 

I can’t read people and I don’t know if they like me. But I’m very clingy and desperate for people to like me because I can’t handle being alone. The loneliness makes me suicidal. I try to be a good friend and I help everyone and am nice to everyone so they don't leave me and I never let anyone know about my struggles

I don’t feel like I’m coherent at all right now and I’m sorry but I am desperate because I don’t know why I’m like this"
1823,Me is autism depression schizoprenia lol,"Hello. I am autism.... I have trouble talking to people... no one likes me... lol dunno why...

I am depression. Sad... *cries* me hurt myself lol.

Hello uhh I am hearing the voices all the time... I mean... it’s like... my neighbors talking... and ya know... my voices telling me to... *TAKE UBER* lol k u know the meme right? Put ze fire in ze fire pit lol. Oh yeah... people... they’re following me!?!? Oh yeah one time I went to a hospital they asked if I’m hearing voices inside or outside my head... shit I didn’t research how am I gonna convince them I have schizo??? Yooo bruh so when I first went to the hospital I wasn’t hearing any voices. Then when they asked me if I’m hearing voices the third day checkup I’m like yes bruh I am keep me here I need some attention.

Jk. All this is fucking fake. And I’m no different from anyone else in this subreddit. Only difference is im fucking admitting I have no mental illnesses because it’s made up for attention."
1824,I just want to say thank you to this community.,"Before I leave this community, due to trying to cut back on the internet, I want to say thank you. This community has helped me fight back when I was dealing with feelings of worthlessness and self hatred, you helped build me back up and pushed me to better myself. Thank you all for being so supportive of me. Please take care of yourselves, you deserve the very best."
1825,Do I have a mental illness or not?,"With emotions I either don’t get them or can’t understand them, alot of the time I fake emotions, i have a short temper and when I’m mad my brain just goes blank and everything just happens, I don’t understand how people work so I try to work them, I’m obsessed with money and crime, drugs etc, I want people to like me I just don’t like people but i do at the same time so it’s hard cuz I really dc about anything, if people die even if there family I don’t get “hurt”, I hate school, not cuz it’s hard it’s the opposite (but everyone thinks I’m dumb cuz that’s what I show people when I’m probably smarter then the “smart kid” and why I do this is because think about it people in school people who are “smart” get projected as weak and are unliked, and I want people to like me) i hate authority, I say sorry but I don’t think I’ve ever meant it, even to my mom, cuz people don’t really matter to me(my mom don’t count she my mom yk) cuz there not me, if I like something, I get it I’ll work my ass off even if I have to change how I look or how I have to act, I’ve had gfs where we say I love you and all that but I don’t even know what love is, if I do have a mental illness (don’t think I do though) is this something where it could wreck my life? 

only asking because curios if it’s trauma or some type of mental illness"
1826,not sure if this counts as mental health but need opinions please!,"i’ll start off by saying i’m on mobile so sorry if there’s any mistakes! 

So i actually have all my mental illness under control ( i suffer from PTSD, Panic Disorders and Depression and Anxiety). i’ve just recently been having issues with my identity, what my interest and hobbies are and my style.

I’ve always flipped flopped on almost every aspect of my life and i feel like i can’t focus on something for more then a month at a time. I’ll start to have interest in something and really dive deep into it but in a month or so i’ll have interests in other things, this is with a lot of things in my life. I want to eventually go to school for something that i’m interested in but i’ve never been able to stay interested in something for enough time to actually pay enough money to go lol. 

mainly i’m just wondering if anyone else has these issues, if it’s something i should possibly seek help for or if it’s just normal and i’m just over thinking things.... 

all help is welcome and i’ll really take ANY constructive advice :) sorry if this is a little confusing i’m more then willing to answer questions if need be aswell!!! thanks a ton if you have ideas lol!!!"
1827,Is there something wrong with me.,"So I live in central Pennsylvania in the only town, I'm a 21 year old man, and I have 3 freinds I trust deeply but as of now they all have been very busy and growing as people and I support them fully implicitly. I've been trying to talk to new people and try to do any form of activity but everyone but those 3 people either ignore me or brush me off.. i feel so alone, and unwanted. I talked to my family about this and they have no advice for me, I don't know what to do. Is it the way I look? Or the way i act. I'm a very kind person and i just don't know what to do, why do people avoid or ignore me"
1828,"I laugh during really inappropriate situations, is there something wrong with me?","Hi! I have a tendency to laugh during situations when I shouldn't be laughing. For example, I was in a work meeting this week with my boss and other executives of the company and a person was having major technical difficulties (out of my control) starting a presentation. While my boss was becoming visibly upset because this was a very important meeting for our department, I was trying super hard to not laugh so I kept looking down at the floor because I was grinning like an idiot, I think they saw my face though. I know this sounds bad, but I've noticed that I tend to laugh when I see people struggling with things that come easy to me. I'm not a mean person, and I treat people the way I'd like to be treated, but honestly what is wrong with me? I don't want to be in a situation where I make people mad because it appears that I'm not taking things seriously."

1830,How can i mentally prepare to fight a wrongdoer?,"Hi, i’m a 19 y/o male, I’ve been picked on since i was a kid, you know, the usual + alot of trauma that significantly affected the way i comprehend &amp; the way i simply function, amid the chaos some hyena decided to take the chance &amp; from that prove their stronger even though physically they’re not, My mind isn’t right, i’m very flawed &amp; that made me stay in my place for months before i leave once then return, i’m also sick with different symptoms, such as blood pressure, nerve pain, very weak &amp; cloudy eyes, cracking body after every move,  an uncontrolled diabetes &amp; a possible developed OCD which i can’t stress enough of how much i believe that it exists in me &amp; a few others here &amp; there. i try to be good in my heart but nothing seems to be good to me, i always do what is right or i try to yet this is how i get rewarded unfortunately, either by disrespect from a family member or even from myself, i never wanted to type in this online but god knows i’m trying to fix everything still, apologies for the question &amp; the rant, i wish to type more but i don’t want to expose myself more."
1831,I went to a mental hospital 21 years ago,"So I wanted to see what it was like. Went there. Told them I’m sad. No evidence. Said it with a smile. They let me in because they just want fucking money lmao. Anyway, I went during the summer and it was a kids unit. During the summer there’s like 8 people and they told me during school there is 40. Alright so... anyway...

*ALL OF THEM WERE ATTENTION SEEKING FAKERS.*"
1832,Can we just talk? I'm scared about my anxiety attack. I'm not sure whats normal and what isn't.,"So long story short, had a weird day, was tired. Drove out to work to make sure I didn't have to relieve someone, I didn't. On way back for whatever reason I made a scenario in my head that car without headlights was following me, it wasn't real but it was supposed to be just a creative thought process/writing thing.

The following weeks I had been researching mass shooters, mass killings ect, I always go down rabbit holes of morbid stuff and generally freak myself out and then I stop, usually has me on edge for a few days, but nothing like this.

While laying down, had a single homicidal intrusive thought about someone in my house, and not even a milisecond later, I was in fight or flight. Pacing, panicking, dry mouth, limbs felt heavy, felt dizzy and light headed. How is this happening to me? am I going to become one of them? Comparing my traits to them ect.

I knew it was an anxiety or panic attack though, this same feeling happened when one of my worst fears appeared, I got tinnitus, this same exact feeling. Which.. had another symptom, whenever i'd close my eyes I would just play out random uncontrollable scenarios (this is what SCARES me the most) and they would make me super anxious, they aren't scary or anything, and only happen when I close my eyes. But now I just have a bit in my stomach that sometimes rises a little, then doesn't.

I can't pretend i'm not scared, and I can't pretend im not reposting this, but I can't sleep, not sure if that's normal.

I'm hoping I just wound myself up with all this stuff and it was a onetime thing. Is that likely that if I just avoid all the morbid shit, this won't ever happen again? It's never been a problem but once in my life, when I realized I had a permanent issue forever (tinnitus) The same panic. I also had roughly 500mg of caffeine earlier in the day, not sure if that makes it worse."
1833,"Do not make contact with ""theepicking777""!!!","He is a troll account going around many mental health subreddits telling people to kill themselves. He has offered DMs for ""help"" and then talks down to them.

Please report him and it would be appreciated if you would spread awareness of him and other troll accounts like him by posting about it."
1834,How to stop racing thoughts/overthinking about someone?,"So I have reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety with elements of social anxiety. As a result of the depression I have racing thoughts, and as a result of the anxiety I tend to overthink things..This combination makes my head evaluate and think about every possible aspect of all things of my life and all possible outcomes and consequences of things.

This last episode of my depression, every time I've been interested in some girl/woman I've met a few times, and it seems like she might find me a bit attractive... I think about literally everything: 

Things like how I would go forward, what it would be like if I got rejected, if I would be down to marry even though I'm not a marriage kind-of-guy, if I would be willing to have kids, a scenario where I convince the person to adopt instead, getting to know her friends, etc.

I know it sounds insane, but this is all against my will. This combo of symptoms is a plague of the mind. I may be a little lonely, but then again who isn't? And my upbringing has made me into a person who has chronic existential crises whenever I'm not in a relationship. That being said, it's not like I'm super-needy or desperate either. A few girls I think were fairly attractive have shown interest in me this past year, but the feeling hasn't been mutual.

This isn't limited to dating, etc. But I believe it can be especially bad when it comes to dating. So please, does anyone have any idea of how to stop this? I'm going to therapy. But it doesn't really ""solve"" it.

tl;dr: As a result of depression and anxiety I have severe racing thoughts and overthink everything. Especially about people I'm attracted to. Any advice of how to stop this?"
1835,I can’t stop thinking I’m a bad person?,"I’ve been an absolute mess MH wise since I was 12. Just being depressed/reckless not caring about anything. A few years ago I got my life together, found a good job, I have a career plan, met someone, got my own flat and I’m out of debt. But now I have a constant feeling of guilt and dread that I’m just the absolute worst person ever. 

I have constant thoughts in my head that I don’t deserve anything good and that any good thing I do is just false. Sometimes I get angry and withdraw from other people and I feel like I’m being really rude, I feel like I’m not myself. 

I feel like I’m turning into some evil person? I don’t understand where the thoughts come from... I can spend days feeling sick to my stomach with guilt? How do I stop this?"
1836,You are not wrong,"You are not broken, wrong, stupid or defective for having a mental health issue. It’s not IQ, it’s not morality, it’s not god judging you or punishing you. It is just a chemical imbalance. That’s all 

The human body needs to be in perfect balance, especially the brain and sometimes it gets it wrong. Just a small imbalance can cause big problems. Sometimes it inherited or random genetics, sometimes it’s caused by experiences or traumas. It can be treated, it can be managed and no one else has the right to say anything about your health."
1837,I think I’m going crazy,"
Funny thing is I’m already in a mental hospital.
I just started laughing uncontrollably It’s so absurd. I’m sitting here in this big room on a couch. There is a lady here that talks to herself and always tells the same story. 
Next to me are two Jesus‘s discussing who is the real one. 
There is a woman screaming at a plant. And this guy that just sits here and is like 
Where the fuck am I. 
Meanwhile end of the world ist playing on repeat. And I just can’t help but laughing. Not at anyone specificity. Just this situation. It’s just so surreal. And I can’t go im stuck here 
I can’t sleep because of the screaming. I hope I can go on a different ward by tomorrow."

1839,saw someone hit a deer with their car this morn and idk how to process it?,"saw a deer get hit at like 5 am and it was so sad i parked behind it and called nonemergency popo to help but eventually i moved before they got there cos ppl kept honking and eventually i left and i feel bad cos what if it got hit again and i’ve been feeling anxious since then eueudisnsisjsjd tryna take deep breaths it was like writhing and trying to use it’s front feet to drag itself out of the road cos back feet fucked up but it couldnt so so so sad makes me feel like i want to die ahhh when stuff like that happens my brain just immediately goes to suicide like ""if u kill urself now u will never have to process this emotion that would be so much better just do that"" and i don’t actually feel that way but that is just my brain’s kneejerk reaction. i know when the feelings are there somewhere but idk how to bring them into the conscious part of my brain and even if i did idk if i would want to bc ik it would be a painful experience. i feel like i oscillate bw being entirely emotionally suppressed and having wildly disproportionate emotional reactions to things during which i feel entirely out of control. these episodes are fucking god awful and are almost triggered at random kind of like one drop that overflows the cup. but it makes me feel rly anxious when these things happen cos ik it’s just adding to the cup. i feel like to a lot of ppl these things happen and they don’t see it as a big deal like my boyfriend says that u just feel bad for a bit and then u accept that these things happen and move forward but it is not so easy for me"

1843,my best friend cut me out of their life,"we  are both dealing with similar things in terms of mental health and we mutually shared the deep parts of our lives, and we were very close. he told me a few days ago not to text him anymore. he says he wants space and is cutting everyone off because he doesn’t deserve friends but I can’t help but feel like this is my fault and that I ruined his mental health"
1844,MODS: Where are you????,"How many people need to report this theepicking777 dude before you resolve this? Clear violation of Rule 5 of this sub.

All the other subs seem to be capable of removing his toxic and hateful rhetoric. 

PLEASE take him away. 

Personally I’ll miss the level of sickness he is displaying because I’m fascinated by the behavior, but there are a lot of innocent people being slapped unexpectedly by his hate. Is this sub open to these types of attacks? There is only so much we can do from this side to try and warn people."
1845,*ALSO IMPORTANT*,"I just wanted to let you guys know that if you go to that asshole's (Theepicking777) profile and look under more options, you can report him/it directly to Reddit. I did that...just link one of his comments and send the report.

PLEASE DO THIS EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. I am starting a movement against the mod on this sub. I have reported him/IT (that asshole bullying people) SEVERAL freaking times and he/IT has NOT been banned yet. So I took it higher and told Reddit itself that the mod is doing NOTHING on this sub. I hope the mod gets banned or removed because this can NOT go on any longer.

Thanks for listening. This is sooooo different than my usual posts lol. I am feeling FEISTY today! :D

LOVE to you guys and don't let anyone tell you that you aren't a wonderful person. &lt;3"
1846,First time going to therapy,"Hey, I'm not sure why I'm typing this, but I'm just super anxious and just wanted to went. 
I've struggled with depression and anxiety for over 4 years now and tomorrow is the first time ever I'm going to be talking about it with a professional. I mostly didn't seek help earlier because my parents weren't very supportive about it and I was in bad terms with them. I'm super awkward and shy and suck at socializing so I'm scared about how this is going to turn out and what type of questions she's going to ask me. The thought of opening up to someone who I dont know terrifies me.
My mind is racing with a thousand thoughts per minute and I dont know what can help me relax.
If any of you have gone for therapy, how was your experience? Did it help at all?"
1847,I'd like to express my anger that is alongside many of you to r/theepicking777.,"You know what? It's not worth it. I'm not gonna scream my head off to a 15 year old by the name of Michael Nguyen Dinh, he lives in Irving, TX in case you are wondering as well. I'm done right now. If he replies to this I won't give a shit because I couldn't give a shit anymore at this point. I'm autistic as well and the BULLSHIT he said about it made so pissed. But it' whatever :) it's the goddamn internet :) have a good day!"
1848,Crippling Misanthropy,"Hi all.

I have no friends, and never had any good relationship with another human. I always thought it was because the people around me, and because I have bad social skills. But now I realize that its because I have no intrinsic interest in interacting with people. I want to want to interact with people, and have good relationships, but I just can't. I feels so unnatural, people all seem to be in the uncanny valley for me, and I would rather just be alone. But that is probably part of the reason why I feel depressed.

There are times when I'm in a social environment, and instead of paying attention to the people around me, I will start counting ceiling panels or carpet patterns or something like that. Then I wonder why people don't like me.

So the question I'm trying to ask I guess is how can I develop curiosity and interest in other people, because I want to have good relationships and interactions with people instead of being so isolated.

Thanks for reading"
1849,MODS please,Mods you need to do something about theepicking777. He’s seriously affecting us all. The shit he’s said to me in private messages is disgusting. Get rid of him please!
1850,My psych. keeps mentioning “manifestations” when addressing my depression. What does it mean in this context?,"“Are you having any manifestations?” 
“Troubling manifestations?”"
1851,Why is it that you can’t “just stop”?,"Person 1: I have anxiety/depression/whatever mental illness
Person 2: just stop brah uwu 
Person 1: ...no.

But why CAN I not “just stop”? Like, I get that it’s just a “thing” but I feel like if people didn’t say that “just stopping” is impossible and bad advice, maybe it would be easier to stop. But idk. Just ignore the body text adjskdfl I don’t even know, I’m mainly just seeking an answer to my question uwu"
1852,Anyone ever felt so low and ashamed of themselves that they completely isolate themselves from anyone?,"Personally, I would purposely work at nights. I would only go to select stores at night. I would avoid going out in my hometown ever to he seen by people I used to know. I could not stand where I was at in life and did not want to be seen by anyone. I would rarely post on social media and avoid socializing with people that way. Can anyone relate?"
1853,Killing rabbits,Is it bad that i’m kind of craving for the next rabbit to come into my yard so I can shoot it(with an air rifle)? I don’t go hunting for them it’s just they kill the grass and are pests in my neighborhood. It almost gives me a sense of power and makes me feel like i’m doing good for me and my neighbors.
1854,People who have been in inpatient/psych wards how was it?,"FIRST I WANT TO GIVE A TRIGGER WARNING BECAUSE I MENTION SEXUAL ASSAULT. So last night i told my mom finally that i’m not ok. a few weeks ago someone i was very close to overdosed and died and it brought up a lot of trauma i forgot i had (ab*se, r*pe, suicide attempts) and she wants to put me in inpatient to try and get me help. 

i’ve tried therapy and it’s just not enough. I agree that I need to do something more because I’m afraid I won’t make it very long if i dont. i’m really scared though and I just want to hear from people who have experienced it and if they actually helped or harmed you more."
1855,I am afraid of myself and my suicidal tendencies,"20m, I have been properly diagnosed with severe depression when I was 16 but now that I'm older and wiser I can see all my life was fucked up, mentally abused by family and ""friends"" all the time and I wold get attached to them because I had no one, I have always been the type of person to help everyone around me except myself and it has taken a toll on me, the past relationship I had was preaty hard on my mental side, the girl did love me for real but she relied on me soo much for her problems that it made me exhausted, I only noticed that after we both broke up, now I am alone once again and my mind is a war zone, I want to self harm again ( stipend doing it 2 years ago) and my suicidal tendencies are thro the roof, last night I wanted to end it, it's because I have been suffering for soo long because of people around me and my own failures with education, I was a splendid student when I was younger, now I can't get out of bed to do anything at all, my mind is at a complete breaking point and I'm afraid I won't last much longer, I know this maybe hasn't made much sense to you but it's soo much to talk about that I can't possibly put it all in to a reasonable text, I feel crazy.
Thank you readers"

1857,I feel suffocated by my dad's opinions on me," truly sorry if this is not the place to say a convo like this I honestly don't even know where to say this so I'm sorry again if it's not the right place.
so about two weeks ago I visited my dad after spending 7 monthes without seeing each other so we were talking about random things until I opened my laptop and played a shooting game after a few moments my dad started commenting about how it's a boys game and I shall be dressing some dolls on a girls games websites I told him games are games any gender can play any game if it's making them happy he said"" no this is a boys game, do you see boys dressing a barbie?no they can't do it just like you can't play a boys game"" I didn't answer him and I even leveled up 2 levels he then tried to be ""cool"" and started saying he is going to play better than me because he is a boy and he is used to games like this . I hate him.  I hate ho he says I should be more girly and if I show a bit more skin then I'm a slut I hate this way of thinking I hate how he says I'm fat although I'm 58.70 kilos ""129.4 ibs?"" and I was even down from 63 kilos "" 138.8 ibs? ""at that time  . I just hate my self honestly I tried for a good while  of time to be girly to be more appealing to  my father's family to my aunt to my mother but they said started saying I can't wear short clothes I can't put makeup on  and complained about my grades. I'm not even allowed to have friends from the other gender and they started telling my cousin she is a slut because she had friends from the other gender.  I hate myself for getting mental breakdowns in my school because of people treating me badly I hate that I'm expected to be looking good having a good body while having good grades and being good at cooking, cleaning  .I hate that my eyes are hurting me while writing this I hate my dad for stressing me out I hate my aunt for treating me like shit always without a specific reason and I hate that my mom doesn't even care about telling my aunt to treat me a bit better I hate that my mom doesn't even care to talk about or solve some of my problems I feel like a disappointment 

I'm sorry again if this post makes no sense I'm sorry again if it has a lot of negativity I'm not expecting a response I don't even know why I wrote this but I'm sorry if the post is annoying or my way of talking is annoying I swear I'm sorry"

1865,Dealing with trolls: my personal experience,"First, I must tell you my credentials. I have been a dedicated psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, doctor, and counselor for over 20 years. I have done it non profit

I have tens of thousands of hours dealing with all types of mental illnesses and people

Personally, when I see a troll, it is best to ignore them.

This goes along with the trolls on this subreddit, and also applies to attention seekers

When you see someone claiming bipolar, adhd, autism, schizoprenia, or depression, or anything else (comment if you need clarification) then ignore them.

Anyone claiming mental illness is seeking attention. All of them. Not a single one of them are actually serious. And if they claim suicide, just ignore. They will not harm theirself if you are worried about that. They are faking it.

Let the trolls know that you see past their act. They are under the delusion they are a good actor.

To stop self harm, ignore the person self harming. Once they stop gaining attention they will stop.

This works with dogs too. If they are barking, ignore them. It is literally in the books and all experts agree.

So when you see a human “barking” with their mental illness claims, ignore them. It will train them to be a better person.

An example of this going wrong is etika. Etika claimed mental illness and was led to suicide because people gave him attention for his trolling and self harm."
1866,I'm kinda worried about myself,This isn't really that big compared to some of the other stuff on here but I don't really have anyone I could talk to about this. Well it's like this I hate myself. I feel like my whole existence is just meeningless. I always thought I'd fall In love and do something with my life but now I realize who in there right mind is actually gonna love me who is gonna give me a job. I'm useless. I don't really deserve any of these things. How can I expect someone to put up with me when I can't even put up with me I know all there thoughts are iratinal but theres just this voice deep down telling me in worthless I don't deserve love ill never be happy. I don't really know what's wrong with me I was never really like this before but idk should I be worried?
1867,It’s a long day when you have no one,I’m tired of spending all my days sitting still in my house with absolutely nothing to do . No one to talk to . I’m alone . I don’t even get text messages ... it’s beautiful out and I have no one to do anything with . I hate my life
1868,how is everyone just okay in quarantine?,Everyone I know is doing just fine in quarantine and actually likes being home for this long. I have left my house twice since march 15th and my anxiety has gotten terrible because of it. I am just being driven crazy being home this long I hate it so much.
1869,How can I help my family understand my feelings of invisibility?,"Considering the circumstances of the world, the fact that I can't see my psychiatrist, that I can't get meds, see my friends, etc, I feel as if I am doing pretty well for myself. 

In some ways, I am grateful for this time I've been stuck at home. It's the first time since my Bipolar II diagnosis at 17 (I'm 19 now) that I've really been able to stop, step back from the chaos of school and my brand new adulthood, and take stock of what my ""normal"" is. It is during this time that I've finally allowed myself to validate some of my concerns and actually work to resolve them instead of swallowing my feelings and chocking them all up to my Bipolar irrationality. My confidence is growing each day, and I am slowly making progress to become a more confident and self-assured person.

Of course, as is to be expected on any road to betterment, there are obstacles.

My mother is truly one of my best friends. I love her very much and she is a fantastic mother. She has very good intentions, I have no doubt of that. 

But, some of her behaviors have popped up as big roadblocks on my path to amelioration. She has a few very bad habits that I have talked to her about in the past. 

When, for instance, I express my frustrations with the behavior of a sibling, she responds with ""well, my brother/sister have said things more horrible than you have ever experienced in your lifetime and we worked through things"". She's expressly forbade me from talking directly to my siblings about their negative treatment of me. 

If I express any sort of discontent with *her* behavior, she says something like, ""I know I'm the worst mother in existence"", or ""You must really hate me if you think that"". 

 And, the most painful thing of all, any time I show any outward signs of irritation or sadness when speaking my mind, she interrupts me and asks, ""Did you take your pills today?"". 

I've done my best to kindly and with as much understanding as possible explain to her how these reactions to my struggles have made me feel-- belittled, ignored, and, as much as I don't like the term, a bit crazy. I've told her that these three particular habits are really hindering our ability to have a productive conversation and that I worry that I won't be able to have the relationship with her that I know she wants to have with me because she can't seem to separate me and my valid frustrations from the fact that I have Bipolar.

I am fully aware that I have my irrational moments when I am experiencing an episode but I'm not always in an episode, I've told her; I'm a person with emotions and frustrations and wants and needs just like everyone else. 

After many conversations of this nature, I would have thought that she would've at least made an attempt to be more open, but nothing seems to have changed. None of the issues I've indicated to my mother have been fixed, and because of it, I'm growing more and more bitter at my siblings. I know it isn't fair, but I often feel as if I get more backlash for expressing my exasperation than they get for the behaviors.

I feel invisible and it's really taking a miserable toll on my mental well-being and my relationship with my family. I don't want to harbor any more resentment. I don't want to wallow in self-pity. I just want to be heard. 

I want to sit down with my entire family and have a discussion about how I am feeling and possibly start to resolve some of problems, but I don't know how I would even begin to approach the discussion. 

I don't want to shame them or lecture them or anything like that, but I do want to show them how things can look from my point of view and explain why their behaviors can impede my ability to improve myself and our relationships. 

How in the world do I go about this?"
1870,Feeling ashamed,"Whenever I'm on a night out with friends or other people I've met, I wake up the day after, completely cringed out by the things I've said or done. Sometimes it just are small things but it bothers me so much that my whole body is cringing and I feel so extremely ashamed. I don't know how to properly explain what my body does in such a moment, but I either cringe or make weird faces, or scratch myself as a way of letting these feelings out, but I'm probably just making them worse. Usually when I tell people whats on my mind they dont understand why I'm so hard on myself, but I can't let it go. I've also been to therapy for this problem and it got a little bit better and I have been taking antidepressants, but it still didnt fully go away. I can't seem to accept myself and I don't know if this part of me will ever go away. I'm not sure what I hope to get out of this post, maybe just people who understand me or people who go through the same thing. Apart from one girl I met, no one experiences this exactly as I do (ofcourse people feel shame, and a lot of other bad things too, but i feel on this particular thing very alone). 

Thanks for taking the time to read this."
1871,I can't deal with my mom's existence anymore,My mom ruined my life. She cause me and everyone I know so much pain. I don't even remember my childhood simply because my brain couldn't handle the stress. And I'm about to properly start trauma processing with a therapist but I had to talk to my previous therapist about my childhood so she could help me find the right path and even that one conversation is apperently enough to make my depression hit like a bus. And on top of it ants are in my house which isn't that bad except I have a thing about bugs and food and if one touches me my only thought is that I need to burn off my skin so that I can't feel it crawling around. And my mom's sister just texted me for the first time in years and with everything else I just broke down. I don't want to be my mom's child I don't want to have this family I can't bring myself to talk to that woman cause it all just is too much. I'm so tired of all this and I have no one to talk to. So I guess that's it. I just wanted to rant.
1872,Have I gone mad?,"I have been suffering from a lot of issues stemming back as far as I can remember voices,hallucinations,delusions ect. I've made these things worse through drugs and being kicked out of my family home and becoming homeless as a result of drugs. I see a therapist and I take seroquil daily but recently I feel like I have just gone insane. I no longer take drugs apart from the seroquil I am prescribed. I have started writing letters with my blood to myself and writing things in code that I only understand the meaning of at the time. I don't understand the cause of all this as I am off drugs and on anti psychotics any ideas or ways or help?"
1873,I got diagnosed with affective mood disorder today and I'm left confused and feeling bad about the overall session. Help me out with some questions I have,So I've had three therapy sessions and so my psychologist referred me to a psychiatrist. The session with the psychiatric was not good ig. I didn't feel validated or feel like I've been heard. The only question she asked me was what my concerns were and so I answered specifically that i had mood irregularities and so explained the situations and stuff specifically. She didn't really ask me any questions and it felt like I had to carry the whole session. She didn't explain to me about the diagnosis she gave me which was affective mood disorder or didn't even tell me of my diagnosis specifically. Like was it depression? Bipolar? What exactly? Was she not able to say for sure? All she did was give me a prescription and told me that she was gonna give me the specific medication and how to use it. I get that you don't need a diagnosis and stuff but I was never provided with any explanation as to why not or why couldn't she or what the problem was. Is this how a psychiatric consultation should be like?
1874,intrusive thoughts,"A little background before I get to my main question here..

I have roughly a 45 minute drive to work, I’m on midnights, and at my job, we don’t really do much. We do 30 minute checks, but other than that, I’m staring at a wall for eight hours, sometimes 16. Many people I work with say our job is the easiest job you never knew you could hate and anyone I’ve ever talked to has said they can’t pinpoint what exactly it is that they hate. I can’t either. I think it mainly has to do with the fact that there is ZERO positivity. Constant negativity from almost everyone.

With all that being said, almost every night on my way to work I will get intrusive thoughts. I’ll get them at work even when I’m trying to keep my mind busy. It’s not always when I’m on my way to work, it could just be when I have a long drive to somewhere also. Sometimes I’ll hop on my phone and watch tiktok or scroll through whatever social media. (yes, I know this is illegal, but I’m looking for any kind of distraction at this point.)

My question here is, have you ever experienced intrusive thoughts and if so, how do you handle them?

I also want to add that I do know my job is one main source for my anxiety and depression, but it’s also one of those jobs that once you are there, you are stuck... at least for a little while. I’m currently going to school (provided free through our union) and planning to get out of my job after 8 years. 🤞🏽"
1875,Don’t message theepicking777,Hopefully everyone knows by now but just to be sure. He’s a troll and don’t listen to anything he says.
1876,I dont feel any feelings,"So this started 2-3 weeks ago. I was with my friend at a party after graduating. It was all fun but after i got home, i didnt feel anything. I can express feelings in the moment, but i dont feel them, except one: anger. I only truly feel anger, a never ending rage to put it lightly, punish the people who deserve it. Thats it, i dont truly feel anything else and its really makes me lose my mind. The days are going on and on as the minutes suddenly turn into hours the hours into days the days into weeks. I can think rationally, but i do have a mild case of paranoi. Now as for what im excepting from this sub is nothing, if you have a kind word or anything to say i would aprichiate it. (except if youre an asshole the fuck off)"
1877,I am not sure what step to take next,"I thought I was just down because I had exams and i was under a lot of pressure. My exams are done but I am still severely sad. I thought I had seasonal affective disorder so i would be normal when that season passed. However, I am still sad, it is just a different type of sadness. I felt so relieved having figured out was wrong with me. I thought I just needed to work on coping with it. Now, I feel as though I am back at square one. Rather than having a depressed state and a normal state, i have a depressed state and a severely depressed stated.  Essentially, I feel broken. Social interaction usually lifts my spirit now a days but I have no one to talk to daily. I also find it strange that my parents are there but I don't crave interaction with them the way I do with other people. I have no idea what step to take next to improve. I have no idea what I am dealing with. I keep feeling sad and much like my mood the sky stays overcasts; grey and cold."

1879,Coming to terms with childhood emotional neglect as an adult,"Is anyone else going through this?
Is there any way to make parents aware of their damaging behaviour, or is it necessary to take care of oneself and just create emotional distance?


I’ve been living back at home recently, for multiple reasons, and recognise the same behaviours repeatedly the harmed me growing up. I worry for them getting older, isolated, and hurting each other with their behaviour - but there seems no way to help them, and the only way to help myself is to move out and create distance."
1880,Feeling less than human today...,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder half a year ago and I take medication for it and I’m feeling less than human today knowing that everyone around me doesn’t have to take medication to “exist” so here I am venting...

For all my fellow medicators (?is that a word?), anyone else feel like this? How do you cope with the fact that we have to take medication for the rest of our lives?"
1881,I’ve thought about killing myself,"It’s the beginning of the thoughts but maybe they’re right?

My family hates me.

I have no friends.

I just hate existing now. It’s just awful. I’m awful."

1883,Why do I feel as though people would be better off without me: a response," ***Because it’s a symptom. That’s all - it’s a symptom.***

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain.

When you break your leg, it really f\*cking hurts right? It’s a symptom.

When you have a concussion, acute memory loss is a symptom.

When you’re depressed, you want to kill yourself, and as if that’s not enough, you feel as though everyone would be better off for it. And guess what - **it’s a symptom**.

&amp;#x200B;

I read a blog a while ago that described depression as a very clever illness. It takes you away from everything comforting, until you feel as though you have nothing left, no happiness, and then it hugs you. You almost feel comforted in the sadness; I for one know how comforting that can seem to feel, and how it can make recovery scary, foreign.

But it’s all an illusion - it’s not real.

People will not be happier without you. They are happy with you here, I can promise you that.

&amp;#x200B;

You have a choice.

Today you can choose to live, or choose to die.

What if you regret it tomorrow? If you choose to kill yourself today, sorry, no take backs. If you choose to live and regret it, you can choose to kill yourself tomorrow; and then just use the same logic.

*Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Don’t make that mistake…please.**"
1884,Fear of unconsented photo,"About 7 years I (28F) think my ex (34M) might have taken an unconsented photo. It was during an intimate moment and I saw his phone briefly in his hand but I don't know what he was doing with it. I can't help but assume the worst. I didn't think at the time the bad things he could have been doing. I was pretty innocent, trustworthy and hadn't been in many relationships. The relationship was brief but quite toxic. 

I've no proof that he took a photo, that a photo was sent to anyone or that a photo was shared/ uploaded somewhere but I just can't stop thinking that there could be a photo of me somewhere that I didn't consent to or even know about at the time. Would I be identifiable with the years that have passed and the lower photography quality? I've searched on  Google images for my name and location etc.but I know there are so many places it could be if it's true.  I'm just very anxious about someone I know possibly coming across this one potential photo of me or it somehow getting to my work. I can't stop thinking about it. It's taking over my life at the minute. I'm constantly googling how to search for a possible photo etc. It's awful. 

I just don't know what to do and it's making me really paranoid and down in myself. 

P.s. I never sent him or anyone nudes, sexy photos etc."
1885,Considering going to therapy for the first time. Good idea?,"So for as long as I can remember I generally always feel down. I have thought of taking my own life, but I won’t. I have some pretty bad social anxiety, hate making eye contact, wont talk unless spoken to and I wish I could be more out going but I can’t. My low self esteem is constantly reminding me that I’m fat and that’s all anyone will see me as. I try to lose weight, I do good for about a week and then I binge eat and take laxatives. I’ll starve myself for a few days, and binge eat again. The only thing making me feel happy and relaxed right now, is weed.  I keep trying to convince myself nothing is wrong with me, but I need to realize that not everyone feels like this. I want to better myself, but after being called obsess in 3rd grade by a doctor I have so much anxiety when it comes to things like this. Calling and setting up an appointment for my health gives me so much anxiety. I know a lot of people have been telling me to try online care, especially now since it’s easy, but I have Tricare. I would have to call and make an appointment to then get a referral so I could go off of the military base and even thinking of doing that makes me anxious. If therapy has worked for you, please convince me because I really need something to push me to just make the appointment."
1886,I hate myself,"I hate myself. Here's why.




During my younger years, my great grandmother moved in where I live. She is the kind of person who... had certain teaching methods. During the 7 years of living with my grandma, she would berate me and my sister with remarks. She would mainly aim them at me, calling me weak, fat, a baby whenever i cried(I cried often for reasons I'll explain later), and a wimp. Whenever I made a mistake, she would say the exact same thing and I can never forget it: Do it right the first time, and you never have to do it again.

These words messed me up in the head severely, but since I had to do the tasks she gave me and keep up with my schoolwork, I was never able to address my problems until they came back to screw me sideways.

Around April of last year, she moved out of the house after and argument with my grandma about the way she treated me and my sister. I was more than happy.

And then things went wrong. 

I started to say similar remarks that she gave me to myself. I began saying that I never deserved to live and I still don't. As my happiness plummeted, so did my grades. This was around before the quarantine started. I then started considering suicide. I kept thinking to myself ""Five benadryl, five antiseptamine, And five excedrin, that's all I'll need."" 

I eventually was seen crying during math class, and sent to the school psychologist. Happy ending right? WRONG.

I was told that I would be able to get a therapist and I would receive the help I need. That was when the quarantine started. I always will try to talk others out of death, but never myself.

All I needed was help. All I needed was to be loved.

I grew up without a mom or dad, I am autistic, making my reactions to things different, I have a little brother and little sister who I am only able to see only once a year, I now have a new little sister. She won't even get to know her 13 year old big brother. All because I never got help. 


And to the 777 guy who will say that I'm making all of this up for attention, I have a story for you: 

During my P.E. class, I was talking to my friend about all that you have read, and some kid who overheard me said that I was faking it and I'm just being emo. I then began questioning myself whether he was right or wrong. I only wanted to die even more."
1887,Need some help,"I am a 23M. I don't know what's happening with me since last few weeks. I had a weird feeling twice till now. I woke up in the middle of night and my eyes were open but I could not move my body. I felt like I was dead and it felt really scary. I used to hate going to sleep at night because many negative thoughts would come to my mind but now I am scared as well. 
Any advice on how can I prevent this thing from happening again?
I used to take some allopathic medicine for anxiety but haven't taken that since last few momths.

Edit:- I don't want my family to know about this that is why visiting a doc is not an option for me. 
Thank you."
1888,I'm worried I might have depression.,"I don't want to be a self diagnosed person and want to get it properly checked. Im sad most days and it's been going on for about a year now, I usually deal with it by self harming or similar methods. I've searched the symptoms on the NHS website and I match the majority of them. However I want to be officially diagnosed because I don't want to be some sort of poser. The issue is I don't know how to bring it up to my family/friends as I'm worried about how they'll react or think I'm just sad this once as I usually act happy around them because I don't like people worrying about me. Thanks for reading this rant."
1889,Can you have a anxiety attack without a reason?,"So I think I just had a anxiety attack, but I'm not sure?
Sorry if this seems like a dumb question, I am very new to emotions and have only been learning about them for a year or so. I'm alexithimic and have been wanting to grow as a person and blend in more I guess understanding emotions will help you know? 
Anyway I had what I think was guilt and got nervous(adrenaline) but nothing happened I was just watching tv....is this something that can happen to normal people?"
1890,This isolated world,"Day after day, it feels like it'd be much better if I were dead. Nobody cares, nobody listens and people who care are so much farther than anything else.

Grad school is a place of hell. It is where you lose your health, mental wellbeing, you have zero friends, zero people who will actually ask how you are and if you're okay. I feel like the higher we climb, more lost is the basic thought of humanity. Even if I were to die, all my classmates would think that they have one less competitor now, and nothing more.

The pain of autoimmune is bad. It's just killing me day by day. Grad school started and this came into my life. I was perfectly fine before this. Restless legs at night are killing me. The twitching just doesn't stop, well into daybreak and even now in the afternoon.

Should I tell this to my already distressed, far away parents and increase their health issues? Or should I shut up and kill myself? Or just bear the pain every day and suffer like I deserve it? The choices kill me everyday."
1891,I’m addicted to danger. Is this bad?,"I’ve noticed in the past few months that for some reason doing things that are dangerous/scary. I’ve absolutely fallen in love with the feeling of driving over 100 mph in a 65(not that I do that on a regular basis or when there is any traffic), the knot in my stomach when I’m sneaking out the window with my friends, or the tense feeling when your betting money on a game of crash and watching the numbers rise. The song What’s Up Danger puts it absolutely perfectly, just wanted to hear peoples thoughts about this, or if anyone shared the same opinions. Is this healthy, or is this something that’s gonna make me end up at 45 gambling away all of my money or dying because I like to pull my parachute right below the ground skydiving. Should I work to stop enjoying the feeling?
TL:DR i love doing things that are dangerous because of the thrill I get. Is this unhealthy behavior that I should work to change?"
1892,How do we know?,"TW: suicidal reasoning? 


Ok to start I’m not in immediate danger, I’ve had passive suicidal ideation for I don’t even know how long and although I have a plan, it’s not anything that I plan on putting into play until I get a few other things sorted out.

Anytime myself or anyone starts talking about suicide, people always come out and say things like “it’s not the answer” and “it’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” The thing is how does anyone know that? Anyone who has actually committed suicide can’t say whether it was the right choice, someone who attempted will often say they wish they hadn’t, but it got them help, but others continue to deal with this until they succeed. I get that the idea of someone taking their own life is hard to understand and causes pain for people around them, but why should someone who is in so much pain stick around just to make others not have to be in pain? When I was younger (probably like high school aged) I found the idea of medical assisted suicide for people with terminal illness very interesting. I feel like we do this with the elderly or those with severe terminal illness where we just help them to be comfortable until they die naturally and same thing with our pets, so why do we suddenly feel that someone else’s pain is more important than helping ourselves to be free of the pain we’re in."
1893,Do I have PTSD? How do I stop these thoughts?,"Edit: FORGOT TO ADD TRIGGER WARNINGS (sexual assault, ab*se, dark thoughts) 

I just finished my sophomore year. My freshman year was the worst year of my life by far. I don’t wanna get too into it (if you’re curious I made a whole master post on my page in an attempt to get my feelings out) but long story short I was in an abusive relationship that really did a lot of damage to me and he did a little bit of irreversible damage to my body as well. I haven’t been in that relationship in over a year now and I’ve been seeing a guy for about 9 months who makes me feel a lot better. Sometimes certain things trigger a flashback for me from my first relationship and then a lot of other memories come flowing in that really hurt me and make me feel nauseous. This doesn’t happen often when I’m with my current s/o (but it does sometimes) but it happens frequently when I’m alone. How do I stop thinking about it? Do I need some form of closure to let everything go? Do I have PTSD from the past relationship? I’m just really confused and hurting a lot inside from all the emotional, psychological, and physical damage he caused to me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. This quarantine has been a highlight for me because I haven’t had to see him everyday at school, and I’ve been doing a lot better since I haven’t been seeing his ugly face. But sometimes he’ll like something on tumblr (I can’t block him since he has me blocked and can unblock me whenever he pleases), or he’ll make a whole new Instagram account and attempt to follow me, and it sends me spiraling. I’m stuck. I’m miserable when these thoughts happen. I don’t know what to do. 
Sometimes I have fantasies about murdering him (and his girlfriend who I have really bad problems with as well) and I start mouthing words (I only know this because someone asked me why I mouth things) and I get so into it, and once I’m pulled out of my world I have this really weird feeling in my stomach. I wish he was gone and he would stop bothering me. I wish he would leave me alone for the rest of my life. What’s wrong with me? Why am I like this? Why did this happen? Am I dangerous? I’ve never hurt anyone (besides the time I fought a kid for making fun of my autistic brother) and I’ve sure as hell never killed anyone. I tried talking to my mom about this but she thinks I’m overreacting. I’ve told my cousin a little bit of what happened and she offered to take me to therapy, but I declined because I was too afraid of my parents finding out about it. I’m so scared. I just want everything to stop and I want to erase my freshman year from existence. 

I don’t really know where this post went, and I’m sorry for wasting your time for reading this. I don’t know how sick I am in the head. I’m only a 16 year old girl and I have no idea what’s going on with me."
1894,are you feeling empty too?,"i realized a lot lately about myself, and when i promised myself to be happier i had to be reminded of why i wasnt in the first place, my parents suck espicially my father, this bitch was never there his whole fuckin life and expects me to treat him good. he can fuck himself thats for sure, his stupid ass left me with a lot of horrible issues. i feel empty, a lot and i dont know how to fill this hole inside. so i just desperatly seek external validation, because i never got it from my enviroment. i did a lot in my life but nothing seems to fill this hole, i just want that ""im proud of you"". but will i ever find this person who will fill this hole? nah i dont think so

1897,Sexual urges in a realtion with my mental stability,"Saturday 27th June 2020

I cannot think about the last time I started feeling down again, but the dark atmosphere is back.

It seems to me that the only way I can think straight is when I start writing down my thought. Most probably, because I tend to escape every moment I feel alone. As if, I am running from an unknown shadow. Only that I know this shadow very well, I can see him as much as I do when I see myself in a mirror

This dark and hupe monster has always been my deepest fear. The feeling of being left out. The strange state when I am trying to escape the simple and intuitive conclusion in my head that I am unlovable, that l can't be loved, which nobody wants to be intimate with me. However, my lungs are too tired from running out. I am too exhausted to start another round of escaping from myself. 

My sexuality, the feeling of being horny all day every day. Seeing every one of the people around me having their needs satisfied. Yet me, an average successful young man compared to the people in my age, have not had sex in a year and half now,

It is weird to talk through this with a friend, I have this big fear that will not be taken seriously, but god knows how much it did destructed my state of mind. Not mentioning my weird habit of trying to impress others, hopefully someone will have a crush on me one day, so I would satisfy the emptiness that grows bigger every day

Now, it has been 3 months since I feel this way, but it disappears since I am having a good conversation with a girl. In addition, it comes again as soon as I realize that there is no sex involved in the relation (I live in a conservative country). So I feel caught between my sexual urges, and me feeling that I am a pervert because of it."
1898,Happy fathers day dad,"I was 7 years old and my dad had to visit another town for his work. That very day, I saw a news on the TV that said a man in the town to which my dad went died. I was so scared and made my mom call him and I talked to him, to make sure he was okay. 

Here I am, 13 years later, praying for my dad to die so that he doesn't feel the pain when I inevitably kill myself in the near future. 

Happy fathers day dad."
1899,Existence is pain,I wish i could just die. Everything sucks and means nothing. I would end it all rn but the least i can do for friends and family is to not be more of a selfish piece of shit than i already am and kill myself to relieve myself. Fuck this life.

1901,I’m spacing out a lot and nothing looks real,"I’m with my family right now, and it’s the most peaceful it’s ever been right now. But, uh, something really weird is happening? It started around yesterday afternoon (2 pm probably). I’ve been spacing out a lot (but that’s okay because that’s been happening to me a lot in the past year) but also nothing looks particularly real.

Like, I’m near a lot of mountains and trees and I feel like they’re made out of plastic and paper. Almost like someone just stuck everything on a blue sky. Everything also seems a little hazy. I keep having to grab things to make sure that it’s still 3D. There was also a moment where I couldn’t feel myself blink, I kind of freaked out and for some reason had the thought that I was ‘using someone else’s eyes’.

I don’t know if this is really serious or if I’m just overreacting, but I really don’t know what’s going on or why."

1908,How can I help my family understand my feelings of invisibility?,"\*Disclaimer: I did already post this here, but I accidentally deleted the whole post instead of my comment on the post, so I am reposting\*

Considering the circumstances of the world, the fact that I can't see my psychiatrist, that I can't get meds, see my friends, etc, I feel as if I am doing pretty well for myself.

In some ways, I am grateful for this time I've been stuck at home. It's the first time since my Bipolar II diagnosis at 17 (I'm 19 now) that I've really been able to stop, step back from the chaos of school and my brand new adulthood, and take stock of what my ""normal' is. It is during this time that I've finally allowed myself to validate some of my concerns and actually work to resolve them instead of swallowing my feelings down and chocking them all up to my Bipolar irrationality. My confidence is growing each day, and I am slowly making progress to come a more confident and self-assured person

Of course, as is to be expected on any road to betterment, there are obstacles.

My mom is truly one of my best friends. I love her very much and she is a fantastic mother. She has very good intentions, I have no doubts about that.

But, some of her behaviors have popped up as big roadblocks on my path to amelioration. She has a few very bad habits that I have talked to her about in the past.

When, for instance, I express my frustrations with the behavior of a sibling, she responds with ""well, my brother/sister have said things more horrible than you have ever experienced in your lifetime and we worked through things"". However, ""working through things"" seems unlikely in this case because she's expressly forbade me from talking directly to my siblings about their negative treatment of me.

If I express any sort of discontent with *her* behavior, she says something like, ""I know I'm the worst mother in existence"", or ""You must really hate me if you think that"", or something to that effect.

And, the most painful of all, any time I show any outward sign of irritation or sadness when speaking my mind, she interrupts me and asks, ""Did you take your pills today?""

I've done my best to kindly and with as much understanding as possible explain to her how these reactions to my struggles have made me feel-- belittled, ignored, and, as much as I hate using this word in this way, a bit crazy. I've told her that these three particular habits are really hindering our ability to have a productive conversation and that I worry that I won't be able to have the relationship with her that I know she wants to have with me because she can't seem to separate me and my valid frustrations from the fact that I have Bipolar.

I am fully aware that I have my irrational moments when I am experiencing an episode (and I've told her as much) but I am not always in an episode! I am a person with emotions and frustrations and wants and needs just like everyone else. I also happen to have a mood disorder. It's a part of me, but it's not the *only* part of me.

Anyway, after many conversations of this nature, I though that she would at least make an attempt to be more open, but very little, if anything, seems to have changed. None of the issues I've indicated to my mom about the treatment of myself and of my stuff have been fixed and because of it, I'm growing increasingly bitter at my siblings. I know that it isn't fair, but I often feel as if I get more backlash for expressing my exasperation than they get for these behaviors.

I feel invisible and it's really taking a miserable toll on my mental well-being and my relationship with my family. I don't want to harbor any resentment. I don't want to wallow in self-pity. I just want to be heard. I want to solve things.

I've been thinking lately that it might be advantageous for me to sit down with my entire family and have a discussion about how I am feeling and possibly start to resolve some problems, but I don't know how I would even begin to approach the discussion.

I don't want to shame them or lecture them or anything like that, but I do want to show them how the things they can look from my point of view and explain why they are impeding my ability to improve myself and our relationships.

How in the world do I go about this?

Any advice is appreciated."
1909,what's your take on suicide jokes by other people experiencing suicidal ideation?,"i've experienced a lot of suicidal ideation, but personally i've always felt suicide jokes (under proper execution, not condoning it of course) were funny, and made me feel less alone and like someone could echo how i felt.

1911,What am I suffering with,"Here’s my story. About 2 months ago I got a groinal response from an Intrusive thought to my girlfriend cheating on me. It has been the worst 2 months constantly getting groinal response sometimes an erection in my sleep when constantly thinking about this constantly checking. I am certain that this is SO OCD. I’ve had times where I don’t get a groinal response at all and I was convinced that it was over but it came back. This Is super distressing to me because I can’t enjoy time with my girlfriend and it’s killed a lot of my appeal for sex with her. I’m at a point where it feels like these intrusive thoughts turn me on more than regular sex. I don’t know if it’s because I’m forcing myself to feel attracted to my girlfriend but i don’t get the same gratifying feeling like I once did. I feel like I’ve had erections related to jealousy in my childhood. I’m not completely convinced as to whether or not my body enjoys this because my brain definitely does not.

 I know that some people will say that this is something that I should accept and embrace as if it’s my fetish or something but it severely disgusts me and makes me feel like throwing and is definitely not something that I want to indulge in at all. 

This has been the worst 2 months of my life and it literally destroyed the happiness I had. I’ve never felt so shitty or seriously contemplated suicide this much.

I would like to know how to treat this if this is even treatable. Ideally I’d like to not get a groinal response at all from these thoughts and just feel shitty about the thought of my girlfriend with someone else. Should I visit someone who specializes in OCD or is this better combated by a sex therapist? Any other forms of therapy? If you’ve gone through a similar experience please let me know where you’re at, how you’ve overcame it, (if you have) and what you think I should do next."
1912,Are suicidal thoughts normal?,For a past few years I've had them on a weekly/monthly basis. Now they are less frequent but they still occure from time to time. But is it normal? Everyone has them sometimes I think
1913,How do you overcome a phobia?,"I've had a phobia for many years, it's the fear of having a sleep paralysis. 

It's getting worse with time and I have trouble sleeping because if I hear the words ""paralysis"" at night or it just comes to mind I start shaking, my heart beats really fast and I breathe really fast (kind of like when you're exhausted).
When that happens I have to hide under a blanket like a baby.

Has anyone reading this overcome a phobia? If so how did you do it?
Do you or anyone you know have the same phobia?
Do you have any tips for me?"
1914,Untilted,"It's about 0:44 where I live currently and I've layed down in bed at around 23 and I'm supposed to wake up at 5 in the morning for school
I cannot sleep
I literally feel sick to my fucking stomach of everything in life
From my family, my life, from constantly complaining about my life, from my past to my inevitably desperate and desolate future
In the last couple of months I cannot stop stressing about how the rest of my life is going to play out
I'm more desperate depressed anxiety filled than I've ever been
I just want this fucking pain to stop I want to live a normal life like my peers I want to be mentally stable
I want to erase my childhood and be reborn in to a normal household
I don't know how I'm going to wake up tomorrow and go to school and act like a normal person
I seriously feel like I'm going to puke right now
Im cryinf as I'm typing this
I never cry
I'm just so fucking sick of everything and I want to be gone just aimply fucking perish because I cannot see the point of living out the rest of my life like this"
1915,"Hello, mental health enthusiasts! (STILL LOOKING)","(Took a break from posting for a week since I was getting no responses.)  
**Would you like to make a difference in the mental health community by talking about something that’s passionate to you? Send me a DM to learn more!**

Hiya! My name’s CJ. I’m 21 years old. I’m a mental-health advocate and enthusiast from upstate New York. Also an aspiring writer and musician. The book is called “Skies of Grey: Mind’s Eyes”. My format is designed to be concise and easy to read and understand.

**But CJ**, *I hear you asking*, **How can I help?**  
It’s simple! I’m looking for people who are willing to have interviews about a disorder they may be experiencing. It's 10 questions long, informal, text-based, and anonymous. I am NOT accepting mental health interviews for (I’ve had multiple interviews on these subjects already and don’t need any more info on them):   
Anxiety, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Bipolar, Depression (Major/Minor), DID, Personality Disorder CLUSTER B/C (Not A), and PTSD. All entries are available here : [https://pastebin.com/WeEUdn0e](https://pastebin.com/WeEUdn0e)  
^(In light of recent events, there is now a timer on interviews. You start the interview, if time zones/other factors conflict, you have a week to finish it before I have to scrap it.) 

Anything else is on the table! I look forward to hearing from you! Please stay strong and remember to take care of yourself, it’s a scary world out there and you’re not alone."
1916,Why do i treat everyone like shit? (18F),"So basically i started treating everyone like shit for no reason at the start of quarantine, including family, it started a few years ago but i just locked myself in my room, now i lock myself in my room and whenever i go out i treat them like shit (not replying or just replying with a nod) and when i push myself to speak with them i instantly regret it (for no reason) I've also pushed one group of friends away despite being friends for the longest time, i don't like the way i am and i want to stop but whenever i go out of my room i can't because i don't wanna deal with anyone and i don't want anyone to speak to me, do you have any idea what i should do and why i do that in the first place? I do know for a fact (i know youre not supposed to self diagnose but it's more than just ""feeling sad"" for a while) that i have depression (4/5 years now) but I'd say it's gotten worse during quarantine since there's pretty much nth to distract myself with, i really don't wanna stay like this because i might lost ties with my mom, but i just can't communicate with her, my mind is blank whenever she tries to talk with me about anything regarding the matter and when she confronts i don't even wanna talk, I've been thinking about Suicide for the longest time. I'm too scared to ask for a therapist and we probably don't have enough money for it, please tell me what i should, thank you."
1917,We don’t speak about it. We never had,"In 2018 our circle of friends lost a very close friend due to mental health. 
But we don’t speak about it, we never have done

on the day that my friend died we all got together and drank for her but we haven’t spoken about it since. 
My inner circle of friends who I can speak to about anything. We don’t even speak about it &amp; when it is brought up the conversation ends quickly or proceeds into something else 

We are all 19/20 years old this is something we should all be able to talk about right?"

1919,Advice needed on how to support properly my fiancé,"Soooo my fiancé, who had always been doing fine (or so we thought) went through a panic attack. He is now dealing with the fact that he is anxious, where he always thought he was a relax kind of person. It’s hard for him, it’s a huge thing to process, and he’s still adjusting to this « new life as an anxious man ». 
I’ve been doing my best to be supportive, and to be there for him, but I’m sure I can do better, so, if you have any advice on how I can help him deal with all this, I’m listening !

Trolls are not welcome and won’t have any reaction from me. Just saying, so no one wastes any time."
1920,2 people inside me?,"Sorry if this the wrong subreddit to post to, but I've got a question.

Since the age of 14 or so, it feels like I've had two people in me. Separate entities with their own personalities, thoughts, and ideals.

The first one is Taylor. The most I can derive from him is that he's soft, vulnerable. Naive and always easily hurt.
The second one is Eric. He's tough, brash, violent, and animalistic in a way.

When Taylor is the main presence, I want nothing more than to get away from people and lie in a quiet place. I think the people around me hate me, and that Eric is my only company that genuinely enjoys my company.

When Eric is the one in charge, im quiet, angry. I see some tiny irrelevant thing and it makes me want to break the kneecaps of whoever caused it. He's tired of the little body I have and longs to be this powerful thing. He likes to just hold Taylor.

But there's also this strange malformed romance between the two. Like they fight but not really fight over who gets to run the body at certain points.

Around people, they kind of mesh and make me, and that's who people know.

Sometimes I can go days being one or the other, and sometimes days of both.

Why am I like this?
Has anyone ever heard of something like this?



No this isn't a joke post or some attention seeking bull, I genuinely want thoughts."
1921,Getting better,"So I went through a rough breakup recently, after a very mentally and physically taxing relationship. And during the few years we dated I always felt so unwanted and unappreciated. When we broke up all of those feeling magnified and I tried to kill my self. It’s been better. I’ve been focusing on hobbies I started after the breakup; mostly gardening (although I’m trying to learn how to draw) to try and just fill the time I’d spend with my ex. There’s still a long road ahead, but I’m proud that I haven’t completely fallen apart yet. Depressions something I’ve struggled with since I was 8. It’s nice that this bout hasn’t taken me fully out of commission like I’ve been before. 

I’m not trying to make it seem easy, and it isn’t easy. I still wake up every morning and dread having to go through the day. I still have trouble sleeping and have constant anxiety. I go to therapy and try my best to force a routine on myself, but the finish line is still months away. I hope maybe some of you guys can relate with me. I’m only 19 so I understand that my emotional responses are a lot stronger and more impulsive compare to older, more mature folk so I try to remind myself of that. 

Intrusive thoughts are my biggest concern at the moment. Sometimes I’ll zone out for more time than I’d like to admit, because I’ll just flash back to a memory of me ex and it’s hard to snap out of it. It always leaves me sad and drained afterwards. There’s some suicidal thoughts, but the more work I put into my hobbies the less I think about them. It helps to have something I want to finish like growing my tomatoes or following that r/chloe subreddit to learn how to draw. 

I’m sending out positive vibes to all you guys."

1923,Stumbled across some disturbing content on youtube and don't know how to get the creators help? (Eating Disorders),"I found a number of channels that are posting daily videos of what they eat in a day, in relation to their eating disorders. It appears that rather than holding themselves accountable, they are posting for approval from other sufferers (judging by the comments and certain titles that may ilicit views). If I just report to youtube, they will either ignore it or strike the channels down. I don't think this content should be on youtube, as it is an echo chamber that doesn't promote attempting to overcome the illness, only showing the 'enticing' parts of the illness, however I don't want youtube to strike them down without there being a system in place to help them. Does anyone know if there's anything I could do in this situation? I am not qualified to try to help them myself, but I also don't know to who, if there is anywhere, I can flag the channels to.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask."
1924,I really need advice for motivation,"Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing OK!

I'm suffering anxiety and very bad depression at the moment. I'm taking my antidepressants and trying in the ways I can. I have a CBT course on my phone,

The issue is having the motivation to work on myself when I feel so hopeless and worthless etc

I'm sure lots of us have this issue, but so far I'm really struggling  to find any sort of reason to try, despite wanting to get better and have a happier life.

Idk, what makes you get going?"
1925,"M20, think I'm going through an identity crisis","My reasoning for this is that I simply don't know who i am.

I habitually go through phases, mindsets, and moods. 

Sometimes, when listening to certain types of music, I change who I am and where i want to be.

Am I a goth? Am I a beatnik? Am i no one? I can't tell anymore.

This is fucking me up as I am constantly changing my mind on everything. I'm supposed to go to University in a few months, however I keep changing my mind. From teaching English in Asia -&gt; A Police Detective -&gt; Office Drone. 

I don't know if it's immaturity or what but i really need help. I can't decide on anything and i don't want to do something I might regret... and I don't have a personality. 

I have many different interests, but that changes religiously. 

I don't really have a personality or one single version of myself."

1928,Hey everyone,Hey guys I'm 14 and I have a stubborn problem and im always bored. Anyways I was wondering what I could do to protect my mental health or improve it any advice would help.
1929,Abnormal Anxiety,How extreme can anxiety be? I have always been an anxious person but I always thought a small bit of anxiety made me pay attention more so I didn’t mind as much. I started taking 5 HTP just to kind of help kick the edge off because I dont want to take meds unless I really need to. I’m not sure if it’s lockdown or moving to another country but my anxiety comes in waves. Sometimes I’m riding high and nothing seems to bother me. The next EVERY single possibly bad thing or embarrassing thing passes through my head and I feel so overwhelmed. I have never had an anxiety attack full out. The closest I have gotten was today. I was listening to a song playing video games with my husband and I got to thinking about not being young anymore which spiraled into before we blink we will be old which turned into what is death going to be like to what’s going to happen after we die. All within 3 minutes of a song to which point I got hot and heart started to race. It’s wild that these things can wreck my mind without anyone even knowing. I try explain when these things ever happen to my husband if he’s there and talk through them as best I can. I haven’t had anything like that happen in a long time but I just would love to know if this is normal and what people do to cope? I exercise and mentally stimulate my brain to help drain down. I talk my feelings through as best I can with my friends or husband. Sometimes I wonder if this anxiety is from a need of a lifestyle change completely. Different job or living situation. Something to help things equalize it seem normal.
