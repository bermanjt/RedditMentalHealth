0,I can't outsmart my illnesses,"I'm older, and I still live with my parents. I can't seem to function in society. About a month ago I was officially diagnosed with BPD, PDD, MDD, PTSD, and GAD. I used to be great at things, especially school. That was almost a decade ago. I was in honors, deans list, won awards, got a Master's... then everything fell apart. I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years (who I treated horribly tbh) and had to move home because I didn't have a job during school. Ever since I've had one menial job after another, haven't established credit or been on my own. I'm in a psych hospital about a few times each the year on average. I don't have friends and I don't know how to make them. I've tried everything from medication to self medication from exercise to ECT, and nothing seems to do anything. I can figure out how to solve other people's issues but can do nothing for myself. My health is declining and I'm scared to go out anymore. I don't have anyone to talk to, or to walk with and I just don't have the ability or the motivation to do it myself. I just feel so empty, I've nothing here and nothing to look forward to, I don't see any future for myself, at least one that's quasi enjoyable. I don't get a lot of social cues, and I don't understand what I do that bothers others so much. Everyone I've known just stopped talking to me, and if I ask they don't respond or tell me ""I should know"" but I don't know, that's why I'm asking. I feel like evil Abed but nothing's ""cool. cool. cool."""
1,My Toxic Relationship- How I’m escaping.,"I felt like I should share this in order to encourage others that yes you can leave relationships if they are toxic. I was 13/14 at the time most of these events happened so please bear in mind my viewpoints may be a bit childish.
—————-

It started when I was 13. I asked a guy out and he agreed. It was my first relationship and I was madly wooed by him especially because he was older (16).
For the first month of two it was great, he did mention that he was cool with having sex whenever I was ready (I told him at the start I wanted to save myself for marriage) and once asked when I wanted to ‘do it’ and where I wanted to. I remember being frightened because it was far from what I envisioned a relationship would be.
A couple months in we met up and he put his hands near my crotch and said “Do you want me to?” I replied, “I don’t mind.” This of course was the biggest regret I have. I was young and afraid. Would he get mad and leave me if I said no? Is what I thought. I showed no pleasure when receiving it and he knew this.
It went like that for a while and then he decided to take my virginity completely a week or two before my fourteenth birthday. I told him “No.” because I was afraid of being pregnant but he begged and said “I’ll only put in the tip.” He lied which little me didn’t understand at the time. He put it all in and we had sex. I do not remember how I felt after it. All I remember was him saying “Ha. You fell for the I’ll only put the tip in stunt.”
I know I was stupid.
This went on for months, I remember eventually wanting it after months of having unprotected sex (did I mention he refused to use w confirm?!). Looking back on it I think I got addicted to sex. 
While all of this happened he mentally abused me. He joked about my weight, my facial structure, my teeth. I started self-harming and had two suicide attempts. He also sent me to A&amp;E once because he twisted my arm too far behind my back. All his friends watched this happen but they thought it was joke taken too far on accident. I did too until he threatened to do it again. 
I wasn’t in a healthy place but eventually lockdown came along and he rarely text. I had more emails from my teachers then I had texts from him but suddenly now we can meet each other he keeps wanting to meet up...For sex. I finally realised it.
I am planning on leaving him with the help of an amazing friend whom is supporting me throughout this because I cannot come out to anyone else about this. Some of the things he did could be described as ‘rape/abuse’. I only realised it could be called that today. For over a year I thought this was normal. I just wanted to share my story to show you guys that it is possible to get yourselves out of a rut. I haven’t self-harmed or attempted since Christmas. Unfortunately I will have to continue dating him until next year for reasons. As I mentioned though I have a great friend whom is helping me through it all.
But yeah please never overthink and try to off yourself over people like this. They aren’t worth it. I hope my story may enlighten someone that it is possible to leave situations like this."
2,Is it normal to be unable to keep romantic feelings?,"I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask this, I just didn't know where else to go, and feel like if I asked this in a Relationships subreddit I'd just be told ""you just haven't found your soulmate yet"".

I'm unable to keep romantic feelings for other people. I don't instantly fall in love or jump into relationships, but no matter how strong my feelings are for someone or how long we've been together or how much they're everything I want in a partner, my feelings always disappear practically over night, completely unprovoked &amp; without warning. Does anyone else experience this? Is this normal? I WISH I could keep feelings for someone, I've tried so many times and dated so many amazing people, but it happens every time. 

I'm not sure if this matters or is related, but I have chronic depression &amp; have been on antidepressants since I was 12 years old (I'm 21 now). I also suffer from intrusive thoughts and OCD, but it's never affected my romantic relationships. I'm very proactive in taking care of my mental health ♡

I'm fully aware that ""I have my whole life to find the right person"", but what if I'm just incapable of sustaining feelings for someone, even if they are my ""soulmate"" or whatever?"
3,Am I just shy? I feel stupid at this point,[removed]
4,I tried choking myself and I don’t know what to do now,"Whenever I break down and have an anxiety attack or nervous breakdown, I always curl up in a ball, find a small place for me to squeeze in and repeatedly bang my head against the wall.

Today I did it with intention to knock myself out and I had my hands covering my face because I was crying but they moved to my neck and I tried suffocating myself.

I don’t know what to do now. I wanted to just knock myself out so I didn’t have to deal with anything, but I don’t know where to go from here in fear I’ll do it again.

And I want to but I know I shouldn’t"
5,"Im breaking down, is it Ok to contact an old therapist?","Hi everyone. I will try and keep this brief. 

Diagnoses: 
GAD, PD, OCD, Agoraphobia, Depression 

Situation: 

I started a new job several months ago. My first job in my field of study. I had one previously in 2018 but my Agoraphobia got bad right before my start date and I did not last long. Now I got a new job on the other side of town (big city so I had to move for it) and I had to switch therapists. Current therapist is pretty good, but not always available to call when im in crisis. The other therapist is not only more available, but pretty much saved my life. Without this therapist, its halfway likely I would have tried to take my own life. The therapist has excessive knowledge of my situation and was really successful in helping to calm me down. The issue is I can’t see the provider anymore because insurance issues. New therapist has been a great stand-in, but simply does not know me well enough after a couple months to be able to make the same impact as previous therapist who saw me for 2 years. 

Would it be wrong to try and make contact with the old therapist, knowing how busy they can get? The only reason Im asking is I feel if something doesn’t change, I may lose my job again. I can’t take my job, my living situation, my daily anxiety and severe depression. I wouldn’t even dream of asking if I wasn’t so low right now."
6,Intimacy and Traumatic Memories,[removed]
7,"I have family, I have love...","I have money, I have a home (albeit 27 living with my parents), I have my pets,  my car, but I don't have peace."
8,Does anyone else see someone you know doing something that you've been doing for a while better than you and feel terrible about yourself?," 

for me this has happened 5 notable times, twice with video games, once with drawing, once with stop motion animation and once with video editing. Every time it happens i just feel useless, like i thought i found something i was good at and did it at the same level i was comfortable with for a while then someone else or my school picks it up and it turns out everyone else is better at it than me without even trying and i always feel terrible about it and either grow to dislike the activity or the people in question. Is this normal?"
9,Ways to get back into reading emotional books?,"I have been on medication for depression and anxiety for years now, so my emotions are relatively stable. However, there are some books that have triggered me into depression sloughs that were very hard to overcome. I tried rereading All the Bright Places the other week, and I couldn't get past the first chapter, because to put it bluntly, it reminded me of the days I too thought about the top of the bell tower. When I read this book, it was easily one of my favorites of all time, and still is! But like so many other books lately, I can't seem to let myself **feel**. And feeling used to be one of the main reasons why I read. 

Triggering, emotional, dramatic, dark books are what drives me. My writing is also all of the above. I really miss sobfests after finishing a book, or having to put down the book because I can't see through my tears and the pages are getting all wet and nasty.

I'm not asking how to not be triggered, I know you aren't a psychiatrist. I'm asking how you let the book reach you ***personally,*** how to let it go there without going too deep. I want to be able to empathize with the characters again. It's one of the most important and favorite aspects of storytelling in my mind.

They say writers write best when depressed, and that's why so many of us don't seek treatment. I'm trying to hard to refute that, but it's not working. This whole issue is affecting reading and writing, two things I live and breathe."
10,I don't know what's wrong with me,"I feel like i'm not good enough. I can't think differently and I always assume for the worst and it kills me every minute of every day. I have a fear that suddenly everyone I love is going to leave me and that everyone hates me and that i'm always getting ignored and it eats me alive. No matter how much people tell me it isn't true and how much they care, I feel like they're lying to me to make me feel better. I get so upset and stressed about it i feel like my only escape is through self harm and I can't stop no matter how hard I try. That makes me hate my body and feel ugly, but it also makes me hate myself. That's basically it in a nutshell."
11,What could this mean?,"I had some weird experiences last year. I got very into god and would think I could feel him around me. I still feel that way sometimes. I started to talk to him and believe in him fully. I even went to church once and spoke in tongues. I didnt know it would happen. Everybody was just asked to come up and pray. I started to. Then I started speaking in tongues. It was an amazing experience. However I felt a bit weird afterwards. I felt a bit sad.

I also took a bible from a hotel room. I felt so euphoric in that hotel room. I kept it to myself. 

Now it's just over a year since that stuff happened. My thoughts about god are different now. I dont think about him as much. I think my meds make me not think about that stuff as much. I tried to buy Acid from a stranger earlier in the year. My parents got me help after that. They dont know about how euphoric I have been."
12,"I feel like I can’t feel anymore, so I tried to cause an anxiety attack. Is that okay?","Recently, I have been feeling like I don’t have any emotions. They are there but I don’t know what they are. I can’t identify them, even if they are so simple to identify. I feel empty. This happens only occasionally and not very often but it happens, and it’s happening right now.
I feel like I HAVE to feel something, and the only thing I was feeling was slightly ill from anxiety so I wanted to try and amplify that feeling just to feel SOMETHING. I sat and listened to a lot of anxiety inducing sounds and things in the dark, eyes closed, and everything, even full blast volume.
And I still felt nothing.
I looked in the comments and multiple people stated that they anxiety and that it freaked them out but it did nothing for me. I just sat there and listened and my head was empty. I didn’t feel anything. My hands didn’t shake, I didn’t tremble, I didn’t cry, nothing. 
I started to hate myself for not feeling anything. THOSE people did so why can’t YOU? They experience anxiety attacks where they shake and tremble and cry and panic! But that can’t happen to you for some reason huh? Why can’t you do that? Why can’t you be like them and be normal? Why can’t you be a normal person?
There is nothing diagnosed with me that I know (my family can’t afford it either and my mom doesn’t really want me to try Anyways) 
!!TW!! // I even tried to cut myself with a dull pair of scissors in a singular spot on my left wrist so I could hide it and it didn’t even bleed. It just made the skin irritated. I also scratched my shoulders and held my head tightly for a few seconds but that didn’t do anything either.
Anyways -so Is this normal? Is this okay? 
Tl;dr - I felt numb so I tried to cause an anxiety attack to feel something and it didn’t work. Is that normal and okay?"
13,Do I have Depression?,"I feel like I have depression, and I’ve been doing research on it, but I feel like i might just be overreacting, or “doing it for attention”. So I don’t know.

Like for example some days I wake up and i feel okay or even happy, but it tends to go down in the day, when other days I’ll wake up and I’ll just feel awful all day. It really depends.

I have a lot of symptoms of depression but I’ve always had doubts in my mind that I’m making it all up. 

Like some days I feel better and I can smile and laugh at things. But it never lasts longer than a day.


If anyone could help me figure this out I would appreciate it."
14,This world is tearing me apart,"I don't get it. They just refuse to play nice with each other. The media pedals outrage and lies to divide us but won't report good news or an actual famine in Yemen. I'm in my early twenties, graduated in December, living through a pandemic that isn't even that bad if you just take basic hygiene into account. Nobody is forcing you to wear a mask but you don't force business's to let you in if they have a mask policy. This whole thing called life is one giant test of patience and I feel like God is testing my limits for what I have no idea. I don't know why everyone is suddenly up in arms over the most basic shit and I keep seeing my news feeds fill up with stupid shit, vile shit, or ridiculous shit. When did common sense become so uncommon and how is a fucking video game about the zombie apocalypse the most controversial thing during an election year?! Why did I struggle through high school and college just to watch the clowns take over? Fuck this bullshit and fuck this year"
15,I've only showered three times in the past eight months. I wonder if I should go to a hospital.,"Definitely using my throwaway account for this. It's embarrassing and disgusting. 


I am in an unmanaged episode of double depression. It's been hell, and I haven't been taking care of myself for quite some time. On a really good day, I can use baby wipes to sort of clean myself. But I haven't had one of those days in a long time. My skin is flaky and has sores because it's been so neglected. I feel filthy but can't really do anything about it. I'm either too tired, too apathetic, or just plain scared to properly clean myself. I struggle with a lot of other things too. It's very difficult to brush my teeth, floss, brush my hair... I just don't care enough about myself. 


Quarantine isn't the issue here. I've been fortunate enough to still have a job during all of this. I almost lost my job due to excessive call-ins, but my boss was kind enough to work with me and encouraged me to get FMLA. I still go to work like this, when I can manage to get out of bed, and I'm surprised I haven't been written up for looking so unkempt and disheveled.


I really wonder if I should go to the hospital. It's been five weeks since I've even tried to shower or use baby wipes. I think I only take care of my teeth one or two times a week. I haven't done laundry in at least a month and just rewear the same dirty clothes over and over. I can't be bothered to go through all of the effort it takes to wash my clothes. 


There are other reasons I'm thinking about going to the hospital, such as self harm and chronic suicidal thoughts. But this post is more about my self-neglect. I'm waiting to see a new psychiatrist to get my medications adjusted, and I haven't been to therapy in a while because I don't want to try and talk to someone again. Honestly, any effort I make to manage this damn depression feels futile.


I just wanted to admit my horrible hygiene issues somewhere. This seems like a safe place."
16,Should I see a doctor or am I just psyching myself out?,"I feel like I might have a dissociation disorder, but I might just be overreacting and psyching myself out over relatively normal stuff. I've struggled with mental health before so I wouldn't be too surprised if something's wrong. 

It's hard to explain what I feel in words, but I'll try my best. I'm just constantly super disconnected from reality and from the idea of ""me"" and my existence. It's such an ingrained mode of thinking that it feels like the norm at this point. I don't even notice when I'm doing it, I only notice when I'm not doing it. By ""it"" I mean believing that nothing is real. Occasionally I slip back into reality and realize that I am in fact not dreaming, and I exist, and that water bottle in front of me exists, and the people around me are real people, etc... and it absolutely blows my mind and I freak out a bit.  I get a tad nervous and my chest gets tight, but it feels like I should always be living like that. It feels like I'm actually alive when I slip back into reality for a moment. 

Also, I usually have a lot of trouble remembering my past. If you were to ask me where I went to elementary school, I could tell you the name of the school, but I don't actually REMEMBER going there, I can't really picture the halls, or the classrooms, or my teachers face. Even middle and high school is pretty foggy (I'm a freshmen in college now). Alot of the memories I can always access are really weird because I remember them in third person. I'm not experiencing the memory through my own eyes, rather it's like I'm standing 5 feet away watching stuff happen to younger me. And overall I just feel really detached from my past self. Very occasionally I'll feel like the old me again, and I'll remember things about myself that I can't believe I forgot. It's a HUGE difference feeling like the old me and feeling like what I usually feel like nowadays. When I feel like the old me, I get real lonely (like I was as a really young kid) but I also regain a lot the feelings and sentiments that make me recognize that I am who I am. Usually, I have no sense of identity, but on the few occasions that I feel connected to my past self, I feel connected to myself and my identity as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

I can go into a lot of other weird things I've noticed about myself that kinda concern me, but I don't want to make this post super long. I want to emphasize that I do not mean any of the things I've said in a symbolic or philosophical sense; I mean them very literally. Can anyone relate? Should I see a doctor? What's going on with me?"
17,Am I depressed?,"Ever since quarantine had started my sleep scheduled has been eternally ticked off, I sleep up to around 12 hours and even before quarantine I’ve lost all sense of excitement. I don’t get excited or happy at anything anymore and I always feel tired, I’m a very active person and used to sprint and lift very often to push myself (been active for 2 years now). These days I find myself sleeping even when I’m not tired, and sometimes (every 2-3) during quarantine i straight up don’t even lift or exercise, and to me that’s a big deal as it’s probably my only attribute to my personality. I don’t want to be one of THOSE people who complains they’re depressed and hate life, but I want to at least know. Now, as for not feeling any joy or happiness anymore, I had partook into football around last year (sophomore year) and I felt miserable every day due to the mental toughness of practice, but I came out a changed person and became so much more happier and valued my free time with family, though this year (junior year) I skipped out on the season and felt incredible regret over it, though I am over it. That’s when I just straight up lost all joy and excitement, don’t get me wrong I still look forward to stuff I enjoy, but I don’t feel happy about it or excited, just “oh that’s coming up, that’s cool”."
18,I'm going to kill myself,[removed]
19,Should pursue my ex who helped me through mental illness?,"Back in March I was admitted to a mental hospital and diagnosed with bipolar depression. For all of the 14 days I was there, my friend with benefits Catt visited me. It was during one of these visits that she became my girlfriend. After I was released I could only see Catt twice before Covid shut everything down. For the first month we had a nice routine of face timing once a night. Then I decided to sneak out and see her. She got into my car and it was pretty awkward but I felt that it was because our relationship had been primarily over FaceTime. I got caught sneaking out by parents and was confined to my room for a week. I faceted Catt nearly the whole time and  it seems to strain us. Catt then told me that I didn't listen to her well enough and if I didn't start to, she'd break up with me. I tried so hard but couldn't change, even though I thought I did. She told me we should go on a break. Then during the break I texted her a lot and she broke up with me because I didn't give her space.

&amp;#x200B;

 She said the spark went away and I somewhat agreed but I still believe it was because we weren't in person. She said she needed space a month ago and we haven't talked since. What do I do? Should I try and get her back? I think that now that I have my bipolar under control that I can listen better."
20,Why do I feel like I don’t deserve kindness,"I just got an operation recently leaving me unable to walk for about a month. Everyone has been super kind to me and helping me out and although I appreciate it I can’t help but feel guilty about people going out of their way to make me feel better. I’m the type of person who doesn’t like asking for help if I don’t desperately need it so having to ask for basic things like helping me up the stairs, getting me safely inside my shower/ bathroom, and having people bring me food makes me feel horrible. Not to mention all the gifts I’ve been receiving. Everyone has been giving me get well soon gifts, cards, flowers– you know the usual. And I feel like I don’t deserve any of it. Like I said I obviously appreciate it very much and I’m unbelievably grateful for all the people in my life that love me but every time they do something kind for me I feel that overpowering sense of guilt. I just wanted to know if anyone might know why I feel this way that way I can start trying to fix myself."
21,I’ve been described Hydroxyzine and I’m just wondering what everyone’s thoughts are of it,I’m so nervous about taking it. I’m scared I’ll get like addicted or that I’ll become really dependent on them. I never pictured myself becoming the person I am today and I’m so ashamed it’s had to come to me taking pills to get over my anxiety and sleeping disorder
22,Feeling Hopeless,"I'm so sick of doctors. I'm having bad fatigue and weakness. I can't even drive, lift a bottle, talk, nor get into the fucking hospital bed in front of the nurse. But no it's not an emergency it's PROBABLY depression. Same thing my primary said yesterday. I never go to the doctor or hospital unless I can't handle life. I can't function. I'm so tired. Sleep doesn't help no matter how much or little I get. What's wrong with me? Why does everyone who is supposed to help just say to hang in there!?! I can't even do my job. I can't do this 😭"
23,I just need someone to reassure me.,"I keep experiencing anxiety over this, but I need someone to tell me that no one will know about my trauma unless I choose to open up about it. I'm not of age yet and I know if my parents found out what happened, they'd definitely shame me and put the blame on me. I've told my closest friend and I felt better after, but I keep overthinking about other people finding out somehow."
24,I want to delete my Facebook,"Im tired of wasting so much time browsing social media and Facebook is the biggest time waster for me. I'm tired of people looking me up if they wanted to and see my photos, work place, birthday and ect. I'm tired of seeing all of the pandemic and just hateful anti BLM stuff. (Black Lives Matter 🖤) I even feel like my moods and wants are controlled by Facebook. For example, I see lots of cooking videos, I want to cook. I see house plant stuff, I got a house plant! And it goes on..
But I have family that I live across the country from that I'm able to stay in contact with and that's the downside? What can I do? Is there a different way to stay in contact with everyone? I'm also afraid everyone is going to ask why I did it. I just wish it didn't exist tbh. Is there maybe a step down approach to use less Facebook? Please and thank you 😊"
25,I am dying...,"I can't take this pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't hold on any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want this to end...

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have the guts to do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Cutting deep into my skin.

&amp;#x200B;

Deeper than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

The blood finally flows.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel my soul leaving this world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am finally free."
26,Ive been hallucinating recently help,"A little while ago I started hallucinating, I dont have a history of any mental health issues though I have had many concussions and I have had two heat strokes but the hallucinations and thoses things don't seem to coincide. Ive only hallucinated animals (I live in the deep country and I am surrounded by woods) the animals have only ever been very big black versions of predatory animals such as a black bear ( twice, once at the end of my driveway and the other in the woods behind my house), a big black dog (in a parking lot with my family [thus how I knew it wasnt real]), a big black bird (about the size of a condor [near my chicken pen in my backyard]), a raccoon (this one was auditory as well, I head my trash can shaking and it was night time but I knew it wasnt real cause my dogs werent freaking out) and a bunch of other ones that I cant seem to remember. I consulted my dad about my recent hallucinations but he said I wasnt getting enough sleep (which isnt the issue since I sleep about 10-12 hours a day) I dont know why this is happening and would love some advice or help on my situation."
27,I'm scared and I'm confused," Right I'm not the biggest believer in the paranormal or shit like that but idk man I'm kinda fucking going a bit Coo-coo because I feel like I've found what haunts me. I think haunt is the wrong word maybe just watches me and its known as the hat man. This is going to sound crazy but honestly I've seen it. I don't know if I ever told the story on here but basically I was in hospital and one night as I was falling asleep or it might of been waking up. Anyway one of the two. My bed was in the corner of the room, I looked behind me in the corner and there it was, it was the darkest I've ever seen something and it was huge it took up the room from head to toe, it had red eyes glaring to me and it just watched me. That figure I cant get out of my head, I constantly draw it all the time especially when I have my episodes. When I saw it a huge amount like absolutely huge amount of dread and paranoia and like it froze me all I could do was look into its eyes and I just couldn't move all I could do was cry and I mean tears were coming but I never moved or made a noise, it took hours for the nurses to calm me down and I refused to sleep in that bed.   


Every time I think about the hatman or talk about it. I cry, usually not a lot but I still cry and like a underlying fear and dread and so much negative emotions drown my body. My hair raises and get goosebumps. I was watching this video and it was about these things called shadow people, and I've never heard of them so I always assumed what I saw was just me being mentally ill but the hatman is a shadow person and alot of people see shadow people but the hatman is unique because he's the worst, he can cause harm, he can kill and he can talk to you. Maybe that's what I hear when I have my episodes and write those cryptic messages, maybe I'm being targeted by the hatman. I know this sounds really weird and I don't totally believe It myself but it's makes so much sense I saw it with my own eyes, that's what convinces me.  


 I didn't know what it was until tonight where I just stumbled apon the video by chance I probably would never of found out until now. The only thing that doesn't relate to the hatman is I don't remember seeing a hat because that's what usually you see, He's the only one depicted with eyes. And they are bright red which I saw. I've drawn what I saw with red eyes when I have my episodes. I just never drawn him with a hat nor do I remember seeing one, maybe he did have a hat and I just don't remember seeing it but I remember the eyes and the figure those eyes are burnt into my mind. I genuinely think I've found what's hurting me. Maybe that's what causing me to be unwell, maybe it's not actually mental health that's causes this to me. Maybe it's the hatman because he can cause harm to people he's the only shadow person who can interact with our world."
28,Feeling OK after 15 minutes of pure misery and crying,"Since I was in high school, I would often feel sad and cry for no reason at all.  During really bad moments (especially when something shitty happens), I would feel like I'm a waste of space and I don't deserve to be in everyone's life. I'm not suicidal but I just feel pure misery. I would just cry and sometimes make myself throw up and after 15 minutes of that, I would feel like everything is fine. 

I would constantly feel inadequate and insecure but I'm very good at hiding it because I don't tell anyone anything. My best friends and boyfriend does not know how much I hate myself. I truly believe my mental health is not their problems. I'm on medication, therapy, doing cbt workbooks, exercising and eating healthy but I'm still feeling this way. It's like I'm always on the edge of depression and when I'm actually breaking down, I quickly pick myself up. It's not bad compared to major depressive disorder because I can function but I'm always ALWAYS sad. I don't know what I can do and I feel like I really don't want to continue living like this."
29,I feel like a complete failure.,"Hi everyone. You know how they say that everyone's got their own pace so there is absolutely no reason for you to compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20? Well, I've been feeling so down lately and I keep thinking that I'm falling behind my peers. I'm 25, working in the food industry as part of the company's food safety team. I actually like my job but I keep feeling like it isn't enough. All my friends and peers from high school and college are very accomplished people and I always feel like I am the only one without any accomplishments in life. And the worst part is that I can't help but compare myself. I feel so scared of the future and what it would be like for me who has not done anything admirable. I want to push myself to do more but with this pandemic, I can't do anything! I honestly don't know what I want and I don't see a future for me. I am scared. I am so scared."
30,How do I leave my house?,"I’ve barely left my house this past month or so of quarantine, because I’ve been laid off from work. It’s gotten really nice outside, which is great considering it’s usually raining where I live. Basking in the sun would be great for my mental health, but I can’t find it in me to go outside because I don’t want to be seen in public. Has anyone had a similar issue?"

32,A mental health resource I've been working on,"I've been browsing this sub for a while now and it seems to be very common for posts to be either ignored completely or not see a lot of attention. I know how important it is to have someone respond when you feel like you need help. 

I'm in the process of making an app that matches up users to have a conversation. It works like this 

\- one user writes out a question, something like - I have no motivation, what drives you?

\- another user gets notified of the question and the two enter a chat room to talk about it

The cool thing about it is that once you've got input from that first user, you can swipe left to reset the conversation and another user gets notified with the same question. Essentially have a 1 on 1 conversation with a variety of people on the same topic. I think 1 on 1 conversations are a lot more useful than reading through a reddit post.

I got the idea from this scene in avatar the last airbender:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quod9FxpazU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Quod9FxpazU) 

In the scene aang seeks wisdom from four different avatars on the same subject

Since a large point of the app is to serve the needs of this subreddit and people in general who need someone to talk to, I wanted to know if anyone has anything they think would be useful to have in an app like this."
33,Is the something wrong with me?,"I want to know if there’s something majorly wrong with me. I’m not really a social person. It’s more of an - I speak when spoken to - type of person. And I’m really awkward when that happens. I’m not the one that engages or kickstarts a conversation. Which is me basically saying I am antisocial. I stay in my room all the time when I’m at home. I rarely go outside. When I’m in my room I watch TV and scroll through Instagram all day. Have troubles with my self-esteem a lot of days. My mom asked If I was depressed several times and I told no. Because I don’t feel depressed. It’s not that I feel sad or anything. I’m just a nonchalant person. I don’t really care for things when they happen. It’s like I’m emotionally detached. When my mom confronted me about my sexuality, I told her straight up that I was gay. She started to cry and I just sat there and basically rolled my eyes. I wasn’t happy/sad/relieved when she expressed her feelings about it. I don’t get bothered by anything. If something happens, I just shrug it off and continue doing what I was doing and just wait to see what happens next down the road. I also have a hard time saying no to things, and I believe it’s because of my mother. She would ask to “borrow” a huge sum of money (which she then used to buy weed) and I would say yes, even though I know she has the money.  And I mean yeah, sometimes I do angry but I don’t really express it, I just wait for it to pass, I guess. Recently I found out this thing where I have my crushes here and there but I can’t see myself being relationship. I just feel like I am a boring and lazy person to be around. I just feel like I wouldn’t be good in a relationship that depended on feelings. And if I’m being totally honest I don’t see a future for myself. Some people can envision themselves in the next 5 or 10 years, but not me. It’s like I’m not supposed to make it pass my teen years. I work at a restaurant that’s sports-y and Texan themed (TXRH) and one day my coworkers were talking about sports and I was nearby minding my own business and I was asked a question about the things like to do. They asked me if I liked sports, I said no. I told them that I just work, sleep, eat and that I sometimes play video games (but my interest in doing that disappeared as time progressed). Then another coworker chimed in and asked me if I was ok, because she said her brother does the same thing and that he’s majorly depressed and still works at Starbucks at 26 years old. (Which doesn’t sound that bad to me...yay coffee). 

I just all around feel like I’m a broken person. 

Sometimes I just wish you could just take my brain and just examine it and find out what’s going on with me."
34,I really need help please,[removed]
35,i took my first steps to getting better.,"the last few months has been extremely rough for me. i fell really hard for someone that i truly, genuinely cared about. i was emotionally manipulated by them. i had to end a new relationship because i couldn't 100% commit to it due to of all the issues going on with me.

a lot of my past has recently been brought up, and i've been very emotional about it. self-isolation isn't helping and i feel like i've been hanging on by a thread. i'm finally back in therapy and i couldn't be happier about that. out of all the anxiety and depression i've been facing over many years, i'm glad i can be with my feelings in a healthy and safe environment. 

i'm hoping i'll be able to get back on my feet soon. it'll take time but i'll make it there. thank you for letting me share. &lt;3"
36,How to deal with constant bad news around me?,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple years ago and went to therapy and took medication to deal with it. I eventually stopped taking the medication and going to therapy because ive been in a good place for the past 1.5 yrs. However, since the beginning of the year, all the constant negative news around the world has taken a seriously negative toll on my mental health. For example, my family is from hk where all the protest is happening and it hurts so much seeing how little i can help/how little other countries have done.  Im so anxious about school and sadden by whats happening around me that it takes me 3-5 hrs to sleep. This results in me sleeping at around 6-7 am everyday and waking up at like 4 pm. With the covid19 situation, im not physically with my SO anymore, who was the person who supported me to the point where i could stop therapy and medication. And now that we are appart, its making it much harder to cope with everything around me. A part of me wants to stop looking at the news but a part of me tells me thats selfish for having the privilege of be able to ignore the atrocities around me (blm movement, whats happening in yemen, china-india border dispute, etc.). What should I do in this situation?"
37,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!,"I don't know what the FUCK is happening right now. My fucking head is numb and screaming at the same time, I can't fucking TAKE IT ANYMORE.

I feel so sick, I'm nauseated, I know my body needs sleep, but no, no sleep, I'm not allowed PLEASE FUCKING HELP ME

I'm laughing and crying and I want to fucking scream but I think I'd throw up if I did.

I'm taking calls for work on sheer autopilot, words are coming out of my mouth, its like I'm not saying them, they just pour out.

It's like I have no energy at all and yet endless

I feel good for a second, then bad, then really bad, then fucking great I'M LOSING IT!

No more, no more i just want to feel normal, why did I  do this a fuckingain I should have just gotten some sleep.

My fucking life is a joke, I just take in pills and power and rocks and any fucking substance i can get anywhere near because im a FUCKING JOKE 

Anything I can do to take away the searing fucking pain, its not fair, its not fucking fair. WHY'D THEY HAVE TO FUCKING DO IT TO ME?!?

My brain is on fire, I hate myself, i hate everything, this is all my fault.

I'm just typing the first shit that enters my head like a fucking idiot.

I need someone to talk to, my mind is breaking, I'm trying to hold myself together, I don't want to bother my friends. 

I'm sorry for all these ramblings, my head is rattling off, I took too much shit, I just, I need help. 

Please..."
38,"I achieved a small task, then turned it into achieving a big task","I am moving on the 4th and I have had nearly 0 motivation to get my things packed. I’ve been struggling with reallllly low, frustrated, hopeless moods and feelings, and experiencing anxiety about moving and being away from my fp lately. it’s been hard to leave my bedroom, let alone pack anything. I’m not sure what sparked the motivation but I started and it’s all done, except things I need to pack that morning. I was using opposite action / the 5 minute rule where you do the daunting task for 5 minutes even if you absolutely do not want to and I ended up doing everything that needed to be done within an hour and a half or so. I feel relived and proud of myself even though it’s really not that much :’) I don’t have many other people to tell and just wanted to share"
39,I (19F) keep finding ways to escape and not deal with my issues.,"I need some support and help in regards to my mental health, I think I have been developing issues for a long time now but one of my main issues is also that I keep believing the worst of me so half of me doesn't believe that there's anything wrong with me and that I'm only making excuses while the other half is in pain and is helpless. I am getting medications (which I started only two months ago) which have been helpful so far but therapy hasn't really been very helpful for me yet. I don't really know what to do, I don't know if there is something actually wrong with me or am I just... Idk making excuses and finding justifications? There is soo much going on in my mind rn I don't know how to deal with it all and how to deal and accept my reality because I keep trying ways to escape (through funny internet content)."
40,am i putting this on myself?,"i have tried really hard to not allow my abusive ex a living space in my head. i have worked really hard at articulating how much his emotional abuse has taken a toll on my mental well-being, but i feel as if i’m continuing to allow myself to be hurt. i feel like i can’t explain how greatly his actions have deeply hurt me, and sometimes i feel as if people are getting fed up with me still being upset about it. 

he gaslit me for years, and i still believe that i was the abusive, manipulative and controlling partner. i also feel this toll is hurting my current partner. i don’t bring it up to him often, but sometimes i break down and i can never tell if it’s hurting him. sometimes i just want someone to listen and just let me have my moment to cry and collect myself. i don’t want to be viewed as if i’m wanting to relive this awful past because why would i? 

am i hurting myself or am i trying to cope with the trauma? 


this is just a wall of emotions, thank you for taking the time to read. i just feel no one wants to listen anymore."
41,I'm in a dark place &amp; I don't want to go to sleep with societal &amp; personal negativity on my mind,"Hi, friends. I'm not going to delve too in detail about all my problems because it isn't really the point, but just for some understand; I haven't seen a mental health professional, the reasons aren't important, just know that's a factor that frustrates me when I'm in a bad place. I go through periods of time where I'm fine, I'm motivated, I feel good &amp; optimistic, and then even longer periods where I'm feeling really lonely, gross, depressed, hopeless, and exhausted.  There's never an in between, it's either all good, or all bad. And right now I'm feeling the bad kicking in. 

I always try to distract myself &amp; I attempt to not let myself feel this way, but to no avail. Trying to not feel depressed just makes me feel empty and angry. When I'm in this state it makes all my trauma &amp; problems come to the forefront of my mind. In my good periods of time I push it all to the back &amp; focus on positive ways of thinking &amp; living, but then the bad periods of time make it all resurface &amp; completely consumes me. So that's kinda where I'm headed. 

Now that you know what's up, here's the other thing; 2020 is a dumpster fire of a year. Everything on social media is just chaos &amp; it's so depressing &amp; consuming. Plus, quarantine has affected everyone. Everyone is lonely, everyone's negative feelings are heightened, and I know I'm not alone in this. Regardless of where I'm at mentally &amp; emotionally, I try to be nothing but helpful, kind, &amp; positive for others. 

I'm always there for people, and my friends are constantly asking me for advice or ranting about their problems, or wanting to hangout to feel better. I *love* being that person. It makes my heart warm to know I can help. But it also makes it difficult for me to want to reach out. I know my loved ones would be nothing but supportive &amp; loving, but I just can't bring myself to burden them. I don't want to add their concerns, stress, and I definitely don't want to cause them to feel sad or like, guilty. I don't feel right talking to them about me when they're all struggling with more important things,  and so here I am.

I just need some support. Kind words, positivity, good news from you or the world, advice, anything really. I just want to curl up with my cat and finally see some good shit away from the anger &amp; sadness of society right now. It's about 10:30 pm so it'd be nice to fall asleep with some positivity in my thoughts. 

Thank you guys for reading, I hope you have a wonderful night/day/life. (:"
42,i’m so scared to be put under anesthesia,"i’m having a minor dental surgery tomorrow morning to get all of my wisdom teeth out. i have so much anxiety about being put under anesthesia and also the needle. i get uncomfortable around needles, im fine with shots bc the needle is small and only there for like 5 seconds, but i haven’t gotten my blood drawn in a whiiiiiiile and those types of things make me squeamish and anxious.

i’m also not loving the fact that i won’t have control over my body and that i’ll be in a room of people without control of my body. my sister got her wisdom teeth out at the same place last week and the surgeon guy is really reputable, it’s just me who is the problem lol.

has anyone ever been put under general anasthesia, and how did u cope with/prepare for it? how did you get over a fear of needles?"

44,I really just need to vent and make sure that what I’m feeling isn’t a sign of something bigger.,"I don’t see a therapist and I don’t want to burden my friends with my venting so hello reddit. 

So I’m sure I’m depressed, anxious, paranoid, and I’m like 94% sure I’m dyslexic. I’m okay with that stuff tho. Like, I know those are things people have and it’s normal. 

What bothers me is something else. I have these weird thoughts that I don’t think are intrusive thoughts. Like I watched a video of someone with Tourette’s and suddenly I was playing out scenarios where I had it. I even pretended I had tics. I’ve also daydreamed about having cancer where I was glad I got it. I read a book where the main characters are in a psychiatric hospital and I envied them. I just wish bad things to happen to me. Why?? I’m kinda freaking out."

47,I don't feel emotions as strongly as other people. Is this normal?,"I would say in general, I feel less emotional than seems normal. At least, I can suppress them. I don't know if either is the case, but if I am suppressing them, I don't know why. I feel like my emotions aren't as strong, and that I'm embarrassed whenever I do show strong emotions. There was a time at my father's funeral when everyone was crying, and all that happened to me was a few tears. I felt guilty that I didn't feel more. Connecting to other people is a whole nother monster. I don't feel like I can connect with many people, and talking to new people really doesn't mix will with me. If it's just a stranger I won't ever see again, fine. But if it's someone that I'm expected to at least form some type of relationship with, I find it extremely hard to interact comfortably. Somewhat similarly, I don't feel strongly attached to my family. I see other people being super close and open with their families, but I seem to be unable to do so. The rest of my family seems open to each other, but for some reason I am unable to properly relate to them. Is something wrong, or is this just a slight abnormality? Please help!?"

Every time I feel like i’ve hit rock bottom, it somehow gets worse. God, I don’t even think therapy would work at this point, maybe medication? Who knows. I want to change, but I feel like i’m not able to anymore. There is no room for change anymore. I give up. I’m so tired. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I guess thats why im making this post is because if someone wants to spend time out of their day to listen to some piss baby on the internet complain about how oh woah im so bad and toxic its because they i dont know care or something like that but when i tell her im sure she feels like she has to put up with someone that just complains about how toxic they are like thats a problem right me telling her about how im a problem thats a problem its just i feel like i force my self hatred onto her and that makes her upset so thats why im making this so i dont force it upon anyone to read all of this once again im so so so sorry and to anyone that made it this fair, hi how are you?"

62,Should I get therapy?,"I have been dealing with mental health issues for years now, but I think it’s starting to get worse. I was taken out of school because of my anxiety disorder which lead me to contemplate suicide.

I’m homeschooled now, and doing a lot better than I was. However, ever since quarantine, I feel like I’m slipping down to my old routes of anxiety and perfectionism. I only seem to enjoy things for a short amount of time before being bored of them and my sleep schedule has become ridiculous.

I’m under the notion that my intelligence is pure pretentiousness and that I’m not skilled at anything. People say that I’m smart, but I think that I just know surface level information about a bunch of tiny things. 

The worst part is that I’ll have a full-on mental breakdown in front of my parents, cool off and then pretend like things are entirely normal. They may think that I’m just having an episode, but I believe that it is my mind’s way of crying for help.

Reason I'm asking is because I do this. Sometimes I dont even know I'm doing it because I'm doing it in my head when Im starting to feel down about something or a negative thought comes. Its kind of a grounding measure for me I guess. But I don't follow half the stuff I say in my pep talks, I mean I try to atleast. 

It doesn't really bother me so much, only thing that does is that sometimes I feel like its not really helping. Especially if I am actually feeling down. Sometimes I'll listen to it and be like omg im so cringe or something. Or I feel like I'm not letting myself feel down by faking that I am good. If any of that makes sense.

Let me know what you guys think"
66,What is wrong with me?,"Im a 19 year old male about to start college soon.. To start things off ill begin where everything im going through started. About a few months ago i was getting headaches out of the blue. Just randomly i started getting headaches everyday, and for a while I ignored them. The only problem is they didnt go away and I started to get nervous. Originally I thought they were just me going crazy but my head really hurt no matter what i did. Ireally thought I was going to die and I was nervous 24/7. Eventually I just said fuck it i dont care what happens to me and they mostly went away. Somtime during all this too I choked on my food a few times, which caused me to be nervous every time I ate. Anyways I got panic attacks from all this, it was horrible since this lasted months. Somewhat recently i got rid of the panic attacks by assuring myself im not going to die and im going to be fine. So by this point in time im feeling a lot better, but it didn't last long. I began to feel what I think was depersonalization/dissociation.  Basically I felt like i didn't exist, that I wasn't in control of myself, like i wasn't me/forgot who I was, and like i was going crazy. I was fighting this feeling for a while, I did my best, but i lost. What made it worse was in class we were discussing weird shit like existence and stuff like that. I knew already that this was going to make stuff worse but I had to listen and do my homework since I wanted to graduate. Anyways the teacher brought up some stuff that freaked me out. Stuff like how do we know we actually exist, life could be a simulation, why do we do what we do,  that we aren't really in control of ourselves, and why are we us? And also said things like are we really in control of our thoughts, are we just our brains. Now I know this stuff sounds crazy but it scared me because it somehow made sense in a weird way. Usually when people said stuff like that to me before I was like no way I dont believe that garbage, but keep in mind I felt shitty already and not like myself so it really impacted me. I tried to ignore it bit it began to bother me every day on top of my feelings of depersonalization. The past week its been getting worse like i actually feel like I don't exist and that I'm not in control of myself. Like I'm actually starting to believe that garbage. Its scary and its really horrible. I try to ignore it and these thoughts but no matter what they keep bothering me. Sorry for the long paragraph but just some background on what started all this. I really don't care whether I'm real or fake, I just love my family and friends and I dont want to end up in a mental hospital; i just want to feel like my old self and actually enjoy life again. I can barely relax anymore due to this shit. If I heard this a few years ago I'd be like nah I don't believe all that conspiracy garbage. Thanks for reading, any help or advice is appreciated!"

69,I am getting tired of my mother.,"My mother is just the worst. I know a lot of people can probably relate, but she is such a narcissist and an abuser. Ive been asking for help and therapy for a long time, because i have bad anxiety, and now to add to it i also feel extremely depressed and suicidal, again, because of her because there is no one else in my life who treats me that badly. She would refuse an outlet for me to get help from, things like going and explaining it to my school counselor because i know that they'd help and yet she was always against it. She believes i dont need the help, that i am just a spoiled and ungreatful child. Im so sick of this. All this time she made me feel so scared to speak up about my problems and i did as shed say, she makes me feel responsible for everything that i dont do. I have wanted to speak up many times before but i was scared of betraying my mother. Right now i am so fucking tired of this shit that i think i am going to tell her the second that ill see her. My school problems, my absence was always because of my anxiety and depression but i had to make petty excuses just because i was too scared to tell them. I feel suicidal more than ever before, im harming again and i feel fucking helpless.."
70,What mental health problems do you suspect John Lennon suffered from?,
71,Is not enjoying social interaction normal or I'm just thinking about it to much?,"I don't enjoy or interested talking, hanging out or other social interaction. I only do this kind of interaction when there is something to be done like study or work other than that if I'm not forced to i just go home or go somewhere where else alone.

This cause me disconnect with people and being unable to really relate to them.

I don't think this is normal and been like this my entire life.
If you and I need to have to do short term work, like for a week you won't notice it because we have a task on hand and both of us is focused on it. But if we like work for months that isn't time bound you'll probably notice this. 

Is this normal or is something wrong with my mindset or something.

Im writing this because I understand the importance of socializing and being connected but I could not do it."
72,left psych evaluations documents in old apartment,"I’m freaking out, because I have been searching for this blue binder that has copies of my psych evaluations in it from my therapist. I moved out of my apartment at the end of May, and now I think I might have left it on the top shelf of my closet there. I’m worried someone is going to find them and use it against me. I don’t know what to do. If I should call the apartment and ask them if they found anything? Or if I should drop it because it was probably thrown away. It’s almost 1am here now and I’m having complete anxiety."
73,I can’t stand feeling like this,"I’m diagnosed MDD since I was 16 and have been medicated. In last two years we added in medication for my anxiety. I feel like I can’t explain what is going on in my brain. I will have an intense fixation on something for weeks and then- nothingness. Emptiness. No interest in doing anything at all- it feels like a chore to even make myself watch tv. Because nothing INTERESTS me. During these times of emptiness I wonder if anyone would miss me at all if I was gone. I know they would, deep down. But really the only thing that keeps me going down the rabbit hole is my two year old daughter. There is no doubt in my mind that she would miss me. And (hypothetically) if the only reason I stayed in this world for was her- it would be worth it. But I’m afraid of saying anything. I’ve tried to explain this to my husband but he doesn’t get it. He’s one of those types who has 6 different hobbies and makes friends easier than anyone I know. I’m afraid that if I tell my psychiatrist they will take my baby away from me. I just want to not feel like this anymore."
74,Ending it. My life is over,Bye
75,Anxiety for me,"First post here. Heard you guys were some cool folk so figured I’d come see what’s up. My anxiety is primarily social, but lately I’ve noticed it seeping over into other aspects of my life. These are just done general thoughts that I wrote down while contemplating while taking a shit. Would be happy to answer any questions y’all might have in the comments. Thanks for reading

I’m scared all the time

Knowing I’m going to have to speak to someone I don’t know causes me a lot of stress

I get frustrated when an interaction doesn’t go how I envision it

I feel like a part of my brain is broken

There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t compare myself to others

I don’t like talking because I’m afraid of conversational slip ups like mispronouncing words, going on tangents not related to the conversation, boring the other person, or sounding a certain way

I’m self conscious about almost everything about me.

I get sick to my stomach when I think about the anxiety or interacting with certain people.

I don’t have any outlet. I sometimes write down what I think or feel just to see it in words, but it hasn’t done much in terms of relief. 

I drive around a lot to let my mind wonder, but it usually results in more panicking and more stress than it does resolutions. 

 I’m scared to talk to anyone about my anxiety because I have a fear of being portrayed as self centered or attention hungry. 

Sometimes I get so frustrated with myself that I get depressed over my flaws and short comings. 

I contemplate suicide

I think I hold myself to high standards but I’m obnoxiously lazy

I almost always assume the worst

My fear of failure is almost if not just as bad as my fear of people"
76,I just finished my last class in order to get my bachelors degree in psychology,"It took me 6 years. I had to take some breaks, i failed classes, and could only handle taking 4 classes a semester; but i finally finished. Ive been struggling with clinical depression even before i started college and then my ADHD has just seemed to gotten worse in the past 5 years. Ive had a lot of bad things happen to me in the past few years that hindered my progress and made me have to go a lot slower than everyone else around me, but im finally done.  

Im so proud of myself and i guess the reason of why im here telling strangers on the internet about it is i just dont think anyone else in my life is going to be as excited for me or realize how big of an accomplishment to me this is. My parents are college graduates; my dad has his masters. My older sister has already graduated and is halfway through her masters program to be a physicians assistant. College just wasnt seen as a big deal in my family. It was also never seen as something that was optional. Im not mad about that though, im really happy my parents stressed the importance and necessity of education. But since getting my bachelors degree has been seen as an expectation, im worried that my family is just going to minimize my accomplishment and chalk it up as me just meeting the expectations they placed on me. I really want them to be proud and excited for me.  

Im friends with a of smart people and all of them have already completed their degrees so i feel im just the lame duck that has trailed behind everyone else.  None of my friends have clinical depression nor ADHD so i dont expect them to understand how debilitating these things can be in completing things like this.

I dont know if this makes me seem entitled to be complaining about this kind of thing. Im not asking for a parade to be thrown in my honor nor am i fishing for complements. Im just really hoping that when i tell my mom tomorrow, she doesnt respond with something along the lines of ""well \*finally\* you finished"" or will cheer for me in a patronizing way.....it just seems like something she would do. I just really want this to be seen as a big accomplishment and not as me just completing the minimum. 

Thanks for listening reddit, i owe you one."
77,I'm so fucking tired of posting here and no one even commenting lol,So yeah I wanna kill myself
78,Is it okay to take some of your diagnosis seriously but not all of it?,"When I was in high school I had a school psychologist do an evaluation on me and I was diagnosed with GAD, SAD, Depression, OCD, dyscalculia and ADHD. I agree with all of these diagnoses except for ADHD. I don’t have trouble focusing on things, I don’t have trouble paying attention, i’m not hyperactive and I don’t have a short attention span and i feel like it was a misdiagnoses. Is it okay for me to disregard that particular diagnosis as wrong while accepting all the others as truth?"
79,How do I stop myself from crying for no reason,"Hey everyone, just some extra info to make peoples lives easier, I'm a 16 year old guy who can't seem to prevent myself from crying in really unfit situations. Many times I will burst into tears for no reason, just mid conversation and BAM I'm crying. I've been this way for as long as I can remember, I suffer from anxiety and a little depression which may explain why it happens, but I hate is as my parents are very ""man up"" kind of people, so even in kinda sorta negative conversations where I have no need or want, I do it anyways. If anyone has any advice on how I can prevent myself from randomly crying I would appreciate it very greatly. Thanks."
80,So... Preface by saying you don't have to take any medication from a mental health hospital that you do not want to...,"We're going to talk about SWIM. They cAn load you up with pills when you get there. Basically leave you incapacitated. And when you say no, well ""Doctor's orders, or 'it's the best for you.'."" 
No. No it's not. SWIM said that they do this to assert control. Take for example Seroquel. 400 mg. Twice. A day. SWIM couldn't function. At all. Morning- ""Take this."" Eat breakfast, wake up in the bed. Have missed lunch. Dinner, ""Have this."" Dinner, somehow get back into bed, sleep for 15 hours. Try to get out of bed, to go to the bathroom. BAM, more than casually equanted with the floor until someone finds you an hour or two later. *Shhhh, you were sleepwalking. Quiet...* 

If someone is in this situation, SWIM tells me that you have the ability to KNOW what medication you are on (with side effects-ask the nurses for a print off), as well as the ability to say NO to any medication. Being drugged up for 20 hours a day, being so drugged that you do not even KNOW you are taking medications, let alone ASK what medication someone is giving you, is not alright... 

Having talked to SWIM about getting mental health help, it's a scary place. If you don't have an advocate ( someone to say ""Hey! What's he on? He's not okay, can you tell him what he's on?!"") Can be important..."
81,I feel like I dont deserve friends or a nice girl in my life.,"Just got into another fight with my Dad because I stayed out too late with my sister at a park I wasnt supposed to be at and after he was done telling at me, I went upstairs and just bursted into tears. Why am I an idiot? I feel like nobody wants to be around me because I'm not chasing money like they are and see me as weak minded they just excluded me from them. I just wish someone just murdered me instead because I'm too scared to do it myself. I became even more scared to go back on Instagram or snapchat because I dont want to be a bother to nobody or ba nuisance. I dont deserve those people, they dont deserve to hear my problems so I'm just hurting inside. I feel like girls view me as undesirable and are just nice to me because they feel bad for me.  They see me as a broken man (I'm 19 btw) and they dont feel like I better than that alone. It feels like everytime I'm emotionally at my best, I just slap down harder. I'm trying so hard not to be cynical of others but it just gets harder every day. Who's even genuine to me at this point? I mean I'm decent looking but I feel like I'm not good enough for anybody or anyone even cares enough about me like that. Been trying to believe in God again, but it just feels like a sweet lie from other Christians. Like they said that they're obligated to care about me, when I bet those same people dont even practice that in real life. I'm tired of the lies, I'm sick of feeling like I'm a shitty human being, im tired of it all, I want to be free."
82,Self-Improvement or Delusional?,"I'm not one to really throw myself out there in regards to personal issues but after watching this video, I currently am at a loss for words as this struck me hard.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhkWDG4Eylk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhkWDG4Eylk)

So I've been trying to wake up early and getting myself to listen to more self-enrichment podcasts for the past two years now in order to be a better person that I am. Although, I think I'm starting to realize that I may just be belittling everybody who I nearly meet like the character Emma in the video. I'm starting to regret for cutting my toxic 'friends' a couple of years ago in which I probably was the toxic 'friend' all along...

I don't even know anymore. Probably just going to cry myself to sleep tonight. Thanks in advance to anybody that is reading this."
83,Where do I start?,"I have low self esteem. I always have every since I was younger i have had a wider body frame than my siblings but my family would joke and compare me to all the bigger people around me and associate me with them when I was honestly figured differently but thin. Somehow from that I developed anxiety and use to eat and cry to help relieve my emotions. It was the only way I knew how to. Somehow they would call me fat but I would tell myself I was skinny and needed to eat so I reversed what what actually going on with what was in my head. I would use spare change or my check to buy food everyday literally mcdonalds I still remember 7 McDoubles 4 small fries in one sitting everyday til I was tiered and full but still ate to cope with my emotions. 

Around this time also my mom told my Dr. about me crying for no reason and I was evaluated for depression and sent to a psychologist. I spent a long time this way feeling dark, sad, and alone. I dont know if it has to do with how I was raised in a over protective environment or the association of my low self esteem, toxic relationships, or past traumatic events. 

I know I'm all over the place but I really want to change the way i feel about my self and view the world. I have my morals and this causes conflict with me associating with the outside world beside those who know me. There seems to be very much tolerance for degrade and disrespect in society now in days and i witness through the use of social media so i stay away and find myself disliking people particularly women. 

Aside from this I find myself feeling like people just use me, take advantage of me, and try to come back when they realize there lost. I have for the longest had a very odd way of finding people to date me i dont feel its ever been proper how we meet. I have ways felt as if I been sexually pursued everytime and that has made me feel like i am incapable of being loved as much as i can. 

When I was younger from about 8 to 11 i was molested by my oldest sister. I never told anyone but growing up that effected my sexuality. I have after many times of it being ignored when I have brought it up she opened up that one of our cousins did it to her and she did not know why she did it to me. I suspected this but never understood why me... i never told my mom either I mentioned it but lied and said it was someone at school. One of my exs cousins sexually molested me. Guys at my previous job also sexually molested me and threatened me i was 16 or 17 at the time. I was to scared to ever open up it seem every guy always took advantage of me and I was always to scared to say anything. 

Growing up in a strict household my dad cheated on my mom and I became the monkey in the middle when that issue came up that he confessed and I was forced to travel to another country and meet with the other child and go with him to his DNA test. That changed things at home and affected our relationship with our parents cause all they did was argue. Besides that my dad has always worked hard to provide for us but has always struggled financially and its stressful at this point. Also my dad doesn't let me do anything is controlling judges everything I do say or who I meet. He always wants to be right I feel there is a lot I can say but the min goes a long way. He also is aggressive when mad and verbally abuse towards us and my mom always has been.

My mom always brings my dads cheating and had trauma from that i wanna keep this as short as possible. I went to a psychologist and stopped because I gained weight and well i was diagnosed with clinical depression i feel it come and go from time to time because sometimes the feelings or thoughts I have towards myself make me want to throw up. I am very simple and people always think im a lesbian it hurts my feelings because idk if I look masculine to them.

I would like to work on my self and invest more on me but i don't know where to begin or how to. I try to jump into things like for instance i just bought make up like if thats going to change anything. There is so much destruction I am so damaged traumatized but have fought through it to get through my career and carry on as nothing but inside of my head there is a disaster and I dont know what to do."
84,My monsters pt.1,"I have had depression since primary school. I was always picked on by teachers and classmates. I always felt so alone, and empty. By the time i reached my third year in high school, I had gotten some friends. I have always been shy, introverted and I seriously think something is wrong with me. I can't deal with what i feel because its all over the place. I don't know what i am. I don't know who I'm becoming.  Everywhere hurts and i don't know how to feel. Everyday feels like a nightmare, I can't help myself. I always think of hurting my wrists. I hears voices telling me to hurt myself, to kill myself. Everything unmotivates me. I always want to lay down and cry in my room alone with the doors locked. I feel so shitty about everything. 

I feel so alone and empty in crowded place. Every face i see are always blurred. I keep pushing my friends away, i don't want them near me like this. Most of them just tell me to suck it up and move on but i can't."
85,Why do I want to push everyone away?,I know people need me as much as I need them. But for some reason I get so angry at people and I want to stop talking to them. But I can’t do that because they need me and I don’t want to hurt them. I’m so angered for some reason but I can’t figure out what I’m mad about and what’s making me annoyed. I don’t want to seem self absorbent either like I’m the only one that matters. I just don’t know what to do? Do I stop talking to people? What do I do ? Why do I feel this way?

87,What can I do to help my severely paranoid mother?,"My mother has extreme paranoia, and possibly early onset dementia. She would rather leave my family and (as my father told her) ""Find a good lawyer and leave"" than go seek help. She has no money to her name, and my father has supported her for over 20 years. If she leaves, she will be most likely living on the street. She firmly believes that there is a ghost in our house or a person that she cannot see who steals her things, and makes her life miserable. She yells out when she thinks no one can hear her and says ""GET OUT OF MY HOME, I DIDN'T INVITE YOU"" among other things that are cryptic and scary,... She believes that cars and planes only go by/over our home when she does certain things like playing piano or opening a window. It's impossible to get her to leave the house. She believes many more irrational things like the lights are cameras and people are spying on her, and blamed my dad for ruining her life. I try to humor her and listen to what she has to say, but I can't do anything more because she wont let me. She went to a doctor once who diagnosed her, but she firmly believes that the doctor ""could not find anything wrong"" and refuses to go again. My father is supporting me through university and he's stressed and tired. He has put up with this for almost 30 years and he wants her to leave. Is there anything I can do? I'm 20 and I've lived with this all of my life; I swear I've thought of everything I could do, but I need a new perspective. I asked her today: ""If I called a paranormal investigation group to the home, and gave you a few thousand dollars to pay for it, and they found nothing, what would you do?""..... She replied with ""Then they weren't good enough""."
88,Is this executive dysfunction?,"There’s this problem that I’ve been having for many years. I tend to stay up all night on my phone, even if I’m super tired, just watching youtube/browsing reddit/etc/etc doing unimportant things that I don’t even care about and wishing that I would just go to sleep already. I did this last night and only went to bed when it started getting bright outside at 6:30 am. It’s like I just don’t want to get moving. I’ve tried to think of explanations for this before, mainly being that I’m really lazy or that I don’t want the next day to start, but the latter in last night’s case wasn’t even true. In fact I really did want the next day to start, but I couldn’t bring myself to just get ready for bed and go to sleep, and I blew it, and it makes me kinda hate myself a little more every time it happens. My mom doesn’t understand and says it‘s dumb (but honestly I’ve never had an excuse or known how to explain).

I’m really bad at getting started with things in general, but this is the worst one since it happens every night and I always ruin the perfectly good night’s sleep that I could be having. (I’m doing it right now by typing this post at 2:28 am.) I think in other situations, maybe I’m just a lazy and a procrastinator, but do y’all think this is procrastination here or an example of executive dysfunction?"
89,Cycling between moods and behaviors. Makes it really difficult to just live life.,"I really don’t understand what’s going on with me. I’ve been struggling with my mental health since high school, I’m 25 now. I’ll try to explain what I’ve been experiencing lately and maybe someone can give me some insight. 

Since about 2 years ago I’ve been really making an effort to change my mental health. I was successful for a couple months or so at some point. I did this by working out everyday, eating healthy, sleeping better, quitting weed, video games and porn, and supplementing with 5htp and L-dopa. It worked and I felt ecstatic for a while. Really better than I had since I was a kid. But then I fell back into a bout of depression. I started seeing a therapist and he said he believed I had minor depression and generalized anxiety. I stopped going after 3 or 4 months because I genuinely felt better, although not as great as I did during my healthy living lifestyle, but much more equipped to handle my mental health. My anxiety is actually gone due to therapy, but the depression comes in waves. I actually go through phases of depression and happiness.

It kind goes like this: one month I’m committed to improving myself. I see my goals and pursue them everyday. I’m working out everyday. Eating well. Sleeping well. I believe in myself and my ability to not only succeed but be great at what I do, have high confidence, dream big and want to be around others. I’m generally goofy and energetic during these times and I have determination and ambition. I like myself.

The next month I have a constant low mood. Feel the need to disconnect from life and myself. Stop replying to people or wanting to be around anyone. I eat usually once a day. I start to dislike the taste of food. Feel like I’m on the verge of tears often. Sometimes cry randomly. No ambition. Lots of self doubt, low self esteem, rumination that causes me to physically cringe often. I don’t feel like myself or feel like I know who I am on a deep level. And I get this passing thought “I’m gonna kill myself.” I’d like to mention that this thought doesn’t hold much or any weight, meaning I don’t actually want to commit suicide or have the desire to act on the thought (and I’ve never tried), although it disturbs me all the same. In a way, when the thought comes, it feels more like I’m saying “at some point in my life I’m going to kill myself, that’s how I’m going to die.” So while it’s disturbing I have yet to feel any desire at all to act on it. 

I have such a difficult time maintaining any relationships because of this. Sometimes the moods last a month, sometimes a week, and sometimes I’ll switch in and out of moods in a single day. I feel bad because I think people think I just don’t want to talk to them or something, and I have to explain myself by telling them I do this to everyone and it’s not necessarily intentional. I don’t have any close friends anymore because I’m so bad at staying in contact during my depressive moods.

I’ve been trying to break this cycle but I feel like every step I take I jump two steps back the next week or month. It used to be mainly just depression but has recently (this past year) started becoming more and more cyclical with this high mood.

I’m in a depressive mood now and have been for the past couple weeks. My brother just visited from out of town and I was able to seem probably mostly fine around him, but I constantly wanted to just go in my room and lie down and do nothing despite only seeing him once every few months. He just left an hour ago and I immediately went into my bed and started crying. I don’t know why.

I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to live like this. I honestly feel like I’m always struggling to just maintain a positive outlook on life. It’s so hard to get a taste of such a good feeling and then not know how long it’ll last. Living just feels like this constant battle as I struggle to make progress in any aspect of my life."
90,Feeling depressed and just need to write out my thoughts,[removed]
91,"If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.",https://youtu.be/-Ueq_GPW_nw
92,Sometimes I just need some intellectual discussion about my feelings,I feel like that’s all I need sometimes. When I feel introspective I can get quite vocal about how I’m feeling. I sometimes just need someone to talk about what’s getting me down. Unfortunately this can be taken as me just whining or being self pitying. My mum has no idea how to react when I talk about any possible negative emotion. She thinks I’m looking for some magic cure or some sort of really helpful advice and usually she’ll just give me some sort of tip. It’s really frustrating talking to a lot of people about stuff. I feel like some people couldn’t care less and just act disengaged in the conversation. Which is understandable because it it’s quite a self centred conversation to have. I don’t have any serious mental health issues but sometimes I  can be a bit sensitive and it’s good to have someone to talk to to help you understand yourself and also so you can have them understand you. All I want to get out of the conversation is to feel a bit more rational about my situation or be told something patronising. I feel very misunderstood when I talk about things.
93,I am in so much pain right now,"I can't even put my pain into words, but I'll try my best: I am shaking, cold and have a burning sensation in my body, like if you've ever got burned by dry ice before or anything like that. Every. Time. I. Get. Sad. It just hurts. I've already relapsed on my cutting and I think I am just too far gone. I really want to take these pills and get it over with, but I am too damn weak. This is the worst time I've ever had in my life. I hope you guys are doing well."

95,How to promote a culture of caring and compassionate leadership,"COVID-19 and the accompanying economic lockdowns are starting to take an enormous toll on everyone's resilience and even mental health. Here are some tips on what you can do at work to promote a culture of caring and compassionate leadership

96,How to stop overthinking,All my life I’ve suffered from overthinking everything I do and this sometimes cause problems or even depression. A lie could tear me apart and anything I do others I will never stop thinking about it. A small mistake would have me thinking about it for weeks or even months which sometimes led me to have a mental breakdown. I try to focused on positive things when I overthink but still I think negatively. School work and playing games/sport also gets affected by my overthinking because I won’t stop thinking if Im doin something wrong and sometimes stops me from focusing on the thing. I haven’t gotten help because my parents think I don’t need it and they think I’m just overreacting. So it would be helpful if you guys have some suggestion to help with overthinking.
97,I feel like no one really gives a shit,"I always feel like no one cares about what I say. I feel overlooked. I don't have a sense of belonging among people I thought were my friends. There's no one I can talk to about how I feel. For the past few weeks now, I've been feeling terrible every second of my life. My heart is always racing, and I'm scared, I don't know about what. I always feel cold, even in 45°C weather. I think I'm depressed, or have anxiety. I don't know. My parents are very supportive and tend to my every need, but I can't talk to them. I don't want to. I never wanna talk to anyone, I just wanna sleep and be alone. I used to play video games with friends but now I just join the voice call and stay silent, only listening. If they ask me something I don't know how to answer, I just turn my console off and go to sleep, no matter how many calls they spam me with. I don't blame them, they don't know what's going on. I feel terrible. I have low self esteem and I'm not creative at all. I lack motivation do be productive. I don't want to study. I want to cry, but the tears won't come out. I want to cry but what if someone sees me?"

100,Fired from my new job. Feel really bad.,"I have depression. My sister got sick (maybe covid), I was taking care of her and had a mental breakdown. My sister told me to leave everything and focus on my recovery, that she will take care of me. 

After a few weeks of doing nothing I found a job as a cashier in a supermarket. It make me feel better, a lot better because I hadn’t time to overthink or listen to my monkey mind. Today my boss told me they were going to close the store. Now I don’t have a job. 

Can you give me some nice words? Can you give me some ideas for new jobs? Where can I look for jobs? I would like to find a “low skills” job because I don’t want to think.

Right now I feel overwhelmed, useless, a burden. I want to cry. To stay in my bed an disappear."
101,I hit a dear today and felt nothing.,"So some background.  I am introverted but far from a loner. Over the last couple months I have been noticing in a strange kind of third person way that things that would normally get an emotional response put of me have lately been getting a diminished response or no response at all. An example would be how I used to get really passionate about a particular band I like but lately I find myself not even caring that there music is playing. I still enjoy it. It's just that the passion is gone. Which is fine in and of itself people get sick of certain things or lose interest in them. But lately this has been happening a scary amount. 

Fast forward to today. I'm driving home after picking up dinner and it's late. A deer jumped out at me and I couldn't stop in time. I normally love nature and cant stand the idea of hurting another living thing.(still cant.) So I hit the deer and my car chucks it off the road. I logically know that if that deer survived it wont live long. I cant be sure but I am pretty sure I saw it get up and run off. I would normally be feeling some intense emotions at that point. Panic that my car is damaged and I cant afford to fix it right now. Guilt over hitting an animal. Anxiety about how I am going to pay for the damages. Empathy and compassion for the animal I just severely injured. 

I felt none of that when my car came to a stop. I simply took a deep breathe turned on my.hazards and got put to inspect the damage. Satisfied that the damage was only cosmetic I sighed a faint flutter of relief. Got back into my car and started back down the road. Other then the faint relief that my car wasnt totaled I felt nothing.

Fast forward to about 4 miles down the road and I am picturing the deer being chucked into the woods in a horrific and violent image. And I just started laughing. Not at the horror. Or the suffering that deer must be doing thru but the image of it flying threw the air. It reminded me of a burly man chucking a midget at a target. I kind of dark humor. Sick humor.

4 hours later and I still feel nothing. No anxiety. No remorse. Nothing. Nothing except the overwhelming terror that I have either complete lost my mind or am a sociopath.

I have never been someone who feels overly strong feelings towards others but I wouldn't say I feel nothing. I have always attributed the muted feelings I have to the life time of betrayal I have been through. People let you down. I stopped trusting just everyone I meet. I think that's how most people feel. They look at someone new and are cuotius. That person could hurt you if you let them in after all so be sure you want them to get close. A fancy way of saying pick your friends carefully. The people I do let in I do feel strong emotions for.

So my question for you experts in the mind is this. Am I a sociopath?"
102,When did you know you needed to be in the hospital?,"I have a psychiatric appointment Friday that I cannot wait for. I’m done struggling so much and I think I need real fucking help. I’m going to tell her everything. I have a feeling that includes going to some kind of inpatient setting and I’m okay with that. It terrifies me, but I am holding on by a string these days and I have no other options.

I have almost never ending flashbacks to a prolonged traumatic relationship and am weak from anorexia. I’m underweight by about 5 pounds and have chest and head pain. I drink, cut, smoke cigarettes, watch gore, purposely vomit, and anything else to punish and/or alleviate the trauma episodes. I also have intense emotions and am easily, easily overwhelmed by emotions that leave me wanting to kill myself—most likely BPD.

Am I overreacting? When did you know you needed to be admitted for this?"
103,a poem,"my brain is such a chaotic thing.

sometimes my own thoughts can’t even keep track of my own thoughts.

and they come, erratic and uneven.

and i want to scream.

and i want to crack my skull open and rip out my brain and replace it with a new one.

one that works like it’s supposed to."
104,"Analyse every little detail when making decisions. I then doubt my choice, which causes great anxiety.","Whenever making decisions, I go over every possible outcome and small detail. I research extensively, which gives me anxiety. Then when i make the decision, I question it and get upset with myself. 

For example when buying a TV, I will research the history of the company who makes it, how likely they are to go out of business, what options I would have if the remote stopped working etc. 

I overthink everything and consider possibilities which no one would even think of. All this thinking gives me so much anxiety. 

Does anyone have any advice about how I can improve this problem?"
105,Feel the urge to hurt other people?,"It’ll be for a stupid reason, like family, friends or strangers saying or doing things that I just find upsetting or frustrating, but I’ll just get this overwhelming emotional urge to physically hurt somebody. Like grab a knife and stab someone and watch them bleed out. I don’t know what’s wrong with me - I had this a while ago but now that I’m going off some medication, it’s coming back again. I don’t think I’d ever do anything, but the urge to do it is so overwhelming that I’m afraid it’ll end up taking me over and I’ll have no control over it. It doesn’t last for long, but when it comes on it feels almost uncontrollable. I’ve told my family this before, but they’ve just blamed it on violent shows (I don’t particularly watch anything violent) and blow it off as if I’m vying for attention. I’m 21 and have social anxiety disorder... the last thing I want is attention. I don’t know what this is or what I’m meant to do."
106,How do you make yourself do something if you have no will?,"English isn't my first language so i struggled to find the word but decided to go with ""will"" at last even tho I'm not sure if it's the one.

I do have motivation and will to do things i think. I want to work on alot of things on myself but i just seem to not be able to.


I want to work out and i do but it's never constant and I want to study  (which is something so serious and alot is going to change if I'm able to get good grades) and i want to do other things i really like but most of the time i get ready to do them and just don't. It's so frustrating i have 0 self control and i hate it , i can't seem to focus or be able to put effort into things no matter how much i want to. 


So what can i do to stop that? I blame myself alot for it as if I'm lazy and just stupid but it just happens idk how it does."
107,My story and questions about weed and panic attacks,"# I am looking for someone who might be able to give me some answers in the following areas:

\- Psychology

\- Weed induced panic attacks

\- General panic attacks

# About me:

* 35 years old
* I used to smoke weed every other day at night. Not much, a really small bud in a really small pipe. (I smoked a lot of weed in my 20s, multiple joints/bong hits a day)
* No previous physical or mental illnesses
* Stressy life and job
* I am very confident on the outside / pretty nervous on the inside
* I overthink way too much

# My panic attack trip:

I recently (1 week before COVID-19 lockdown in Europe) went through a very horrible phase in my life. It all started when I would have to lay down in bed after smoking weed because I did not feel like I had enough energy to get up off the couch and make it over to the bed. Then I started to have the same feeling but worse, I felt my hands start tingling and my breath become real shallow. My inner thoughts were *""ahh it's just a paranoid high, nothing will happen""* and then at some point I fell asleep. I cut weed for the majority of the week after this event. Then I toked up on the weekend again, the same exact thing happened, I was feeling so bad I called my girlfriend and had her come home from work. The tingling in the hands and shallow breathing was far worse. I basically said to myself that this is a paranoid high over and over until I fell asleep. When I had paranoid highs in the past I would just think back to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Pxx1Qz-hw), laugh, and think to myself *""nobody has ever died from smoking weed""*.

I stopped smoking weed that night as I of course realized that I was unable to control what I was going through. Throughout the week I started feeling light-headed and really felt sick to my stomach and a lot of shallow breathing while sitting in meetings etc. The ""sick to my stomach"" feelings most likely came from a new project I received on top of all my other work in the company I work for. The cherry on top: COVID-19 was becoming more and more of a threat (at least what I thought at the time), with more and more infections/deaths in our neighboring countries. I even called one of the COVID-19 hotlines to find out if the symptoms I had were somewhat related (shallow breathing, light-headed).

&gt;**I must note**: at this point in time I had no idea what a panic attack was nor have I ever hyperventilated.

The days after I couldn't go to work as I was feeling dizzy and sick to my stomach. Then comes weekend.. my girlfriend is out for a jog. I still feel horrible but decide to lay out in the sun. I start feeling worse and worse and decide to try and get up and lay back in bed. I finally make it to my bed and the same feelings start coming back, very shallow breathing and tingling in my hands. It got worse and worse. I called my girlfriend (who by the way also did not know what a panic attack looks like). She comes running home very worried of course. I saw the worry in her eyes in then my symptoms started to get worse. She called the ambulance. Right before they arrived, I started to have carpopedal spasms in my hands. The hands kept tightening up more and more locking them to my body. At this point, I thought I was about to die. Then my feet started to go numb. The paramedics finally arrived. I was still able to speak and explained all of my symptoms. They put a benzodiazepine on my tongue and I was in a relaxed state after about 10 minutes. I insisted on going to the hospital to get an immediate checkup. On my way to the hospital, they explained what happened to me. Basically said, a major panic attack. They checked everything at the hospital and said I was perfectly fine. The days go by with minor panic attacks. I was basically in bed for a complete week after my first attack. I was not able to shower longer than a minute as I felt like I could not breathe. My doctor prescribed anti-depressants which really bummed me out as I would do anything to overcome illness without medication. I did not and have not taken any medication since.  I finally got an appointment with a psychologist which helped me out a lot. He basically said its all due to stress at work and not having anything to compensate for it (fitness etc.).

A month or went by, and I felt a lot better. I still had anxious feelings and was still very worried about having to go through this shit again but I had two benzodiazepines in my back pocket just in case. **And then... it happened again.** I was sitting on the couch watching TV and felt sick to my stomach and was breathing shallow again. About 5 minutes later my hands cramped up so I immediately took a benzo. This was a major step back for me. I thought I had overcome all of this and then it happened again. One day goes by, not feeling too good (drained of energy). The next day, same exact shit, I am sitting on the couch and it happens again. In the meantime, I found a psychiatrist and scheduled an appointment. I started my therapy there and it´s going well. I explained that I do not want any medication unless it is something natural. I received lavender oil pills which have been quite effective ( I assume its the placebo effect though). I have not had a panic attack since. I do feel sick to my stomach once a week or so but that is probably due to the fact that I have started working again and am slowly getting back to my normal lifestyle.

I am very aware that I have to find something to compensate for all of the stress in my life.

# My questions:

* Could my first major panic attack (which was in a sober state) have been caused by me smoking weed? *My thoughts: maybe the weed brought something to light that I would not have considered while being sober. I am still aware that stress plays a big role too.*
* I have only had maybe 10 paranoid highs in my lifetime (nothing like what I recently experienced). Could this have been caused by the strain of weed or concentration of THC?
* I have now been ""weed sober"" for 3 months. My last panic attack was a little over a month ago. I really miss the relaxation in the evenings and was wondering if I will never be able to smoke again. I would not try at the moment as I am pretty sure I would go paranoid again. What are your thoughts here?
* What are your thoughts on CBD weed (no THC)? My therapist advised against it or actually said he is pretty neutral on the subject.
* The ""sick to my stomach"" feelings I described above are still present about once a week. The doctor told me that there are two types of people: Heart People &amp; Stomach People. He further explained that a lot of people have a very fast heartbeat and others feel sick to the stomach when anxious or while having a panic attack. I have always had stomach issues right before big interviews or presentations but the feelings I have now seem to be worse. Has anyone experienced the same?

As you can tell, I have a little love for cannabis ;) It has been one of my best friends for many years (off and on) and has helped me through some pretty rough patches. I would be very grateful for an expert opinion here or even some of your thoughts and personal experiences. Thanks in advance!"
108,Everyone is just always expecting the best of me,"I work in a 9-5job in a tech company. Im currently leading 3 projects and is providing training for key people here. 

My boyfriend is a smart man and I need to keep up with him to keep him engaged. And due to corona we have to go through a long distance.

My friends are always supportive but they’re never truly there and I feel like Im going to waste their time if I get to my feels

I just moved abroad 6 months ago for this work and I havent had the chance to look around bcs lockdown.

Today is just a random day and I was scrolling through linkedin and saw a post saying that it’s mid year: what a wasted time.

And I felt my life going on so quickly... and now I’m having a mental breakdown at the office at 5pm. 

What the hell is wring with me? I really cant stop crying it’s been 30 mins."
109,I have visions of these black shadows.,I have visions of these black shadow things. They come in like a sort of panic attack. They usually come at night. If I'm laying in bed they are more like faces. If I'm doing something they usually come in like a hand grabbing my arm or something. It usually only happens like once a month. Im on a waiting list to see a doctor because I get depressive episodes. I also convince myself that there is nothing wrong and that I dont need help when I clearly do. It sorta feels like its someone else convincing me. I just don't no what to do or if its all in my head.
110,Drunk and want to Kms,Second time this has happened. Terrified that I’ll forget this has happened and I won’t seek the help I need in the morning. First time I was seconds away from throwing myself off a building. I need to talk to someone
111,Is this a harmful message towards men's mental health?,"This may be a slight trigger if you have had any issues with your mental health!

Hi everyone! I came across this video from, the woman in it is claiming that advocation for men's mental health charities and support are inherently sexist and completely isolate women when it comes to talking about mental health. She raises some good points regarding women suffering with mental health difficulties to a greater extent than men, however I believe she is sending the wrong message that men should not receive more support regarding mental health due to the astronomically high rate of suicides among men (in the UK where myself and this woman are from, **75% of suicides are men**). I believe when we face issues such as this, an equitable approach is more applicable in that, men's suicide prevention requires more attention to get to a more equal standard - obviously in an ideal world we should let no one get to the point where they feel their only next move is to take their own life.

This video was also posted on Instagram and she resorted to replying to educated and respectful responses with personality insults. The message that we should destroy support for an issue that affects one gender disproportionately more than the other is not a feminist one. Please let me know what you think about the video and my response to it. If you are struggling with mental health you are not alone, there is always someone to talk to, my DMs are always open.

112,Does healing exist for the abused,[removed]
113,Do I need psychological help?,"Hi comrades, this is so long, I’m sorry!!
I want advice on whether or not my behaviour warrants professional attention. I would like help and went to a doctor earlier in the year, but he seemed to think that I was rather okay and just experiencing some adolescent distress.
I saw a psychologist when I was 13 for very minor self harm, cuts that have almost completely faded. Despite my psych and parents believing i’d stopped for good, i’ve found myself engaging in cutting on and off until the present day where I’m now 20 and one year into University. I’ve consistently sought alternative self destructive behaviours, which I feel are less obvious means of self harm. Purging, over-exercise, binge drinking, bruising, are all activities I’ve done, though none have stuck with me consistently, other than cutting. Up until this last year, I felt I had cutting under control, but I’ve cut more often and much deeper recently. I know this isn’t sustainable as It’s no longer satisfying, and I don’t want to cut any deeper, I’ve now got thick red scars which take almost a year to heal and It’s very difficult to make convincing excuses for them. I feel this enormous inclination towards self destruction, even when I’m happy and the opportunity presents. Now that i’m an adult I feel that i’m putting myself at a bigger risk because the adult world, I’ve discovered isn’t so nice. Sometimes at night I get short periods where I feel depressed, almost psychotic, but I’m aware of my actions. At the beginning of the year I engaged in activities which seem crazy to me now, and I don’t think I could do it again. I lost my virginity to a man whom I met through seeking arrangements and felt so disgusted I could think of sex for a month. After that encounter In the span of two weeks, I took a train 3 hours from home, slept with a man of 45 for money. I came home a few days later and met another man in his hotel. I was so uncomfortable and nervous  the entire time. The sex in both of these cases were unprotected, I was extremely drunk in the first scenario. The sex was incredibly painful. Then one night I got a text from a brothel I had applied for, under the guise that I could do this sort of thing—the money I was making, and spending just as quickly, was insane. I had so much adrenaline and just showered, made myself up and drove to the brothel. They asked me if I wanted to work for a few hours that night. I said why not and ended up working from 8pm to 6am the next morning. I had 3 customers. I felt surprisingly fine, though filthy. The next night I was hesitant to return, I hated having to try to sell myself to men. I got in and felt uncomfortable and anxious, I wasn’t pumped full of adrenaline like the previous night. I had 2 outcalls and a customer in house. After that night I never went back. All of these brothel experiences I don’t think about, I have sketchy recollection, It feels like it didn’t really happen. These have been my only sexual experiences, until I met up with the man whom I’d previously lost my virginity to. This relationship, the sexual relationship we have, is the most dishonest and conflicting thing I’ve ever experienced. I know he’s not the generous man I’d thought I knew, the man who insisted on honesty and communication. He lies to me, he leaves me standing if he gets somebody he’d rather sleep with, and he uses me. He is ‘dominant’ and we’re starting to explore bdsm, I don’t know if Iike it, or if it’s the only way I can have his desire. I know this is something I need to get out of, but I feel so powerless. I don’t even love him, not one bit, I hate him most of the time, but I can’t seem to say know. He knew me at the start of my sexual ‘journey’ and offered to be the person I could turn to to talk about my experiences, because he « knew i’d need somebody ». I feel like this has created this intimacy that draws me towards him. At the moment i’m okay, but I know that I go through periods of extreme behaviour. This is what prompted me to see a doctor, I knew something worse than just self harm was waiting for me. Nothing sexual had happened, only cutting. He seemed to think that adolescent females were particularly prone to emotional distress, and that my experience was not alarming. I wanted to see a psych to prevent future destruction. He had made me an appointment, but I felt guilty in light of his comments, and that I would be wasting somebody else’s session. I bailed on that, and I regret it. 
My friends and and sibling have genuinely told me they think I should see a psychologist, they don’t know I do these things. One of my friends told me he thought I was bipolar, but I don’t feel that it’s that. 
Is this normal?"

117,Found out my cousin was listening in on me having a phonecall with my therapist,"We had my cousin over yesterday due to the fact that no one was there to take care of him at his house. (parents weren't home, sister's were both out, he's 19 which is above the legal age to stay home by yourself but he won't get off his Xbox if someone isn't there to boss him around)

I had my call at about 3:30pm and spent most of the day out of my room chilling with the cousin. When the call came, I slipped into my room to take the call, and a few minutes to by when he opens the door and gives me a confused look. I shoo him out of my room from my bed (didn't think at the time to excuse myself from the call and tell him to ping off for a few more minutes.)

Now, you'd think that when someone's shoos you out of their room, you go away from their room, right? 

I found out he was standing outside my door and listening in to try and figure out what I was doing only just a few minutes ago. I feel both horrified and terrified, as no one else but my mum knows I take these calls, and I share A LOT of personal information with my therapist. (I don't think my cousin got a lot of information though, by the time mum caught him and got him away from my door I was in the middle of talking to the therapist about events she wanted updates on.)

I'm not sure if I should tell him what I was doing and tell him to not ever do it again or just pretend it was a causal phone call if he ever asks. I'm pretty sure mum didn't say anything to him about it."

120,Feeling Distraught - Moving at a Bad Time,"I hope you're all doing well.

My 300 IQ brain decided last February that I should finally fulfill my lifelong dream of moving abroad after I got a job offer in my respective country's embassy in the UK. I was flabbergasted, beyond happy and ridiculously excited for a new life of adventure, freedom and voluntary solitude. I barely spent a month here before lockdown started. I had to work from home, stuck inside a tiny rented room by myself for upwards of 3 months. Two friends of mine have passed away in this period, one from covid and one was run over in a car accident, which absolutely broke me, and I had to take some time off to process. I live alone, I did not have time to make any real life friends or forge any real relationships, the closest people I know being my coworkers. I talk to my family daily, but I miss them so dearly. I can't sleep until I've cried almost every night, I have to call Samaritans to make sure I don't do anything stupid and hurt myself, or worse. I feel like I am trapped, I don't want to leave as it's been my life dream to live in the UK, but I can't handle being by myself for so long. I can't do anything I wanted to do, I only leave the house to go to work or for walks.

A solution I thought of is to take an extended vacation (paid or unpaid doesn't matter to me) back home, about 3 weeks or so to reset myself mentally, but I've taken so much leave in the short period I've been here that my superiors commented on it, and there is a good chance that they will not approve this time off. I feel horrible about it but I couldn't do different, I happened to move at such a horrible time, with the lockdown and the death of my friends coinciding so close to each other... I needed some time to think, and my job being so customer service oriented, being in a fragile mental state tends to be counter-productive to dealing with rude or entitled customers.

I have it in mind that if my leave is not approved and the restrictions do not loosen up, I might just off myself, or at least try to. Hopefully this time I'll have the courage to just do it. I can't stand another 3 months like this, I'm a huge mess.

I'm sorry that this is all over the place, I can barely structure my thoughts right now. Everything feels horrible and I just want it all to end."
121,Anxious when being asked to talk to a certian person,"So I’m 14M and have no current mental health issues and am just looking for some clarification, for a few months to a year, me and my brother have argued lots and I think it’s affected me mentally. And a few weeks ago it was really bad and he smashed some things and I just tried to ignore what he was saying to she shouted how I was ignoring him and hit me in the face and I was red for a while on my face, and cried for a solid 20 minutes non stop then went back to me mom/mums  ( I’m under a special guardianship order to my mum or who I think as mum and who I think as dad but they left a while ago so I just visit both there houses from time to time but live with mum/mom but this is unrelated.

Since the time he hit me I have been nervous to talk to him and be careful of what I say so he doesn’t shout at me or possibly hit me again, and when my who I think to be dad but you can call him dad, wants me to go and ask him something I get really nervous and scared, and would just like some advice generally, any more info just ask, all these people are my adoptive family. This post may make no sense but I’m not thinking straight right now and about to have dinner so typing quick

Can’t wait to hear your responses, always here to talk if you need someone 💙

125,"if i dont walk around for 5 hours a day, i have a panic attack?","question mark because ultimately i have no reason why i do this.

slight tw: self harm

long before quarantine, ive always had the urge to walk around for hours on end, and never on schedule; id abruptly stop doing something (even if important, like eating or working or talking to someone) just to walk around. if not, i felt like i was being suffocated or pulled back. (note: i have no trauma i can recall that could possibly contribute to this)

since i just graduated highschool and most of my life has been scheduled up to now, i had no problem paying attention in class for less than 2 hours at a time and then walking during recess or in the afternoon, and going to malls or parks on the weekend. id be twitching the whole time but it was manageable.

now, during quarantine, i live by no schedule/timetable and despite responsibilities, am free to arrange my duties throughout the day-- meaning i can walk whenever i want. i thought this would be good, but i guess it isnt. now, i get up from my meals, suddenly halt talking to people, and even wake up from a good sleep at 1am almost every night simply to walk around the house for hours. again, if i dont do this, i feel like i will die-- i can get lightheaded sitting down/etc sometimes and i literally black out from stress. however if i am occupied by something i am actually interested in, i almost pee myself because i will not move until im done so the walking isnt all that consistent (note again: the walkinh bother anyone else in the house, thankfully)

i tried to look into why i do this, and some of my friends said i might have ADHD (as do they, diagnosed since primary school); i do have a fair amount of other symptoms (literally every single thing you see if you look it up online), but i dont think it's really.. right? to diagnose myself with a disorder after a couple google searches. and overall, i can try to control my impulses, but it makes me want to hurt myself, or i just blurt out a ton of things while walking and crying at the end of the day. also, i need to walk more if i am more stressed, and i have been recently, so i spend almost half of my whole day walking (it's exhausting lol :( )

is there any other reason why i am like this? i am not very knowledgeable about this stuff because i spent most of my time up till now occupied with other responsibilities, but now that i am in my house all day and cannot leave i have nothing else on my mind.."

128,"I have suffered bipolar disorder for a long time, and somethings new and its not good. Whats going on?","I am very familiar with my depression and mania. About two months ago I started a new medication and I felt better than I have ever been in years. Starting 3 weeks ago somethings been very off. Im feeling something that isn't exactly depression, but it has similar things. I feel like I'm not doing enough, and I feel like my soul is being crushed down by hundreds of stones. Im not having sadness, or thoughts of suicide or death like i used to, but im just not right. I cant sleep anymore because I'm stuck in a deep haze of thoughts,  and I feel no emotions. I will get stuck in these thoughts and stand in a single spot and stare at a wall for hours. Everyone is saying I sound different. I don't even feel like I exist anymore. I don't have a sense of self and nothing feels real. I've been slowly stepping away from everything and in withdrawal. Just weeks ago I was happy, cheerful, and turning my life around. Now im just frozen. I have worsening intrusive thoughts that loop over and over that drive me mad and I can barely stand it. I just feel like everything is difficult to say or write. This doesn't feel like my depression I had before. Is it something I should be concerned about?"
129,"My first ever post, maybe you guys can help.","OK so I'm 28 years old and I work myself to death in a lumber mill.  I feel that I can't do any real work unless I have music to listen to. The pay is very good specially seeing that I don't have a college education. I see my day-to-day life as a dream almost. I still feel emotions like love and sadness when my dog died both of them actually in the last couple of months. But I can't seem to get excited about anything. I did shatter my skull when I was 13 and have a few titanium plates above my left eyebrow but at times I just don't know what to do with myself.  I still live at my dad and stepmom's house in a small trailer and I spend my off time working on my car. But I just can't seem to get excited for anything anymore. Can you guys suggest something that I should do that might make me happy,  I'm also a very socially awkward a person I have very few friends and old friends that I do have I consider family."
130,someone to talk to (panic attacks and anxiety),"So for years now I've been experiencing panic attacks I think I'm not really sure what they are.

Basically they come out of nowhere like I'll be feeling happy or excited then suddenly I feel tense and I'm certain something bad is going to happen and I always feel like I'm about to throw up and sometimes I do and they're really intense and vary in how long they last. Again I'm really not sure what I'm experiencing.

When I was in year 8 (3/4 years ago I'm 16 now) I tried to talk to my mum about it but I didn't really have the words back then I just knew something was wrong after I had my first BIG attack in school. She basically told me that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm fine. I believed her cus yanno she's my mum but then that year became really rough for me this anxiety got worse and it was constant really. Luckily I talked to some really great friends of mine and they reassured me that everything was gonna be okay and that this period would pass and they were just so supportive and checked up on me.

Recently it's been getting worse again and I don't wanna talk to those friends about it cus we aren't close anymore and I've got no one to turn to.

I don't want to talk to my mum about it because I know she'll say what she did before and even if she does believe me she'll feel so guilty and start crying about her childhood then I'll feel bad then she'll feel bad and it's a whole cycle.

I think I just want some people to talk to about it without judgement when I get this way."

Every time I think about them getting older or dying I have a full on breakdown. I can’t even fathom the idea of it, it ruins me. Every time I think about it nothing can distract me from it save intense pain. I’ve been hitting myself with a belt until it stops, but I know that isn’t even remotely healthy. Can anyone help me get over this?"

134,In need of guidance,"I have low self esteem. I always have every since I was younger i have had a wider body frame than my siblings but my family would joke and compare me to all the bigger people around me and associate me with them when I was honestly figured differently but thin. Somehow from that I developed anxiety and use to eat and cry to help relieve my emotions. It was the only way I knew how to. Somehow they would call me fat but I would tell myself I was skinny and needed to eat so I reversed what what actually going on with what was in my head. I would use spare change or my check to buy food everyday literally mcdonalds I still remember 7 McDoubles 4 small fries in one sitting everyday til I was tiered and full but still ate to cope with my emotions. 

Around this time also my mom told my Dr. about me crying for no reason and I was evaluated for depression and sent to a psychologist. I spent a long time this way feeling dark, sad, and alone. I dont know if it has to do with how I was raised in a over protective environment or the association of my low self esteem, toxic relationships, or past traumatic events. 

I know I'm all over the place but I really want to change the way i feel about my self and view the world. I have my morals and this causes conflict with me associating with the outside world beside those who know me. There seems to be very much tolerance for degrade and disrespect in society now in days and i witness through the use of social media so i stay away and find myself disliking people particularly women. 

Aside from this I find myself feeling like people just use me, take advantage of me, and try to come back when they realize there lost. I have for the longest had a very odd way of finding people to date me i dont feel its ever been proper how we meet. I have ways felt as if I been sexually pursued everytime and that has made me feel like i am incapable of being loved as much as i can. 

When I was younger from about 8 to 11 i was molested by my oldest sister. I never told anyone but growing up that effected my sexuality. I have after many times of it being ignored when I have brought it up she opened up that one of our cousins did it to her and she did not know why she did it to me. I suspected this but never understood why me... i never told my mom either I mentioned it but lied and said it was someone at school. One of my exs cousins sexually molested me. Guys at my previous job also sexually molested me and threatened me i was 16 or 17 at the time. I was to scared to ever open up it seem every guy always took advantage of me and I was always to scared to say anything. 

Growing up in a strict household my dad cheated on my mom and I became the monkey in the middle when that issue came up that he confessed and I was forced to travel to another country and meet with the other child and go with him to his DNA test. That changed things at home and affected our relationship with our parents cause all they did was argue. Besides that my dad has always worked hard to provide for us but has always struggled financially and its stressful at this point. Also my dad doesn't let me do anything is controlling judges everything I do say or who I meet. He always wants to be right I feel there is a lot I can say but the min goes a long way. He also is aggressive when mad and verbally abuse towards us and my mom always has been.

My mom always brings my dads cheating and had trauma from that i wanna keep this as short as possible. I went to a psychologist and stopped because I gained weight and well i was diagnosed with clinical depression i feel it come and go from time to time because sometimes the feelings or thoughts I have towards myself make me want to throw up. I am very simple and people always think im a lesbian it hurts my feelings because idk if I look masculine to them.

I would like to work on my self and invest more on me but i don't know where to begin or how to. I try to jump into things like for instance i just bought make up like if thats going to change anything. There is so much destruction I am so damaged traumatized but have fought through it to get through my career and carry on as nothing but inside of my head there is a disaster and I dont know what to do."

136,i don't know what i'm experiencing,"this is so hard to explain but i'll try my best.

sometimes i have these weird experience where everything feels like a dream that i am

not really in the world and i'm out of my body, but it's like my subconsciousness controls

my movements and what i have to do, but my consciousness is asleep and the world doesn't

feel real to me, but everything a dream, with this also sometimes i have these weird visualization of random events that might occur in my daily life like my house exploding or that my mom died, and these visualization feels really real, i try to get these out of my head but then if i think about other

visualization it will feel really real. it's like i lost control of my brain and it's acting by itself, like i'm not really controlling myself. i'm afraid that i might do something terrible and i'm not aware of it, that i lose control.

i mean, even writting this post is like i am  not myself writing it, but my subconscious on itself...

it's like my body is on auto-pilot.

138,My partner (26m) yelled at me/ blamed me (23f) for not appearing upset enough that i was raped,"My roommate raped me. My reaction is messed up and not normal. But it was my coping mechanism to just pretend nothing happened for 5 days and hang out with my roommate like i used to before telling my partner.  Ive been raped before and i have an avoidance reaction like this. I cried and yelled at my roommate a few hours after it happened and it was on my mind constantly for these 5 days. I was upset even if it didnt seem that way.  Anyway, when i told my partner he was mad at me and screamed ""fuck you"" at me repeatedly. He got mad when i complained about how expensive it would be to move out (i did move out and an staying in airbnb). I understand why he was upset,  but i think he should have been supportive.  I told him his reaction was traumatizing and he's mad that im more upset by his reaction than i am by being raped. I cant help how i feel. I was raped then blamed and yelled at by the person who should support me and am incredibly upset.

140,Need a friend right now,"So I just quit my first job after a day with a flooring company. Loved the people there, but the work just wasn’t for me. This caused my dad to flip and start a verbal attack like I’ve never experienced before. Some of the stuff insults he used should never be heard by a man’s son, let alone his teenage son who’s struggled his whole life. He told me I was basically a worthless quitter and to get out of his house and “go sleep under a bridge”, I’m very heavily paraphrasing mind you. I’ve had 4 suicide attempts before I even turned 18, and have struggled harder than they realize. I guess all my parents see me as is a quitter, and it really messed me up mentally to hear what my
dad really thought about me. I’ve never felt so unloved and outcast like I have today."
141,My reason for staying alive isn’t good enough for my girlfriend,"For a long time I’ve felt suicidal to some extent. I’m 21 now and I remember in grade 9 wishing I would get hit by a car on my way walking to school so I didn’t have to continue on. Lately my feelings have been more under control, but when I break I feel like I break really hard. I feel like if it wasn’t for the feeling that my son, three or four friends and my family would feel if I killed myself I would’ve done it already. I’m staying alive because I don’t want them to have to feel that. 
My girlfriend of 4 years has never really understood my feelings of overwhelming depression and anxiety, she says “our life isn’t that bad, you have nothing to be sad about”. for me I’m not sad about specific things, I just feel depressed about myself. Yesterday I hit my breaking point and expressed to her for the first time my feelings of wishing I was dead, and instead of her understanding she told me she thought that when I feel suicidal I should be thinking about the life I will miss with her and my son. How I will miss him walking for the first time and going to school and him talking. Of course I will miss that, but what difference does it make how I justify staying alive in the moment. She told me that me telling her that makes her feel shitty because she’s not enough for me to stay alive. I just don’t understand why it’s a fight she’s bothering to pick, why does it matter how I justify not dying. 
Maybe I’m in my head and she’s right and I’m not seeing it but any opinions are welcome, I just don’t get how she can chastise the way I dig myself out of the holes I’ve dug."
142,Sort of happy story to share with you all.,"I am a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 from the age of 19.

I discussed with my psychiatrist to sort of do a trial/probation experiment kind of thing to live my life with no medication after being on medication for 4 years. This is due to problems with energy levels, weight gain and libido. This was all in the period of time when COVID lockdowns got serious and the busy exam time for university was starting. It was all well for the first 2-3 weeks, until I realised some nights I couldnt sleep well and some nights I slept too long. Some days I would be super focussed and energetic and some days I would wake up feeing groggy and my body ached. 

I kept track of all these “symptoms” but didn’t think much about them and thought they would pass - and that they were just part or me transitioning off medication. 

On the day I submitted my last take home exam/assignment for uni, I called a mental health facility that is not a mental ward, but more of like a youth facility with 24/7 nurse on staff and occupational/group therapy classes during the day.

I Just got out of 6 days of “preventative mental health care” i volunteered myself to go. It was public government service so I didn’t pay anything. I am lucky I have a very good psychiatrist with a big reputation in my city. Funnily enough he actually recommended that I stay off medication, but i discussed with him to prescribe me medication to take if I feel like I need it. I got real close to a relapse, I thank my family members for recognizing early onset symptoms and the helpful and friendly staff at the facility. Better to prevent a problem than to fix a problem. Take care ya’all."

That happened about 5 hours ago but now I’m having an unprecedented fear of what’s to come: what the fuck i actually want to do with my life, what’s going to happen to my parents if I really am going to pursue education and ultimately life as a whole as well some country else, how much time do I have left with my parents and brother and cats.... I’m in my early to mid 20s, just graduated from uni January this year and am doing my first ever full time job ever, so it’s all new to me. I also always consider myself quite chill and cold-headed at the best of times but this instance is really bugging me off... I shed a tear or two but no more.

149,My best friend talked me off the ledge yesterday,"I’m on vacation right now and everything in my life hit a boiling point yesterday. 

I’ve been working nonstop for the last 2 years without a break. This isn’t your standard 9-5 weekends off kind of work, it is an insanely hectic and ever changing schedule as I work in the personal training industry. My days are more like 6am-9pm. 

I have built up an awesome client base of 30 clients and had to bust my tail end to do so, but it came at the expense of my mental health (which I ignored because work).

I also have a girlfriend who I love to death but I feel I have to be obligated to do everything for.

I also adopted a dog from the rescue but he ended up having severe separation anxiety so I was tied to my house when I wasn’t working or having him in daycare.

This all sounds extremely slight and nothing to push me past any kind of point. But in my mind, it felt like I had lost control of everything and anything around me.

Me, my girlfriend, and my mom were out at one of my favorite tourist places yesterday. I was looking forward to going to my favorite area of this tourist town but my mom and girlfriend were on a wine tasting trail and didn’t want to stop so I joined them for a bit. It ended up turning into a 2.5 hour thing and by the time they were on their last wine stop, I went to go get tickets for the destination I was speaking of before. I got there to get the tickets to find out they closed in 15 minutes and between the alcohol and other stressors, I finally hit my boiling point.

In that moment, I felt any kind of control I had over my life was gone and when that was compounded with alcohol, I started getting into an extremely bad headspace where I was heavily considering suicide. I’m a Christian and I had already said my prayers for forgiveness. I was just looking for the easiest way to do it.

I decided to call my best friend from college who has been in similar situations before and luckily he answered, was able to talk me through it, and I didn’t go through with anything. 

I’ve never been a point this bad before. I feel better this morning but am not completely “normal”, just not suicidal anymore. 

This isn’t so much a post asking for advice, I just wanted another place to vent to."
150,I just lost the most important person in my life I need advice please,"The love of my life just completely walked out, no explanation I had to find out from someone else that it was over. I’ve never loved someone as much as this person and I’m extremely antisocial I feel like i have no one else. They aren’t responding and apparently they never loved me in the first place. Someone please give me advice I’m extremely heartbroken and I don’t know what to do I just don’t want to believe it’s real"
151,My mind,"My mind is a prison.

The worst of all is that I’ve been thinking of taking all the rivotril and lamictal in for me to fall into deep sleep and won’t wake up anymore.

I am so tired of fooling myself that I can still work in my toxic department. I cannot meet their criterias enough, and it’s pressuring me to the bones. Even just taking a restroom break is hard and it will be deducted to your 15 minutes breaks.

Not to mention the toxic customers I always talk to everyday.

Since the start of quarantine here in Manila, and as I get through the weeks of just being at home, doing my job, working at home set up is even more toxic that working at the office. Home is supposed to be my safe haven from troubles, doubts, fears and pressure and this invisible enemy that everyone is fighting off made it worse for us, especially for the people who have mental health issues.

I cannot pretend that I can work anymore. The job, and all the requirement is too toxic for me to handle. I once tried asking my supervisor if they could let me apply to a department that I could handle. That won’t make me pressured or will at least let me go to the bathroom and wash away the bad things in my stomach without thinking of a time pressure.

She said no. It’s because we have a shortage of people in that department.

Of course no one knows that I have been struggling mentally because I do not want them to think that I am incapable of doing something relevant. I mean, just hearing that you are depressed makes someone think that you just get over with it. So, this is not what I told to my head about the reason why I want to apply to another department.

I am just going through because I am saving up to pay the mortgage my Mom can’t afford to finish. I am saving up as well for my application going to New Zealand so that I could meet my dad. But what goes in my head right now says that I should wuit my job because I know that I can’t do it anymore.

Now, I am very much contemplating whether I resign or not. If I do, where will I go? What job can I apply that could help lessen the stress and the pressure I am in? I am only for for customer service because that’s the skill I have gained. If I do find one, it may be the same all over again.

If I don’t, how much of it could I take?

My mind is like a prison right now. I am scared to tell this to my mom, but I am so desperate to break the railings and tell what I think about the process and the requirements they give to us to the highest person.

Maybe what I though about this company is wrong. They are not into people. It’s going to be BAU as always.

It’s wednesday and I still have 2 days to get through a struggle. I have diarrhea, and I am thinking of taking all those medicine to put me into deep sleep so that I will not wake up again. This pandemic really sucks big time. It made everyone worse.

It made me feel worse. I do not know if I could go through for the next days."

166,Trying hard to find the will to live,"Tldr : Clinically depressed 22 yo dealing with anhedonia, financial issues, academic issues, suicidal thoughts, self harm, and now a break/breakup from a 3 year old relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

A little introduction about me. I \[22M\] an Indian student from a lower middle class family. I've been in a relationship with my best friend for the past three years. Since Feb 2019, things have begun to fall apart for me. I live with my mom and dad and rely on their income to get through. Apart from their monthly income, we do not have any savings or assets to survive, in case something goes wrong. I am stuck at a college learning a course I have zero interest or talent in, and regularly gets humiliated by my professors and other teaching assistants. I am told that I suffer from anhedonia. I am someone who's extremely extroverted and constantly acts as a jolly person in public. My girlfriend is the only one who knows the struggles I go through and always supported me. I on the other hand showed my fragile side only to her.

Since lockdown, my parents aren't getting paid properly and things are actually starting to get really bad at home. My dad is a private employee and has only 8 months of service left. I will have to start earning immediately after I graduate in 2021 April to compensate for this and keep things going smoothly. As I mentioned, I am terrible at what I am learning and there is absolutely no chance I am gonna get a decently paying job by then. Also, due to several other and more intense issues in the family, both my mom and dad are also extremely depressed and are no longer their normal self. I am forced to take care of my family's mental health, while taking care of my own with a doctor without their knowledge, deal with the pressure bestowed on my head regarding earning for the family, suffer from insomnia and lack of appetite and suicidal tendencies and also occasional self harm, and my girlfriend has also left me. I can't blame her for deciding not to be with a depressed person because I don't remember the last time I shared a laugh with her. She has half heartedly agreed to talk to me in August after a 3 month break, although I am pretty sure she has made up her mind never to take me back again.

168,My colleague wrote about a Roman emperor’s philosophy to improve mental health,"The article explains **4 different time-tested coping techniques** from Roman emperors to **reduce anxiety** and **improve mental health** and live life more fully and calmly.

I especially like the third technique: *using pain as the driver of progress*. The article explains that pain can harm us only when we wallow in it and allow our emotions to injure us at a much deeper level. By facing the pain and accepting unpleasant emotions instead of fighting them, we can not only reduce stress and anxiety, but we can also thrive with our emotional state.

169,Urgently in Need of Help,"I have finally built up the courage to reach out for help, but the therapist I’m trying to get an appointment with isn’t returning my calls. I’ve been on edge terrified to talk for two days now, but I’m still determined to talk to somebody. 

I really need to talk to a professional immediately before I get too scared again and just suffer in silence for another year. Does anyone have any resources they can share? I’m in the US."
170,How do I deal with a close friend constantly ranting to me every day?,"My friend has been going through a rough patch in her life to the point where she’s talking about suicide (refuses any kind of help and gets angry at me for suggesting) she’s VERY depressed... and rants (not vents) the same exact thing every single day and then just leaves. 

I send messages (this is online via telegram) saying “sorry” “that sucks” etc to the point where I feel like a broken record. I have high anxiety anytime I talk to her now and get depressed because she’s no longer a friend I can come to for support but just someone who dumps her problems on me and talks about killing herself.

I’m very very afraid to say that her ranting is too much because she’ll get ANGRY at me and assume I’m just like everyone in her life and she’ll stop being my friend. I have abandonment issues and i dont want that to be the case...

The pandemic has made life rough for everyone but it’s taken an especially hard toll on her. Losing her job is made her family make her useless, she’s very depressed, having bouts of paranoia... constantly listening to the same exact rants every single day since June is going to make me depressed or say something wrong... She’s also been very contradicting too saying things like “I won’t talk to strangers anymore” then “strangers are more of a family than my own family.”

I don’t know what to do this is severely impacting my mental health.

FYI: She lives in California and I live in Ohio.
Also, she’s on antidepressants (not even a week old yet though) and sees a therapist over the phone."
171,TW ⚠️ Self harm and telling my mom,"Two days ago, I told my mom about my mental health situation and my self harm. This took every ounce of willpower I had. I had at least what I would call a breakdown or episode before and I was freaking out. I told her, she was supportive. Two days later and she's back to being mean. I don't know and I feel so awful like she doesn't care. She started yelling at me today and I went upstairs and harmed myself. As I was doing so my dog came from downstairs and started licking my ankles and I feel really bad about it."
172,alternative resources to access support other than the doctor ?,"My friends and parents think I’m bipolar, I’m 17. Basically experiencing really bad depression after being crazy spontaneous, staying up all night doing art and cleaning and spending all my money. Now I can’t get out of bed, in a really bad place; suicidal thoughts all that lovely stuff, rang the doctor yesterday she just told me to go to online helplines and if it’s still bad in September she’ll look at prescribing me meds as I’ve been through cbt multiple times. I just wanna ask if there’s any alternatives I could do at the moment because I can’t stand this depression and would love some support right now but don’t know how to get it ???"

174,Scared for my parent's marriage,"Hey, a little bit of context:
I'm 15 years old with two younger siblings (8 and 12). My parents have been married for about 16 years, and I have never been too close with them. They have been arguing for the past few months, and they are no longer sleeping in the same bed. This really hit me, and it's been getting worse.

Earlier today I was studying when I heard yelling and crashing coming from the bathroom upstairs. My mum stormed out, grabbed her bag and left the house without telling me or my siblings anything. My dad went looking for her, and nearly two hours later, they came back, saying that they ""went to the chemist to pick up some meds"". I know they lied but I don't want to speak up.

I'm now sitting in my bedroom, scared to come out and talk to them. My siblings are oblivious but I'm really stressed, shaking and feeling faint.

Any advice on how to cope with this could really help. I want to speak out but I'm worried I'll make the situation worse."
175,I’m so lost,"I need to stop smoking weed and drinking. But idk how. Life isn’t even that bad sober, I think it’s better, I just have such low motivation and no willpower. Like every solution I try ends up not working or I fail at some point. I solve one problem and I’m left with another and always, always end up right back at square one. I guess I need to just keep building myself up from square one until the day I die. It sucks though, to be constantly let down. Happiness is fleeting and so rare that it just makes me even more sad because I always come crashing down and spend all my time missing how my life used to be. I need to work on being more present and mindful but like...my life feels like a blur...there’s so many things I need to do but can’t bring myself to do any of them...I need to get all this shit out of my house and make it look nice, fix up a ton of stuff and redo my room...find a job...start working out and eating healthy every day and stop using substances and I wanna do more reading and art and I wanna study more bla bla...I wanna take better care of myself and get new clothes and a new life but I barely know where to start. Idk right now I feel hopeless but I have 2 months to flip it all around I think I can do it. I just feel so awful right now."
176,How did you get the confidence to see someone about how you're feeling?,"I'm almost ashamed of how I'm feeling. I worry about stuff all the time, whether it's having to have a phone call or talking to a worker in a supermarket. I just hate how I feel, and I'm embarrassed about it to be honest. Sometimes I have days where I don't worry about stuff too much, and other days I feel so miserable that I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. How do you get the confidence to see someone about how you're feeling?"

But as soon as it comes to me being alone with lots of time on my hands, I am extremely sad and feel very depressed.
I have taken a month off work just to give myself a break and I am struggling a lot with being alone. My partner has recently joined an exercise class he goes to twice a day which has turned his life around completely and I'm just here feeling really, really low and terrible about myself.
I do nothing during the days. Friends are studying or working which is fine I don't want to need to see friends. I need to feel better about being alone but I can't. 
What on earth is wrong with me. I will be studying next year but until then, what can I do? How do I enjoy my three weeks off instead of using it to feel extremely bad about myself.
I must add that I am joining a sports game once a week but I still feel unaccomplished and I dont exactly have many hobbies..."
181,That thing when you actively catch yourself repressing emotions?,"
As in, you just had an argument with a parent whom you love very much but they are endangering themselves and you start crying. But you know the constricted feeling in your chest when you feel deep grief? It’s not there. 

Your tears feel superficial so you take off your face mask, there’s no need for it where you currently are anyway and relax your facial muscles. You are still walking around redfaced and bleary eyed but it feels like the mask you just took off, it will go away soon.

But here’s the thing: Your rational mind tells you that the reason you were crying actually warrants it. Your parent has an undiagnosed condition and they are too afraid to seek out a doctor and it has the potential to be very serious. It has been going on for months now.

So why, even writing this post out now, remembering in vivid detail the way they lashed out because they’ve had enough of you worrying and pushing them to go to the hospital, do you not feel anything? Sadness, anger, whatever?

But you are too young and too sheltered for mental conditions. You live a good life, always have, in a big house, with both parents in the picture and many friends and good grades as well. Add to that that you haven’t even reached your second decade. 

You feel ridiculous. You rationalize.

Whatever happens, even if your parent doesn’t go to the hospital as soon as possible and their pains worsen, the healthcare in this country is good. Will help. Always does.

Everything is fine in your life and always will be, so why the fuck are you pussyfooting around, too lazy or too stupid or too much of a pussy to confront yourself, to make sense of why you just don’t feel like feeling anything? Don’t feel like watching a movie or reading or going on youtube because there will be people, situations and stories and all of that means you’ll have to get involved emotionally? Is that normal, will it go away?

Everything seems so silly in retrospect, there are  older people with actual problems out there but still. I think of how, when I thought of my parent refusing help, I thought of how I am so done with the situation and if their condition worsens, I won’t care because it is their own fucking fault. And I don’t feel anything about thinking that and that should scare me but it doesn’t."
182,Please help me understand this illness,"I have a friend with schizo-affected bipolar disorder and I am really struggling to understand this illness. I feel like I get bipolar, but I have little to know understanding of schizophrenia. This persons illness has put an enormous strain on myself and everyone else trying to help them and I feel as though I am at the end of my rope.  


Here's what I can't grasp. This person (during a manic episode) will express literal murderous thoughts. Talking and posting online about wanting to bleach the earth, kill everyone and start over, posting about guns and stuff. It's pretty scary at it's worst. I've had to personally call the police on them for a welfare check, and when the cops show up it's like they can ""flip a switch,"" - almost like when you're drunk at a high school party and you have to pretend to be sober for a few minutes to talk your way out of trouble with cops or your parents or something. This person will convince the police they are fine, and go right back to being unstable. I've seen this person be admitted to psychiatric facilities and it's the same thing. As soon as they're in front of a physician, they seem to ""flip the switch"" and convince everyone they're fine. Then they walk out and go right back to destroying their life.   


This has all made helping this friend, as you can imagine, a seriously difficult task. The other problem is, admittedly, this person was kind of a garbage person before they ever got sick. Always thought they were the best/smartest/funniest person in the room, had a huge ego, never took help from everyone and has a demonstrated history of lying to avoid consequences. Couple that with refusing to make lifestyle changes, attempt to apologize or rebuild bridges that they burn during their episodes, I mean you see where this is all going.   


So here's what I'm really wrestling with - what I can't wrap my head around :: How is there a mental illness where one of the symptoms or facets of the illness is behaving like you're healthy to avoid getting in trouble?? I am 100% not trying to be sarcastic, I am genuinely upset, confused, frustrated and I cannot understand how this works. I want to believe that if someone can just act normal when they realize they need to, that they could just act normal when ever they want to. But obviously, mentally ill people can't do that - that's why they're mentally ill. Please help me grasp this, I am frustrated to the point of tears."

184,How COVID-19 WFH Measures Are Affecting Your Mental Health and How You Can Maintain Your Sanity,"One day we were at work with no worries. Then out of nowhere, Coronavirus took the country by storm. Offices and schools were abruptly closed, businesses were shut down, flights were cancelled, and we transitioned to a remote work environment. At first, it seemed great! No commute every day saved us time and money. Not having to deal with our boss in-person. Spending more time with family.


Then after a month or so, many started missing being in the office. There’s something to be said about getting out of the house every day and having social encounters with others. Being exposed to new environments and meeting new people keeps us agile and fresh. Even outside of a professional setting, being cooped up prevents us from trying new restaurants, hitting the town and traveling.

185,At that moment I knew I was going crazy...,
186,Im concerned for my brothers mental health,"
My brother is suffering from depression and I’m not sure what to do. Lately he’s been having issues coping with where he is in life. He just turned 25 a few days ago and he lives in a small town working at a crappy job where he doesn’t know many people. His boss is extremely racist and he can’t seem to get a better job despite constantly applying to several. His relationship with his girlfriend is coming to an end and he commonly feels as if he’s failed at life. My parents told him to quit his job and live with us but they tend to be emotionally abusive. I was trying to give him some space for a little while but noticed that he started trying to begin conversations with me to distract him from his problems, but I didn’t notice in the beginning . I had accidentally text him the other night thinking I was sending the message to someone else which prompted a conversation. He responded with a negative and self deprecating joke. I asked him if he was okay to which he responded that he’ll be fine.  I started talking about how guys tend not to seek therapy because of the idea that they can “tough it out”. He had lost access to the school counselor after graduating, so he doesn’t really have anyone. I talked to him about seeing an online therapist. He seemed extremely open to the idea so I sent him some resources including some that are targeted towards his race and gender. I feel like I should do more but I’m not sure what I can. I’m an 18 year old girl who has struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, but I didn’t have anyone meaning that I’m not sure what’s the best way to react in this situation. What should I do?"
187,"When my father touches me, I feel so disgusting. I just want to tear my skin off.","As much as I love him I also dislike my father. I understand he is not a good parent and not much of a good person either. There's almost endless reasons for me to hate him but I can't say that I do. This morning he woke me up, hitting me. everywhere.
I was lying on my stomach so I couldn't do anything. He did it as if it was the most normal thing in the world, but I felt so disgusting. I can still feel his hands all over. It makes me want to scratch my skin raw, or rip it to shreds with a blade anywhere I still feel him. I'm used to being disrespected and treated poorly by him, alongside the other members of my household, (I honestly think he doesn't know how to not be that way, he really just thinks it's normal) but this time I think I just snapped. I know my mother would probably get rid of him if I asked, I know she cares a lot about my well being and mental health. But I'm scared to tell her, I don't want us to be financially burdened or tasked with the stress that comes with divorce. But I'm so tired of being scared to live in my own household. I really just want to take this feeling away."
188,I might be bad at having friends (keeping relationships),"I'm already looking for a therapist for professional help on this, but as I need to find one I can trust and pay for, that might take a little while, so I came here ask you guys just to see if this is actually a thing.

I work as a ESL and Japanese teacher, and have always been very charismatic. I'm the one who's always smiling and was always able to make new friends very easily, but I only kept one or two around, and for that I always told myself I just preferred a few good friends I could focus on over a lot of friends I weren't so close to. 

Lately (during the quarantine and before it) I've been realizing I just don't consider anyone to be my friend. I have my students and plenty of people I care about and I know they care about me, but I just don't feel close to them at all. This has been getting worse and worse until it got to the point I don't really want to talk to anyone anymore. I'm starting to feel like it's easy to make friends, but I just can't keep them.  I do meet a lot of new people and spend hours talking to them on discord channels and the internet in general, but that initial conversation is as far as it goes for me, no matter how much I like that new person.

I'm a very practical person and I've always like only doing things that have a very clear purpose to me and being as objective as possible with my actions, but I think this has been contaminating my social skills. I never start conversations because I have nothing important to say, I never ask people how they are because I don't really care (as in I know they're probably alive and well or I'd have heard about it and if they needed my help they'd just ask, as pretty much everyone I know knows I'll come to their aid no matter what), I never ask anyone to play games with me because I feel like it would just be too much work (although I don't really understand how playing a game for 30 mins could be ""too much work"").

 It got to the point where I only talk to my students and that's for classes and whenever anyone tries to reach out I answer with ""yes"", ""no"", ""ooh wow"", ""that sucks"", ""really?"" Or ""Ok"". I can't keep the conversation going because that also feels without purpose and kind of useless.

My question is: is that a thing??? I hear a lot about people not making friends because they don't like socializing and meeting new people is stressful, but I have no problem making new friends and I love meeting new people, but I can't get a relationship after that initial talk."
189,When should I turn to hospitalization?,"I’ve been in a depressed slump for a bit over three weeks now. I went to a smash room on Sunday which trigger something in me and I keep crying and can’t seem to control any of my emotions for the past four days now. I currently see a therapist once a week on Tuesdays and it didn’t really help to see him yesterday and I’m still in my out of control emotions. My close family are worried about me doing something to myself and my I think my therapist is too, he gave me crisis lines to call and said if I think it’s bad enough to go to an emergency room and tell them I’m a danger to myself. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on what I should do. Should I consider checking myself in?  I know I could never ever do anything bad to myself but my emotions have gone way past getting the best of me. 
Thanks everybody."
190,What can this mean?,"I have this thing that's been going on for pretty much my whole life. I see things all the time, mostly tentacles and stuff. I never stand with my back towards the mirror because I see things in it too. I see weird crazy stuff that don't actually exist all the time. I thought that it's just imagination but I thought maybe I should ask. Also, whenever I sleep, I think that I don't close my eyes because I see the same things- tentacles and stuff- whenever I sleep, and when I try to wake up I can't. I try to run away but it won't work. 

I don't know if this is a place to ask such a weird question, but any response is appreciated."

It’s to help us realize we need help with mental health problems until we seek help. For some reason, a small amount of people have this until one day they wake up to the help they need and deserve. 

I don’t think it’s always around mental health but mental health isn’t a joke and it plays a big role our lives.

Everyone just says - ""Just focus on what's good"" when there's nothing ""good"" left in my life anymore.

196,Please Help I need guidance,"Okay here is the deal. 

I really dont where to go with this. I have a girlfriend. She has extreme anxiety to the point where she has to lock herself in my bathroom, panic attacks to the point where she goes into a sort of mode where she attempts to act like everything is okay but really her world is collapsing, and depression where she thinks about suicide very frequently.

Every attempt i make seems to backfire. I constantly try to comfort her and suggest things, but she always tells me ill never understand her and no one will. Its almost like she hates me for trying.

She is constantly stressed about certain things so I try to identify her stressors and eliminate them the best i can.

I want so badly to find out how to make her happy, but she says no one (even me) can make her happy. But she loves me to death, takes care of me, spoils me, and all that great stuff. Its confusing and genuine.

I need to know how to best handle her from someone who has similar issues like her.

How do i approach you? How do i help? How do i anything?

Im so bad at this, but there is nothing more i want in the world than to be someone she can fully open up to and rely on. I need her to understand that im on her side and her 1 safe place she can come to.

How?"

I’m not suicidal at the moment, but I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past. The lady who prescribed me citalopram said that I might become suicidal, but I don’t really understand- If I do become suicidal, when should I expect it? Like, is the highest risk after a few days? Weeks? When do I know I’m safe &amp; that it works? What do I do if they end up making me suicidal? I’m assuming I can’t just stop taking it."
199,Borderline Personality Disorder question,"Hi, I think I may have BPD, but I looked at the symptoms and I don't think I have all of them. A majority but like, I don't have substance abuse, I mean I feel like if I started I may, but my mom's an alcoholic so I don't even allow myself to get drunk. And I've tried weed and such but have never been too fond of it.

My mood can switch from happy to depressed really fast, but I don't think I have ""Explosive anger."" I mean sometimes I get in that mood where EVERYTHING pisses me off, but it's so occasional that I feel like I hide it well, I mean I don't know if I actually do, but I don't blow up at people even though I want to sometimes.

But everything else is yes

abandonment, unstable relationships, I idolize people that i shouldn’t and lean on them and rely too much on them. unclear self-image, I mean it’s pretty clear, I hate myself, but like unclear of what I want to do in life, goals and identity stuff.

Self destructive behavior/self-harm yes.

I mean I know it isn't a hard you need X, Y, and Z to ""qualify"" (for lack of a better term) for this, but like, are the ones I don't have indicators that I may not have it?"
200,I've got nothing about me," 

Err, this is just a vent / rant - not asking for advicing.

I've not done anything, not gone anywhere, not had any experiences... i dont even have people to talk to openly. My life is shit, proper shit. It's just so fucking frustration. It's been so fucking shit for so long, this has psychologically damaged me. I've been in self imposed exile

Everytime I think about ""bouncing back"" I..overthink? and just I don't think I can socialise like normal people and it's all my fault, due to the life choices I made.

don't have a past at all...nothing to talk about, I don't want to ever talk about it. I want to erase my past. I keep on playing the story back in my head, idk if it's coz i have no one to talk to and don't know how to talk, but I keep trying to figure out why I'm like this. Why do i think so deep? Or about a scenario that's 5 steps ahead in my mind.

I want something about me, i want to be interesting. I want to be successful.

I'm 24 but I feel like I'm , at max, 19. 16 year olds have more experiences then me. It's sad. I feel like I'm trapped..I have this tension in me that isnt going away, ik i need to move and i probably will soon but rn man...it's just not a good feeling im feeling

Everyone around me has dropped all expectations of me. It's like I have a mental illness, but i dont. I'm cognitively fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if it's because I quit masturbating, now for 250+ days, but I've been getting this intense feeling of realisation. I see that the problem is greater than I thought. I don't know shit about life or anything...I've missed out of so many conversations. I have no street knowledge. Like, If listen to an interview and someone's talkng about a situation or what they did in the past, I try to imagine how I'd cope in the situation... I'd be stuck.

But it sucks, I feel like I'm gonna be playing catchup with my own expectation of what I should be like at X age. It's a twisted mentality. I don't want to play catchup, but it feels like I'm lagging further and further behind in a race I didn't sign up for.

Life just coast me by, thankfully I'm 24/ soon to be 25... I know I make it sound that i feel like im too old, but I do feel it's reversable. I do feel like I can be somewhat normal and achieve what i want to achieve / when / how i wanna acheive it, especially with the aid of long term therapy, but right now...it just feels like the journey is gonna be bumpy for a long time."

• i have a great fear of accidentally hurting, injuring or killing someone because i have horrible anger outbursts over nothing. (this makes me afraid to have close relationships, kids, and pets)

• i also have very low self esteem, and constantly look for reassurance, and when i don’t get that it makes me uneasy.

• i avoid people in social situations, and will not attend events, skip meals, take longer paths to my destination, etc to avoid people (this comes and goes in waves)

• i have thought abt doing horrible things to myself, and even performing some, but i have never been in anything that can be considered as a depressive state since my lows only last for a few days

so i just recently got a new therapist and he said i could always text him if i felt bad or was going to do something that isnt so smart. but i get really bad anxiety about texting people, especially about something so sensitive. i've been to his office about 2 times and i really do trust him, but my anxiety is stopping me from asking for help because i keep almost relapsing into my old habits. he knows i used to harm myself and i really dont want to do it and i think that if this week goes on as it has been i should really shoot him a text for a convo or an appointment. i already have on planned on monday but still. can you guys please help me with this, should i even text him? or can you guys help me get a lil more encouragement? please?"
206,"Gf and I said goodbye after a really fun day, now I want to cry","It feels like a dependant and non-healthy trait. I just love her so much and I cant imagine what I'll do or how I'll be happy without seeing her. We live far apart and I wont get to see her for a while. I feel like the goodbye wasnt enough and I just need a 30min hug from her. Literally breaking from tears right now, is this normal?"
207,Do I really need therapy?,"So a bit of backstory here: I kinda faked having depression and an eating disorder to get attention and because I was bored and needed a new way to behave. Thing is that I was so good that I convinced numerous Doctors and Psychologists and landed myself in a clinic. Fast forward to now, I am forced by my parents to take therapy sessions even though the reasons for being there in the first place were faked, so I actually have nothing to talk about, really. And my therapist shares my opinion. She said that she can't force me to partake in sessions against my own will. But I was also told that she finds me interesting and I don't know why. After some talking we find out that I am constantly bored, have little to know interests, as well as friends, no emotional connection to friends or most people and generally shallow emotions, and the fact that I dont mind having no friends and thus being alone. But that's nothing to be concerned about really, since it doesn't manifest itself as a problem to me, meaning that no therapy is necessary. And since there are no problems I am aware of that needed to be talked about, I asked my parents if they know of something that's worth mentioning to the therapist except, of course, the stuff that I faked. Now, what I didn't expect was, that they got upset upon me asking them. My mom said she didn't feel good in this didn't want to talk about it, which i dont really understand the reason as to why, and my dad just got angry and said that, because I faked it I needed the therapy even more. I dont understand that tbh. Also my therapist and parents always insist that there is some deeper reason or motivation behind my acts, which I dont believe to be true. For example my mom doesn't believe me that I am okay with being alone, that some time ago I was always together with other kids etc. and my therapist doesn't understand why my grades fot progressively bad (I just got lazy). So to conclude, there is nothing behind all of this, and they somehow can't seem to accept that I sometimes just act logically and am not always driven by some unconcious emotion or whatever Freudian theory may come to their mind. 
And since it's all logical, there are no problems, at least that's what I think. But it would still be interesting to hear some other opinions."
208,What do you think life is like for people who don’t struggle with mental illness at all?,"I think about this often...I know we all have our struggles, but I still wonder what’s it like to never have to deal with mental illness every single day of your life. Just interested to hear people’s thoughts."
209,An experience at a mall,"I was at the mall with my mom and brother and while going to one of the restaurants I started panicking for some reason, I all I told myself was ‘everything’s real everything’s fake’ this repeated until we got in the restaurant, I usually scratch my head when stressed like this but I didn’t wanna cause a scene, mom thought I was crying because I didn’t wanna talk to the waiter, just listened to music to calm down, I don’t know wht happened, did I have a panic attack?"
210,I am unlovable,"I have been doing everything I can to meet someone and find some modicum of happiness, but after hundreds of attempts, not even one woman has expressed any interest in talking to me. Maybe I need to accept that I am just destined to be alone and miserable. I genuinely think that it would be better if I was just dead. No one cares about me and I wouldn't be in pain anymore if I was dead."
211,Had an uncomfortable experience with a guy and I feel like I have no one else to tell about it right now,"Some context: 
I'm a 23f and in April me and my bf of 10 years broke up. I was living with him, and now I live with parents again. I got a job and a delivery driver, and I made friends with one of the male drivers. I could tell he was crushing on me, but I wasnt interested in him or starting a relationship.  He also knows I just had a bad break up. 

Disclaimer: I talk about things graphically because I really need to vent 

Recent events: 
I've been hanging out with him more, because we both like to smoke. I was at his house on Sunday and he made a move, and I told him I wasnt ready for anything serious. That if we did anything it would just be casual. I'm not over my previous relationship, but I figured a hook up would be okay. He said he was fine with that. We started to fool around, but there was some red flags. Like I personally like things a little rough, but I've never mentioned this to him before. He was really aggressive, shoving fingers in my mouth, grabbing things too hard, choking, and slapping . We didnt have sex that day, I was on my period, and things just felt weird. Like sniffing my hair constantly, the way he would talk about me, and his fingers after touching me. 

Last night he texted me asking if I wanted to smoke and i was down with it. We parked his car in a secluded place and smoked a bunch. I was already drunk too because I was drinking before he invited me out. I was fucked up and he started to make a move on me. Saying shit like how much he missed me and I just started feeling uncomfortable with the way he would say it. 
Things started to feel bad when he would choke me harder than before, even slapping my neck and face and grabbing me really hard. He fingered me and the way he did it hurt, so I said I didn't want that. He stopped doing that for like a minute and then randomly shoved them in again. I said ow and he was like ""sorry I just couldn't resist""  
He started asking if I wanted to come over Sunday. I was still feeling pretty fucked up but I was able to respond that I might be doing something that day, that i might have other plans. A minute or two later he said to me that i was not going to have plans that day that i was going to come over and have ""the best sex of our lives"" he practically growled that last part while grabbing me hard.  
All my off feelings about it made me start to panic and I didnt feel safe so I told him I wanted to go home.  He took me home and is keep apologizing but I just feel gross now. Like I consented,  but things  dont feel right. I wish I had someone to talk about this with but the people I talk with used to be friends with my ex, and I feel like I would be judged for fooling around with someone else. 
Maybe I'm overreacting, but they way he talked and did things just felt obsessive and off some how. 
Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but it's really hurting my mental state. I already have depression and am grieving my old relationship, and now I feel really anxious and gross."

213,Probable psychotic break resulting in ER visit; had issues communicating with staff,"This is a LONG read, and I apologize. I just think hearing a story like this would have helped me, so I wanted to share a tough experience. 


June 30th was an intense day for me. 

Full disclosure, I am a 35 year old woman diagnosed with bipolar 1, OCD, and BPD. I have had that diagnosis for about 5 years, and am currently on three daily medications (I’m unsure about listing that here, is that ok? I guess just message me if you want to know what I take), after trying 2-3 to find the right combination. 

Or so I thought. I’ve always had an uphill battle, because for the entirety of my adult life I was a functioning alcoholic who was unmedicated. I had been told in college that I needed serious help, but I literally laughed it off, insisting that medication would “change me”, and as an actress I couldn’t be “compromised” (obviously this is stupid and naive, but I was 19). Somewhere around this time, I had what I now believe to be my first psychotic break, or neurotic displacement as it’s sometimes called. My body felt completely numb but also tense and tingly, I had an extremely high heart rate, drenched in sweat, and could not be convinced that anything around me was real, including myself. I somehow ended up in a friend’s room, who then called an ambulance. When they arrived, I completely blacked out and apparently tensed up completely, with my eyes open (I don’t recall this part). I was also seeing colors and hearing things that weren’t there, but I couldn’t understand it wasn’t real. The paramedics said I had too much caffeine, and left. I had taken caffeine pills earlier (this was the beginning of my drug experimentation), but not nearly as many as they seemed to think, certainly not anything that would amount to poor than a panic attack. But I believed them, because I didn’t know about disassociation or anything back then. 

Finally, 11 years later, I got a proper psychological evaluation and began correct medications. I wasn’t exhibiting any hallucinations or anything, so it didn’t come up, and I didn’t think to bring up the earlier “attack” because I thought it was more of an overdose. It seemed like I was at least pointed in the right direction, and for the first time a doctor sat and patiently listened to me and I didn’t feel judged or shameful at all. 

Cut to this past Tuesday, June 30, at 3am. I’d been slightly more panicky than usual, and also in a 3-4 month deep depressive period, with an unusual amount of disorganization, weakness, loss of memory, and even some agoraphobia which I’ve never felt (I’m an actress, remember; I love to see people). I knew something was off but I was too bogged down to understand how bad I’d gotten. All of a sudden, a thought hit me almost like lightning, as if everything was suddenly clear. I realized I was an absolute complete piece of garbage, utterly useless and accomplishing nothing and a shameful person to be around. I saw my room—the clothes, the dishes, the mess, the art strewn everywhere, half-read books—and it was like the filthy den of some hideous unknown creature. I began cleaning, frenzied and erratic, picking things up and putting them back down, moving clothes from a pile to a basket, attempting to “clean” but knowing it was too much. Then I felt tension in my shoulders, they seized and I couldn’t lower them. My left eye began to sag shut, I couldn’t feel my face. My legs began to tremble and seize, everything was numb. I used my phone to try to look up something, anything, I was just typing in weird nonsensical searches, but couldn’t read the screen, the letters were out of order and seemed a completely foreign language. 

This was when I realized I needed help. I got my parents (truly, bless them), and I genuinely completely thought I was having either a stroke or Bell’s Palsy, but I could only use certain words, I couldn’t form complete thoughts. I remember making my mom hold my hand in the car, and asking her to ask me questions, just keep talking to me, though now I can’t recall anything other than holding her hands and feeing numb head to toe. 

At the ER, I told them I thought I was having a stroke, but the woman just laughed. She got my license from me and asked if I have insurance, which I don’t. At this point she stopped asking questions, got a wheelchair (I could no longer walk, my arms and legs were seized completely and trembling), and brought me to a room. I was crying but trying to talk, but I couldn’t make a complete thought. It felt as though there was a “hump” , like my thoughts were a car and there was a speed bump I couldn’t get over, and I just kept rolling back. I don’t know how else to describe it. At this point, the hallucinations kicked in full force. I heard talking, music, and could see vivid colors all over, I swore there was an elf in one of the vents, or a fae. I was telling the staff that nothing was real, but I knew that was wrong, but there was nothing they could say to convince me. 

They then began to ask me “what I was on”, which I thought meant medication, which I’d thought to bring because I couldn’t say the names at the moment. Then the doctor repeated that, implying drugs. I told him I’d had nicotine and thc, and he seemed sort of...indignant? I was hallucinating but I remember feeling that, he then asked me if I brought it, but I didn’t because I literally have at least some thc daily, and have for years (it’s one of the only things that helps me sleep and have an appetite, and doesn’t interact with my medication and hasn’t before). They took an EKG and said my heart was fine, but I just had to “wait for it to wear off”, then dosed me with Ativan and left me alone in the room. I cried for someone to come back, but they said they couldn’t stay, and left me alone again. They’d asked me multiple times if I felt suicidal, and I said yes, but they still left me alone. 

After 2 hours, they came in, told me to get dressed, handed me a stack of papers, and told me where the exit was. I was still completely out of it, barely able to walk, and confused. I had at some point texted my parents to get me, which I don’t remember doing. I wandered outside, just aimlessly through the parking lot, not sure of what I was looking for until I saw my mom and dad. From there, I went home and tried to begin to make sense of what was happening. 

It’s been a little over a day, and I’ve tried to attack this head on. I made an immediate appointment to my regular doctor, to make sure all my meds were updated and to get a referral to a psychiatrist. I had the hard talk with my family that I know this is out of my control now and I need professional help to get better, and that the disorganization, the inability to care for myself, the not eating, etc, were actually symptoms of something bigger, rather than causes (my parents seemed to think if I just cleaned up I’d be cured). My doctor was amazing and helpful, as well as the pharmacists today getting everything organized so I was up to date. Hopefully the psychiatrist will be able to help me find answers, and come up with a comprehensive plan to work on my mental health. 

Other than the obvious burning shame and guilt surrounding the entire incident and my mental health in general, I am so concerned with how my ER visit went. I am not violent, I’ve never hurt anyone else physically, but I have very much harmed myself before, and would have again, without any concern because it “wasn’t real”, but the staff didn’t seem concerned. I could very much clearly see how someone in that state could kill or hurt another person, simply because it does NOT seem real. I also didn’t understand what they were doing or why, or why they wouldn’t listen that “my brain was bleeding”. I am so thankful they were able to help me, but if I was a less self-aware person, or less informed about my situation, I don’t think it would have gone even that well. They simply thought I was “tripping”, and needed to “come down”. I understand that concern, but I have absolutely no doubt that perhaps the thc was a trigger, but it was not an underlying cause. 

I now realize the mental health system in this country is not only broken, it’s nonexistent. At the ER of course they just want to save your life, and that is their job, but I could have used someone trained to help, to communicate with me in a way I understood, because I didn’t understand what was happening. I know in places like the U.K. they have patient advocates to help in those situations, and now I know exactly why they’re so necessary. I think something I will now be very passionate about is access to mental health care as well as trained professionals being available in times of crisis, as these things can absolutely save lives. If I hadn’t the tiny bit of clarity to *not* kill myself, I would have. I would have cut right into my arms and legs just to make sure they were real. And they just released me into the world, without verifying that I had transportation or any follow up plans. Imagine if I had violent tendencies, or aggressive tendencies? I could have killed someone and not even known it. 

I know this was a long read, so if you’re still here, I can’t thank you enough. This was terrifying but really life changing, and I want more than anything to get better, because I want to someday be in a position to help people like me, or to make it easier for people like me to get the help they need. If my foot had fallen off, I would be treated like a person. But because it’s my mind that is broken, my experience in the American health care system is embarrassing and tedious. If you have any resources you know of that you’d like to share, I’d love to see them linked below. I’m in Virginia, but I know nationally there are tons of people who probably need help too. I am unfortunately uninsured (what a great time for my mind to break, huh?), so i pay out of pocket for everything, but it HAS to be done. Take good care of yourselves, and check on your mentally ill friends. If I didn’t have brilliant friends that not only support me and believe me (thank you, you know who you are), I would be chalking this up to another “caffeine overdose” and would be too embarrassed to ask for help. 

ALSO: I started writing down a bunch of things when it happened and when I was in the hospital, and now it all reads like the ramblings of a mad woman, but I think it’s helpful. I can post pics if anyone wants to see my wild train of thought mid-attack. 


TL;DR Past history with bipolar and BPD, recent sudden possible neurological displacement (“psychotic break”) resulting in ER visit, was told I was drugged and then sent back out without any help. Now exploring possible schizophrenia or similar tendencies."
214,It feels impossibly heavy,"Today feels like one of those impossible days. Where surviving is the harder choice. 

I’m so exhausted from the totality of this current human experience. This time and place where the world is so heavy. 

I wish the depression didn’t come with the exhaustion. The exhaustion makes everything impossible. 

It feels harder to keep living than not. 

If you all could just send a couple reminders that it isn’t impossible and that it will be okay again and that this is just a momentarily suffocating wave, I would be so grateful."

217,Helpful Tips from someone who struggles with anxiety/panic attacks amongst other brain stuff,"Hey everybody!

I hope you're having an awesome day and if you're not here's some tips that have changed my life in 24 hours:

1.) Stretch

Someone smarter than me can probably explain the science behind this way better than I can but stretching first thing in morning (or literally whenever you think about it through out the day) has been a game changer!

2.) Eat as much as you want of The Good Stuff!

Today I cut out bread, dairy, and processed foods/sugars. I've been eating like a drunken sailor but I feel awesome. Started off the day with a veggie omelette (replaced the cheese with some extra salt and pepper). Drank a bunch of water, not forcefully, but instead of sipping on coffee or soda pop and just went for the life giving agua. And just ate a heap of grapes which brings me to my next tip.

3.) Eat some fruit Outside!

If you can take some fruit outside. Could be a balcony, a backyard, a park, or just an open window. And while you're there giving your flesh suit some A1 fuel just start to verbally or mentally list off things you appreciate about what you're looking at. Notice how beautiful the bark on that tree is. The patterns and colors are so beautiful when you truely take the time to look. They're just natural, loving, vibrant, and radiating life. 

These 3 somewhat uncomfortable yet comfy changes have really improved my mental health today and I plan to do it all again tomorrow!

Cheers to everyone. I love you all. And stay strong bevause you are strong!

Love, Big Ole Hole 69"
218,Being Covid positive and in isolation is taking a toll on my mental health.,"I don’t have adverse Covid symptoms however I do feel perpetually stressed and demotivated while in isolation.

Any words of advice at all?"
219,Lying to myself?,"Hi, can GAD or any other disorders make you feel like you are lying to yourself? Even though deep inside you know you aren’t?"
220,Crying,"This post is going to sound really odd, but I need help crying. The only thing in the world that I want is to cry my eyes out at something, but there seems to be a subconscious mental block, almost like a dam and a river, preventing me from crying. When I was a kid, I cried at everything; when my sports team lost, when someone even looked at me funny, when someone chastised me for something, probably due to the fact I was (and still am) a shy person. Now though, I can't cry no matter how hard I try, and it's all I want to do. I was often told when I was young to just get over it, what are you crying for etc. There was a stigma about it, or maybe those around me weren't comfortable with emotion like that. This has had a lasting psychological effect on me, to the point where I can't seem to cry out of fear of being heard or mocked. I have no emotional connection, romantic or platonic, to another human being, which has warped me and left me emotionally void. I struggle to embrace emotion out of embarrassment or emptiness, which again is probably because of some subconscious fear. I don't want to be like this. I lay on my bed trying to force myself to cry, but it didn't work. I know this is such a weird post, but I'm seeking help. Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences?"
221,Are there any OCD/Anxiety medications that don’t cause sexual side effects?,"I think having your sexuality function normally is a big part of ridding yourself of intrusive thoughts, so I could really use some meds that would allow that to happen."
222,I can’t live in my own head,"Ever since I stopped smoking weed after 5 years (which was how I numbed my obnoxious thoughts) I am 2 months sober today and for 2 months I’ve never had one day where I didn’t overthink and contrive situations in my head that didn’t / don’t exist and work myself up over nothing.

It’s ruining me. Meditation didn’t help, breathing exercises don’t help, distractions temporarily help but it always comes back.

I feel like I can’t grow as a human with this constantly weighing me down. I’m in therapy to help me cope homeopathically but my sessions are 2 weeks apart because of Covid and I feel like I lose any progress I make in this time period.

223,"I do NOT like hearing ANYONE use the R-Word. It doesn't matter who it is directed at, regardless of their intelligence."," 

They could be the most intelligent person on the planet for all I care, I don't like it when people use the word retard or retarded directed to insult people. Not just for me, but for the millions and millions of Americans who suffer intellectual disabilities. 

It is an extremely insulting and derogatory slur. I suffer a mild form of Autism/Asperger's (25/m) and even if not directed at me I cringe anytime I hear anyone use that word, especially if they’re a full-grown Adult. . 

Like with African American Folks and the N-Word, The R-Word is extremely insulting and hurtful to millions and millions of people suffering intellectual disabilities. Both terms are derogatory slurs, and they’re NOT to be used (In My Honest Opinion). The less I hear either of them, the happier I am. There are a million different words or phrases to insult someone but neither The N-Word nor The R-Word are acceptable in today’s society (2020). 

For years, Ann Coulter has tweeted about a hundred times using The R-Word in front of a very large audience consisting of thousands of people who suffer intellectual disabilities and my heart goes out to them if they were hurt by that in any way. She directed the term “retard” at both United States Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. She also said that the cannabis legalization in the USA is making people quote-on-quote retarded. She even said something along the lines of that people don't ever use the word retard or retarded to insult or put down people with disabilities and I cringed so badly. 

Now I'm going to have nightmares about this bitch for sure."

But what if you're made to feel like you did the wrong thing by saving your life? What if you're guilt tripped about making the best decision you could in a highly disturbing situation? What do you do then? How do you go by life when you have to face the predator everyday, who you would've given anything to kill that cursed day? 

Now think what it must be like if this entire narrative happened over and over multiple times. How could you keep yourself from trying to rid of this guilt? Please help me find these answers."

We've all been spoon-fed this idea that Depression is just a chemical imbalance when the reality is, that's not even a good one-sentence description.  After being on the boards for a while, I decided to make a video that offers up a novel theory for the origin of depression that makes predictions, explains 'what' it is, 'why' it comes about, and 'how' to climb out.

231,Is there something wrong with the way I think?,"Why do I think so weirdly? Here is how I think, firstly I'm almost 100% sure I have bdd, due to my obsessive and perfectionist personality traits.

( I have other Reddit posts of that but besides from that ) This isn't it all but it's a fraction of it, I can't explain it that well but i tried my best

Ok first thing, I lose interest in things abnormally fast I get super invested then I just stop, I feel like if I dedicate all my time and energy into this hobby I can identify myself as that hobby like that hobby becomes me? Idk if that makes sense I just then feel like I can finally have a purpose because that hobby gives me a reason to live. I get so excited then I just.... stop.

Also if I love that hobby and like for example reading, I saw this woman who was reading she was British ( I'm British ) she looked like she had a basic house and I started obsessing over it thinking she shouldn't be reading because that's my hobby and that should be something only people like me do, ( If it was a fantasy book I'd think only teenagers, who are tryna escape reality who are like me can read it or something ) listen, please don't judge I'm aware the way I think is really strange but I can't help it I also feel like I need to cover my room with everything I love because it's the place I can feel like i'm not part of the world like I wanna just stay in my room in be in my own world. I also have like such vibes from everything like here lemme give you an example have you ever been listening to a song and it just made you feel super weird, I get that from everything sometimes good sometimes bad, If I were to walk into a place and I got like a weird vibe like my heart would start racing bc of that certain way I'm feeling but if it's a good vibe I wanna constantly feel it ( like I get with hobbies, only certain ones ) I literally stopped going to school, because of that weird feeling I felt when i was there, i just felt like I didn't belong or something like I was an outcast looking in and like everything makes me feel weird, even movies some movies just make me feel so strange. I just idk what it is but my mind is never at rest, I always need to reassure myself like about that woman thing that her room has something dark in it so she must be like me cause I like dark stuff. And like people with basic living styles and rooms and stuff it just makes me so uncomfortable like how can you live in such a basic life so I hate when the things I love get mixed up in things that aren't supposed to be basic and normal cause I love it Idk please someone tell me what it is. Thankss bye"
232,Too afraid to do Therapy/Psychiatric care,"Hello! So Ive been diagnosed with GAD but I really want get more in depth tests done to get rediagnosed, because I suspect that I don’t have anxiety but some sort of personality disorder. I went to my primary doctor and she said I should go see a Psychiatrist (this was about a month before the pandemic). 

Since the pandemic started, my mental state stonks have gone down VERY much. I was trying to find a therapist, but I can’t even type an email without shaking (I can do this with EASE when it’s not about therapy. Same with phone calls. Normal stuff = easy, Therapy = Sweaty Shaky Hands).

Unfortunately, all the therapists/psychiatrists are only doing virtual or phone call sessions. I don’t have privacy in my house, and I can’t go anywhere else unless it’s a phone call but like I said, it almost physically hurts to sit on the phone with someone I can’t see and talk about myself. I NEED to see that person and their reactions or else i’ll be way too into my own thoughts and probably panic.

Is anyone else having this problem? I’d be so much more willing to go if it was in-person, but this virtual/phone call thing is putting me off to the point I’d rather suffer than do that. I’ve asked so many offices if they had any idea when they would open and they all said the equivalent of not any time soon.

I don’t have much money, but my insurance covers the normal therapy/psychiatry costs, but as stated above, that’s not gonna work. I can’t really afford to pay $50 a session either for something more text based. I’m just so lost on what to do and I’ve pretty much decided that I have to wait until the offices open again. 

Really I just wanna know I’m not alone in this feeling. I know some people find therapy hard to get into but does anyone else feel like now it’s more impossible than ever while the entire world is saying it’s “better”?"
233,I just need to get out of this universe and erase my whole existence,I can't take this anymore. I don't want to be here and i don't even deserve to be here. I feel out of place. I feel like something terrible is going to happen and i'm not prepared and i need to get out of here before it happens. But i don't wanna hurt my family. I don't wanna hurt them for my selfishness. I just wish i could leave without any trace of my existence. I wish i could kill everyone else that knows me and then myself. If no memories of me remains then it means i never existed. But i don't know how to kill everyone who knows me. No matter how much i think about it. I can't even gather everyone in one place and set the whole place on fire. I wish i could. But no one listens to me. There seems to he no fucking way and i'm stuck

235,Bullied everywhere I go even as an adult [29y male],[removed]
236,Scared of going off my medication,"Hi. So I (F15) went to a behavioral health hospital due to my suicide attempts and MDD in late April. I am on medication and have been doing good-ish. I went on vacation to stay at my friend's house for a week and I had to sneak my pills because then I'd have to explain everything and I'm not exactly ready to talk about my experience (and didn't want to ruin my vacation). There were a few days I missed. I went maybe 2-3 days without it. Then I started having my bad thoughts again. Thoughts of: ""I wish I would just die"" ""No one cares about me"" ""I don't deserve to live"" ""I'm a waste of life""

Prior to my vacation, I already knew I was scared of going off my medicine. I was scared of what I might do if those thoughts came back. And then they did. I am really scared and I never want to go a day without my medicine. 

But I also worry that with my medication and my therapy, that I am wasting my parent's money. I feel as if I am just a money pit. Like I cost too much money for them. I feel like I'm wasting everything and I am a burden to my family. Most days, with my medicine, I don't have these thoughts... but I can still slightly feel them there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Any thoughts??"
237,How do I stop comparing myself to people? Any tips or tools would really help,"I feel like I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone else and I never measure up. When this happens I usually just take breaks from social media altogether.
I think it’s a deep seeded childhood issue. Does anyone have any tools or words of affirmation they use to dig yourself out of theses holes? This just spirals into self hatred and I want to stop the cycle while I’m still able to help myself."
238,Eating Disorder and Pregnancy,"I’ve been what I consider mostly to fully recovered from my two eating disorders for some time now.

One thing that has left me curious, is how a future pregnancy may affect this. 

I’m curious to hear from others who have gone through this, and hear what their experiences may have been (I.e., followed closely by a dietician from the get go).

If you go into it healthy as well, is it possible to have a healthy pregnancy without facing your triggers of the eating disorder?"
239,How to deal with an angry avoidant friend?," So i have this avoidant friend. I managed to gain her trust and affection in the last three years. Unfortunately i have issues too, i'm not avoidant but i'm always afraid to be abandoned, to be betrayed, i'm insecure, i have no self esteem etc. Due to these problems of mine, in April i ruined my friendship with her. I apolgized with and open heart text to whom she didn't answer. She eventually texted me on week ago apoligizing for not having answered my text saying she was avoiding. The problem is this weekend she was acting in a strange way (we can't see ourselves irl because we are in two different countries atm), so i asked her if she was ok after what happened, because we didn't speak about the thing that happened anymore, because i know that it would have been so tricky for her. But i was uneasy too, i had to have a clearification if she was still angry at me. She reacted in a bad way, saying that she was obviously still angry even if she was trying ti forgive me, that i shouldn't have asked that etc. So i feel i make her more angry and that i lost her again. What should i do? I can't express my feelings because she is uneasy with that and she'd call me cheesy, but i have issues too and sometimes i feel the urgency to speak openly to people.....for example now i would text her how much i thank her to struggle with her issues since she has written me, i would text her that i will wait until she is ready to be my friend again apologizing for everything, but she will be upset again. So what can i do? What would you like that a friend did in a situation like this? I have to wait i know, but if she wrote me again, how can i deal with her ambigous behaviour withouth asking her openly if is all ok? Should i write her first? I just want that she knows that i love her and i don't want to make her uneasy"
240,My friend needs help that I can't give and they wont admit they need,[removed]
241,I'm genuinely trying to get help but it feels like the world is against me.,"Last semester I wanted to use the psychological support service my university offers to its students. It took me months to build up courage to write them email to make an appointment. And they never replied. It crushed me and made me feel absolutely worthless and it took another seven months of rapidly worsening mental health before I found a psychiatric clinique I liked and sent them email, asking for an appointment. And guess what. It's been two weeks and no reply. I can't call them and make a fuss like normal people... It took me seven months to make myself write a bloody email - duh.

It really frustrates me when I hear from my friends and family and even Internet support groups that ""get help, get help!"" thing. Like. I'm trying. I know I need help, genius. But nobody seems to give a damn when I actually call out for help.

I'm tired, my mind is trying to destroy me 24/7 and until it succeeds apparently nobody will care. And then suddenly everyone will be like ""What a shame! She was such an awesome girl, had she only asked for help!"" My ass."
242,I don't know how to talk about this.,"I can't put my words into text.

Every time that I've been in a bad place I've just repeatedly told my self it isn't that bad. I was under the impression that my depression was very mild. I thought that I had mild anxiety. Because of that I would always just tell myself everyone has it worse and I have a good life.

Recently I went to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and I felt validated. I started new meds and felt better than I had in a long time.

When I recently had a incident I felt like I had no way to cope. I have no idea what to do. I don't have another appointment for 2 weeks and feel like I've lost my only to deal with my thoughts."
243,I was just told my anti depressant won't be able to be filled and I don't know what to do.,"I recieve trintellix via samples through my psychiatrist office. I have enough for tomorrow and friday. I'm able to call a few days before I run out and they get the request for samples approved within the same day and sometimes the next day.

 I called today and was advised that no one be in office until Tuesday, and that since the office closes soon they won't be able to get the sample approved, and also I wouldn't be able to pick it up before the office closed. 

I'm not sure what to do and honestly I'm freaking out. I'm really sensitive to medication and I remember very vividly when I tried to take myself off antidepressants by quiting cold turkey last year what it's like. 

Honestly I don't know why I'm posting this"
244,I haven’t felt genuine happiness is a long time,"I’m a 16 year old male and the last time I was truly happy was when I was 10 on Christmas. This is the most recent happy memory I can recall. My family and I have had holidays and am loved by them, but I just don’t feel joy anymore. I was going to talk to the school counselor about it but now because of the lockdown cannot. I haven’t told my family about this yet, because they will either completely ignore it, or take it too far, thinking I’m suicidal or something. I have bottled up emotions due to things in my past, my family picking on me for all of the choices I make. I have an extremely low self confidence. I have been told by friends to find things that I enjoy doing, but I have so much school work to do, so I never have the time. The only hobbies I have I have now discovered are common coping mechanisms to anxiety, so I only partially enjoy my free time if I get any.
I know this is too vague to give a full answer, but just some overall helpful advice would be appreciated."
245,Im 15 and Im mentally suffering.,I also have suicidal thoughts time to time.
246,"Disconnection from reality and basic human senses with motor problems, hallucination and really weird body feelings?","Tl;dr: I have had a really strange ""episode"" of disconnection from reality and all of my senses this morning. I started to move my extremities uncontrollably and I couldn't make them stop, like remote control or something. At the same time I was seeing some kind of images or scenes in my mind but they were passing  too fast one after one that and I couldn't see anything well. And my internal voice was acting really weird and independent of me, just like my body. When I could finally feel myself again and my senses came back, all of my body was covered by an intense tingling and numbness.

First post ever in reddit. Sorry if my English is bad or I use terms wrong. I'm non-native speaker and my head is a mess right now.

I don't really know where to post this so I think maybe this would be a good place to start. If I do something wrong related to rules or something I don't know or there is a better r/ to post this please let me know. I've reread and rewrited this 800 times out of insecurity.

So this morning happened to me the most strange thing of my life. I'll try to explain the best I can because is so confusing that I don't even expect clean answers, and much less anything like a diagnosis. Im just trying to know if someone has a clue of what happened to me. Somewhere to start learning about. It will be long to read, I apologize for that in advance.

To give you a little (and maybe useful context, explained later) I was washing my hair bending forward with my head down, standing, and because I haven't got yet a proper shower (new house and some problems) it takes more time to wash my hair so I have to be in that position for a longer time. I am a pretty sedentary person and my depression doesn't let me make too much exercise so my back is shit, and as a result my back started to feel stiff because of that prolonged posture. When I finished I started slowly letting go back to the upright position, because it felts like if I forced my back to go upright at once it would hurt. I go to the sofa to try to stretch it in a more comfortable way. I sit down, I try to force stretching just a little bit to see if I'm overestimating the pain/discomfort and it gives me a more intense feeling of stiffness in return, so I try to relax it back and sit with the back as upright as I can without forcing it because looks like sitting releases a little bit the stiffness. But I started to feel a little bad since that last stretch. Can't recognise well what it is about but it was in all of my body. Sometimes happens. Doesn't matter. I start to feel a little dizzy but, for multiple reasons (bad eating, lack of exercise, anxiety) I feel a little dizzy sometimes and then it goes without a problem so I don't give it to much drama, I try to relax for the third time and wait to the dizziness to go by itself. But it doesn't go. I start to feel my body tingling a little, i think sometimes when i go dizzy i feel it but very low. Both dizziness and tingling intensifies so quickly and so intense to the point that suddenly I don't even recognize where I am or what I'm doing. The dizziness escalated so quickly that I don't even know how I get to that point. Total and absolute lack of control of anything in my body or my mind that I can normally consciously control. Here starts to be more and more weird.

All becomes black. Or void. I don't know very well how to describe it but it was like total lack of consciousness. But I was conscious. Not like asleep. Not like unconscious. When I fall asleep I blend my conscious thinking with my dreams, my mind is active until I fall asleep and I lose the record of my thoughts. This was sudden total black. Nothing. I couldn't even think for myself until the next thing happens. This last for a few seconds from my pov. 5-6 seconds. I don't really know how much time it takes all of this... episode? (Don't know how to call it) but not too much, much less than an hour. 15 mins maybe less. Then, suddenly again, I start to be aware that I'm in something like a dream but all I see is a lot of places or scenes, like scenes form a movie or a memory but passing so fast in front of my eyes. Or the scenes start run above the black background. I don't remember if I was inside that scenes or if I was just watching from ""the outside"" with the black color on the background but it was too fast that I could even see well what I was looking at. I couldn't even know what was happening. It wasn't a dream. It felt like a bad abstract nightmare or a fever dream but it wasn't a dream and I wasn't asleep or unconscious for some reasons I will explain. It felt like I was suddenly forced to be there. Doing things like normally in my life and in a blink of an eye all was out. All of what I was surrounded. I couldn't even try to stop anything because I didn't know what was happening. 
So I start to try to realize what was going on, at least, to maybe know what to do, and I don't really know how I did it but I slowly started to become aware of some things. I was barely ""conscious"" yet (conscious in the sense of not being unconscious. In the sense of being ""awake"" and capable of thinking and process things, maybe like in a vivid/lucid dream) so it was really confusing but I was surprisingly able to analyze, but at the same time it felt like I needed to turn on again like my... sensory abilities? or something that I wasn't getting. I didn't think about what I was doing before, or where I was in the reality, I was too focused on knowing what was happening to me because it felt incredibly wrong and sudden and unexplainable. It was just that's sick hallucination and me, nothing else existed in my mind in that moment. 
I became aware that I was feeling really really bad, really dizzy, the scenes running so fast in my eyes made me feel sick too and I myself (my ""body of the dream"") was feeling like swinging but in the same place all the time, but all those rapid images that I was seeing confuses me at the same time. Then I became conscious about my internal voice, because it was screaming loud ""por qué"" (""why"" in spanish, native language) repeatedly. And the most important thing, uncontrollably. I didn't know why I was saying that, it was totally irrational, I simply became aware that I was already doing it, like with the rest of the other things that comes now. At this point this goes even more strange. Because then I realized that not only my mind, and my ""dream me"", inside that ""forced dream"", but my real body was struggling violently, moving my extremities with energy, like a child throwing a tantrum and kicking the floor with my feets, that shocked me. Because I didn't know how the hell I was feeling my body /inside/ that weird state like a dream. I can't never feel my body in my dreams, only a little bit after I have awaken. It was really weird, and maybe the weirdest part of all of this, my body wasn't being controlled by me. Again, I just became aware of that act, it was in a kind of automatic mode or like a cause of the struggle of that rapid strange ""dream"", like maybe I was controlling it but not in the usual way, it was like a remote thing. It was so hard to even try to make it stop, my ""dream"" kept going on and it was in some way connected because when I kicked the floor with the feets I was doing at the same rhythm of the words I was shouting (e.g:  por-right leg / qué-left leg) but before that I wasn't feeling anything in my body at all. I didn't feel my body, in general.

When I became fully aware that I could feel what my body was doing something felt really bad. I could feel from the inside hiw my extremities were moving up and down, I could feel my muscles working, but I didn't feel anything in my skin. Absolutely anything. All my touch was totally numb, totally isolated, and then I tried to look at me. To look at my body, to check what was going on. And I couldn't. I couldn't see anything at all. All black. I don't remember when the scenes running in my eyes stopped but they stopped at some point and when I realized that I couldn't see anything they were gone and the black color was back. But this time it was real black. I'm 99% sure that I had my eyes open but I couldn't see anything. I'm 100% sure that I was awake at that point because it was impossible to me to feel my body in that way without being awake, and that capacity of my mind to think things. And wtf, I was fully awake and active some minutes ago. And some time later. So I panicked a little bit. I didn't do anything like try to stand up. All this time I kept moving my body and shouting ""POR QUÉ, POR QUÉ"" the same way though. I just started to feel so claustrophobic and I realized that I couldn't listen anything too. It terrified me. But a second or two after I realized that, I started to see, slowly, how the black was fading away, not like my eyelids opening, the black color started to fade away from center to the edges of my sight, creating weird forms like ink in the water, but not like the form of the eyes opening. that's why I'm sure I had my eyes open. I saw finally how my arms and my legs were moving, exactly how I felt it. I looked to the window and for a second it was really hard to realize where I was, but I recognized fast my home. When my sense of touch came back I could slowly stop my extremities moving, and my internal voice came back to normal too. I realized that my boyfriend was by my side but he was still asleep. (I mean it was a pretty comic situation seen by other pov, and I would feel very embarrassed but it really is a serious thing and I'm happy that he didn't have to see that without knowing what to do or what was happening to me) The last sense that delayed to come back was the hearing, it freaked me out. Looking to the window at 8 am and not listening anything for very long seconds. But it came back, like all the other senses, slowly fading away the nothingness stuck on it. The sounds were weird in the transition from not being able to being able to listen. Like my brain had a hard time processing again the sounds. Like my sight. But it was just a moment. What really concerns me is that when my sense of touch came back I felt how my body was entirely covered by the same tingling sensation when an extremity gets to much pressure on the nerves or lacks of blood flow, but it was all of my body, and it was really intense, almost paralyzing. All was with that numb feeling and it had increased a lot since the dizziness started but I couldn't feel it again until now. Never happened something like that to me. The other thing I felt related to my body was that the part of my back that hurt at the start of this, had become very very hot, more hot than when I exercise, I touched my body to check temperature and all was a little high but that part of the back was extremely hot and still felt stiff but with all the involuntary movements I guess it forcedly stretched. All my spine felt really weird and my body in general was like I just came out of a really bad experience. But emotionally I didn't felt anything until I realized what was really going on and that it was serious, which gave me a little anxiety but I didn't know exactly how to react at first. But in the course of this ""episode"" I really felt anything at all emotionally speaking, even when I was conscious about my screaming asking ""why"" repeatedly, that's why it seems irrational to me, it wasn't coherent with my feelings, I was pretty calm for that crazy situation.

I felt pretty sick for 15 minutes or so after the ""episode"" fully stopped and I came back to reality. And even then, all of this, coming from nothing, left me with trembling hands and a disturbed feeling. I didn't know what to think. I thought about depersonalisation/derealization, but I've never listened or read about body effects like this, moving it violently and without control. I don't have any motor disorder. And the motor tics are non-rhythmic and that was totally rhythmic but totally uncontrollable too. The next thing I thought about was something related to nerves. My back was really hot like overcharged, maybe im falling into hypochondriasis but that sudden dizziness, numb feeling and tingling in all of my body that comes as easy as goes could be because of the back, I wasn't in any stressful moment or anything difficult to handle in my mind the moment it happened. It happened just right after the last stretch, all my body started to feel uncomfortable in that moment. Other thing I think about could be that I smoke pot daily, and I know it can trigger some hallucinatory problems, psychosis includes, but it has never ever given me any problems besides a slower mind and sleepiness. Anyone in my family has ever had hallucinatory problems or anything similar, and many of them, in their 50 now, smoke too and never happened anything related to them. But even with that I know it could be still possible to be some delusional problem and not dp/dr related. Just maybe with less % of possibilities to have an episode like that vs someone with genetic history of the same problem. Nor impossible What do you guys think? Can dp/dr come without a significant trigger, or any trigger at all, just out of random? I think I have read about marijuana that the randomness is not that uncommon. I have had some derealization too in a very few times but once it was in a extremely hard moment to me emotionally and psychologically, when I had a moment where I couldn't process well all the bad things were happening in that moment, and it was very mild, just a little dizziness and feeling of strangeness watching things or people around me but recognizing them and knowing what/who they are that goes away in a minute. Not like becoming totally blind and deaf and without sense of touch for a short period of time. The rest of the moments I could possibly had a little bit of dp/dr were so soft that I barely noticed.
I would really like to know if some of you have had any problems relating dissociation and motor disorders. Does anyone have had that disconnection from your five basic senses with or without that black blur? Anyone that has fallen unconscious can tell the experience to see any similarities? I think I've never been unconscious. It is pretty irrational to think that it was caused by the back problem right? I just think about it because it was just before the ""episode"" happened. But I haven't experienced this ever in my life. It has been a difficult year too, cognitively stressful. That could explain some things but not all of them. I think that maybe it could happened the same thing to me years ago in a time when I was more chaotic but is a very weak idea and my memory doesn't let me remember well so I think that maybe is a made up memory. This felt like never in my life. So many questions. Ask yours too if anyone needs it. I'll be happy to answer.

I haven't been diagnosed yet because I can't afford searching for a psychologist in my situation (I will search for one as fast as I can) but I strongly suspect that I could have a cluster B personality disorder, if that's helpful.

Sorry for the really long post. Thanks in advance for reading it all to anyone who reaches this point. You are a lovely person."
247,(Kind of stupid question) How bad is “bad enough” to admit yourself to a psych ward?,"This is probably a stupid question so I’m sorry in advance. 

I have a lot of mental health issues. Sometimes I get into these severe suicidal states, whether it be for hours, days, or weeks. Sometimes I scare myself when I get like that. 

*(Side note: I don’t experience anything near mania, but I have DID and sometimes I can be influenced by the alters that wish to harm us. So if one of those alters comes near the front I can become suicidal very quickly due to their influence. Also I have depression and PTSD so sometimes it just gets bad.)*

There have been many times now that I’ve researched psych hospitals and what I would need to do if I was going to admit myself. Usually I don’t have a plan, but I’ll start to have intrusive thoughts about hurting myself and start to plan out what I’d say in my notes (I’ve never written the notes, though). I also relapsed with self harm, this time by causing bruises on myself. 

It starts to get to a point where I’m constantly thinking about it, imagining myself following through with it through various different methods. I don’t think that I would ever have enough guts to really do it, though.

So, my question.

**I don’t know how bad counts as “bad enough”. If I don’t have a plan, do I belong there? Will they even take me? For some reason I also feel like they would need to see proof, like self harm scars, which I don’t have.**

I get to a point where I can’t take care of myself. I can’t get out of bed, I’m suicidal, I can’t eat or shower. But I don’t have a plan, so where does that leave me? 

I’ve been looking into coming up with an emergency plan. Keeping a bag packed, a list of phone numbers, and calling around to find which hospital would be the best for me. Because when I get into those states I really do scare myself."
248,What do you think of?,"What do you think about when you're doing nothing? Or waiting or smth? I'm really curious, because in any free time I have, I tend to daydream, but I've always wondered what it's like for others. Do you just sit in silence and somehow think of nothing, or do you think of plans? It's a question that has been bothering me lately for some reason."
249,I don't where am I right now.,"Well, I'm 20 and I just don't know what to feel.

&amp;#x200B;

About to 3 years ago, I met this girl, who was friend of My ex, and I just needed to know who she was, had this bloomed personality at such a weird age. 

She was the ""Hey!, don't judge before knowing what's up"" type of girl.  
She just didn't had hate inside Her heart, was logical and subjective all the time, I loved that We didn't had more than just one thing We could agree on, We were both kind of dorks and very nerds, and I just never had enough of Her.

Until I had this meltdown, where i just couldn't see a future before Me, I didn't want to spend anymore money of My parents pockets and, I just tried to commit suicide with antihistamine overdose for weeks, and well, didn't happen.

Somehow, I got over that, and I started to focus, which was bullshit, because private schools are stupid in My country.

I didn't realize I stopped messaging Her, until one day I had my phone locked, and she was just gone of My life.

Maybe, due to a lot of things She had to go through in such short notice, She did what she did and commited suicide, but, I still fuck Myself up on pourpose thinking stuff like It may have been because of Me, because maybe She felt by herself in the toughest time possible, However, the first days after My friend told me about it, I just had this bottomless depression, and I didn't want to had nothing to do with My friend nor Her, but, to this day the thing I miss the most, is that I felt weighless, I felt the strongest man in earth when I thought about Her, and it just feelt right, the way things are going the way they're supposed to where they're supposed to, and maybe she Was right about that, It's not something I enjoy talking about, but, I posted this here just because, if anybody ever reads this, I know, I bet she's ok, She's happy, and there's nothing else I could enjoy more. Or maybe her friend jus told Me a fucking lie and She's still alive, I don't know, I just do know that after I confronted that feeling, I just moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

Point is, don't be too tough about anything like that happens, life is that, You live and You die, period.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, i get angry randomly, on just about anything, but just a person, a friend of mine. She is the only one I can’t get angry on, and she can calm me. Now the question, are there any medication I can take, or alternative ways to handle it? I can’t afford a psychology expert, I am kind of poor.

Age: 19, Male, România."
251,My mind constantly goes back to thoughts of death,"first off, I'm not diagnosed of anything, I haven't gone to a psychiatrist or anything of the sort (I was going to go for the first time but covid hit) 

I had my first panic attack at 14, it lasted for hours and I thought that I was going to die with no more explanation than that. I started going to a psychologist but aside from helping me vent about things that I didnt want to tell my parents or friends, it didn't change much. I still had panic attacks (they weren't worse than the first one though) and I still dont know if something triggers them. 

At 15 I had a friend of a friend die (I knew her because we had like 2 friends in common but never talked to her), and I still had to go to her funeral because I sing in the school choir. She died of cancer and it was the first time someone my age that I knew died. It didn't bother me much at the time because I was much better mentally at that point.

Late last year one of my close friends died. I dont want to go into any details about her death. She was a year younger than me. I met her at the school choir. She wanted to be a musician and we talked a lot about that.

Since then my panic attacks have gotten worse. This time around I know kinda how to control them so they weren't bothering that much with my daily life. I thought I was going to be okay and each day I felt like my mind stopped obsessing and going over and over again over that one event. Quarantine has made everything worse.

I won't stop thinking about death, my friend, the other girl, what I should have said or done, how I'm going to die too, how if they died I could be next, how she didn't get to be the musician she wanted to be, how they must have felt, if they knew they were going to die, I go over these days over and over again, I go over new year's day over and over again, how it felt to be in a funeral in the morning and at a party in the night. Some days I'm okay, some days I'm convinced that I'm going to die, some days feel like a dream and I cant concentrate on anything other than the feeling of dying. I hope it would stop or I could get help but covid wont allow it. Even if I got a digital session I wouldn't say the truth because my parents hear everything from my room and I'm not open to talking about my ""darker"" thoughts when they're hearing.

I'm just 17 I shouldn't be feeling this way."
252,Advice for ocd and paranoid personality disorder,"I was diagnosed with OCD a while back, and this year I was diagnosed with PPD. And since I'm not in school for the summer, and quarantine is still in effect, AND online therapy's prices, I haven't been able to go to therapy. I'm supposed to have it every week, as I'm very unwell, but I haven't had it in two months. and i'm beginning to fear everyone and everything again, and often i find myself contemplating self harm. Please, does anyone have any advice?"
253,Does it ever get better ?,"I'm so, so tired. I won't kill myself, but I think about it all the time. My body hurts. My mind hurts. I want everything to be over."
254,Im very worried.,Im 12 in 26 days and im starting to be so scared of death and that one day we will all pass away and its all dark after and nothing will happen ever again for me. Please help me I feel depressed.
255,I might be indulging in self pity too much. Need some perspective.,"Until recently I’ve made a big deal about how unfair things are and, though it’s kind of a slap in the face to admit this, I think I’ve been victimising myself for years now. I don’t think I’ve always been like this but somewhere along the line something changed making me focus on myself too much. This has taken a toll on my mental health as all I ever do is criticise myself which is followed by feeling sorry for myself. This has also largely affected my self esteem and made me insecure. 
Even right now as I right this I’m confused af if I actually want a solution or just attention. The only concrete solution that I can picture is finding some perspective. Maybe if I made myself realise how insignificant when it comes to the larger picture things might change for the better? I just don’t know how to do that yet."
256,I feel emotions physiologically before (or without) experiencing them mentally/intellectually,"I feel as though my body reacts to emotional stimulus (the death of a family member, stress and worry, even intense joy) in the right ways, but my mind doesn't. Its hard to articulate but I feel like my body knows how to process emotion, but my mind doesn't, and I'm sometimes a bit surprised to discover myself crying/smiling/showing signs of worrying before I am consciously aware that I am upset/ happy/worried. I have never had mental health treatment and I don't know if this is something everyone experiences, or if I need guidance. F/24 if that's relevant"
257,Video Therapy,"Most of the posts I’ve seen here or from kids. I hope it’s no problem that I am 75 and male. I saw his therapist last year and it didn’t work out. Me in this old lady simply had a nice chat and she announced that she did not believe she could help me. I agreed.

My situation is this: Black. Gay. Interracial marriage. Caregiver. Estranged family. I heard a female celebrity say all black people need therapy. It doesn’t take much to agree with that considering the world we live in. I live in South Florida. South Florida is not much worse than any other place in United States, though it has its racial problems. I made efforts to find A therapist that was Mel black and preferably gay. That combination apparently does not exist in South Florida. I was not least bit surprised to learn that.

However, I have been advised that the VA has a mental health program. Due to Covid it is all Online. I don’t object to that, however it seems almost a waste of time and much less effective than a face-to-face meeting.

What are your thoughts in this situation. My plan is to follow through with the appointment and see how it goes. I have an appointment with a female therapist. I have hopes."
258,Helpful suggestions? Schedule wise.,"Hi guys, 

The past year I’d suffered badly with my mental health and I’d had my hair start to go white and got eczema on my finger. I’ve somewhat been able to relieve my stress level thanks to lockdown and working from home but now it feels like I’m looking at myself a whole lot more than I usually would. I keep thinking to make a schedule and get a routine going but I end up getting up at 8am and working until 4pm. Then play ps4 until like 1’s in the morning. I need things like gym back because that helped me a lot mentally. Sorry to rant on but it may sound strange but can anyone suggest how I can effectively schedule my days? I will end up thinking about all the things I’ll get done and once it hits 4pm i just want to nap, I feel the depression seeping back and I’m trying to get out of that mind set. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you."
259,Have you tried keeping a mood journal?,https://youtu.be/SMfbJD6cjyg
260,can someone help me out here.,"So I'm 15F and I have a friend whose 13F. Back in December my abusive boyfriend (18M) molested my friend and pressured me into having sex with him in a school elevator (not the same incident) And he ignored me when I told him he was hurting me. Ever since that situation I've become somewhat rape obsessed. I watch true crime videos about sexual assult cases, songs about it, it's all I can think about. Even tho hearing about it makes me so upset I just cant stop forcing myself to consume it, I dont know why. Is this normal? And how do I stop myself from doing this? Cause it's getting to a point where exposing myself to this content his making my mental health deteriorate and its basically a form of self harm at this point."
261,"My aunt, an alcoholic’s, kids are showing severe signs of mental illness/personality disorder WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP","I am 22F college student and I live alone in Southern California, my aunt (40F) has two children B (14F) and M (9M), first name initials have been changed, and they also live in SoCal for context my aunt is an alcoholic who got pregnant after a one night stand at a college party. Now she is a single, absent mother who would much rather use her time to be someone’s mistress than a parent to her children. My mother (46F) and my SD (48M) took my cousins into their home (three hours away) in early March because my aunt lost her job in the beginning of quarantine, also living in the house are my sister P (20F) who has epilepsy and autism and K (14F) the youngest, initials have also been changed. Eventually my aunt got her job back maybe two months ago but she did not want her children back yet which we understood because it would be easier for her to save extra cash if she was only watching over herself, but it is now July and things have been occurring with the kids.

M has been showing psychopathic tendencies. P has a electronic egg cooker that she loves (because cooking brings her a lot of joy) and M put it in the sink, then lied about it and tried to say things like ""who would've done that?"" with no remorse when my parents saw it was potentially ruined. M lies so convincingly (and he’s 9) that he fools my parents even if someone saw what actually happened. He has mastered lying and even the facial expressions and inflections of someone who is innocent. M thinks he's superior to the girls, and he screams in rage when the girls win games or have control in a situation, mind you they are all older than M. My parents said he yells not like he's upset about a game but that he genuinely hates girls and inferiority. A couple days ago that happened and M pulled K's arm in a rage and hurt her really bad.

B has also been showing symptoms of mental illness, perhaps depression, and I know for a fact she struggles with trying to be perfect in front of her mother. My aunt lives her dream life through B. B is a cheerleader with a great GPA, and B acts as if she is okay 24/7 around her mother, but when she is away she is very introverted and to-herself. B has also been cutting, mind you B is 14. I am only visiting for a week from SoCal so I don’t know the details but evidently my autistic sister P is terrified of B, and can only say, “she is mean to me.” Perhaps she cannot articulate what happened but her eyes water every time she talks about it, and my parents still do not know what happened as neither sister has spoken about it.

My parents have already brought the kids back to their mother’s house in SoCal, but even before they drove down my aunt said she needed 48 hour notice before her kids returned (which my parents rejected) because she will be spending a few days at the beach with her lover. I am sure my aunt is not home now and will be partying without her kids for Fourth of July weekend. I would ask the children if they want to spend the Fourth with me but I am visiting my own family and to be honest I am terrified to have M in my home.

I am in my last year of college and I am going to be a teacher. I am sure these issues are arising because of my aunt’s poor parenting but as a cousin who lives 30 mins from my cousins, and an educator, how can I help? I cannot insist my cousins get counseling as my aunt would rather spend her money on parties and alcohol, and I don’t want to essentially “out” my cousin’s issues which they are clearly dealing with alone. Yes, I am aware this is not “my problem to fix” but I feel like I wouldn’t be able to take it if something happened to my cousins, my family, or someone else in the future because these issues were not addressed. I come from a very religious family, so their answer to this is, “yeah M is probably going to rape people 💫 praying for him ☺️💕” or “I pray B doesn’t hurt herself ✌🏼✨” and I am the only child to break out of that mentality because I know what these kids are facing especially coming from a toxic culture such as LA.  If your only advice is to not worry about it since they aren’t my children then don’t respond because I don’t believe that helps anyone, in fact it actively DOES NOT HELP. I am not sure if there is a hotline to contact or if CPS would improve the situation. Hopefully somebody can help as I refuse to believe there is not a single program that can aid my family."
262,How to get involuntarily committed? SOS,"Hi everyone. I’m currently sitting in the emergency room because I feel like absolute shit and like I need help right now. I’ve been cutting and I feel suicidal, taking pills and not eating. This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve been to the ER many times, and I’ve stayed at the psych unit here several times. But the psych unit here is horrible. The place I want to get help from is the state hospital, but they only do involuntary admissions. The psych unit here is voluntary, so they’ll try and get me to go there. How to do I get sent to the state hospital where you can only be admitted involuntarily?!? Please help, the mental health system in this ER is so bad. If I tell them where I want to get sent they’ll think I’m up to something. And they’ll probably just try to send me home."
263,"Just back from failing basic training, need some answers."," Went to navy boot camp, was super excited. I had never done well in highschool, and dropped out of college in my second semester. I always wanted to join the military, I wanted the discipline and to be broken down and built back up. 

 I should of gotten mental help before joining but I was afraid that would jeopardize my enlistment. Went in, I loved it. I loved training, I loved marching, I loved being angry and using it in a  constructive manner. For once I didn't feel meek, I felt dumb sometimes but I fel felt stronger. It was stressful, you get yelled at alot but I felt stonger, I liked the pain, sometimes I wanted it to be worse.

  But at night things got bad, Ive had some stuff occur in my child hood and being away from home and all my friends kinda triggered alot of nightmares and feelings.
  Eventually I got an arm injury in an accident and had to go to rcu(recruit recovery) to get better.

  Stay there for a few weeks in what feels like limbo, training is paused but I have no outside contact and im not allowed to exercise. I practice folding and organizing my rack, reading my training guide, I get to know some really good people. People who were almsot like family, we had eachothers back. There was old man, dude was in a rocker because of some back issues, plus he always helped everyone and was just wise. So the name stuck.


Anyways I start getting worse mentally, I start staring into space and losing sense of where I am. I get sent to uss tranquility, stand at attention for 13 hours in line just to get a chit just for the front desk to tell me I need to go to a different ship. I ask him for a driver since I dont know this part of the area, and im rcu so i literally can't go anywhere without a driver without an rdc getting on me.

  I broke down bad walking out after getting yelled at by like 4 rdcs. I stop walking and all my bad memories start flooding me, I forget where I am and im not lucid. An rdc realizes this and has a car transport me to tranq. I get there, they send me to a psychologist. I tell them about the memories and I kinda made the dumb move of saying I would kill myself to get rid of them.

I get separated over the course of a month. 
 I want to be back in the military more than ever. I would do it all over again,  I have an re8 code so I can reenlist. My new job makes me feel pathetic and dumb. I just want to do something where I feel like I fit in, the navy made me feel that way for the first time in my life.



I havent even talked to my recruiter because im ashamed. I feel like I let down everyone."
264,What am I experiencing? Please help,"Sorry that this is so long. English is not my first language so there's gonna be some mistakes. This is something I've been dealing with ever since I was a child. It never really appeared it feels like it was always there. The earliest intense episode of it happened when I was around 9. I'm fifteen now. I'mma just get to the point. 
The intense episodes happen immediately after a trigger, which is usually upsetting someone, not agreeing with someone, finding myself in front of a decision, etc. It's usually a pointless thing, won't really affect anything. An example of it (that happened to me) : We run out of cookies. They're the only cookies we have in our house &amp; we make them ourselves. I should mention at this point I'm an only child. My dad tells me to make cookies in the morning since I'm on my summer break &amp; both of my parents are working.(it would be my fist time making the cookies on my own) My dad is slightly mentally of. He's basically normal but occasionally has the mania or the depression episodes, I can't remember the name of that disorder right now. He also blames my mom for everything, occasionally yells at her, that's because of his childhood (grandma was mentally ill, abused dad as a child, he grew up in a very dysfunctional family etc.). Also I'm not really close to him. I'm a huge people pleaser, I am nice, but I find it hard to open up about basically anything even my own opinion on everyday stuff (i have avoident personality disorder). So I don't want one of his points in the next yelling show for my mom to be that my she has made me passive, etc. &amp; I'm scared of the ""so you didn't make the cookies?"" in the evening. He wouldn't do or say anything to upset me, don't get me wrong, I'm just afraid of the awkwardness of not meeting someone's expectations. Now when I talk to my mom on the phone, she doesn't want me to make the cookies, her reasons being she needs to have peace to work (she really did need to work) &amp; I'd call her every few minutes with questions. She didn't imply that there's anything wrong with me having questions, she just didn't have time for them. Now she has that as decided,but I wanna ask what is there to not understand about making cookies (it's a very simple recepy) but I'm afraid that I'll come of as rude &amp; I know that she'll get mad for I'm opening the question again and dragging it over when she already gave her answer and decided/ordered. So I half mumble something, she doesn't understand what I said, she knows something's bothering me &amp; I have something to say but won't/can't say it &amp; we end the phone convo like that. The way we ended our convo is the first reason I feel bad (guilty, upset...). Second of all I really wanna make the cookies &amp; I know I can do it but what if I fuck it up? I mean I'd make them but I'm way to scared I'll fuck up. No one's gonna be mad, my mom would give me a I told you not to do it and that's it but I really don't want that to happen. Now I know this is a supper minor &amp; unimportant thing but I way overreacted emotionally. I'm trying to say I felt way to strong emotions for such a minor thing. Now this convo only lasted a few minutes meaning that the emotions appeared very quickly. I don't know which emotions those were. They appered too fast &amp; were too strong. They formed this emotion ball, bomb &amp; the only thing I felt was being very overwhelmed eemotionally, (This was in a matter of seconds, I had to go back, relieve it &amp; only then I made sense of it, it's supper hard to explain) I wasn't really thinking anything, there was no omg what if, no I'm going to die, no I'm such a terrible person, just a REALLY REALLY strong sense of being emotionally overwhelmed. I burst into tears, I was bawling at some point, breathing way to much to the point of feeling dizzy &amp; light headed because of it. I'm falling to the ground, moving around. That's not the bad part. The bad part is the sense of a power, a force that's inside off you, that you can't (are unable to) let out &amp; it wants to leave really bad. I silently scream (like warriors running into battle, screaming my throat out, but it's silent cuz of my neighbors). I squeeze every muscle in my body, my shoulders are up to my ears and I'm shaking wildly. It looks like 
there's a demon coming out of me. When it's really bad I put my hand in my mouth. I'm pulling my jaw down whith all force &amp; my jaw is pulling up. I'm not insane. I'm completely in touch whith reality, I know where I am &amp; etc., I know what's happening, I'm not scared, this has happened to me before , I don't think that I'm dying. I just feel an INSANE amount of emotional overwhelmness (although I can't feel any of the emotions that are twisted in my emotion ball) &amp; I feel like there's a force inside me that wants to get out but can't. Like the powerwaves in movies that like push/throw everything away except I can't release it. It last for about half an hour. Feels kind if like a water tank. It fills up in a matter of seconds, it's too filled it bursts and than for the next 40 ish minutes water is escaping in waves until it's empty. It's like a supper intense emotional cleanse. The power thing stops suddenly a few times out of nowhere. As soon as it stops I am perfectly functional, I could get up &amp; start solving a math test but then the power thing comes back. It doesn't come back suddenly, the way it left, it fades back in. After a while the power thing attacks are becoming less intense &amp; I can slightly control them, later even prevent them. When I calm down, I feel ok, almost happy. It's like I'm clean now, (I've never felt filthy because of emotions, it's just a comparison) I'm actually pretty productive after it. I give my self some time, clean myself etc., proces... Then I go &amp; make those cookies &amp; I'm feeling pretty happy. It's like my emotions just self cleansed themselves. 
I haven't seen or read anything like what I'm experiencing on the internet. It's neither a panick attack (I don't feel like I'm going to die,etc.) nor a breakdown (it's way more intense) or maybe it's a very intense one. I haven't spoken to anyone about it. My mom wouldn't get it, she'd say something about having another mentally ill person in the house &amp; how she can't handle it, etc. I've never had this happen in front of her, but it's usually triggered by a conversation or disagreement with her. Probs cuz she's  the only one beside like 2 friends that I'm close &amp; open to &amp; she's the only one of out these to people that I have to arrange things with. Please keep in mind she doesn't mentally abuse, manipulate, encourage/stimulate me or anything like that. I can't go to the psychiatrist without anyone finding out. I am ok with this happening to me, I just want to know what this is. Is it a disorder, or is it just me emotionally overreacting &amp; that's just my way of coping with a lot of intense emotions or? Please help"
265,How I treat myself,"So Ive noticed that Im really hard on myself lately, mainly in thought, in a way that really gets in the way of my life. Its not a voice but more like a persistent delusion as to how I think about myself. Has anyone had a similar situation and had anything that helped them?"
266,I told my best friend I wanted to die and he called me a burden,[removed]
267,I get mad easily and obsess over things I’ve done or said,"I get incredibly angry and frustrated at work. Specially when people are lazy and don’t want to help. I understand we are human beings and that no one is perfect, I’m not perfect. But I can’t stand lazy people.So because of that I sometimes act out on that anger or say things out of frustration, but I know they’re not as awful as I think they are in my head but it takes me a while to get to the point where I analyze myself and the situation enough"
268,Feeling at peace.,"I have struggled with my mental health since I was like 10 and my home life broke, I rarely had happy moments and it just kept getting worse. Yesterday was a particularly bad day. But today, and right now, I’m just laying on my bed with headphones in listening to music and I feel really at peace, idk if anyone will look at this post but you will feel okay one day."
269,Breaking the cycle.,"Posted this back on r/advice a while back, but I want a little more help. I hope that's the correct flair.


Why is it that I can't accept the fact that I cannot do things perfectly right off the bat? 

Art: ""It looks like shit I hate that I tried this.""

Math: ""I'm stupid as fuck I should just fail all my classes at this point.""

English: ""This was supposed to be my strong suit, wow guess I really am fucking stupid."" 

I am most likely legitimately stupid in math. But everything I try, I expect myself to be the best at it.
Why is this happening you may be wondering. Probably because my parents and family used to tell me I was smart constantly while I was young. I used to be on the superintendents list every year. I DID make good grades... until this one time when I made a C. My teacher said she was disappointed in me. My tiny elementary brain decided ""hey, this shit hurts like hell. lower your standards so it hurts less next time."" Instead of the ""let's do better to make her happy next time"" that my teacher probably wanted to happen. 
(I did a LOT of digging through my early memories to uncover this.)

This cycle happened over and over and over again as the years went by, and my standards are slowly becoming non-existent.. so are my grades. I am  15(F) and am just now spotting this. I don't know how to stop it. My parents are disappointed. My teachers don't expect better anymore, and me? My standards are really low. Low to the point to where I kinda don't care. Then again, here I am asking for advice so a little part of me must want to care.

I never feel like I'm enough. At home it's still cycle of wanting to be ambitious and try something new, but not being good at it so I get sad and try not to dwell on it. It's this horrible cycle of unrealistic expectations, self-hate, and sadness. I don't know what to do. 

Where do I start? A therapist? Probably. BUT NO, because my mother says.. 

""You need Jesus! Not a therapist! A therapist will never be able to help you like our lord and savior Jesus Christ!""
Yeah.. that isn't working, thank you though, mother. Is there a way I can fix this on my own or with a trusted friend? I have someone who is willing to work with me through this."
270,Love fucks me up,"Hi. 

I can’t sleep so here I am. Im in love with this girl and it fucks my motivation and focus and just everything. Haven’t felt like this in a long time, so I don’t want to fuck it up. 

We don’t speek much in person. We both work and talk on snapchat for the most part. I wonder if she talks to me just to be nice. That idea makes me tear up. 

However, she have started the convo by asking how I am and such. Which is rly cute. (Even I don’t start like that). There was also a time where she was using emoji with hearts and blushing for a while. But that came to an end. (We both are not active emoji users, so therefore I thought that she might was faling in love idk.) 

I hate rejections, so I have only asked her to join me in a car ride once. (She was busy with a friend and said maybe later. There was no later.) I might also have developt trust issues, but I am not sure. My last relationship, crushed me and my grades.

I really just want to text her that I like her, but thats just stupid. 

God, she makes me smile. Everytime I see her smile, my heart melts. I am weak for her. I never thought that I would fall in love so fast after my lates relationship.  I want to hold her, hug her, cuddle. THE FUCKING LOVE IS KILLING ME

thx for reading. I am going to bed. Tell me any tips down below, for future «moves» or how to deal with this better."
271,It kind of scares me how my OCD is ruining my life... While OCD itself is at best a lower mid tier mental illness in horribleness...,"It's just... so shitty. I have the luck to only have a mental illness whose terribleness is only like... 4/10 maybe, and I can't even deal with that properly... What if I develop something actually serious? I fear this every day..."
272,"I am getting to a point I wanna give up, but have a little bit of hope","Sorry if this is a bit all over the place but I just need to get this off my mind. I was generally a very happy and carefree person and was about to start a new life abroad. I have only a handful of friends, but great friends and a loving boyfriend. I am a super social person and being stuck at home just with family has been draining me every day. I have a temporary job but it’s as a personal assistant so I am alone at work all the time. I don’t enjoy my job either because I prefer an active and social job, but it’s good money. My boyfriend and I are long distance, and his country is open so he has been super busy with work and I miss him too much after not seeing him since December. In his free time he’s always going out with friends, and it makes me feel like shit sometimes because I feel like I’m missing out because I was supposed to be there next week originally. I just recently graduated top of my class in my major for undergrad while working 40+ hours a week. Even though I did good for myself and saved up for going abroad, I missed out on a lot of college fun in doing so. I ended up with a full ride for going to graduate school abroad, and am so excited to go from a small town in the middle of nowhere to a big city and my boyfriend even got a job right by the school I picked since it’s in his country so we could finally not be thousands of miles apart. My program may be online now, but they haven’t verified since the semester does not start until mid-September. I feel like I wasted my time working so hard for saving and studying for something that might not even happen, I wanted to go abroad to experience new surrounds and not just at home. I wanted to go because I wanted a fresh start, I can’t stand being home and feel like I am wasting away my youth and it’s made me terrified that I am going to regret my peak years of my life. Everyday has been getting harder and harder, and I honestly don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending I’m now about to break. I feel so trapped in a cycle and like I am throwing away what’s supposed to be my best years. I am just so lost, I just want a glimmer of hope to move forward."
273,I feel like a bum.,"I just graduated and I can't drive because I'm to scared to even when I took drivers ed I was scared to drive. I don't do anything productive in my day besides maybe draw or write lyrics. 

I want a job so I can feel useful and be a contributing member to society whether the feeling is big or small. But I'm considered high risk since I have asthma. I can't take my actual drivers license test until things open up and I just lounge around all day. I feel like I mooch of my dad except for food I pay for my own 90% of the time.

I have been trying to draw and write lyrics as its the only way I feel productive or useful."

276,How do I help my friend?,"I have a friend that has a big phobia of throwing up. She also has bad anxiety. One of her anxiety’s symptoms is nausea. So nausea triggers her phobia and makes her anxious which makes her more nauseous. Or she’ll already be anxious which makes her nauseous which the worsens her anxiety. 

I’ve looked up articles on dealing with anxiety nausea but none have the specific scenario. I also thought that people with this similar experiences would be more helpful so I came here. 

Does anyone know what I can do to help? Or what she can do to lessen the nausea or anxiety? I’ve tried a few things but it’s not working :("

279,Anxiety and Depression,"I'm in High school going into my senior year. And as a graduation requirement I need to shadow someone and write a research essay on my shadowing experience. And I have to do all of it from home-- shadowing someone from my museum from home without limited help and resources, even from my teachers. My dad and mom also got into a fight with me and smashed my laptop to bits and I need it now more than ever. Luckily the museum gave me one for my senior project but I have to give it back later. 

I don't know how I'm supposed to do my Senior project bc no one is really helping me and I'm afraid I won't graduate. Plus I don't know how I'm supposed to do my college apps without a computer😭. I honestly don't know what to do and I'm stressing about everything. My heart feels like it's about to jump from my chest and I keep having bad thoughts. I don't know what to do."

282,What illness could this be?,"I’ve been treated for depression and anxiety for a long time, but no therapy or medication has worked. I’ve noticed that what I deal with has been getting worse happens in a cycle which is the following:

1.) Feel okay. Not great but good enough to be social with no problem, and motivated to get certain things done like exercise, chores, etc. lasts for about a week or 2.

2.) Start to feel a little worse, but not depressed. More anti-social, start to isolate, dissociate and feel generally numb to almost everything. Lasts about a week and then turns into:

3.) Full fledged depression and breakdown. Persistent suicidal thoughts (have had a few attempts), no motivation whatsoever, hopelessness and helplessness. Lasts for a week, sometimes longer. 

The entire cycle then repeats. I should add I’ve experienced some traumatic events in my life that I haven’t completely been able to move past. Could this be something other than major depression and anxiety? Thanks for any advice"
283,I feel like I'm going down the wrong tracks in life,"Hey guys, 

I am a twenty year old male (soon to turn 21 in a couple of months) facing depression and suicidal thoughts. Long story short I was left at home a lot growing up and was neglected by my grandma who was supposed to take care of me and my brother. When I was 18 I tried to commit suicide and went through depression and started experimenting with drugs, eventually leading to me to taking too much acid/weed and woke up one morning with choppy vision and the inability to focus. Even though I fried my brain I eventually started smoking weed again (which made it worse) and fast forward to today I find myself being unable to function well (I am moved out of my house because I wanted to start living on my own). I realize that I have been completely alone and am slightly insane (I often talk to people in my head. I know they don't exist but I sometimes just put myself in these situations in my head where I talk to people) I used to do this when I was much younger but stopped around high school. Now I realize I've been doing this again. I grew up sitting in front of the computer a lot so I didn't develop the strongest social skills. Right now I face short periods where I can find myself thinking extremely negative things and wanting to commit suicide to times where I feel mostly normal and realize what I was thinking wasn't really right. Now I am going onto reddit to meet new people and see if anyone has advice. I know I need a role model and someone to help me. I also just signed up for free therapy through my university, but I think I need more intervention in my life because I don't think I can save myself."
284,"I’m starting zoloft today, my first antidepressant.","I’m currently crying on the couch waiting for the time to hit 10am so I can have my first pill. I’m scared it won’t work, that i’ll be like this forever, or until I can’t take it anymore. I don’t have anyone anymore, or at least anyone who cares enough to want to talk to me. This isn’t me asking for strangers to dm me. this is just saying what’s on my mind. I don’t know how i’ll get through today. I should invite someone over to distract myself, but there isn’t anyone I want to talk to, and i’ll just annoy them because I won’t be fun and we won’t have a good time."
285,Attention seeker?,"I’ve been googling and generally trying to find out what to call what I’ve been feeling. The only thing I have come up with is attention seeker but a lot of it doesn’t fit. 

I don’t lie or do outrageous things to get people’s attention. I don’t even text or call people constantly but when I don’t have someone to talk to I feel alone, depressed, hated, like no one cares. I feel like I need people to care about me to survive. Maybe it’s a little more severe than that. 

Sometimes I panic when I’m alone or when I have no one to turn to with my anxieties. Even when friends don’t seem to care about what I have to say. 

Can anyone help me figure this out. My doctor seems to think antidepressants is the answer to all of my issues. I’d just like to have a better idea of what’s going on and how to cope."
286,At what point does one start to come off a doctor shopper? How does one best prevent this impression?,"I’ve been to a lot of people, starting as a tween, most of whom did not know what to do with me. Eventually, the consensus became that I’ve got one of the few things that really doesn’t have treatment and got sent away unmedicated by the last psychiatrist I went to. For a while now, I have the suspicion that I also have something medication worthy going on, and want to explore the possibility of medication again. 

However, I’m nervous that I’ll go in there, tell a new psychiatrist my history, and then be accused of being a shady drug addict looking to get benzodiazepines or stimulants to flip on the street and/or stock up on."
287,Can OCD cause your skin to feel hypersensitive?,"I notice that I become much more conscious of how my skin feels when my OCD flares up. For example, I can feel a tiny arm hair move, or fixate on how the fabric of my sock feels. Normally those are things anyone can feel, but for me, it almost becomes like a compulsion, and I feel the slightest sensation more intensely. 

It gets very annoying and it’s hard to find an explanation. Sometimes I feel like bugs are landing on my skin when there’s nothing there, and the times that I have felt mosquitos land on me, I feel it more intensely. There have been days where I feel like this for hours, even when I’m trying to sleep. 

It goes away when I don’t focus on it. But sometimes I’ll be in the middle of something and feel like a bug just landed on my face. To make it worse, I’ve developed an obsession with triggering the sensations. If I have a certain intrusive thought, then I’ll feel a bug land on my arm."
288,I can only feel when intoxicated,"I’ve been bottling up my emotions for over 10 years (I’m 20). I’ve been struggling with opening up about my feeling as king as I can remember but the pst few years I’ve noticed I open up a lot when I’ve had a lot to drink or had some mdma. I don’t want to have to take these drugs to feel smth or be able to open up but when I’m sober I get to anxious. 
Im just looking for any tips on how I could open up without being drunk or high."

I don't understand how people can be horrible to other people &amp; still succeed in life. I have a lot to be grateful for, but I want so much better for myself, and waiting for that ""better"" to come seems endless. I wish I had a CLEAR sign. Everytime I think I'm ready for something new, exciting, or good for me something goes wrong. I am fucking exhausted. I know I'm complaining to probably just myself, but today has been rough. I hope everyone else is doing okay. Remember to smile &amp; that you're amazing no matter what. ❤"

292,So depressed I feel sick,"I feel so bad that I dont even have the power to right about it but I'm still feeling the need to share it with someone. Its the kind of feeling that makes you wanna puke, or makes you insecure about your health condition.
I feel sorounded by toxicity, I feel alone, I feel like I can't find a support anywhere. It could be my parents,but I just can't open up to them. The last thing I need is someone to judge me in any way. There is no point to describe what happened because then I should describe my last 3 or more years. Otherwise noone will understand. So I don't really know why I'm making this post. Probably because I NEED to feel that even someone from the other side of the world would care."

294,"My brother (soon to be 18) just spent about 2 hrs talking to a suicidal friend on the phone, there's a lot of responsibility, how do I best help him deal with everything (+ what to do about the friend)?","My brother went to hang out with his buddies and have a fun time, and was called in the middle of the night by his (female) friend who had just swallowed a bunch of pills and alcohol in an attempt. From what he just told me, she was freaking out that she's about to die, was somewhat delusional and he had to first talk her out of killing herself and then stay on the phone with her to calm her down and just be with her so she doesn't completely lose her mind (like I said, she was freaking tf out). She was eventually escorted by some friend it seems...

The point is, he shouldn't have to be the one to carry this on his shoulders. He called me now, at 2am, just to tell me what was going on, he's really shaken and he needed to tell someone. Luckily he's with a friend and not alone, so at least that. He said he's never been so stressed in his life (no surprise there). Basically what I'm getting at is I want to make sure this doesn't turn onto a trauma for him if I can help it, I want to help and support him as much as I possibly can and make sure he deals with it in a healthy way (and doesn't put the responsibility on himself). As an older sister, I'll literally do anything to lift the weight off of him and protect him from as much pain as I can. I know how big of a toll this stuff can have on one's mental health. What is something I could do...?

There's another layer to this, this friend apparantely has some past trauma this is related to, and her parents seem to be quite awful/dismissive, or absolutely not helpful in the very least, her mum is a psychologist but doesn't want her to get professional help for some reason...?? Like she allegedly tells her she doesn't need a therapist &amp; stuff, idk. Point is, this girl is obviously in danger for her life and needs medical/professional help, and needs it right now. And my brother feels he has to call her mother tomorrow and tell her what happened, and make sure she realizes just how serious it is and that the girl needs to go to a hospital or sth; he's obviously terrified that he's gonna make it worse for her as she obviously didn't want her parents to find out, he's worried they're gonna be dismissive, and just generally doesn't really know how to go about it, you can imagine.. there's no manual for this shit. I'm no wiser. This is such an awful situation, I don't know myself what the right course of action would be here. As for my brother though, this feels like an awful lot of pressure and responsibility that he should in no way have. There's no way I'm letting him deal with that alone. But yeah... honestly I'm just as clueless. If anyone has any experience with a similar thing from either side, what might be a good thing for me/us to do?

Any insight would be hugely appreciated. Thank you to everyone who read this awfully long and unorganized ramble. If you can't tell I'm kind of freaked out for him. I just wish I could take it on for him, you know...

Anyway, take care."

296,How can I get over the fear of finally getting help for my anxiety?,"Has anyone else had severe anxiety over actually biting the bullet and getting help for your anxiety? I’ve never seen a doctor but I know that I have crippling anxiety and it’s gotten worse over the past couple months. I know that I need help but I’m scared to open up to someone about it even a doctor, and I’m not sure exactly what kind of doctor would be right for me (therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist). I’ve made an appointment with a psychiatrist twice now and cancelled the day before - it’s expensive and my health insurance doesn’t cover the whole bill so that’s stopping me from going to the appointment too, and I’m nervous to take medication if that’s what they recommend. 

Any advice? What helped push you to actually get help? I’m sick of living in anxiety, depression, and fear all the time."

299,"After missing a night of taking my medicine, I usually feel better the next morning. Should I look at getting off it/switching medications?","I take 300mg of Wellbutrin every night before bed to help with depression. Typically when I see people talk about missing their medication, they say that they feel much worse after missing it. Whenever I miss a night of my medication, though, I typically feel a lot better physically and my mental fog feels a bit clearer. I haven't been able to find anything about people having similar experiences, so I'm not sure what to make of this. I haven't recently missed more than one night at a time, so I'm not sure if I would continue feeling better or if I would take a hard dive after missing too much of it.

Should I talk to my doctor about getting off of Wellbutrin and/or switching to a new medication? I've been on Wellbutrin for years and haven't tried anything new in the time I've been on it, so I guess I'm a bit hesitant to make a change.

Also, kind of in the same vein: I do experience very bad mental fog and trouble focusing that make it harder for me to get work done. What sort of medication would I need to ask about to help with this?"

I don't know who I am. At this current time I have a new job which I should be really happy I have but I'm not happy about it. Relationship stuff could be getting better but I feel numb. I just feel like everything could just get ripped away very quickly. I found it hard to smile much these days. If you do make me laugh well you are talented. I miss being Happy and enjoying life.

302,There’s two of me... in me.,"Except, the other me is my younger, teenage self. This isn’t a delusion, at least, I hope not. It’s more of a.... well, I just forgot about this part of me. This me wasn’t dissociated. This me wasn’t depressed, or anxious. He cared about his grammar. He cared about people. He was empathetic. But he was used and abused a lot. He was great and looking back, I loved that part of me cause he was authentic. The only downside is he was just paranoid and had a lot of fear because of conditioning. 

And it’s almost like I can have a conversation with this old me. I can hear him talking to me in my head sometimes. We sit and talk and when he’s freaking out or panicking really bad, I sit with him and actually calm him down. Like I said, it can’t be a delusion. It’s literally me. Just, the old me. I can feel him. 
-

So for the last two years, I’ve felt completely dead and fake. But now I’m starting to feel emotions again. But, sometimes it seems like those emotions are part of my younger me, and are in another place, and he’s experiencing them at the same time I am, we’re just perceiving it differently. 

Personally, I wanna go back to this old me. Just with the knowledge and calmness I have now that I’m older. Is this possible? Can I somehow re-emerge with this old self that I miss so dearly? This part of me, when I look back at it, was the me I’ve wanted to be for years and years. Somehow he got lost but now he’s back but just... in a different place?

But often times I think about killing myself, the ways I'd do it, etc. I wanted to buy a gun for fun cause some guys at work have em but I'm kind of scared to get own as I know its a pretty good way out if I ever got the urge. 

Normally, I just get distracted by a videogame, work, food, playing with my dog, or tv but when all those aren't available, I get pretty bad thoughts. Most of the time I feel like life is mostly boring and I really can't find interest in nearly anything anymore. I'm pretty much over relationships after a troubled childhood and three abusive relationships (one wasn't bad but her family treated me terribly). I'm not afraid of them, just tired of dealing with the drama / waste of time that they seem to turn out to be. Sometimes, I just don't see a point to do this for the next maybe 40-50 years. Seems like a long time of just existing lol.

I'm just curious if this is normal? I just watched some CNN thing on Chester Bennington and they if you have suicidal thought you should seek counseling but that seems like a lot of time and money."
305,Is antisocial personality disorder attributed to a lack of emotions?,"The basic, universal definition of antisocial personality disorder is “a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of disregard or violation for the rights of others.” 

I’ve also been told that antisocial personality disorder cannot feel emotion and are considered sociopaths. And there are serial killers that don’t feel remorse for the actions they did, which means they can’t feel emotion?

So does someone who suffer from antisocial personality disorder not feel or have emotions?

Thanks for answering"
306,My mother clearly has a serious mental health problem and I don't know what to do.,"&amp;#x200B;

Hey.

I am 21yrs old and live with my family.

Around 3 years ago my mother started getting very depressed, isolated herself, and also had some other mental illnesses.

Back then (also today) my father and sister keep me away from my mother so that I don't see her like this.

Well yes, fast forward after some months of my mother being depressed and having delusional thoughts she tried committing suicide but survived which was a miracle.

After she got out of the hospital she got better, she started being happy again, went outside all the time and pretty much seemed ""normal"" to me.

Now she seemed normal for those years but since around 4 months ago she again isolated herself.

Since then she hasn't gone out of the house, not even once.

She again is very very quiet depressed weak, my sister sleeps next to her and she says that she barely sleeps.

What scares me the most is that she now has very weird thoughts which are not normal for her to have or express.

My family is religious and muslim, they are very conservative, thus they believe that she might be possessed by a demon (I don't believe that).

Thats because now all of the sudden (she was very religious) she started having VERY anti islam thoughts, she doesn't pray, says she never prayed in her entire life and she once told my sister that she doesn't even speak arabic. (Its her second mother tongue)

When hearing anything islamic/arabic my mother shakes twitches and gets very angry before turning it off (I never saw that happen because I am always in my room but my sister and father saw it)

My sister once saw how she watched spanish videos on youtube (she doesn't speak 1 word of spanish) and she even once asked me if I could give her my spanish books from school so that she can learn it.

Also my father always addressed her using her name but now he always says ""woman"" to her because she once got angry at him and told him that he should say ""woman"" (I didn't see that, my sister told me that it happened that way).

She has very weird thoughts, once she came into my room and asked if she should do a tattoo on me (normally she would be 10000% opposed to anything regarding tattoos).

My sister also saw how she once looked up on google ""Converting to christianity from islam"", around one hour ago she knocked on my door and asked me what I think about israel.

I said I don't know, I don't care about it why?

She responded that she watched ""Mark Weins"" on Youtube, he is a famous guy who shows and eats food from all over the world, and I was like okay cool, but what do you think about Israel?

She said I don't know many times (She always says I don't know when confronted about something)

but in the end she said that its a good country because they are rich?

(Note that normally she would have a slight negtive view upon Israel because of the Israel Palestine conflict since she is muslim)

These are just examples of the weird thoughts she has which made my father and sister believe that she might be possesed by a demon who makes her say these things and do these things (I don't believe that).

She in general is veery lost in her thoughts.

Yesterday she was just standing in front of the door of the livingroom and I asked her ""What you doing"", she instantly flinched as if it was a jumpscare and said I don't know nothing.

I really don't know what to do, I am certain that at this point its not only depression, I am really scared of her because its not her.

She sometimes does very weird things and after that she just comes into my room and hugs and kisses me while crying, I really don't know whats going on.

My sister once said that they tried sending her to the hospital but she got very angry and rejected.

A few days ago my father wanted her to talk to my aunt (she is a doctor) but I think she knew that they were going to talk about her mental state so she denied.

My mother once asked my sister who she was and after my sister said who she was, my mom was like ""How can someone like you be my daughter"" in a aggressive tone.

She also doesn't even address my grandma as ""mom"" which she ALWAYS did, she just says ""how are you guys"" instead of ""how are you mom"" when my grandma calls us.

I would really appreciate any help thank you.

Also I don't know if people might do jokes on this subreddit, I am new here, but this is not a joke.

\*edit

My mother never took any drugs or something.

She also doesn't currently take any medication, I think she took some medication after she got out of the hospital around 3 years ago but that was only for some months."
307,I don't know if I should seek therapy.,"Male, 40, been dealing with generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder for as long as I can remember and have been seeing a psychiatrist for over 10 years. Meds have little to nothing in helping with either condition. A few worked for a little while before becoming ineffective and the rest only mad eme want to sleep more than I already want to. 

I have a HUGE fear of confrontation. I avoid it at all costs. It is really starting to effect me and is making my GAD even worse because I don't know how to cope in situations where confrontation is unavoidable. 

 I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a few weeks and I want to ask her if she thinks I would benefit from therapy, but I had a poor experience in the past with it and I don't want the whole thing to be a waste of time and money again. I honestly feel like I'm at my wits end and on the verge of a break because my my inability to deal with confrontation."

314,"I'm treated differently by my teachers, and I feel very discriminated.","I'm 16F, and introvert with anxiety no friends at school. I get average grades and I never misbehaved, yet my teachers treat me differently for some reason. They always treat the ""active extroverts"" normally, they often make jokes together and have fun but no teacher has ever bothered to talk to me. When I try to ask a doubt, my teacher makes weird expressions as if she's annoyed, which makes me take back the doubt. Once I went to my teacher after a class, asked her politely something about the homework submission date and she yelled at me, telling me to go and ask my ""friends"" about it. A teacher once told my parents that ""I can't achieve  shit in life"". I also have abusive family issues which makes the world a living hell for me. I often used to cry for about 30 minutes daily after I got up in the morning, because just the thought of going to school disturbed me to the core. I'm demotivated, anxious, and lonely. There's specifically two teachers who treat me this way. I went to my vice principal to complain about the teachers, but all I got was ""Why are you the only one who has a problem? Look at the other students, seems like they don't have a problem at all!""

The online classes has improved the things a little bit, but still seeing the ""active"" kids being jolly with the teacher in the meeting makes me remember all those moments. Plus when my abusive dad is home, I get really bad panic attacks it almost feels like I'm about to have a heart attack.


I'm hoping everything would get better when school ends and I move out, but the time doesn't seem to pass at all. Passing a day seems like an eternity. I want everything to end.

The possiblity of a future with this man is what keeps me going. My insanity pushes him away and makes him resent me. Its too much. This may be my last night on earth."
316,Never felt emotionally safe growing up.,"I suffer from severe anxiety. I would like to say it leans more towards social anxiety, but I am very prone to severe paranoia over things that have nothing to do with being around people. 

As long as I can remember, I have always been extremely secretive over things I don't need to be secretive about.

I have always been so extremely scared of sharing any of my interests with my family. I feel like they will find something either weird about what I'm doing or something bad about what I'm doing. 

I have 2 older sisters and they have always made fun of me for every single one of my interests. They would search my room just to find things to make fun of. I stayed in my room for 4 days and starved myself when I was 9 years old because they found a list of my favorite songs.

I'm literally scared to exercise because I don't want my family knowing about it. I refuse to acknowledge anything about social media because I feel as if I will get reprimanded for knowing anything about it. 

I've created this character for them, a person who doesn't listen to music, doesn't watch any movies except Disney ones, doesn't watch TV, doesn't have social media, has no idea what a bad word is — basically a person with no interests whatsoever. 

It makes me feel safe from judgement and getting in trouble. I'd rather cut off my toe than them find out anything about how I really am.

This has caused me so many problems, it made my anxiety so significantly worse. Keep in mind I have been this way my whole life. I feel like I am never safe to be myself. The fact I was bullied as a kid over being weird really adds to the fear.

What the hell is wrong with me?"
317,CONSTANT GUILT,"Does anybody feel guilty all the time? I have been struggling since a while now. My struggle started when my life changed overnight and I had to choose a completely different path.
If things go as I want them to go, I'll start feeling guilty. I'll feel as if I am hurting people around me, as if they don't want that to happen but they are keeping quiet because of me and I feel like I'm the most selfish person on the planet. I know VERY ANNOYING. 
Is it just me? Does anyone else feel like it?"
318,what to do about the cycle of my self-hatred,"before i start, here’s some context: I am 18f and have been in much needed therapy for several months and about a month ago I started anxiety medication.

I’ve noticed that I’ve had positive changes with medication but after the day ends and I’m alone with my thoughts I feel I am in a dark place in my mind. The cycle goes like this: I berate myself in my head, say pretty nasty things about myself, and then I hate myself even more for thinking these kind of things, and then I’m back where I started. This isn’t new, I’ve been doing it for so long it’s automatic and anything I think about myself is completely factual to me. 

I brought it up in my therapy sessions and while I am working on it there I would also like some advice/support from others if possible, thanks."
319,I deeply regret following my therapist's advice and I don't know what to do now.,"I (20f) have been seeing a new therapist since last year (I have suffered from moderate-to-severe depression for the most of my life and have struggled with bullying and abuse, both sexual and good ole regular abuse, as a child/teen), at that time I had just quit my college because the education quality was really poor and no other universities offered that specific course (A bachelor's degree specialized in english translation, english not being my country's language, so i would be able to work with official document translations and customs work) anywhere near my area, im also unable to move out of state to pursue education in that area due to financial issues and also my family not wanting my suicidal ass alone, I had two back up choices: *Mortuary Sciences and Graphic Design.* 

Mortuary sciences being my main one at the time  since everything about the course and future job prospects were perfect for me, working mostly at night due to funerals traditionally being held in the morning, flexible and unexpected schedule since a stiff routine tends to throw me in a depression loop, very minimal (alive) human interaction and a mostly noise and stress free peaceful working environment, im not very squeamish and have a certain ease with detaching emotionally from situations (lol its the trauma) so the gross and draining parts of  the job didn't bother me. My city also has one of the best mortuary sciences course state-wide and amazing internship programs.

But my therapist *urged* me to go to graphic design instead, im very passionate about art, illustration and social media, I could talk about comic books and the youtube algorithm for hours, he explained that going into mortuary sciences was just a way for me to avoid interacting with people and distance myself from society, so i enrolled in a graphic design course instead.

I think that was the worst mistake i've ever made in my life.

I just finished my first semester and I just want to kill myself, It sucked the joy out of something I was incredibly passionate about, the quality of my art has dropped so immensely that my grades were the shittiest grades i've ever had in my life, I can't take the harsh criticism from my teachers, Im creatively drained, I try to make something for my portfolio on illustrator or photoshop and I just stare and the blank screen and start to cry because I just can't come up with any ideas, and when I do, the delivery is absolutely terrible, this specific university I go to doesn't have tests, you are only graded on your work, so my finals were basically me muting zoom to cry while my teachers said how terrible everything I did was.

Well why don't you just go back and enroll in mortuary sciences instead? Because since it involves well, dead bodies really no need  to sugarcoat it, they won't open new classes until mid-2021 at least.

My parents are pressuring me to stay in graphic design and get a job in the area too, they hate the idea of having their only daughter in a ""weird and morbid"" profession (remember the shitty childhood part of the intro, yeah they are quite responsible for that) and would probably not financially support me even if the course in much cheaper than an art school.

I just feel utterly hopeless, I genuinely don't know what to do, I lost my only hobby and light, I feel pressure to get a job in something that is making my mental health a million times worse, I lost trust in my therapist and can't have an open hearted conversation anymore because I feel like following his advice ruined my life and I have no IRL support from anyone."
320,How to help a friend who ignores/ denies emotions?,"Hello. I have a friend who has mentioned to me before that he has an ability to control and manipulate his emotions. He’s told me about it before but I didn’t ask about it until today. 

I was concerned before, but the other day he said that he was proud of himself because he was improving. When I asked how, he said he was getting better at controlling his emotions. But for him, I’m not sure it’s as much about controlling his response as much as actually changing/ ignoring the emotion itself?

Today I asked about it and he explained it ask masks. And I asked him whether or not he stills feels things in these masks and he says it depends on the mask. He says there’s one in particular where he feels nothing.

I asked him which mask that was and he couldn’t specify. He said he has a lot of masks and he can’t tell them all apart. He couldn’t point out any specific events that caused this mask to appear or any reason he thought it might. 

He seemed very... calm about this. I don’t know, I’m worried about him. I thought this was just a defense mechanism for him and I thought he’d kinda grow out of it, but he’s still doing it and he’s happy that he’s improving this skill. I don’t know if that’s healthy. 

I asked why he puts on the masks, he says, “everyone does. I’m just the only one to admit it.” 

I don’t know. I’m worried about him. 

Has anyone else experienced this before or know how to help? I have suggested therapy before but he’s not open to it. I’m hoping I can help in some small way until he’s ready for more help or until it improves.

Any advice or comments? Anything would help. 

Also, is this a common thing? I don’t know that I’ve ever done this, but I don’t know, maybe it’s more common than I realize....

Thanks."

322,I almost kinda fetishize death [18+ maybe?],"I used to be actively suicidal. I’ve hung myself but failed after a panic struggle, held a loaded gun to my head, whatever. I’ve also almost died in kinda fucked up circumstances from people wanting to kill me to like a burning car or this one really bad lung infection. Maybe it was to cope with that and a sorta suppressed existential self esteem complex but I fantasize about death in both sexual and non-sexual ways. The sexual is all stupid. It’s all shit like imagining being drained of life by a vampire, being possessed and my soul dispeled, idk it’s all self insert into fantasy stories in books and games, anything with a martyr complex or masochism for the benefit of someone I... love? That’s hard to describe. It’s dumb but it gives me some weird catharsis. I know 

I got some messed up self worth shit going on- mom never held me, step mom abused me, homeless at 18 and went from strangers house to strangers house and I developed a self worth based entirely on being sexually useful to the people who took me in. Once a couple was done with me after 2 weeks and dropped me off in a McDonald’s parking lot like an unwanted dog, ain’t that a pathetic image

But it’s not just sexual fantasy. I stopped attempting suicide but instead I risk my life whenever I see a window. Like to protect friends or strangers or whatever, I see danger and I’m drawn to it. Like fantasizing about my death or suffering having some positive effect for someone gives me a cathartic feeling. Like maybe I’m trying to seek finality but feel like it has meaning instead of just being another useless burden on whoever is in my peripheral.

Like I’m social, I hang out with a lot of people and I’m well liked I guess but I feel entirely undeserving of it, like I’m not worthy of love or that any love felt for me is shallow or tainted with my deep flaws, that self sacrifice whether noble or twisted is that what I’m seeking or something 

I’m ranting, idk, I’m trying to ask about a therapist. I keep trying but I can never feel comfortable with them. They always end up being old and college educated and from a much better walk of life. I’m tired of explaining my life up until now [26] and being met with a spoken or unspoken “oh my god, I can’t imagine how that feels but I’m sorry”. It’s never helped, it’s never felt like I was seen. I just recovered from my last injuries putting my body and life on the line and I’m sure I’ll jump at the chance to do it again, until I’m dead or something"
323,Do I have anger issues or mental health issues?,[removed]
324,I'm having trouble staying concentrated on one thing at a time,"This has happened for the last 6 years of my life since middle school. I've had trouble concentrating on my homework or other assignments for extended periods of time. I've tried all kinds of methods such as isolating each task, splitting tasks into smaller tasks, or clearing my workspace of any distractions, but none of it seems to work. 

An example of this is when I do SAT practice tasks or a practice test. I start out on a set of problems, manage to solve the first few, and end up ending up somewhere else around halfway through the task, whether it be on the internet playing MMO's or zoning out. It has had a significant impact on my grades (and 3.3) and my extracurricular courses, and I feel constantly tired and/or burnt out.

Are there any other ways I can help myself concentrate or stay focused?"
325,I haven't been getting along with my therapist lately,"I have been seeing this therapist for 4 years now. We used to get along great, but lately, I have been going through some personal issues in my life. She is trying to help me but refuses to see things from my point of view. Therefore, we have been going back and forth and it's so frustrating."
326,Repeating a part of my life.,"A a man of my past waited a whole year to come back. 

He tried to cause problems for my family and I, unfortunately he can’t. My grandmother is bedridden, I have PTSD, and my grandfather is fine. I know he knows I repeated a part of my life? He didn’t believe my father when he said I’m not who you think I am. And then he turned around and tried to mess my life up by targeting me in a more personal way behind his back. Letting me know he disregarded everything I said. 

I know I’ll have to move them out one day as I’m finding it hard at my age to care for one let alone two if push came to shove. 

On top of that, he has a girlfriend who could of became his fiancée. This woman is my childhood bully I recognize. 

We are really repeating a part of our lives that has already happened and everyone puts their blame on me at first because they had no clue what was happening. I know I cannot when the only one repeating but it shows that everyone is a little dangerous to be around right now. 

My family relative all these years tried to separate me from my family, and she’s been treating me like deceased sister, who was my mother, when she finds the chance. Only to see she can’t get rid of or find out what’s wrong with me, when there isn’t anything. 


I tried counting in Spanish and I had a hard time because I forgot. And I almost forgot if I’m right or left, is this because of trauma and PTSD? I was happy about everything being resolved between us all but I was still holding on to the thought of what exactly is and was happening. 

Can anyone tell me what I should do when I feel I’m going backwards mentally? When I feel I’m talking backwards? How to ground myself? How can someone repeat a section of their life again?"
327,Is there a phobia or mental issue with me if i feel scared of saying my own name?,"I just feel in danger or something like that. I cannot say my own name, i just write or spell it. I'm 20 years old. If this is not allowed here, please recommend me a subreddit for me to ask this."
328,Does anyone every feel like there problems aren’t that bad so there’s no point of getting help/talking about it?,"So I kinda feel this way though iv never been to a mental doc so iv never been diagnosed with anything; I have struggled with my mental health quite a bit. (Anxiety, stress, self esteem issue , all that shit) 

So I know people who have it way worse then me (in terms of trauma) so I therefore just feel like me wanting to get help or complaining/talking about it way to much is a waste of time. 

Does anyone feel this way?"
329,I hit myself when I'm really upset,Idk what this means. I've got a lot of diagnosis but none of them have this sort of side effect. I get so mad and suicidal and then hit myself hard in the head over and over again.

331,Does anyone else feel like they're truly living when under pain and stress?,"I've gone through the hardest 2 months of my life. No point going into detail as irrelevant but I was wondering does anyone else feel at their most alive when in pain? Losing normality is tough and sometimes your world can be turned upside down in a single day, your thoughts, beliefs and regrets haunting you. During this time however I think I've learnt a lot more about myself, lost a lot of weight and have never felt more alive. I would like to hear if anyone has similar experiences, how they dealt with it and what helped you get over that hill in the end, how it feels looking back at yourself etc."
332,Finally reaching out for help and it back firing ...,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice. I have been depressed and suicidal for a while now, it started about 6 years ago. It took me so so long to reach out and ask for help like everyone encourages you to - but the experience went far from what i expected. I spoke to my local GP and I won’t go into too much detail but the process was horrible and I was expected to open up to a person I had just met 5 minutes ago which is impossible for me as I struggle with that. So then I was told I can’t be depressed if I had no reason to be and I should just think positively. I was told it was probably a phase and it will pass, the most cliche things like “it could be worse” and at least you have food and a roof over your head. I felt so belittled and was at my lowest point.

So I leave it some months and try to live everyday with these intrusive thoughts and struggle, feeling so lost and at a dead end, I decide to try once more at reaching out for help so I call my GP but I have the SAME kind of experience where the person I talk to is rude and doesn’t understand, shouldn’t they have mental health training? They didn’t know what they were talking about and couldn’t empathise with me in the slightest. Everyone tells you the right thing to do is to reach out and talk to someone but when I do no one wants to help me, I feel so angry and hurt, I tried to get help and it didn’t work, I try again and it’s the same, so what more is there to do?

Thank you all for reading, if anyone could offer me some advice or if they’ve had a similar experience I’d really appreciate it."
333,Is it possible to have feelings of grandeur but be depressed?,"I’ve suffered with MDD for a while now but my depression has gotten a lot better. That being said I have lots of bouts of apathy that really suck. 

That being said, I’ve been told a lot by others I always care only for myself or see myself as always right. It’s simply not true, I do care for others sometimes too much to be honest, but I never lie to others and they misconstrue it.

That being said, I do often feel smarter than others. I lack self esteem but I have a sense of grandiose. It’s the strangest thing and I can’t explain it. Am I a sociopath? A narcissist? Or a person suffering from depression and getting confused because of all the apathy I experience?

EDIT: I usually hear people who are depressed care so much for others and feel worthless. For me it’s been the opposite, before depression I was very extraverted and cared for others. I got depressed and had a more negative outlook on life, more realistic in some senses though. Eventually it balanced out. I still do care for others, but my view on people in general has gone down. That being said, I’ve always had a sense of grandeur my whole life. Like something special is supposed to happen to me or I’m destined for something great. It might be delusional, but I like to hold on to the thought as it helps me pass time when I do have bouts of depression, sense of feeling worthless, and lack of self esteem."
334,I’m done,"I (M 17) am done, I’m done trying to reach out for help. Nobody really wants to listen, I’ve tried to tell some of the best friends I have, it took all the energy I had to just say that I’m not okay, one night I tried to let my best friend into what I’d been feeling, and thinking. about how little I would be missed, about the attempt to write goodbye notes, the googling how much extra strength Tylenol to just go, and everyone cares in the moment, and then by the next day it’s like it never happened and suddenly I’m all happy as can be again. I’m done trying, I was hoping that someone would give me a way forward, just someone or someway to help, but there is no way, and if there was nobody seems to know it. So I’m done trying to open up and get better. It’s not worth it."
335,I want to die for stupid reasons,[removed]
336,Struggling + new meds,"For the past month or so, I’ve been having probably the worst anxiety+depression episode of my life. The last 2 weeks, I’ve been barely functioning at all. I can’t get through the day, I’m not sleeping well, not really eating, and I’m getting panic/anxiety attacks several times a day.

2 days ago it got bad enough that I went to the ER, and I was given a small dose of Celexa to tie me over until tomorrow. Tomorrow I have a doctor’s appointment to discuss meds, but I’m really nervous. 

I’m worried because most meds take a while to start working, and I’m terrified of becoming suicidal (I’m under 25). With everything happening in my life right now, I’ve been having very passive thoughts (but I absolutely do not at all plan on acting out on them, at the moment I’m very safe), but apparently SSRIs can make peoples thoughts worse? 

If I start meds, what do I do if I become actively suicidal? I know I would need to call my doctor, but would it be psych-ward level serious? Would I need to admit myself? I’m honestly not opposed to the idea, I’m just trying to do whatever it takes to get better.

But also, if things get worse, I’m nervous to admit it because my mom’s birthday is coming up soon and I’m scared I would ruin it if I told her I needed to go back to the ER. My mom’s been essentially my caretaker for the past 2 weeks and she’s already dealing with the worst of it, I can’t imagine adding other pressure onto her, especially around her birthday.

And I guess finally, how do I know when enough is enough? How do I know when I need to go to the ER immediately? Is intense &amp; disabling anxiety enough of a reason?"

341,My past,"My most traumatic experience was when I was 7 and my friend, who was also 7 at the time; we were both guys. I made him take off his clothes for me and kind of just like we would put tattoos on him or just do random things (nothing sexual). Back then I didn’t know it was possible to be gay or anything so I didn’t think there was anything wrong with it. Now, I am gay and am scared this could be considered rape or molestation of some sort, even though we didn’t engage in any sexual touching. The day after this happened I freaked out and had a full fledged panic attack. Also this happened multiple times, but ceased after my panic attack. I am no longer friends with this person, but am scared I caused them hurt. This is also one of the biggest reasons I am afraid to come out as gay. Any comments?"

I've taken all the screenings and tests under the sun, but obviously I can't say I've been medically diagnosed by those, so I want to be able to for sure say I have what I'm fairly confident I have.

But my doctor only does meetings now through zoom (or whatever system they use). Can I still get medically diagnosed through this? I don't know the process so I don't know if it's as easy as just talking about what I'm going through or if I need to go in to get scans of my brain or whatever"
345,Trying to help friend who doesn’t want help with extreme paranoia,"I can give details if needed, and it’s a lot of long and specific symptoms that I have been told by therapists and psychologists at work that they are symptoms seen in schizophrenia. I also was told though that trying to self diagnose is also very bad and can get things cloudy. 

I believe my roommate is showing signs of paranoid schizophrenia. Long story short, she thinks that her ex boyfriend is stalking her to the extremes, and that everyone she knows is involved (minus me up until recently) She thinks her ex boyfriend began making porn videos of her, and that he began making a lot of money off of them and that after he broke up with her (because of constant accusations) that he continued stalking her with cameras in her contacts, glasses, couches, etc to continue making porn videos that he edits not to look like her. She moved from out of state, and only has me, our other friend, her ex, and her neighbor that she really knows. She thinks that they are all involved, and a couple of days ago I found out she now thinks I am involved. We still have a lease together so it has made things weird. 

I want to know how I can help her. She doesn’t have family I can reach out too, her mother is out of her life and she hasn’t spoke to her father for years. She doesn’t have or talk about much friends from back home. If I mention her speaking to someone or getting help she gets defensive so I don’t think she will willingly get help. She’s not a threat to herself or others (yet) but this paranoia is ruining her life. She stays up until 9 in the morning taking things in the house apart, sleeps until 4pm and does not work so she does not have income. She lost her job when things started originally getting bad with her delusions. Our lease is up in a couple of months, and we were going to renew but obviously with her thinking I’m in on this living together isn’t a good idea. But she will not be able to get her own place due to lack of income and she doesn’t have friends or family to stay with, so I don’t want to move out and leave her stranded. How do I get her help when she won’t take it?"
346,I think I might be developing schizophrenia please help,So I think I might be developing schizophrenia but I’m too self aware so maybe not ? I’m not sure okay so like since I was a kid I had a very vivid mind I have adhd and bpd and for most of my life I’m mostly dissacosiated when I was a kid I was mostly typical adhd kid that couldn’t stand still or make friend or pay attention and in hs I became very shy and into more different things but i was still kinda normal ish I was extremely depressed and couldn’t ever sleep I started doing drugs when I was 18 I still smoke pot but I have a very high tolerance and I don’t get more high than being mildly relaxed and less on edge but I was doing opioids at the time and I quit about a year ago I’m 20 and I’ve noticed since 18-20 that I’ve changed a lot ever since stopping drugs and my eating disorder I started being able to sleep which I couldn’t ever do even before the drugs but then I started to realize that I can’t be organized at all or do things in time I started having very disorderly speech and I have extreme mood swings I’m constantly disassociated from life I don’t feel like I’m a real person I truly belive I’m in a simulation and I have a lot of controversial beliefs that i know might not make sense but at times I forget it’s a theory and it’s not facts and I’m very very very paranoid recently I’ve got hacked everywhere and I’m 100% certain im hacked because I know too much. Anyways I feel like when I tell people what I truly belive they just never ever understand what I’m trying to get to and sometimes I snap out of it and I’m normal and other time I don’t even remember half of the day or conversation and actions I had. The reason I think something is wrong is because recently I’ve been seeing vision changes the floor looks like it’s breathing or the furniture looks like it’s dripping but I’m not dizzy and my eyes are fuzzy it’s very clear actually and it’s weirdly not scary but confusing pls help also does everyone not hear their thoughts loudly like I feel like I have different states of minds like I’m baby but also I’m a town boy but also I’m super girly and when I’m in each state of mind I have a whole different personality and I’m on like autopilot everything seems like I’m in a book when I’m going through life my bf thinks is concerned I just am in a state of fuzzy dreaming always

A lot of people only have one or the other but I’ve never met anyone else that doesn’t have either. I don’t know if I’m just weird or if this is normal and I’m really curious about it.

350,Depressed and took coke - not a great idea now I can’t sleep,
351,"I don’t feel as if I need to me on medication, but my doctor disagrees [ED TW]","I visited my nurse practitioner for the first time in about 5 months today for issues related to weight loss and GI complications. For further information, I’ve struggled with disordered eating the past 8 months (roughly). It started as a way to indirectly self harm, thinking I didn’t deserve the nutritional food in front of me. Fast forward to present day: I want to eat! I know my body needs food! And I have been eating, at least 2 meals a day with a good amount of snacking throughout the day. Despite the fact that I’m eating more now than I have been in 8 months, I don’t exactly have an appetite. I’ll feel hungry once a day, but for the most part it’s me forcing myself to eat. 

Throughout the last two years I’ve tried a handful of antidepressants. In short, none of them worked for me. I fell into a continuous robot stage and would often forget what my true self felt like. Through the help of a great therapist, yoga, meditation, communication and healthy coping mechanisms, I genuinely feel as if I don’t need to be on antidepressants. I take an as needed anxiety medication when my thoughts become to much, hydroxyzine 25 MG, and am beyond happy with that. 

Now here’s my problem: my doctor told me the only way to get my appetite back is by going back to antidepressants. In her words, there must be a mental issue preventing me from feeling hungry. I told her I’m the happiest I’ve been in a long time off medication, but that didn’t seem to matter to her. Why do I need to be on a medication that makes me feel like a shell of a human to gain back my appetite? I want to eat, I want to gain weight, I don’t want to self harm, I don’t have a voice in my head telling me not to eat anymore. Did she not believe me? I don’t know if this is the right sub, I’m just confused when it comes to moving forward. Any advice would be appreciated."

Does anyone know if cleaning services will help me move the furniture in my room?,So my room is a pig stie and my first mattress is almost completely broken open so i bought a cheap mattress to put on top. Problem is my rooms so small and due to the lack of energy from my illnesses is near impossible to clean and rearrange myself. I dont have any help irl either so im forced to pay for help. Does anybody know how to go about doing this on a budget? Would cleaning services help me move the furniture too or would i need something else to be done? I know this isnt directly mental health related but im sure others have been in this situation sorya. Yhanks for reading!
353,I think I want help.,"I feel sort of guilty for making this post here, but I just want some advice. I think I may suffer from BPD type II. I'm 15, and I do realize that hormones and environmental factors and such are huge contributors to my mental state. I also realize that this is sort of a self diagnosis, which is something I don't usually condone, but I don't know how to ask for help.

The problem is with my parents. For the most part, I'm a very good kid. I make all A's, I'm on varsity sports teams, I play two instruments, the whole shabang. I've worked so hard to be someone they can be proud of, and I don't know if I can just dump all of this on them.

How do I tell them that their daughter has self harmed for two-and-a-half years? How do I tell them that I've contemplated suicide since the fourth grade? Most of the time, I look in the mirror and hate what I see. How do I tell them that?

How do I tell them that I've sent nudes to complete strangers? How do I tell them that I've snuck out, I've lied, I've done things that I knew would disappoint them? 

Would they even comprehend my mental state? Most of the time, I hate everything and everyone. I was always tired, I would sleep in every class. Quiet, cold, curt, antisocial. I was forgetful, easily distracted, anxious, terribly self conscious, I just wanted to be ALONE. 

And then sometimes, I'm loud! I'm funny! I'm flirtatious and daring and energetic. I light up the room, I feel like the baddest bitch to ever walk this earth.


They would be so disappointed and horrified. I don't know how to ask for help. Maybe it's my pride, but honestly I think the fallout from coming clean would just drive me over the edge. I'm tired of being like this, though. I want help, but that would ruin the image that I've built for them. I've worked so hard to make them proud, guys, and I just dont know what to do"
354,My partner suffers from depression and a host of mental health issues and I don’t know how to help or what to do anymore.,"My boyfriend (M29) and myself (M29) have been dating 2.5 years. He smokes weed daily; about 2-3 bowls per day. He lives home with family but can’t stand them. Wants to move out but doesn’t want to work hard for it. Fantasizes and dreams of grandeur and is very delusional in the reality of things. He has a lot going on in his head and I love him dearly. I realize I can’t “fix” any of it and often just try to listen and understand his issues to the best I can. We get in arguments often about little things. He usually gets quiet and then moves around and pouts but doesn’t communicate. I try to press him to talk or open up about how he’s feeling in those moments but he often shrugs or pouts and looks around. 

The thought of breaking up makes me very sad and it weighs heavier to be with him but I’m starting to get very frustrated. He doesn’t do anything to help himself except smoke weed and blame others for his life situation. If offered to go to couples counseling or even mentioned him seeing someone but he refuses and comes up with a list of excuses not to go. 

I try to be supportive. I try to encourage him. We go for hikes and do activities and have fun together. But when he is in his spells, I feel I have to leave it alone and just offer an ear if he needs it. But more recently it’s been just annoying to be around and I do try to understand his depression and ADHD issues but it’s really hard when that cloud is cronically over the relationship. I don’t know what to do! Anyone else have a partner that experiences this? How do you cope?"
355,Have you been diagnosed with or have had symptoms of COVID-19?,
356,am i dealing with anxiety or an intense paranoia?,"i have had a strange relationship with my mental health for a couple of years now. i am not diagnosed with anything (which has contributed to what I've been feeling) but I've shown a lot of symptoms for anxiety and depression. 

i was recently diagnosed with ibs (irritable bowel syndrome) and it has taken a significant toll on worsening my mental health. one thing I've noticed (along with my boyfriend and family), is that i have had this intense paranoia about very random things and i'm not sure what to do about it.

i find myself thinking of things that are not affecting me and having anxiety about those ideas. for example, i am an 18-year-old student. i have been having anxiety about pregnancy in my future, this is not something i'm planning on partaking in anytime soon but i know it will likely be a factor in my future and i have deep paranoia about what it will be like for me. another example is i have this paranoia that i have cancer, there are no symptoms that would allow me to truly believe this is a possibility. my only reason for this paranoia is i'm worried my excessive time on my phone will give me cancer from the radiation. when i go outside i'm worried someone will harras me or kidnap me. 

i'm not quite sure what to do about this, it's exhausting for me to deal with constantly. does anyone else deal with it or have any idea what the problem is?"
357,Every day is this intense rollercoaster of needlessly strong and overreactive emotions,"Hey! 

I basically just came here to say everything I said in the title (and apparently a lot more, as I'm actually writing this). I don't really remember how long it's been like this but it hasn't been my whole life. I don't even really remember how I felt last week in much detail, and last month at all. It could've been like this for two weeks or two years. I don't actually know.

All I know is that I become irrationally and intensely excited, scared, depressed, angry, sentimental, determined, sexually aroused, or kinda rambunctious (for lack of a better word) at the smallest stimulus that ""conflicts"" with whatever I'm feeling at that time. Especially for fear and anger.

A typical day will look like waking up craving death, drinking too much coffee and then becoming obsessive over either a very positive thought (i.e. geek stuff, grand plans and dreams for the future that feel destined for me, really enjoying a piece of music) or a very negative thought (i.e. self doubt, religious paranoia, feeling like the world is ending or that I am going insane), getting into a state of flow and intently working as the caffeine wears off, becoming very happy and content for maybe an hour, some very minor inconvenience happening and me becoming very angry or borderline suicidal, realizing how ridiculous I'm being over spilled milk, becoming emotionally exhausted, and being moderately angry that I can't seem to fall asleep.

I'm actually really addicted to caffeine. it's late here and I just got more of it because it's no longer a focus or alertness drug for me. it's just stimulation. everything feels like some vague dream that I drift in and out of without it. people (incl medical associations) say caffeine addiction isn't serious but I reckon they're either paid off or focused entirely on neurotypical (I'm autistic) as well as otherwise mentally healthy people. probably both.

I'm wondering why this all might be. I'm terrified that I'm going insane. I experienced a rather vivid auditory hallucination today: the floor creaked and my mind warped it into my mother calling my name (she wasn't there), and it took me a couple seconds to realize that it was a hallucination. but I did realize that it was one. I'm always in my head. my intense feelings are the result of an outside stimulus bouncing around in there as my overactive mind contemplates it, I guess. and that's been my reality, mostly. except for mid afternoons when I feel content. then I'm actually engaged. 

for a while now-- especially since quarantine-- text on screens has felt more emotionally engaging than talking to people and hearing them talk. both messages sent over the internet and game dialog feel more like reality than engaging with someone in person, which feels dreamy and vague most of the time (but not all the time).

Sorry for the long unfocused post. I guess I just want to know what specifically is wrong with me and how to tackle the issue from there. thank you for reading!"
358,"i want to understand better, but respectively. how do i go about this?","i want to understand what people tell me when they express to me what it’s like living in their own state of minds so i know how to react better and be a better person of strong support to them specifically. how can i express to them this want of understanding or what should i do to take the initiative of learning about their behaviors and habits so i can make my part in their life comfortable and safe for them? i’m afraid to come across as overbearing or annoying. i know what i like from people when they want to go about learning me and what it means to live as bipolar, but i know that everyone has a different approach and everyone has their own internal battles."
359,Jus needed to vent,I’m such a fucking loser. I’m fat. I’m ugly. I’m white. I’m a nihilist. I’m a drug addict. I’m toxic. Ima cancer and I drain the life outta ppl. I literally have nothing going for me. I work at fuckjng Pizza Hut. My brain is fried. I don’t remember what i did 3 days ago. My mind goes blank all the time. How imma graduate college. I’m nothing but negative energy. I have caused nothing but misery for everyone I have ever met. I dint deserve to live anymore. I don’t even think imma graduate college. What’s gonna happen if I get my degree and I’m still miserable. Imma live alone and overhaul myself with work which means no social life at all which in return means I die alone. My worst fear. This girl I been talking to. I’ve never liked a girl that much. Then again she might’ve jus played with my emotions. I only like her that much cuz no other girl has shown as much interest in me as she did. But I fucked up things with her. She’s really jus like me. Introvert. Takes things to the extreme. And I admire her for dat but I lost myself. And spazzed on her. I judged her the wrong way. I didn’t respect her mental. I judged her by her actions and not her intentions. Lord knows what she feels on the daily and what she goes through and I only made things harder on her. i depended on her for my happiness. I put that pressure on her and that was wrong cuz she has her own problems. I jus want her to be happy. I jus want her to do everything she wants in life. She’s a positive role model to me even though she’s 17 and I’m 19. But I think she found sum1 else. And I’m ok with dat ig. He’s a better dude than me. He’s got interests. He paints and shit. He wears fashionable clothes. Hell make her much happier than I ever will. The only hobbies I have are getting fucked up and wallowing in my own self pity. I only wear fucking Pizza Hut shirts not cool fashion shit. I’m uninteresting.  I dint blame her for like cutting me off. Imma a negative person. She doesn’t need that in her life. I hate everything. I gotta chip on my shoulder. I feel like I’ll never be enough for anybody. I’m scum of the earth literally. I think it’s too late for me anyway. I’ll never even be a good boyfriend. I cringe at the thought of me actually being in a relationship. How much I’ll embarrass the poor girl that thought I’m worth it. How much of an embarrassment it would be to date me. How ik I’ll do nothing but cause misery for dat girl. I’m evil. I dknt even know if I’m capable of love. It scares me how I’m jus like my daddy. And I hate my daddy. And seeing him today. I’m jus scared imma end up like him. A bitter and angry 40 y/o. It jus ducks me up. Cuz the girl I’m talking about is from Cali. And idk why I thought it was ok to catch feelings for her. But she kept texting me. She didn’t have to do that shit. Idk why she did. I was jus a weirdo that stalked her on Twitter. I remember when I first saw her page. My account was suspended so I couldn’t follow her. Any other girl I would’ve jus went about my day. But she was literally the most beautiful girl I ever seen and I felt sumthing really good about her. So I screenshotted her profile so I could follow her later. Idk. I really miss her. But she hates me now. And I don’t blame her really. I said sum really fucked up shit. I was mad. I felt like she didn’t find me cool anymore. Ik that sounds shallow. But I got real mental issues. I get this feeling that everything and everyone is against me. And I jus wish I could take back everything I said. She was funny too. She had a dark sense of humor. Like fr the funniest girl I ever met. I say met but I’ve never even met this girl irl. Makes me wonder how’d she react if she actually seen me. How she would feel sick to her stomach knowing she once entertained a slob like myself. Maybe she’d give me a hug prolly not. Prolly jus ignore me completely. Block me on everything after. Idk why she hasn’t already. It’s crazy she’s the first thing on my mind when I wake up and the last thing on my mind when I gts. And she doesn’t even think of me. At all. Imma wait til like august to text her. I hope she forgives me. I really do. I miss her. She doesn’t miss me tho. I miss her independence. I miss her jokes. I miss hearing bout her day. I miss talking bout food with her. I miss telling her she’s pretty. At one point and time she really had me believing we were like meant to be. Then like one day I guess a switch flipped in her head and she realized imma loser. She’s not wrong. Imma die alone. I’ll prolly be dead by 21. 30 max.

363,Worried about my teenage brother,"I'm really worried about my little brother. He is 13, he has ADHD  (not a problem but it might be a factor?) and has recently started self-harming and expressing suicidal thoughts. It's a very long story but he's VERY upset because my parents are taking away his phone and computer because he's obsessed with it. He was online almost all day and was sneaking around at night and stuff to go online. He goes on discord Undertale roleplay servers and just does that all day. There's a girl he says he is in love with (their OCs are dating or something) and he feels really upset about missing roleplay events and not being able to talk to her. He listens to the same nightcore songs on repeat and sometimes sings them aloud and it's just unsettling and it's honestly destroying my family. I'm trying so hard to talk to him but they just seem like temporary fixes. For instance, we talked for awhile and then i tried to take his mind off of things by watching some tv. Then, he headed to bed and literally 10 minutes later he's downstairs again looking for something to hurt himself with (we have hidden all knives/sharp objects). 

It's tearing me up inside. My parents are losing it. They are so broken and defeated and I'm feeling it too. I don't mean to make this about me either but I'm feeling so hopeless. I don't know what to do. He started therapy yesterday and tomorrow my parents are taking him to a doctor or something. Does anyone have any advice? What can I do to help? Can I help? I'm scared he is going to do something terrible. I'm also confused because he's a teenager but this is all so intense?"
364,Being home is triggering,"I (20F) used to struggle heavily with depression and an eating disorder in high school, but going to college was the fresh start that I needed. I have made truly incredible progress, I finally developed a healthy relationship with food and working out and I never went into a depressive episode at school. Being stuck in my parent's home during quarantine is very triggering to me. My only memories of living in this house are of a time where my mental health was at its low, and I find myself reverting to old tendencies (isolating myself, being overly critical of my body, short attention span, hardly able to do simple tasks like cleaning my room). I have a friend who's holding me accountable to workout over FaceTime every morning and that's the only thing getting me out of bed everyday. Is anyone else struggling with the same thing? Or have any advice? I feel so miserable."

368,Help with my girlfriend who’s bipolar and has anxiety,"Hello everyone, so some background, me and girlfriend have been dating since around Valentine’s Day this year, been official 3 and half months, but basically 4 and a half since our first date, we clicked and hung out a lot before being official. She had brought up dealing with anxiety and depression when we started talking, and as we started to hang out more she had brought up her being bipolar. She had also mentioned to me that she hasn’t been on her meds since the beginning of the year because she doesn’t like the side effects making her tired and unfocused. Now mostly she’s fine, occasional mood swings but 90% of the time it’s good days for her, but tonight she told me that the last few months she’s been feeling super anxious, sometimes scared to drive, and even just anxious to get up and go pee at my house. The reason she finally told me about this is because she just dropped me off and we where messing around and I was annoying her while driving by drumming on her dash, I won’t get into what led to this, but she slapped me on the arm a few times, nothing bad, but she texted me after she had cried on the way home, not because what I did but she told me how part of BP is impulse control and that she hates feeling out of control and that she was sorry because she don’t mean to slap my arm as hard as she did...she also said it was a reminder to her that this is something that will never go away no matter how many good days she has and that broke my heart to hear her say that, she told me she thinks she should go see a doctor but she doesn’t want to see a psychiatrist because of the med situation...I love her so much and I know there’s no way for this to go away for her, and I just want to understand how to help her as much as possible and be there for her, but she’s resistant to letting me in in that way. She’s someone who hates feelings and I know she feels like she needs to deal with this on her own, due to shitty past experiences, but I just wish she’d know that I’m not gonna leave her side through it all, and I just want her to be as close to happy as she can get...I support her decisions 100% mainly because I don’t have any idea what she’s going though and what she’s been through, and I trust her to do what’s best for her, but Sometimes I get worried that if she chooses not to go back on meds, idk what it could eventually lead to, but again I also don’t know what it’s like to be on meds....I just don’t know what to do to help her and I try to be as supportive as I can, and talk her through things and be available to her in case she needs me in any way. I haven’t even told her I love her yet because I’m scared it may scare her off, or that it’s too soon and won’t mean as much because she’s my first gf( were 24) or just cause it’s a big thing in general. I guess I’m just looking for some advice as to the  best and correct ways to be supportive, and maybe some insight to what she’s going through and how I can help combat that in a positive way"

370,Just a small word.,"For someone who suffered 2 major psychotic episodes..  spent over 2 months in a mental ward. Lost every friend I had, lost my passion for drawing and making art.. its taken me 10 years to recover.  One peice of advice I can give is let go of ANYTHING that brings you down. Anyone who has it over you, those friends that don't intentionally but still do, bring you down. Don't question yourself.. dont blame people for what they do or how they treat you its not your fault. You can't change who they are. Anything that gets you worked up, if possible get rid of it. Life has so so much to offer. Weve got the power in every single one of us."
371,Should I tell him? (TW: Suicide and self harm),"My friend who lives across the world has been open about his suicidal thoughts to me, and I know he has a plan. I have, many times tried to intervene personally and contacting someone he knows who is capable of informing his parents.

**TW /// Detailed mentions of self harm:**

He plans to end his life by cutting to the radial artery in his wrists, and has been practicing cutting deep to be comfortable hitting it... I really don't know if I should make him aware of the 2% success rate of this method or not, it may discourage him from trying this way or it might encourage him to find a more 'effective' method, so I just really don't know if I should say anything. I want him to get clean and stay safe but I just don't know how to help him navigate the situation because his honesty to his therapist and psychiatrist only goes so far."

375,Feeling the need for a change/spontaneity while seeking help for my mental health?,"Hi everyone. I’m new to reddit so if I’ve made any mistakes please let me know! I would just really like some feedback/support on the scenario below. 

Some backstory: I have recently began getting help for my mental health. I started seeing my psychiatrist about 3 months ago and I started CBT therapy last week. I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, depression, insomnia, and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. 

Since seeking help and getting my diagnosis, my life has been turned upside down, both good and bad. I can see an improvement in my anxiety and the other aspects of my mental illness are also on the road to recovery as well. I’ve also been seizure free for 60 days! Regardless, I know this will be a never ending battle and a long road. 

However, recently I’ve been feeling the need to do something spontaneous or make a big change in my life. The change that I want to make is to move out of my current apartment I share with my BF (23M) and live alone. I’m a little taken aback that I even want to do this. We have a good relationship I think and I don’t think I want to break up with him. I just want to live by myself for a little while. 

I suppose I felt the need to do this because I feel as though I rely on him and my family too much because of my mental health problems. I want to be able to rely on myself again. I used to love spending alone time and I enjoyed being by myself, now I feel uncomfortable being alone. 

I suppose I’m just looking for someone who has gone through something similar. Is this normal to want to make big life changes while seeking help for your mental health? I’d love any input anyone can offer."
376,I fucking hate my mom and I wanna live with my dad instead,So my mom has gave me a bunch of fucking mental problems that I just sweep under the rug and tell nobody about until it becomes a big fucking problem.

I’ve told her many times that she makes me feel like shit and she ether laughed it off or said I was fucking lying. Well do you think I’m lying when I’m in a fucking breakdown and in tears because you won’t fucking listen? Like what does she expect when she has made me pick up rocks as a 7 year old near night time without a jacket all for kicking a pebble and it hits a girl which I didn’t mean to him and she goes and tells a teacher that I “threw it at her” does she think that’s fucking reasonable?

377,Feeling the need to change/spontaneity after seeking help for my mental health,"Feeling the need for change/spontaneity after seeking help for my mental health

Hi everyone. I’m new to reddit and I’m so sorry if I’m not doing this correctly. I would love to hear some thoughts on the dilemma I’ve typed up below. I just want to see if some people have gone through similar things/thoughts on their journey to managing their mental illnesses. 

Some backstory: I (23F) have recently, as of 3 months ago, started my journey of trying to manage my mental health. I started seeing a psychiatrist. During my visits, I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, depression, insomnia, and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. I also started CBT therapy last week. 

My diagnosis and treatment has already made a huge impact on my life, both good and bad. I am starting to feel more like myself and starting to feel like what most people who don’t have anxiety 24/7 feel like. LOL However, I’m still very much struggling and I know I have a long way to go. 

More recently, I’ve been experiencing bouts of feeling the need and urge to do something spontaneous or to change something in my life. The thing I’ve set my mind to wanting is to move out of my current apartment that I share with my bf (24M) and into my own place. This is something I’ve been thinking about recently and I feel such a strong urge to change this aspect of my life. I’m not really sure why though. My relationship is normally good; we have ups and downs as normal. I certainly don’t want to break up with him. However, I feel such a strong urge that this is the right choice. 

I think part of the reason why I feel the need to move out and live alone is because I feel like I need to learn how to rely on myself. I have a hard time being alone, especially because of the seizures. They are pretty much under control and no real threat to me now. Before my mental health got bad though, I very much enjoyed being alone and spending time with myself. I want that back. 

Has anyone had a similar experience or at least felt the intense urge to change something in their life after seeking help for their mental illness?"
378,I might lose,"I've been fighting depression for awhile now and I've had my ups and downs but this time it's kicking my ass. Living just doesn't seem appealing anymore honestly. I feel like im losing all my friends and its my fault. Im not sure if my girlfriend really cares. And im too scared to talk to my parents about it. I just feel like life would be better if I was dead. Death isn't scary to me at all and I don't think dying is that bad. I got a perfect plan on how I want to go out. My plan is to drive out in the middle of nowhere at night, chill for a bit, tape a hose to my exhaust, run it through my window, make sure no air escapes, smoke some bud, listen to my favorite music, then peace peacefully. It sounds like my kind of night lmao. Anyway if shit doesn't get better im outta here"
379,Been contemplating existing.,[removed]
380,I’m soaring over lush grounds,"Been holding everything in since I got out of psychiatric care. Its like after I went through that I tricked myself that I was alright and even stopped taking meds (even though I really feel like they were bullshit, but I don’t feel like explaining why it’s a serious reason though). I’ve held every last mental health thought I have about myself in since December and I’m worse than I was before the hospital. I wear a smile and act happy, but on the inside I want to die (god that sounds cliche, I never thought in my life I’d experience or say these words). And my “best friend” told me nobody likes me. Ouch. I want to kill myself badly, but I’m listening to Oranges &amp; Lemons by XTC so it’s a weird dichotomy in my head right now. Sorry for the stream of consciousness, I just haven’t explained this at all to anyone at all. :/"
381,Should I be worried?,"27F in US

I’ve been hesitating to post here as I’m not entirely sure I want answers. I am familiar with therapy, as I had a wonderful relationship with my last counselor 10+ years ago. I had anxiety, depression and was diagnosed with PTSD. I had some serious traumas during my teenage years and have overcome a lot to be where I am. I’m proud of my progress but also understand that there is still work to be done in order to be fully healed and it is still a complicated matter. But that is something I think I’ve come to terms with.

The reason I am here is that I’m afraid that my mental state has been slipping. I know that my experiences have altered me. I do not think I feel things like most people do. I express and can fake some emotions quite well and I do have those that I care for but ultimately, I am apathetic at best. I’m very rarely truly honest with others about my thoughts or feelings. 

I have these intense inner monologues that cover everything from thoughts about the universe, to interactions with strangers, to relationships with people around me. The ongoing flow of words running in my head do not cause me anxiety, but are just distracting. I could be watching a movie or chatting with a friend, and suddenly no longer be really paying attention because I’m listening to the monologue. 

I have other thoughts that I can “hear” over the monologue too. Sometimes several different messages going on at once. I’ve had a song playing in the background, two voices discussing sides of a debate, the monologue droning on, and still actively thinking about the coffee I’m about to order. I guess what I’m getting around to admitting to is that sometimes, there are many voices in my head. They feel kind of like an extension of myself. This is sort of the starting explanation but I figured it was a good place to start.

I have never said anything like this aloud because I am afraid of being forced into treatment or given a label that will effect my future. I need to know if I should be concerned? Or if I’m having some sort of psychotic break"
382,I believe I’ve lost all communication,"I’m sorry if there’s any grammar mistakes.

I’m a 17 year old boy who’s been growing up in a immigrant household, my parents moved to America from an asian country where males showing any emotions was always frowned upon and seen as being weak. I grew up always being told to man up and act tough, never showing any negative emotion. While this is pretty standard for a lot of families who move to America from immigrant countries, my family added more and more to it. I was never allowed to speak my mind, always been yelled at or being told Im stupid or my opinion is stupid and that I should just go away every time I attempted to communicate any thoughts. I was not allowed to talk to any friends about any of my problems, I was always yelled or beaten as a kid for even mentioning any life problems I had. I was always treated as the least intelligent of the family, constantly being laughed at by my family and relatives alike for not being able to speak our native language or making small mistakes in my life. Eventually I just adapted to having not just my mouth but my mind closed, thinking and communicating has just been harder and harder it seems. Recently it got even worse, my grandma passed away and I was in despair, I couldn’t do much and my thoughts and emotions were in a more of a jumble than ever before, I couldn’t think straight and I couldn’t live life thoroughly as anyone else does. Eventually it got too much for me and I asked my parents to go to therapy. They yelled at me, calling me crazy and a psych ward patient for even suggesting the idea of therapy. Surprisingly, I actually did manage to get one appointment in. I talked with this middle aged man in his small office, couldn’t have been more than 30 minutes but that was the only time I felt free to talk about myself and my emotions. After that, on the ride home, my mother asked me if I would like to go again. I refused. I thought myself crazy and unstable to need therapy based off my parents ideals and words to me. What my problem is that I want to be better, I have a girlfriend of 6 months and it’s hard to communicate sometimes with her, I only just realized how broken I am and I don’t want to be like this anymore for the sake of her and me.

Any words of encouragement or tips will help. I’m sorry for the huge mess of words, I’ve never really written a long post like this before and certainly not about myself."
383,Please help,How do you forget something gross/disgusting you saw on internet? Does that gross/disgusting thing mix up with your good thoughts and images?
384,Idk what to do,I thought I was getting better but I’m at an all time low now. I feel like a background character in everyone else’s life. I know I’ll never be anyone’s first choice and it makes me so sad. I want all my friends to like me and sometimes it feels like none of them actually do. Lately when I’m around them I’ve been so quiet I forget what I sound like and it makes me want to cry every time. It doesn’t help that I know some of them hate me for sure too.

386,Does anyone get paranoid about random stuff when there is nothing to do?,"During this pandemic I barely have anything to do. So lately I’ve been having thoughts of paranoia that something bad might happen and I have no evidence for it. 

As an example - last month I read an article that a guy drove 14 miles in his sleep and killed his father in law. And now I’m super paranoid that I’ll do something illegal in my sleep and I’m scared to go to sleep. 

I think my mental illness stems from experiences in childhood. In sixth grade I had two teachers that kept on giving me detention for no reason at all. Once one of them gave me detention because she thought I was smiling while she was giving the class a lecture on being respectful. On another occasion a teacher gave me detention because I answered a math question correctly (she wanted the class to do it as a whole together but I had the answer instantly and said it). In several other scenarios I’ve gotten in trouble because kids in my class framed me for things I didn’t do. So I think I’ve developed this condition of constantly thinking I’ll get in trouble or go to jail for something I didn’t do. 

With that being said - mental illness runs very heavily on my mom’s side of the family. My mom’s father was a schizophrenic and my mom’s brother committed suicide in his early 20’s. My mom’s sister also suffers from anxiety. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist but she’s not very good. She gives very general advice such as meditating and drinking less coffee- basic shit that I can google. And she’s very unprofessional: when I told her the things my dad did to me as a kid she said “your dad is a total asshole”. I want to see another therapist but I’ve already spent a lot of money on this one."

388,Questions about my panic attacks.,"This is going to be kinda long so I’m sorry. 

A little back story as to maybe why I am like the way I am now. Maybe it ties into what I’m experiencing now. But when I was a teenager I had a TERRIBLE trip/panic attack on weed that lasted hours. It didn’t help that I was outdoors. 

Basically I didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t. Everything was in slow motion. Like if you’ve ever played a laggy video game that was how my vision was. 

I wasn’t sure if I was actually talking or if it was in my head. I wasn’t sure if the person was talking or if that was in my head. I’d black out for who knows how long and come to just to be more panicky and black out again. 

I don’t remember a lot of it but I do remember hallucinating a man. 

I did end up crying towards the end of it because I couldn’t tell what was real and I was just so scared. I thought I’d stay like this forever. 

That was the start of my panic attacks. 

When I have a panic attacks now I sometimes black out for a couple seconds and everything still has that video game lag feel. I get derealisation still. Just like how my bad trip was. It does last quite a few minutes. It’s usually when I’m overstimulated.

But now recently there are just these random times that someone is talking to me but it sounds like gibberish and I ask them what did they say and that triggers something in me for some reason and I just feel super scared and wonder if that person actually said something or if it was in my head. And it can be the other way around too. The person ask what I said in a way that triggers me and I wonder if i actually said something or if I said something completely different. It’s like my brain just stops working for a second. 

It’s just a super scary feeling and I was wondering if anyone else feels like this too or if it’s just me? I hope it’s just panic attack and not me actually losing my mind."
389,"As an Asian-American, I wish I could cut all my skin off","Or at least fucking bleach it or something. I fucking hate being Asian so fucking much. 

I’ve faced so much racism due to the pandemic. I was literally beaten up by a guy. 

Fuck this so much. This country doesn’t give a flying fuck about Asian Americans. Even after all this horseshit Street level racism, I’m going to be fucked again when applying to colleges this fall. I’ve worked my fucking ass off in school to get the best possible grades and have the best extracurriculars, research, essay, and recommendations. It’s do damn depressing knowing that I’m at an inherent disadvantage due to being Asian. 

Did you know being Asian is like having 50 points deducted from your SAT score compared to a white kid (according to Princeton)? 

The bullshit media claims to be so “anti racist” but doesn’t give a flying fuck about people like me. And at the end of the day, I’m just supposed to sit back and support these programs or risk being vilified. 

I cannot fucking take this anymore. I hate being Asian. I wish I could sit in a bathtub full of bleach and just make the Asian skin go away or just cut it all off. Some days I wish I could just get hit by a fucking bus and die. And you know what, I live in a large city and almost did get hit by a bus back in February. The damn driver didn’t stop until the last minute. I didn’t even flinch. If that bus had hit me, the oh fucking well. 

As a disclaimer, I have no intention of harming myself. I just needed to get this off my chest."

391,Benefits for mentally ill in UK and living on my own.,"Ok so, uh... Dunno if I'm doing the right thing by posting here but I honestly don't know what else to do. I thought that some of you might know more or at least have some ideas for me.  
So, I'm over 18 and am living with my family. I have social anxiety, depression, paranoia and avoidant personality disorder, so as you can probably guess, I'm not studying or working at the moment. And I don't mean the quarantine - even before that. I'd like to move out, because I believe living on my own would be essential to start healing. Long story short, living with my family isn't good for my health. But here's the problem: since I obviously can't work even though I'd love to, I have no money of my own. I'd like to know if any of you know what I could do in this situation. What kind of benefits I could get (I live in Scotland).  
I feel like a goddamn loser for just wanting benefits but it's the only way I can see myself getting out of here. I have no one else who could help me, no other family, no friends. I have plans to start a therapy and am on medication but I want to actually start getting better and as long as I live with my family, I don't think that'll happen.  
I feel completely stuck so I'll take any advice you can give me."
392,my anxiety is killing me,"For the past couple days I have been having lingering anxiety throughout every day causing me heart palpitations and making me zone out. Quarantine has fucked me up now that I think about it. 

I'm scared of chest pains being heart attacks, headaches being cancer or something else that's bad. 

I'm really scared of catching the virus and spreading it to my family so I haven't gone out in months. Three days ago I started going out on drives, and oh my god the instant change of mind it brought me was so incredible. All my worries, fears, and anxiety went away and all I felt was good. But then as soon as I came home and sat down on my desk to talk to friends or play some games, it came right back and I started getting heart palpitations and feel really uneasy. 

BUT it has been getting better as I am now going out for a drive everyday and I don't think about it as much. 

So if you're feeling the same way as I am, try just leaving your house, taking a day off from whatever your routine has become, and hopefully you will also feel better."
393,I’ve been really struggling the past few months,"I’ve wanted to join the army for a long time now and I’ll be 18 in 2 days. My girlfriend really isn’t taking it that well and I’m really scared of everything at this point. She keeps begging me not to and she told me she didn’t change her major so she could be with me and that she wished that I’d do the same and it honestly made me feel like shit, I know she doesn’t mean to be manipulative or anything and she always has my best interests in mind but damn. She’s also really worried about the virus and I keep wanting to go out with my friends but it upsets her, I believe her when she says it’s the pandemic because she never cared what I did before as long as I was safe.

We are both worried about the other cheating which hurts, we both think we’re not good enough for each other but I know she’s the best for me. I really just want to be hers for as long as possible and even looking at someone else makes me sick.

I’ve dealt with mental health issues in the past and it feels like I’m spiraling down again. I have to gain a lot of wait just to make it through MEPS but sometimes it’s really hard to eat and whenever I eat a lot I don’t gain any weight."
394,I overthink so much It's literally getting so hard for me to clam myself.,"I need help. I cannot sleep, I always feel heavy in my chest and I overthink things so much that I can't stop. I know that I should stop and bring something positive and new but I cannot help it. It getting difficult day by day."
395,Did you survive a suicide attempt?,"I thought it would be helpful for people to have a place to talk about the aftermath of their suicide attempts, to shed some light on what surviving is like, what happens next, how you cope, etc. ❤ Personally, I hope my experience discourages anyone from trying to complete suicide:

I attempted back in 2017 by overdosing on my prescribed antidepressants. I was found by my mom. She found me too late for my stomach to be pumped, but I was given activated charcoal, IV fluids, &amp; hooked up to a heart monitor at the hospital. I had to stay in the hospital for 2 weeks, until my heart rate was high enough for me to leave. There were no showers or restrooms in the ICU (intensive care unit). I was a senior in high school, so I had a LOT of work to catch up on. Most of my teachers only let me graduate out of empathy &amp; kindness, otherwise I would have failed 12th grade. I didn't tell my friends, so they poked fun at me for ""ditching school"" so often. I had therapy and doctor appointments constantly. I had developed anemia and tremors/my legs and arms would shake uncontrollably, which was embarrassing at school. My family was sympathetic at first, but I think they were angry that I would do this to them, that I would end my life and pass my own pain onto them to have to live with. Hospital psychiatrists instructed my family to carry on as usual &amp; act like nothing had happened in order to maintain normalcy for me while recovering, but this honestly made me feel worse, like they didn't care or even acknowledge that they'd almost lost me. The 1st year after my attempt was the HARDEST year of my life; many times, I almost wished my attempt had been successful so that I wouldn't have to be dealing with the repercussions of my actions, but most often, I wished I could take it back. I wished I had just talked to someone, even a stranger on reddit, instead of trying to end my life. it's not worth it, &amp; there are SO many better options and alternatives. it's my biggest regret. i didn't want to die, i just wanted the depression &amp; suffering to stop. in the moment, it felt like the only way out, the easiest way out. 

but 3 years later, i'm finally, for the first time in my life, HAPPY to be alive. i NEVER thought i'd say that &amp; mean it, &amp; it's taken a lot of effort just to keep moving forward &amp; force myself to keep going &amp; keep existing, but it gets easier every day, &amp; i'm so grateful to have a 2nd chance at really truly living ❤ 

&amp; i'm glad you're alive, too."
396,Hopefully this is okay..,"I don’t know if I’m allowed to say things like this here.. but I’m just so done with life and this world. I lost the one person who meant everything to me and who was the reason I wanted to actually try in this world because I saw a future with them where I could actually have an ""happily ever after"" but the possibility of that is all gone and my will to live with it. I don’t know what to do anymore, no one can help me because the way that I am simply won’t allow it and I hate myself so much for it. The way that I am is what pushed away the person whom I loved with everything I had. And if you’re wondering what I’m talking about, basically I’ve always felt different from others and I always thought it was very possible I had some sort of autistic spectrum disorder or aspergers because I have so many of the same tendencies. So I decided to take a test online that would tell me the probability of me having something like that were I to go get checked out, and my score was a little passed borderline and said I had many tendencies of someone with an autistic spectrum disorder or aspergers. I just.. don’t want to go on anymore without my love.. I don’t want anyone else. I don’t even know why I’m typing this anymore.. I’ve already self harmed today because today was just worse than the others. I guess I just don’t want to be alone.. because I’m starting to push away the last of my friends with how stupid I am. Thanks if you read this far I guess.."
397,Why do people randomly delete their account after having an argument on reddit,"I'm new to the sub, but i specifically came here to ask this question. Why do arguments we have on reddit with total strangers affect us? Everyone here is pretty much anonymous and why do our anonymous online avatars matter to us. It's not as if it can have real life manifestations. 


This may not be the case for everyone but I've seen people either deleting or leaving reddit (after announcing it) after having an account for nearly 3-4 years. That too after having an argument.

399,Does anyone like NEED people to talk to all the time so you don’t have to focus on your shortcomings or think about your life?,"Like, I used to be such a loner, I would go weeks without talking to people. I think I use it as a form of escapism because if I’m engaged in playing a game and talking to someone, watching a show and talking to someone, I’m not in my own head all the time. I need to constantly distract myself so I don’t ever look at the big picture- every time I’m alone and people on discord are asleep, I get so depressed into tears because I finally think about myself.

I hate that I learned how to distract myself, because I don’t work on myself anymore. Any time anyone says they have to go, I plan other back up plans immediately so I don’t ever have to be in my head alone for even thirty minutes. It’s so embarrassing."
400,Frequent inverted responses to tragedy,"I’m 19m and am in college. 

today, my family happened to be gathered around the t.v., when our local news was showing an interview with the father of a kid who was shot in Seattle last week. About 15 minutes in, the father started crying hysterically at which point my mom and dad also began crying. I didn’t catch myself first but i could feel my eyes light up and i started grinning uncontrollably. I looked away since seeing me grinning would likely upset my parents. 


this has been a common occurrence since I was very young. On walks, i’d see a deer and her baby fawns and would lose myself to a fantasy, where the fawns die in front of the mother and the mother deer becomes hysterical. 


Similarly, i enjoyed pushing the emotionally unstable kids buttons until they would have a melt down and be sent to the principles office, at which point i would again have this feeling of elation.



This also happens during breakups but only for the ones which I had initiated. See her heartbreak brings the same feeling. 


i know that it is a bad thing, but i’m usually not aware that it’s happening except for today. So, why does this happen and has anyone else had similar experiences?"

402,Feel like I'm sliding back in negativity,"I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense, English isn't my first language.
Also, I'm sorry if it's long.


I'm a bachelor of nursing student in Europe. In my country we have the opportunity to transfer to a working student position after the first 2 years of fulltime study. I passed those 2 years without too much trouble and with a GPA &gt;80%. 
I've always had some trouble with my perfectionism and high expectations of myself. Couldn't handle feedback well and always felt like I wasn't good enough. This caused me to get a burn out last year. Took me about 6-9 months to recover but I made it. 


Even despite covid I had never felt better. I made some huge steps in my education, can handle feedback a lot better and could cope much better with my perfectionism without it getting in my way too much in my daily life/work/school. Gained a lot of motivation to finish my school and finished some (drafts of) assignments and started some others. Did a lot more schoolwork in the last couple months than I had done in the year before. 
Made a plan and a schedule for which assignments I want to finish when and how. Even tho covid caused some more delay I was motivated to finish everything as fast as possible to try for the delay to be as little as possible. 


I sent my plan for my thesis to my school for feedback and a ""Go"" and the email I received just made me go straight back to negativity. For the last 3 days I've been feeling so so down and I just can't stop crying. My mentor, my hospital and other people involved were all on board. They said my plan looked really good and they couldn't imagine I would not get a Go for my thesis to start. And my school is just questioning if I shouldn't change my subject even tho my hospital approved.


All the motivation I had just went straight down the drain and I'm once again back to questioning my life choices. I'm too far in to just quit, although it crossed my mind A LOT in the last couple years. It's even more frustrating to see that most people I started school with are all graduating right now. I'm happy for them, I just hoped I could've been there too. I ""should have been"". And I know I've been sick. It was an all-time low but I learned a huge deal out it it. And I'm okay with graduating next semester. But with corona a lot of things came to a halt. Just now some of my projects are restarting and, albeit a little tight schedule, it wasn't impossible to finish in Feb/March.  Especially with the motivation I gained. But this feels like setback #somuch. 

I've seen some theses from fulltime grads and they are more or less the same as a research paper I had to do for an earlier assignment. It feels like I'm/we are held to a higher standard even tho the diploma will be exactly the same. My mentor agrees and some other students I've spoken to feel the same. We're expected to finish a bunch of assignments in one semester while the fulltime students get a whole year for it. Sure, half their year is an internship but we have our work to do too.


I'm just tired of all of this cause it just feels like the amount of setbacks I've experienced just never ends.
I feel like I'm going back to that negative mindset I finally got out of and I just don't know how to handle this well. I don't want to lose the positivity and motivation I finally gained but just laying in bed and crying feels much more appealing atm.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rant..."
403,It's the same shit over and over again.,"I'm only 19 but I really feel like I've lost control of myself and my life. Every morning I wake up and from that moment on it's the same shit I do everyday. I take a bath, eat, and stay in bed till it's night time. I can't find the passion I once had, the energy that filled those around me. I've never seen a face in like 3 months since the lockdown, and this isolation is slowly making me lose control more and more. 

To anyone feeling the same, I hope you find yourself soon and enjoy life! Thank you for letting me vent out my thoughts."
404,"Suicidal, Depressed Friend","I don't know where to post this and I'm sorry if it's triggering but I've had a friend who's been depressed for years and has recently been messaging alarming things alluding to him wanting to kill himself. I don't know what to do, I've tried giving as much support as I can but I'm always scared I'm going to say something wrong. I know it's not nearly as big a problem but often he messages me something very alarming and goes offline for a while in which I get so anxious my stomach starts hurting. I'm very lost as to what I'm supposed to do in this situation to make him feel better. He's rejected any suggestion of seeing a therapist. What should I do?"
405,Drained from work,"Hi everyone, don't know if this is the right place or not to post it.

I'm feeling so drained these last weeks. I don't know what is happening but I cannot seem to do anything work related anymore. I work a 9-5 job and working from home now due to corona.

Everyday when I start working I cannot seem to keep my focus and i'm distracted the entire time with social media or other stuff. It's weird, I started the job 2 years ago with a lot of ambition and there wasn't a day when I hadn't done anything. I was busy the entire time. I manage my own schedule and for the past 2 years I went all out for this company. Now, I can't do one task anymore. I'm starting to have a meltdown, every task is too much. Can't help but feeling guilty that I'm not doing shit atm. 

Beside my work I have some other projects that I also cannot bring the energy for to do that now. 

I have some vacation planned in 2 weeks. So that's a start... 

Has anyone else experienced this? What could this be? I don't know what to do about it, and I feel more guilty every second that i'm doing nothing."
406,I can' t feel genuine happiness .... Like ever,"For the longest time i thought that it was a normal thing to not feel happy , and then really good things started happening to me , and i couldn't feel ANYTHING , i felt numb , what's wrong with me ?"
407,Is it normal to still cry when I talk about my depression?,"I suffered from depression for approx an 8 year period, and it is now about 7 years since I got help and made a recovery (I still have moments, but I have definitely moved on from the worst of it). I haven't spoken to people about my depression much because I didn't tell anyone (bar 1 person &amp; medical professionals) at the time, but am now coming to a point where I want to tell people and am fed up of hiding it.

I have told a few people, but every time I think about it or talk about it, I start getting really emotional and upset, and often end up finding it hard to get the words out. I don't want this to stop me telling people about it but am concerned that I wouldn't able to have a proper conversation with people when I do - I want to be able to talk about it without dissolving into tears.

Can people tell me if it is normal to still find this so involuntarily upsetting, or whether this might mean I still haven't fully recovered/processed everything, and so should get help with it?

I have tried to look this up by doing normal internet searches but have had no success, so am hoping reddit can help me :)"
408,Helpless in Hawaii,"This is my first time using Reddit as a means of saying anything or venting in general, but lately I've been really hurting and I've come to the conclusion that I need some sort of help. I don't really know where to start with this but here goes nothing.

I'm in the military, stationed in beautiful Hawaii. A few months after I got here I began to struggle with overwhelming sadness and my job and mostly some of the people I worked with, constantly beat me into the ground. Made me feel like crap, that I couldn't do anything right, and just downright stupid. I have always been a very easygoing, happy, and confident guy, but this had really changed that a lot.

I've always struggled with being overweight, ever since I was a child. I have a very hard time maintaining a healthy diet and a healthy workout routine, unless I have good motivation, which alone is very hard for me to maintain. 

In January, I suffered a pretty bad back injury that left me unable to do most things. Even walking became very difficult for me. I was pulled away from the ship I was on, away from my crew, which is pretty much all of the friends I had made here, and sent to do much lighter work for recovery. I had friends in my crew that I would work out with, and they'd keep me motivated.

COVID-19 hit the island and everyone went into lockdown mode. So I became isolated to my small  musty barracks room. For months. During this time, I couldn't do really anything aside from play video games with friends from back home (on the East Coast). It became routine for me to go to work, come back, then play video games for the rest of my night. Wash, rinse, repeat. I couldn't work out due to my injury, so it was all I really could do.

When my friends from my old crew would have free time, I'd still hang out with them, even if it was very seldom. I'd always make sure to hang out with them when the opportunities arose. Until they left for deployment. Since they had been my only friends I made here in Hawaii, I was left alone. So there I was, all alone on this island, with no friends left, aside from East Coast friends through video games.

I have lost motivation to do anything anymore. I still do all of my duties for work, but as soon as I get out if work, I'll come home and play video games with the guys from back home, for the rest of the night. I've recovered a lot from the injury, so I can work out again (jogging, resistance cables, some bodyweight stuff), but I have little to no fire under my ass to do it. I barely have the fire to do the stretches to help my back recover, so I barely ever do them. I eat pretty unhealthy each day, and tend to snack when I'm gaming, so I feel like that has become a bad habit in general. I understand that I don't need to buy the snacks, and have even turned down my stomach when I'm in the store and it tells me I need to buy Cheetos. But a lot of times I end up buying them anyway. And I'll splurge it in one sitting. Yesterday I ate a tray of Oreos AND a tray of Chips Ahoy in one sitting, felt like shit, but I'll probably end up doing something like that again sometime in the future.

My issue is my lack of motivation to do anything anymore. I matched with someone on a dating app, talked to her for a while, set up a date, and when the date came around, I felt as though I needed to muster the motivation to even go out to meet her, and almost decided to stay home and play video games. Every night, I take a deep look at myself and find that I'm disgusted with who I am. I hate the way that my body is, but don't have the gumption to work out and change it because I feel hopeless. I feel like it'll never change, and I'll never have the body I want. I feel incredibly upset most nights. I feel as though I have nothing special about me anymore. I feel like I have become this sad blob of a man that will never amount to anything. I know that I can obtain motivation through other people (by doing things with them), but have no one here anymore. I hate my job, I am not good at it, and that really puts me down. I am just entirely unhappy, all the way around.

I feel like I can't fully describe everything about the way I feel and how it feels to me, through words in a Reddit post. I hope I can at least get the message across. I just don't know how to help myself anymore and I feel like I'm a lost cause. I just want to be normal, healthy (mentally and physically) and overall just okay."
409,I wanted to write down my feelings for the last few days. this is more like a journal with some optional advice from strangers on the internet.,"Reddit, 

I've been thinking about how I can just be alive one moment and another I won't even know I'm dead. I won't ever know I existed because there's nothing. I can't stop smoking, a habit that I ceased for around 3 months until I had to interact with my parents and family again. I feel stressed and on edge about everything I do. I just find myself going on 3-hour drives thinking about crashing and not living I can't shake that thought off my head. I feel like I'm in a hell hole country that is filled with dumb people. I can't help the feeling of wanting to be more than everyone, all I think about is money. I can't stop thinking about it, how it would solve all my problems,  but would it really do that? I mean I'm not poor or rich. I live decently, but a poor person would say I live like a ""king"", but in contrast, a rich person would say I live like a peasant. I try to reason that we'll always want the next level in our lives, let's say I make it and get a private jet. how much time until I want a bigger jet? or what if I fail? I couldn't live with myself. I feel that I live in a world that won't ever change and that everything I touch is destined for failure. it sounds stupid and irrational until you see my track record of everything involved with me failing to succeed.

My cousin came to my house for a week, I thought that him being here would lighten the mood with my parents. It didn't lighten anything, everything still the same. I can't stop drinking regularly and smoking over 2 paks a week currently. I feel like crap and I just can't stand it. I just want to go back to college, get rid of my parents, and see them once a year at Christmas. just to be a ""decent human"" whatever that means. I'm a fucking piece of garbage, no doubt about that.

my rant with horrible grammar and redaction, but It's just my thoughts as they go. 

Thanks and auf wiedersehen.

410,My anchors are internet and my freinds.,is it weird that I need internet or my freinds around to anchor me otherwise I start spiralling and panicking.
411,I don’t know what is going on with me but it has got to be something involving a drug induced psychotic type of mental disorder,"About two years back I started experiencing voices in my head, hallucinating, colossal anxiety to the point where I would sweat. Don’t know what the fuck type of mental disorder I have but I have or had something because it’s starting to go away, very very, very slowly. But I’m noticing changes. It could even be just the affects the drugs and booze had on my brain because when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with adhd and add and Tourette’s, and I didn’t stop taking meds for that until I was around 16-17 and that’s right around the time I started getting addicted to drugs and alcohol. 

So I think with all those pills and drugs and booze mixed together over the years, it was a recipe for disaster so to speak. But I’m noticing now that it is slowly but nonetheless starting to go away, Hit a year sober last month. Never fucking again will I inhale or drink anything for as long as I live. I will die and sleep forever with my ancestors before I ever inhale, snort, pop, drink or light up anything for as long as I breathe. 

But the good news is I think My mind is very slowly starting to heal, I’m also trying to quit porn addiction and just fapping in general (not trying to give you too much information but aggressive porn use and fap use targets the same areas drugs and alcohol too and that shit has some side affects of its own) striving for 100% complete sobriety, I don’t think it would hurt to start eating a little bit better cause I still eat like dogshit. If you see this and are struggling severely with drugs or alcohol, porn whatever your addiction is, quit now, right now. Or at least start the journey that leads to eventual sobriety and curb kicking of whatever you’re addicted too. If you’re still reading after all that thank you for reading, whatever you’re struggling with, I hope god blesses you with eventual peace at the end of your journey."
412,Anything. I’m going to attempt sleep. I don’t even know what to call this,"I’ve been drunk or self sedated for over two years. I’ve had jobs, friends, women, booze, opiates and the bare necessities I need to function and maintain a static weight. All of this was to tranquilize my brain function. Not to a stop but not close to full. A medium that I could still function in my work. All money to supply the fog I was looking for to cloud my judgement. I’ve been a degenerate for over two years now and I knew what I was doing. 
I’m fucking awake now. It worked. I got the toxic aspects I filed somewhere deep back. I don’t know where. Something unconscious stopped my routine cold turkey almost 4 days ago. 
I’ve been awake since. I’ve not had a drink, a pill, or a craving. My thoughts are concise, ordered and direct. I can’t even remember why I decided that my egotistical ways were to be put away. 
I’m not looking for anyone’s validation, pity, or any emotion. What is going on? I didn’t slowly develop a stutter. It’s just there in full force now. Ive done some work in public speaking so I’m well acquainted with my diction, speed, and dynamics. Where my words used to fall out of my mouth while inebriated giving me a deep southern voice. It’s at least a pitch higher and cleaned up now. It’s sharp, pointed even. 
This isn’t delusion. I’m having a few barely noticeable visual manipulations of shadows on the wall when a vehicle drives by my window, and the reflection comes through the blinds. 
I’ve been fucked up before. I’m stone cold sober now. I’ve yet to have a single symptom of withdrawal. The skin on my calves is a bit tight. I blame that on sitting Indian style for hours at a time trying to figure out where and what the hell iv’e done without alerting anyone that anything is wrong. I feel good, great even. I remember parts, chapters, slivers, just enough to get a girlfriend that apparently loved that slob I’d been. I know things about her and feel her care. I have never felt many emotions or highs that weren’t self induced. 
I’ve not taken any hallucinogens or substance that would skew my perception in the time frame  which they would still be having an effect. 
She, Shiann... is looking at me like a stranger, but I know her. She first noticed my voice being off and this stutter which twitches like muscle spasms on my bottom lip.  
I’m going to attempt sleep soon. My old mind is running so hard that I swear I can smell static. 
No stroke, overdose, or seizure symptoms. I’m 28 years old with a slim build. 
I got my motivation to succeed back, and direction. I’m not asking from where. I’ve had her for supervision as well. 
I’ve never been a violent person, I don’t feel a trace of the hate that used to run through me. I told my friends/family I was manic depressive to give an excuse for highs and lows. They don’t really question anything. I’ve never understood that. I’ve always been fairly intelligent. I don’t know how. 
There’s much more. I need sleep then some real sleep. 
I’ve never had to try at academics or athletics. Sociable, but my sense of competition drove me. Never good to be that guy, or is it? I feel not like a drunk drug addict kicking a habit. I feel the want for better things immediately. I’m disgusted by my situation. I’ve studied psychology since I was a teen into college courses. I’m familiar with a lot. These aren’t manic claims. I’m not boasting, these are the facts. I’m lucid, no past deviations from reality, or delusions. No history of disassociation. I’m worried. I’ve never heard of anything like this. I’m afraid to attach a positive to the way I’ve felt these past 72 hours or so. It’s not fleeting, but I want to make sure. ANY explanation? 
Leave all Gods in your head. I have enough going on in mine without the nonsense. Religion can take credit for anything it wants. Besides this. This is real. I’m no risk to anyone or myself. The suns coming up. Anything?"
413,Am I apathetic?,"Hello wonderful people!
My question is am I apathetic? I am currently in a relationship and it's going great but sometimes I get lack of feeling for the person or anything else for a few hours then they will come back and it back and forth. This isn't the only thing, I have a 33600 peice puzzle and I have been doing it for a year now however I constantly lose motivation to do it and I could care less if it went up in flames. However later that week I'll be motivated to continue it without fail. It's the same with video games and everything else in my life. Family is a problem for some days I love them to bits and other days I could watch them all die and not care at the time I don't feel anything however later in the day I would absolutely care and be very upset. I could go on about everything that it affects. 
My past is a mess so that might be the cause as I was emotionally neglected as a child and a whole other tale if needed I'll put in. 
Am I apathetic if not what is wrong with me?"
414,I'm not gay stop judging me on my looks,"I get comments all the time asking ""if I'm gay"" or ""are you trans"" like fucking no. I have a short pixie cut because I personally prefer that over have long hair because it's just easier and I think it shows confidence but people think it's a sign of gayness? Now I don't like labels if I wanna fuck a girl I'll fuck a girl no label needed I say I'm straight as to the fact that I've never have feelings for a girl before. We live in a society that makes people judge things on looks like if I see a man on the street holding up a sign that says ""help me, anything helps"" I can judge that, that man is homeless but I don't go OH he's probably gay and a disappointment and his family killed his sister like no. When I tell people I'm straight I get weird looks as to say ""yeah, suuureeeee"" some people think I'm being sarcastic and I'm a sarcastic person but you can tell if I being serious or not and when I say I'm fucking straight IM FUCKING STRAIGHT. I really don't care when people think I'm a dude tho it's funny to me and I can't blame them in wear baggy clothes. But when I get ask the same damn question over and over and over and over again I get frustrated. It's just something I hate about society they think they know everything just because of someones looks. But whatever you can't change society."
415,It’s been one year ago since I went to a mental hospital (F24),"Last year ago yesterday I entered a mental hospital. I met amazing people with inspirational stories. I stayed there for nine days, and I had to go back in August due to medication not being compatible. Looking back today I can’t believe it’s been a year. I was in such a different mind set last year. I don’t really know how to process this to be honest. I feel sad honestly. I’m also questioning my future right now as well. I’m unsure about how a potential romantic relationship will go. I’m scared to get a job. I also get a lot of anxiety trying to do my summer school homework. My friend was telling me last night how I need to be more confident of who I am. But like not to be sappy lol but who I am?"
416,"i cant get over feeling embarrassed about being raped, and its causing lasting issues to myself.","when I was 16 i was raped by a man who was in his 40s. at the time i didn’t know it was rape and it sounds so stupid im mad at myself just typing this out. i was raised extremely christian (like only allowed to wear skirts and dresses and everyone goes to hell type christian) and was extremely naive about sex.  

Robert was a man i kind of knew but not really, he would sometimes give me pink starbursts for some reason and he would talk to me about a lot of different things that i genuinely enjoyed and he was funny but he’d also constantly start sexual conversations with me, but never about me and him. the conversations made me uncomfortable but i enjoyed our other conversations too much to avoid him. also ngl i was curious about the sexual things he’d talk about because i knew little about it. 

one day the i sensed the energy was extremely different because the day before we had had a really good conversation about writing (i wanted to be a writer) and we said we’d continue it but then this day when i tried he wouldn’t continue it, he would just persist on sexual questions and jokes. he told me that when i get older i’d understand that i actually didn’t want to save myself for marriage because men didn’t want someone who didnt know what they were doing in bed, then he asked if he could show me how to do it and i laughed and said no, and then he apologized like crazy to the point where he started crying so i apologized too and then he “confessed” that he loved me and that he wanted to marry me when i was 18  and he kept asking if i would marry him one day and i kept avoiding the question until i finally said yes which i guess he took as a yes to me wanting to have sex with him. 

i was strangely okay with everything after that, the part i felt the worst about was “not being a virgin anymore”, but at the same time i was kind of relieved i wasnt too. 

im 22 now. and that was the first time i ever told that story with details, ive told a few friends and my current boyfriend that i was sexually assaulted by a man and i twist the story to make it seem like i didnt let it get that far because subconsciously i dont feel like anyone who wasn’t raised like me will really understand how stupid i was about things like this. i also never told my parents. 

around 17 i was diagnosed with DID and that was something my parents had to deal with for a while, i ended up burning down our home when i wasnt in the right state of mind at 19 and went to jail for a little bit (parents still love me though) and then now im 22 and maybe this is all coming up now because its been three years since my trial for the fire and my record is about to get expunged. ive just been thinking a lot about my life and wondering if i’d feel better or worse if i told more people about this.  

i have a wonderful boyfriend that i live with who doesn’t know, but im afraid of telling him wanting to find him or get cops involved or anything like that. plus its been so long. 

i also do this extremely fucked up thing where i dont fully support other women as much as i should who come out as sexual abuse survivors because i have this extremely fucked up way of thinking like, if i cant talk about mine i dont want to hear about yours/ if i dont victimize myself why are you victimizing yourself mentality which i know is toxic and i accidentally did it to my friend who was also raped which i know makes me so shitty. its almost like im angry at my friends for not being there for me even though i refuse to tell anyone what i need them for, which i know is my fault. 
  
in the end i want this to stop, but also after years i cant bring myself to talk about it with anyone and still holding on to hoping i can handle my feelings on my own."
417,Is what I’m doing normal ?,"For years, I found myself to be extremely hard to define. What do I mean by that? Well, whenever someone says “I just don’t feel like myself today.”, I don’t understand it because I don’t know what it’s like to be “myself.” Ever since I was little, I would often observe someone and copy their exact personality. Reaching the teens, I watched TV shows and watched how actors acted, I would often go look at myself in the mirror and copy the same expressions. The thing is, I act so much to the point that these copied personalities became as though they’re my own. Whenever I switch to another, I’d completely forget which I was. You could say it’s kinda like a short term memory loss, except that memory is regained within 10-20 mins. 

The thing is, I can’t trust or understand myself because I can’t differentiate which one is an act and which is the ‘genuine’ me. My self-image constantly changes, along with my goals, my likes, my hates and my opinions etc. 

Not only that, but I realised I lacked apathy as a kid. My great grandmother died when I was 6, but I just didn’t feel sad about it to make me cry. Everyone was crying at this scene, so I copied the same thing, but I wasn’t sad, or maybe I just didn’t understand the concept of death at this age? 

About my emotions, I wouldn’t say I’m completely emotionless but most of the time I seem to be apathetic, which I thought was normal until I was told. Often times, I feel empty, but not depressed. I don’t think about suicidal thoughts and I wouldn’t try to kill myself either, but I do think about when and how I’ll die but I don’t seem to care about it. It’s like this, “I won’t kill myself, but if my death comes near, I won’t avoid it.” Am I taking ‘death’ to lightly? Maybe I am, maybe I’m not.

I have more to tell, but I’ll keep this short.

So let me ask again, am I normal? Or do I have mental issues?"
418,My close friend abandoned me and I can't get over it,"Hey, I don't really know how to start this since I've never actually made a Reddit post before. But I need help. I'll start from the beginning, but I'll remove some content to try to keep myself anonymous as possible.

So from a pretty young age, about 13, I was really badly bullied and had issues at home. Because of this I developed pretty severe social anxiety and depression. Along with this came fierce trust issues and even a bit of seperation anxiety. 
When I started highschool, it was really hard. And I mean, REALLY HARD. I had no one but my equally as anxious best friend and her boyfriend to keep me company. So when I met a boy, who we'll call Alex, I was thrilled but also terrified. We became close really quickly, and he introduced me to more people and I started coming out of my shell. I also started therapy around this time. My depression was gone by this point.
Eventually, me and Alex started dating. Which was a pretty bad move, honestly. I didn't trust him fully since we got together about 3-2 months after our first meeting. Because of my trust issues and anxiety, I panicked and ended it. 
After a while, we became friends again. One of my other friends, who I'll call Anna, started dating Alex. A whole big thing happened where I was accused of liking him and he was accused of liking me and blah blah blah. Going back to my anxiety and trust issues, I really trusted Alex at this point, and I didn't have romantic feelings for him anymore, so it stung quite a lot when we stopped talking because of it.
i had a crash on the Christmas holiday where I just laid in my bed alone. Nobody spoke to me for a month because of that situation, I lost all my friends except two. My best friend randomly texted me out of the blue after a whole three weeks. It was a rough time.
So when Alex randomly started speaking to me again at the start of this year, I was thrilled. Something I have to mention is Alex and Anna have a VERY on-and-off relationship. This is where this story catches up to the present. They broke up again. I texted Alex and told him I was there for him and it was ok to be upset, and he said that he was thankful, and that I had always been an amazing friend to him. At this point, I trusted Alex with my life, and I'm known for my loyalty, so nothing would make me give up the friendship we had. I valued it a lot. 
Next day, Alex and Anna are back together, and Alex won't even look me in the eye. I just assumed he was having a bad day, because everyone does. Next day was the same. And the next. And that turned into a week, then another. We had our exams, still wouldn't even smile at me. Just blank glances in my direction before he completely brushed me off. I'm pretty sure that Anna said she would only get back with him if he stopped speaking to me.
I get that. I want Alex to be happy, and if Anna makes him feel that, then I'm glad. But what broke me is the fact that he went around this situation in a way that would be easy for him, but he knew would hit me the hardest. I've been told by my friends that we were close. It's hard to put into words how upsetting this is for me, but it's like I'm being stabbed over and over. I trusted him, and told him things nobody else knows. It's suffocating. I can't count the amount of times I've sobbed my heart out behind the curtains in the stageroom, or I've ran out of class, or I've hidden in the bathroom, or countless other things so I could go cry to myself. It's hard on my best friend too. I'm normally a very tough person, and I refuse to cry around people. She hadn't seen my cry once until this situation. I've been reported my teachers and pulled out of class to talk about it, I've been sleeping in and missing Homeroom, and my parents have noticed a shift in my behaviour as much as I try to hide it. I've honestly thought many times ""it hurts to be alive"", and I keep asking myself whether he ever even cared.

I really don't know what to do. I'm scared for myself, and I'm so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone have advice?"

420,How have you overcome your low self esteem issues,"How have you gotten over low self esteem issues. 

I'm pretty sure that I have it . I know that's it's not healthy for me to have such issues . But whenever I try something to improve it , I see myself plunging deeper into abyss where I destroy my self worth more and fall down more in my eyes . 

One of the major reasons for this is that I think that despite being 26, I have missed out on a lot of life experience which people my age have . This results in me putting them in a higher hierarchy than me and myself on the bottom end of it.Sometimes it's so bad that I cry in my bed for an hour or so and after that my mind starts spiralling into a lot of scenarios all of which have negative outcome for me .

Has anyone ever been able to successfully get over this and how did you do ?"

422,"Random depression, hormonal? Wait for it to pass? Help.","So I’ve had depressive episodes in the past and deal with some anxiety here and there. But it’s always always triggered by something. Usually the end of something, like school, university, a job, or when there is significant change in my life that scares me. However, last week I was randomly feeling anxious for a few days and then proceeded to have a panic attack which confused me so much as there was zero trigger. Since then I’ve been in this weird sort of daze where I’m just waiting to go back to me and how I usually feel? I have PCOS and I’m due on my periods so wondering if maybe it’s due to hormonal changes making my body feel funny and thus making my brain react in this way? In past depressive episodes (I think I’ve only had one or two) I literally would sleep all day, couldn’t bear the thought of doing anything and would cry so much. Was completely in my own world and was shitscared. This time round I feel oddly normal and functional, able to eat and shower and do whatever but I just feel so OFF, like I said - waiting to return to ‘me’ like I’ll close my eyes for 10 seconds, open them again and BAM I’ll be back to my normal self immersed in life. It’s like I feel like we are normally an autopilot going around doing our daily duties, laughing, having fun whatever and being immersed in life, and then suddenly that anxiety and panic attack took me out of that and I can’t get back to how I was before and what is ‘normal’ for me and I keep having this impending feeling that this is how I’m going to feel forever and I will never go back to me and I will just be this shell of myself in this alternate reality trying to crawl my way back into myself and that life. 
I can’t emphasise enough how much I think this is hormonal cause it’s so bodily. It’s like usually I will have a trigger and thought process that leads me to spiral and get to a weird state but this time it happened so physically. I feel like maybe it will pass when I come on my period but since I’m so stressed I feel like my period is getting delayed? Idk? I’m just so scared I’ll be like this forever, I can’t live like this."
423,Blame, I know it's not my fault but how do I get over the feeling that there is something wrong with me when the fact is I have been sexually abused or raped by nearly every man in my life since I was a kid. Like clearly I have to do something wrong and I just can't shake the feeling of shame and anxiety I carry with me everyday over it.
424,I have a Zoom meeting and I can’t stop crying,"But at least I have a day off tomorrow. 

I’ve been working 13-hour days (office work) and haven’t been doing too hot lately.

I’m concerned they’re going to let me go.

Things are messy right now. 

I just need a hug."
425,Why do I feel the need to lie/exaggerate things?,"I don't think I'm a pathological or compluslive liar because I don't do it really often, and it's not about big things. It's about small things and I exaggerate what happens

Like I was skateboarding and I texted my friend, and I went down a hill, but I texted them I was like ""almost fell while riding down the hill haha"" it's like to make something seem cooler than what actually happened.

It's always for small stuff like that, never anything bigger and I'm aware that I'm doing it, and I'm like why am I doing this?

I recently found out I have borderline personality disorder, is it part of that?

Or like when friends are discussing grades, if they all did better than me, I'll make my grade better, or if all of them did worse than me, I'll say I got lower so they feel better.

Is this bad? I'm aware of what I'm doing, and it's never doing any harm, but should I tell my therapist about this?"
426,I cant stop feeling anxious while doing simple things.,"I used to be a regular movie person but Now I can’t even confidently decide what movie to watch without thinking “this movie is kind of depressing and I can’t deal with anything like that right now” and I think that for all the movies. In the back of my head I think I don’t want to feel anything at all. I need to know if it’s a thing?!

My recent ex-boyfriend once swore at me and broke up with my cruelly and then we got back together the next day after he apologised but he made me feel like a liar and an untrustworthy person for telling my best-friend about him swearing at me. He said “you should’ve kept our private matters to ourselves. Now I can’t ever trust you”. After that I stopped talking about our relationship with everybody and I reduced contact with my best-friend too.

Yesterday, I called my best friend after a long time and I couldn’t help but feel anxious while talking to him which resulted in messing up and slurring my words and not being able to form meaningful sentences.

I’m am an introvert, who is depressed and has somehow managed to isolate herself from everybody ( I think my ex might have had something to do with that ). I just need some advice or opinion on what this might be? Is it an introvert thing? Or a side effect of a toxic relationship?

(More context: my ex used to get irrationally angry at me sometimes and scared the living crap out of me but always excused himself by saying that he’s depressed *which is true* and has lots of mood swings

AND I was diagnosed with depression recently but I think I’m dealing with it pretty well.)

so, what can I do to feel less anxious while doing simple things like talking to a friend and selecting movies?"
427,Need help- Parents can't understand,[removed]
428,Emotional BAlance please,"I sometimes feel like crying, and I want to, but I just cant. I have been in therapy ever since I was 12, I am 20 now, my parents are divorced and have been for 7 years. Between then and now I have developed an Anxiety disorder, which I was in Treatment for in a Clinic for 6 months. I now have that under control. When they divorced I was 13, we moved to Europe and my father stayed in the US. I yearn for the past, because the future is too imminent. I also have Narcassistic Traits, which cloud my judgment sometimes. I feel like my emotions are at a Constant state of distance from my own self and being. I havent had a solid relationship, because of the disruption of my emotional development. I dont lack social skills, I have plenty of friends and get invited enough, sometimes more than I want or need. I feel like I am scared to commit. My relationship with my mom is not good, we fight often, and I lack empathy towards her. I want to feel guilt and empathic when she starts crying, but I feel like I cant. She says I lack empathy in General. I dont know, I can cry during some movies, but over a person feels difficult. And I know that if she does get sick, that it will be partially my fault, she has said this to me, but even before I knew it is true. I am angry that I cant cause her less stress, and seem to push and oust all that to the side. For some reason I sometimes look forward to sadness, and to that moment where people point fingers towards me when she gets sick. I dont want her to get sick and I do love her alot though, and its important to me how she feels and how she is doing. But our relationship hasnt been based on feelings, since I do not feel comfortable sharing mine with her. One could describe it as cold, from my perspective. My father and I arent that close either, I would describe the Relationship as the same, except that we dont fight often, 1. because he lives far away 2. because I feel more respect towards him. I dont have suicidal thoughts, but when things get bad, it calms me to think that in death there is no bother. I am not suicidal. That was actually one of my anxieties growing up, thinking that I am. I Think that it crosses my mind as such because of need of attention, I never say it out loud though. As I am typing this I am scared that you will title me as such. Usually I am happy, and I think I do have a Good life, but I dont have any aspirations. I just finished school, and it is sad to see everyone leave. A good relationship, is what Im missing and I hope that is what can balance my emotions. Its not the problem of look skills as I have had turned down a few in the past, but a problem of commitment I think, any tips? UPDATE: I seem to have more bad luck in love than i thought. Recently I came into closer contact with a friend of mine. We stayed up multiple nights writing eachother, and sending voice messages, laughing so hard we couldnt breathe. She was even angry when i said that her best friend distracted me because she had also texted me at the same time. This plus many other indicators where I even asked my boys if this is finally the time for me to gain at least some stability. Each of them said that it was a 8/10 chance. All that just to find out that she has a boyfriend. The person before her was a Sociopath, who also manipulted me, and screwed me. And now her? Im slowly starting to give up. With no aspirations in life, and the law cutting down on my hobby (graffiti) this would have been the highlight and the reason to keep my head up. But once again, no. Im starting to give up, please help-I dont know what to do. I feel empty. Im literally the meme ""funny guy at school and depressed at home."" I feel like thats all Im good for, to be laughed at, and other than that a no good."

430,I don't know what to do.,[removed]
431,What is wrong with me?,"I always considered myself as a positive person and never had any problems with my mental health. Now I noticed that  every little mistake I make turns in my eyes as the end of the world and I'm getting extremely anxious about random things. Im completely losing my concentration, I write something down to remember it but I write it wrong (dates, numbers) and that causes mess. I don't know how to deal with it. Today I supposed to have an appointment and I wrote it down for tomorrow so it had to be rescheduled because of me. That made me feel like a total fail. On top of that I feel so stressed when I talk to someone I don't know that I cry afterwards, because I overthink that something I said makes me look stupid. What can cause this? I have a perfect family and everything in my life goes great so why I feel like am not enough and stressed about things like that. Can it be something in my subconscious that sits in the past?"
432,"I hate sexuality, but I don't want to","Hey all, this is going to be something of a vent, but I am curious if anyone feels the same or has any advice. I was told about sex from a very young age, to the point where I actually don't remember learning what it was, but one of my first memories is remembering what it was. I was always told it is a totally natural thing, but that it should be done safely and with someone you love. All awesome there, good advice.

Jump to me at 13, I'm very confused about what my sexual orientation could be, and I can tell from porn that I can attracted to both genders. So, instead of deciding that I was bi, I decided that I had control over my sexuality. At the time I had a friend who was 16, and one day while we were hanging out he introduced me to this married couple in their 20s he had been sexting very regularly. They took some kind of interest in me, and before I knew what was really going on I was sending naked pictures of myself to pedophiles over the internet. The worst part about it was that I was convinced it was my choice, and what I wanted.

For a long time after I stopped speaking with them I just kept on believing that it was my choice, despite the significant cognitive dissonance required to keep believing that, and that for some reason I just enjoyed pretending to be taken advantage of, or something like that. Essentially I believed it to just be a facet of my sexuality, because I didn't want to believe I had been abused, or that I was ever not in control of my own actions.

Jump forward again to last year, I tell one of my closest friends about what had happened while we were talking about embarrassing stories. She was very determined to make sure I understood that I was just a kid, and that it wasn't my fault. Let me tell you, that opened up a big can of psychological worms. It felt like I lost control, or realized that I never had control to begin with. That realization had realistically been inside me the whole time, and explains a lot of my timidness towards sex through my teen years.

Either way, at this point I've come to hate whatever mechanism in my mind convinced me to go along with those people. I still want to be in a relationship, I want to be in love, and I want to have sex, but every time those feelings cross my mind I feel like a demon is whispering in my ear. Some ancient horny ghost of my ancestors that possesses me from time to time.

So, I'm sorta stuck. My emotional response to sexuality has been totally warped, and I don't know how to change that, or if it's even possible anymore. I'm very confused all in all, so I apologize if any of this seems contradictory. If it does, it's because I had significantly contradicting thoughts, and that's very much a part of the problem. Thanks anyone who read this far, and I hope you have a wonderful day!"

434,What’s it called when you wake up with a strong sense of dysphoria?,"Not gender dysphoria, just general dysphoria. Like you’re in a bad dream. Everything feels wrong, and you can’t figure out what it is. Information that’s usually normal is suddenly a bit scary. Overall, it’s an uneasy state to be in. What is it?

438,Do your memories have emotional value?,[removed]
439,Feeling humiliated by something very minor that someone said to me,"I don't know why this has affected me this much today, but at midday I was in line at a cafe in my work building to get lunch and this old guy in a wheelchair tries to get past so I quickly move out of the way to show courtesy. Since there wasn't much room to move there due to some tables in the way, I had to go a fair distance out of the line to get out of his way and he remarked to me ""geez, I wouldn't have run ya over"". To me it sounded like he was sarcastic but it couldve just been his old-fashioned sense of humour, yet it still got to me. When I moved out of his way, part of me was still stuck in social distancing mode so it was almost like i quickly jumped out of the way (note in my city we've pretty much eliminated it and they've lifted social distancing rules). 

I think the reason its gotten to me is that his remark made me feel weak and I feel like social distancing has made me sensitive and I feel like I need to harden up. I know this is the wrong way to think and I hate myself for feeling this way, but I don't know how to get rid of these negative thoughts without resorting to some sort of reckless behaviour to make myself feel stronger and more in control. Another part of it is there were a lot of people around me and I know they probably don't care or didn't notice, but in my head it feels like my weakness was exposed to them and that seems to magnify the embarassment.

I mostly felt better as the day past and I forgot about it but now for some reason at night right before I'm going to bed the incident suddenly popped up in my head again and those feelings of feeling weak and humiliated have resurfaced again. I just know that everytime I go to that cafe I will be reminded of that incident and that feeling of embarassment will come flooding back again, kinda like I'm naked in public and everyone's staring at me. This seems to occur quite a lot with me at other places, where I will be afraid to go to because of a single tiny incident that normally to other people would be insignificant - is this what Agoraphobia is?"
440,"For the first time in over a decade, I’m really, truly happy.","I don’t intend this as some sort of brag post, and I apologize if it comes off that way. It’s more that I want to share my real-life example of how that “It gets better” slogan can sometime be true. I guess I also just want to put it into actual words. Part of me still can’t believe it, but I’m happy.

My brother asked me the other day if I was doing alright, as I seemed a little short tempered to him. This came as a surprise to me, as I’ve been feeling pretty good. No, I replied, I’m doing pretty well. The thought stuck with me though, and the more I thought about it the more I realized it was true. I’m happy right now. Really, genuinely happy. I feel, for the first time since I graduated High School in 2007, if not “in control” of my life (which I’ve come to believe is a complete fiction, NO ONE is “in control” of their life), then at least like it isn’t spinning out wildly like some Hellish, broken carnival ride.

I’m Bipolar 2, with GAD and ADHD for flavor. Of course, I didn’t always know this. My parents thought a lot of my emotional problems were diet related growing up (I’ve got some hypoglycemia, history of Type 2 Diabetes in the family…). They did take me to a therapist in 7th grade who I stonewalled for all six sessions. It wasn’t until I moved to the other side of the country for college that my issues became horribly, crystalline clear.

I couldn’t function. At all. I lived in the dorm but avoided my roommates or any other variety of socialization. I stopped eating. I did my best to go to classes but eventually I couldn’t handle that either. I stopped attending. I stopped answering my parent’s phone calls. I didn’t get out of bed. Those first two semesters, I flunked nearly everything. By the end of the year, I tried to kill myself.

The next solid decade was a rinse-and-repeat of depression, doctors, medications, therapy, lies, community college, awful part-time jobs, and a deeply felt, vicious self-loathing. I hated myself. I hated what an absolute fucking failure I was, what an idiot, what a screw-up. I thought I was a burden to the people around me. I wished I was dead.

It took me all 10+ of those years to learn how to manage my anxiety. I learned through trial and error which CBT techniques really worked for me and employed them regularly. I had to learn how to ask for help and, perhaps even more importantly, that asking for help wasn’t shameful, that I was doing the right thing for everyone by reaching out to the people who still loved me. I figured out how to spot the early symptoms of a depressive episode, and that alerting my support network and making sure I stuck to a dedicated routine would help me stave off the worst of it. I started exercising twice a week.

Over time --with innumerable stumbles, set-backs, and repetition-- I began to feel like I could manage my symptoms. Eventually, I went back to school. Last year, after a decade-long battle, I graduated with an BS from a small but respectable university. I almost immediately lucked into a good job in my desired field.

I started to feel confident again, and at 29 I started dating. I’d only done so a little before, always feeling like I was too “crazy” for a real relationship, like I couldn’t put that fucked-up baggage on somebody else, that no one would want a crazy girl anyway. But when I started dating, something unimaginably wonderful happened. I fell in love for the first time. I even told him about the Bipolar and the Anxiety, and while it was pretty rocky immediately after (man, did he ask some WTF questions, but that’s a story for another time), we sorted it out and he was an open and understanding listener. We’ve been together over a year and a half now. We have a beautiful, sweet dog named Finn.

So when my brother asked me if I was doing okay, it really hit me that, yes, I was. Things definitely aren’t perfect (my boyfriend's family, oh man!), but I finally feel like I’m doing okay. Like the future could be net positive, if not always easy.

If you’re in the dark right now and you know with absolute certainty that you can’t get out, I just want to say that you’re not Nostradamus and no one can know the future. It might take longer --much, much longer-- than you’d like, but you can climb out of the dark place. If that sounds like pie-in-the-sky, then, trust me, I’m as surprised as you are to find out it’s not.

Stay safe, and be well."
441,"idk if this is the right place for this question, but is this a conflict of interest?","so i was seeing a great therapist for 7-8 months ago last year. i had stopped seeing her because i went back to school. she is the guidance counselor at my mom's school, but also does private practice. ive been feelin ""iffy"" again and tried another therapist but the one i tried seeing a few days ago wasn't a good match for me. i want to go back to my old therapist, but my mom had told me that now she is a higher position of power at her school (so basically her boss). is it a conflict of interest if my old therapist is now her boss?"

445,A teacher at my school disclosed my private information and made horrible comments to someone elses parents in a private meeting.,"(Trigger warning for talk of suicide/self harm, just an FYI)

A teacher at my school which I have just finished my final year at disclosed my private confidential information to someone elses parents in a private meeting - and because it was said in a private meeting, I cant complain to the school about a breach of my private information.

In a little bit of background, the teacher (let's call him Mr F) was my English teacher 4 years ago and has NOT spoken to me since he was my teacher, so he is basing everything off what I was like 4 years ago. In that year, about a month before the end of the academic year, my best friend (who im going to call S) committed suicide at 13, and I was devastated. I had never lost someone before, let alone through suicide, and I really didnt react well. I didnt cope very well at all, I was missing lessons a lot, refusing to talk to people, and I also got a safety concern put in about me because I broke down in tears telling a teacher who was worried about me that I wanted to die and I was self harming. What was worse was people spreading rumours and I was actively blamed by people in my academic year group for ""making her kill herself"" and some kids even threatened to report me and get me charged with manslaughter, but I always thought the teachers were on my side, always telling me that it wasnt my fault and trying to stop the bullying as best they could.

Unsurprisingly, it has taken a long long time for me to come to terms with what happened - I was 14, for christ's sake - and mental health for me has been up down all around. However I have improved with coping with it over the past 4 years. I made a new friend in July (who we will call R) and in September time, they had a mental breakdown and severe mental health crisis, self harm and suicidal ideation, all of that - they wouldnt let go of my hand, so a teacher and I took them to the Blue Room (sort of like a safe mental health space for students having a crisis) and we waited for their Head of Year to turn up - surprise surprise it was Mr F. He took R to a separate room to wait for their parents to arrive and have a meeting, and I went home as it was the end of the day and my mum was waiting to pick me up.

After R's meeting with Mr F and their parents, things did improve for them and I'm really pleased that a lot of stuff got sorted out, but then I found out from R what Mr F said.

In this meeting which was meant to be strictly about R, somehow I became one of the matters of discussion in the meeting even though I wasnt present - present in the meeting were R's parents and Mr F, nobody else - and things started to delve into private matters. R's parents knew that my best friend S had died a few years back but I dont like telling people that she killed herself because people make insensitive comments and it makes me feel awful - but they quickly found out that S took her own life because Mr F fucking TOLD THEM about MY personal history which R wasnt even involved in. R wasnt even at the school when my best friend died. R then told me that comments were made by Mr F about my ""fragile"" mental stability, the fact that I had been referred 3 times for mental health crisis and I was receiving counselling and then said this:

""I'm not sure what you expect hanging out with (my name). All he does is walk around and make other people depressed and unhappy, there have been...incidents...in the past (continues to tell R's parents about my confidential information)

I couldnt fucking believe it. This teacher, who had not said a WORD to me in 4 years, was telling someone else's parents about my private and confidential information WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE and did it in a ""private meeting"" in hope that I wouldnt find out and if I did, I have absolutely no evidence to bring against the school or that teacher. I cant do anything about it and I'm so upset that he would tell someone else's parents about my private personal life just to prove a point and find a scapegoat for why R was struggling with their mental health, even though R was struggling with mental health BEFORE we met. I feel horribly, horribly violated, like I'm not deserving of my own private information. I dont know what to do, I want an apology but I know I will never get one because I cant prove anything, even if R or R's parents confirm that it was said.

I have blamed myself for my friend's death for a long time and I was bullied relentlessly for it but I never ever thought that a teacher, someone who I am meant to trust, would do something like that and essentially use me as a scapegoat for something. I was so terrified that I was making people feel like that, I avoided making friends, only to finally put myself out there as part of my 4-year long recovery before university and be shot down by someone who is meant to have a duty of safeguarding students, including by KEEPING THEIR INFORMATION PRIVATE even if in private meetings. I feel so hopeless having been set back so far, I dont know what to do anymore. How can i ever trust someone again after all of this if they're just going to turn around and tell people my private stuff behind my back and behind closed doors so they can get away with it and I supposedly dont find out. I was over my self harm, I thought I had done it, but now I'm not so sure."

Past 1 month I've been getting scolded by my service delivery manager for everything, even when it's not my fault I'm still getting scolded. I.e. I'm doing work and I didn't see my phone of a message sent by my service delivery, and I got scolded for not looking at my phone for the message. When I'm literally sitting behind him and he knows I was super busy.

My colleague has resigned. And Its not gonna be more hectic is just that past 1 month I've been getting too much scolding and I feel so scared to go to work. I feel so tired cause I've been working from 9am to 10pm almost daily.

My main team with me main manager back in the main office that I belong to had told me to just hang in there for few more months. However my mentors at work has told me to ignore my service delivery managers scolding and just do my work as much as I can. And errors are very common in the  IT industry.


But i don't know how to deal with this scolding daily. I feel so hurt tired, exhausted. I cry every night before I go to bed. I've thought of resigning but my main manager has told me to just hang in there as he's finding a new partner for me to share the load with.

Should I resign or just hang in there?

I don't know how to deal with the constant scolding. I keep crying every night. I can't deal with it much more. I've thought of suicide a few times but I know that's not the option.

I try to skip as much sleep as possible just to avoid it, but I obviously can't stay awake forever. Tonight is the worst it's ever been. I as able to sleep for 4 hours total (not all at once) and woke up in borderline panic twice, so I gave up on sleeping.

I remember her coming home from nights out bring home guys, and me and my brother having to kick them out.

I've just come back from a holiday to see my Dad, and I was very distant the whole two weeks. I feel uncomfortable around him and on the last night, we had a small argument and he ended up punching the door on the way out. It brought me back to when I was a kid and mum and dad would get really drunk together when dad got home and sometimes it would end in verbal abuse to each other and violence on some occasions.

anyway, two things - 

first, in my class today, someone typed in and said that they just lost someone to suicide. it all just kinda came back to me. hearing she had died, feeling that grief and guilt. and to think that someone else is feeling that, someone else is going through that. it’s a lot. all I want to do is scream and cry but i can’t. i just have to sit here and be silent and pretend that there’s nothing wrong. it’s too much rn. it’s all too much. 

second, earlier this year, i realized why her suicide hit me so so hard. she is a lot like me. we had a lot of the same struggles. we had similar likes and dislikes. and she’s gone now. and iI can’t stop seeing parts of her in me. like a constant reminder 

last, my mother, when she told me, said that “sometimes you meet someone and you can just tell that they won’t have a long life” and it stuck with me. every time I meet someone, I try to analyze them and look for that. because i want everyone to live. fuck i just want everyone to grow old and happy. and yet im surrounded by so many people who struggle with their mental health (wit self harm and suicide and addiction) and it’s too much. it’s too much to talk to anyone. it’s too much to talk about it. it’s too much"

461,Can a 16 year old suffer from hebephilia ?,"Im 16, i have always felt sexually attracted to girls my age or older, but there are some cases where i felt sexually attracted for 13 year old girls. I never really thought it was a primary thing, and i still like to think it isn't. I've suffered from HOCD for the past two weeks and my libido was gone, so i couldn't **hard** to girls, yet when i saw one of those 13 year old ( Yeah, i don't feel this for all 13 year old girls, except for some that somewhat clicked, i dont really understand why ) it happened, and it's still happening, and i dont want it to, i mean, they dont even have a defined body yet, and they're faces look like child ones. So, if my libido was gone, why did this happened, exactly when it shouldn't haveAll this started around my late 15 year old, they were probably 12 at that time (i dont know if that matters) I've done some disgusting things, and i didn't really care at the time because i thought i was at the age where ""sexual stuff happen"". 

I dont really know what to do, i dont think i have any psychologists/therapists where i live, and if there are im afraid they would probably report me, or i would get to prison or something. 
If this shit doesn't disappear, i""ll probably consider suicide ( but then i think about my family and im afraid to do it, because i love them and wouldn't want them to suffer because of me). Aren't there some meds to completely eliminate my libido or something, i mean, anything that makes me not get sexually aroused for the rest of my life ? 

Please, help me 😢"
462,Feeling ashamed for potentially getting help,"I have been struggling with mental health issues for years now. The thing is that I never let it show, and in my head, I keep thinking that just because I am not suicidal or on the edge I should not be getting help to take up specialist's time that could otherwise help someone else. Even though I realise that it might be silly and that none of my problems will go away until I genuinely get help (even though I, once again, don't have any serious issues), I still never do. It comes to a point where I even resent myself a bit and am ashamed of potentially getting help and keep thinking that these are not serious issues that most people can work through, I never do. Is anyone else feeling similarly?"

465,Is what I just experienced “sleep paralysis” or a form of mental health “issue”?,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit and I hope it is because I don’t know where else to ask. I honestly don’t even know how to describe properly what I had just experienced. Just now I was taking a half nap?? I was closing my eyes lightly napping, but I was aware that I was napping and I was aware that everything I was imagining/ dreaming. But I was still napping at the same time if that makes sense. But then something weird was happening. Everything I experienced felt so real. Since I knew I was napping, this “thing” felt really real. I began to sort of feel like something was pressing against my back. Sort of like a small body was pressing against my back. And it genuinely felt like a small body was pressing against my back. I’m still in my “half-nap” state at this point but I couldn’t really move and check what that “feeling” was. I tried to but I couldn’t move. I was getting kind of scared? Like what the hell was happening?? And then I started hearing sort of a whispering noise. And this noise genuinely sounded “real”? It didn’t sound like it was in my head. The whisper slowly gradually started getting louder?? Nothing that would be painful to hear but I guess a normal loud whisper. I couldn’t really make out what I was hearing, but it was clear that it was a person whispering into my ear. At this point I was full on nervous. But I couldn’t really physically move or speak or turn around. I tried moving my fingers but it just wasn’t moving?? Ugh idk its so hard to describe. I didn’t see anything since I was lying on my side with my eyes closed.

What exactly is this experience of mine? What did I just experience? It’s never happened to me before and if anything it reminds me of sleep paralysis since I couldn’t really move. But I wasn’t really “sleeping” either? Kinda half awake half asleep sort of thing? I don’t know how sleep paralysis works. So if someone could please give me some sort of explanation as to what happened to me, that would really put me at ease! Thank you in advance to anyone that replies!"
466,"'Old soul' = loser, add ADHD, depression and probably PTSD","Hey.

I'm in a rough patch. Having a mental breakdown at the end of January, quitting my job, being declared 'medically unfit to work', getting into 5k debt, going to therapy, discovering I most likely have ADHD (diagnosis in progress), being diagnosed with depression, and having flashbacks from childhood trauma (11 years of physical, mental and emotional abuse by a narc mother), never having a relationship nor having felt any sort of unconditional love or romantic affection made this year that much worse. Emotional outbursts ruined all friendships that I've had, I've been going through these last 6 months on my own, and I'm starting to feel ever so hopeless and discouraged. Loneliness is a poison, this seemed like a good place to share the pain I've not had a way of sharing before. 

At least I'm not dead or dying, so... silver lining?


tl;dr

468,Left my job because it was worsening my anxiety and depression - family not being supportive,"Hey,

A few weeks ago, I quit my job at Target. It was so mind numbing, doing the exact same thing for eight hours straight every day. I just couldn't do it. Every day I would leave close to tears, get home, and just feel completely unmotivated to do anything. I couldn't bring myself to draw, or read, or do anything at all. It was awful.

I asked if I could be switched to something else, maybe the tech section or the registers, but was told that I could not. So I left. 

My mom understood. Every time she picked me up she saw how miserable I was. She knows how bad I can get and hated that the job was keeping me at my worst all of the time.

My dad, however, is not being as kind. He doesn't believe in anxiety and depression and all of that. So, I have to find a new job within two weeks or my phone is being shut off and I'll essentially be grounded (even though I'm 20 years old... (and I know, I should be paying my own phone bill - I'm going to get on that)). He called me lazy and unmotivated, and said that he was disappointed in me for quitting.

I know that I need a job. Hell, I *want* a job. I tried so hard to stay at Target, the last thing I wanted to do was quit, but I was not willing to sacrifice my mental health for a paycheck. I've been looking for a new job, searching through forums every day, but there's barely anything available, and I refuse to get stuck in another position that will make me feel the way that Target made me feel.

(And yes, I know how it sounds. I probably sound like a bratty little kid who can't bear to work (at least, that's what the advice subreddit told me...), but that's so far from the truth. I worked at Barnes and Noble during winter and I loved it. For three years before that, I worked at a record store that I absolutely adored. I just need an environment where I can interact with people and have conversations, not one that's solely made of up stocking shelves, back stocking items, repeat)"
469,Am I experiencing anxiety attacks?,"Sometimes I'll just randomly start feeling really cold, my heart starts to beat really fast, I feel like crying and I feel..
 scared? I feel scared but I don't know what I'm scared of. All I know is those few minutes are pure misery and just thinking about having one makes me almost cry. Whenever this happens, I have to stop whatever I'm doing and lay down. Sometimes I don't get up for hours. 

Also, recently I've become much more emotional. The other day I saw a video of a dog crying and a girl comforting it. That video made me really sad and I literally stared at the 15 second clip playing over and over again for 30 minutes."
470,I think I have intermittent explosive disorder.,"I’m a 27yo male. Since I was in elementary school I have had, what I thought was “normal” anger issues. The more I looked into intermittent explosive disorder, or IED, the more it sounds like me. Literally the description is describing me. 

“ Intermittent explosive disorder involves repeated, sudden episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior or angry verbal outbursts in which you react grossly out of proportion to the situation.”

“Criterion A1: Episodes of verbal and/or non damaging, nondestructive, or non injurious physical assault that occur, on average, twice weekly for three months. These could include temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments/fights, or assault without damage. This criterion includes high frequency/low intensity outbursts.

Criterion A2: More severe destructive/assaultive episodes which are more infrequent and occur, on average, three times within a twelve-month period. These could be destroying an object without regard to value, assaulting an animal or individual. This criterion includes high-intensity/low-frequency outbursts.”

I wish I could get it diagnosed for sure, but I just can’t afford a psychiatrist.  For me I fit into both criteria’s, but more so with the high intensity/low frequency outbursts. I’ve never hit my wife, or my 3yo daughter, and I never want to. It scares everyone involved when I blow up. It scares me because I CANT control it once it starts, and once it’s over I just feel so ashamed. 
2 days ago my wife and I got into a fight because I was annoyed slightly at a store clerk who was talking shit about people wearing masks(I live in Portland Oregon, and it’s required to wear a mask in any public space that’s inside and establishment.) while not wearing one herself. So I told my wife about it and misunderstood her. even though she agreed to boycott that store for their ignorance, I thought she was saying out of convenience she would still go there. Not a big deal right???  WRONG, for some reason that I can’t even explain I BLEW UP. I screamed at her, called her names, slammed doors, broke a door, broke a steak knife, broke a tile on our tile countertops. It was such an extreme reaction to the situation. I’m ruining my life, because I can’t control it. Is there any way to stop? Or do I need to bite the bullet and ask my mom or grandparents if they would front the bill for a psychiatrist? I don’t know how to handle this."
471,My mind has become my prison.,I really need help. I can't sleep neither I wanna wake. Idk what have I become. My parents divorced months back and this has affected me to the core. Iive with my dad having nearly zero communication with him. I try to change my state of mind but I just am unable to do. Worst part i can't control and hurt myself. I wanna stop this. But i can't help myself more.
472,Does anybody also experience stressing themselves with the things going on with their daily lives even though you don't have to be stressed about it?,"I know there are things that you should not be stressing enough, but for me everything I do is making me stressed.

Aside from that, even the littlest thing or the simplest tasks is making me anxious that it got to the point that I am stressing about it. I was previously diagnosed with anxiety disorder so being stressful is not helping. It adds more to the stress . You know, I-am-anxious-about-something-that-it's-making-me-stressed-then-anxiety-will-worsen-then-adds-to-the-stress cycle.

473,Constant Dark Thoughts,"I have never told anyone this before but I am wondering what to do. Basically I have been experiencing dark, suicidal thoughts for the past 8 years or so. It's hard to describe but even in moments of joy and happiness I immediately go back to these recurring thoughts. I am not typically anti social but on certain days I experience extreme social anxiety. Usually once I am in a group I feel good for a while and even enjoy making people laugh. But underneath the smiles and laughter I keep thinking about wishing to die or that someone would kill me. It is very difficult for me to develop long-term relationships as I have never been in one before. I have slept with prostitutes hundreds of times and had countless casual hookups trying to find a connection but they are only a temporary band-aid trying to cover up my mental anguish. 

 I have no health insurance and cannot afford to see psychiatrists or psychologists so I am resorting to the internet to hopefully find some answers."
474,Social media is the worst for mental health,"There is no worse feeling than being ignored by everyone, especially when depression and anxiety rears its ugly head. Social media is the only place I get my interactions with people unfortunately, because I really don't have any close real life friends. Facebook is awful because you expect your ""real"" friends to care about you, but I never get a single like or comment. I guess they must have all put me on hide. I find that no matter what site I use, pretty much no one cares what I post about or think, and it hurts pretty bad. I try to read and take time off from social media, but it's sometimes impossible due to how lonely I am. And I'm too crazy and stand-offish to make real friends."

Got bloods done and my doctor wants to refer me to ed services but like,, I feel like such a fucking fraud going into ed treatment when I’m not even a little bit skinny. Seems like a waste, all this suffering, if I don’t even get to be thin which was all I wanted to begin with. I ate a fucking cupcake at 10.30 last night and pxxged straight away, but I got caught halfway through and they locked my bathroom so I pxxxed in the bin. The fucking bin. Then a nurse came in and took the bin as well. I got given a new vitamin this morning, which made me puke, and I’m going to the orthodontist tomorrow and I’m terrified she’ll notice that I’ve been pxxxxng a lot. Everything sucks right now."
477,I finally set out to do what I wanted to do,"So, last year my life was at the lowest it's been in 4 years by that time. I was on the phone with my dad and he reminded me where my mother's sole source of income was from. From that point onwards in March to December I was almost irate every single day and was extremely upset and frustrated that my mom lives off my disability money while not giving me anything. But then came November 25th, 2019 and it was on that day that for the first time I finally got those gears in motion. During another wild tantrum of mine, I told my counselor about why I was upset after switching to her from another counselor (that counselor told me there was nothing I could do), and she said that I could have it put into my name. Then came January 2020 when I saw a case worker and told her about getting it put into my name and either by that same month or the following month, my doctor rejected putting it into my name and instead having it in the name of some organization instead, so I flipped shit again and screamed until my lungs got sore. But thankfully, but March 7th, 2020 I got a break from them as I moved into a group home for about a month, but left after I got tired of having to call my family every day for food because I had no money or almost getting into a fight with several other people there, or not liking it there in general. So in April I went back home. But before I left, I got a message for me in the mail announcing the new company to have my disability after the previous one was full, so everything was basically the same until yesterday on the 1st of July when my mom didn't receive the check in the mail. Then today on the 2nd I called up my counselor after she still didn't have it and told me that she received something through the mail announcing that said company is now going to manage my disability money, and I called up several people, but namely my counselor and that company and found that I now have a payee at that place, I plan on getting paid $50 a week is what I asked them, the lady is gonna write a form and send it to me via mail today, and I'll receive the check on Monday. So it seems that my work here is done. I've had no one to rely on throughout these years but myself. And now it seems I've finally managed to wrestle my disability money out of my mom's greedy hands. 

And just to give you a backstory, back in 2015 my dad recommended me to go on disability, so I told my mom and grandparents about it, so she took me to my doctor and told my doctor that I was going to spend it all on drugs so she could have it. She then quit her job at the Country Club just so she could fuck it off on herself. She bought me stuff with it, sure, but she wasn't on disability and the money didn't belong to her. She even lied about it and said the reason she left that job was because some guy was harassing her at work, but I know this is a lie because she never applied for anywhere else after she quit the job, so you do the math as to why she actually quit. Then not only that, but my grandparents defended her lies and regurgitated them whenever I mentioned it. And there was two occasions prior to now when she tried intimidating me when I tried finding a way to get that money back. One time she boldly told me that I wasn't allowed to have money, especially given the fact that she never gave me a penny of it while she had it and just kept it on the card. As for when she tried intimidating me, well that first time was several years ago when she was interrogating me when I tried calling the social security place and the second time was when I stole the card to go online to get an app and she threatened me saying that she could just look through her bank account to find for any withdrawals. 

But it appears I've finally won. Thus is the first major bitchslap she's probably had from me in half a decade almost."
478,I can’t picture a future that doesn’t end with killing myself,"I’m not very good at anything. I’m in school for English and I want to be a writer, but I’m beyond pathetic. I can’t even finish a single piece for this application. Whenever I try I don’t know where to take it and I get wrapped up in how lousy the writing is.

The future doesn’t have anything for me. Even if I graduate my degree won’t be very useful in getting employed. I’m not even sure what I want to do. I’m a white male that has loving parents and enough money to not have loads of student debt, but life is still horrible. How is that even possible? I rolled sixes on every die, but I’m too pathetic to use them. What do I like and what am I good at?

I feel like a waste of space and the thing that’s been getting me through it is that I can always kill myself. I know that’s so backwards, but that’s  what has been getting me through life. I can work hard, get my degree, shoot my shot, and when I’m still useless and unhappy I can kill myself. 

I don’t know how anyone can help me. I’m not even at risk of killing myself now, so maybe I don’t need it."

481,Reckful and I,"Just wanna talk about Reckful. I have watched this guy for his entire streaming career and has always been one of my favorite people to watch. He was such a smart, funny, and handsome guy. It was very obvious he had some mental health issues, he streamed his therapy sessions with Dr. K. He wanted to help people in the same situation as him. Wanted to shed light on the darkness inside of peoples head. He seemed to be a lot more happier when working on his game ""Everland"", a game to bring people together and chat. The game recently finished, so maybe he lost that feeling of having a purpose. Before he committed suicide, he posted on Twitter. Confessing his love for an ex girlfriend, Becca, and asking her to marry him. Now this ridicule that Byron realized he would get after the post is what may have put him over the edge. Another one of the memes like: ""11+4"" or ""30K car"" would plague him for the rest of his life.

I believe we are not understanding Mental Illness, it is very complex. I suffer from it myself, have thought about suicide multiple times. I tried it once, but I couldn't go through with it. The thought of leaving my mom who already lost her father, mother, husband, daughter and best friend stopped me. I couldn't do that to my mother, I couldn't give her that pain. When my mom dies, I don't know, I don't think anything could stop me then. But something stopped me, I feel maybe could be the same for most people trying too. They probably don't wanna go through with it once they start, but it's too late and they can't get out of it.

Yesterday, I got the news that the restaurant I manage would be going under. I went to see my mother, and talk to her about what I would want to do.(She knows about my mental health, I told her everything) I told her I wanna do Psychology because I feel I can make a difference with Mental Health issues, having them myself may give me a better understanding. The next day, soon as I wake up. I get news of my favorite streamer and content creator having committed suicide. I want to thank you Reckful, and may you Rest in Peace you beautiful soul, for opening my eyes in so many ways. And quite possibly saving my life. Because after today, it is my GOAL to get a PhD in Psychology(maybe aiming high here, but go for a degree first, then Masters) to help with this issue. If anyone wants to reach out to me and talk, do not hesitate. I'll share my experiences with you so you know you are not alone. 

Thank you

486,Should I (16f) quit my first job?,"I had a really bad freshman year. I just finished up my sophomore year. During my freshman year I was stuck in a really bad relationship. I don’t feel like describing too much so if you’d like to know more about it [click here to read](https://www.reddit.com/user/spiritfae/comments/gut3tl/my_traumatic_freshman_year_a_playbyplay/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

I just got a job at a salon. Someone who’s like a mother figure to me (we’ll call her Rachel) is a hairstylist. She works at a salon and got me a job as an assistant since I’m going to school to become a cosmetologist. On my second or third day, a woman who I’ve met once before was also working there the same shift I was (we’ll call her Patricia). Patricia was once the stepmom of my ex, but a few years after her and my ex’s dad had a baby, they got a divorce. She hasn’t seen him since my freshman year, when we ran into her at a baseball game my parents took us to. He told me that she starved her children, and that she was abusive. His mom hated her too because of petty high school drama. 

After a few weeks of working with her, Patricia finally asks me if I remembered her from the baseball game. Getting increasingly nervous, I said yes, and she immediately started talking about my ex. I told her that he cheated on me and she started shit talking him and his mother (his mother is a monster, mind you). 

I started getting really traumatic flashbacks while I was talking with her. Patricia is such a lovely woman who is a victim of these people as well, just not in the same way that I am. She’s gotten many threats from my ex’s mother, and my ex was spreading terrible lies about her. She never starved her children. She just feeds them HEALTHY things and doesn’t let them eat themselves to death like my ex’s mother does (also important to note that my ex is a type one diabetic). Patricia, when she was married to his dad, took care of him, taught him how to do the math for his diabetes, and fed him healthy things. Whenever he came to visit them he always had large keloids (which is BAD) but Patricia fed him healthy things and did what she could to help him. He always went back home to his mom with small keloids, but she’d feed him shit and make it much worse. 

I never really realized just how awful my ex’s mother was to me. As Patricia and I were talking I started to realize how she basically tried to keep me from seeing my own mom, and tried to make my parents out to be horrible people. She said my mom failed at raising me, and my ex completely brainwashed me into believing that my dad tried to kidnap me. 

Today I had a panic attack in the bathroom after talking to Patricia. I couldn’t handle having all of these memories come flooding back, especially since I really was doing a lot better. I was a lot happier and I was rarely thinking about my freshman year. 

Am I overreacting? Should I quit my job? I have the same shifts as Rachel because my parents work and Rachel is able to give me rides. I don’t know what to do. Please, someone, tell me I’m not crazy. Tell me these reactions are justified. Tell me I’m strong and that I can overcome this, because I’m really starting to believe that I can’t. I can feel sanity slipping through my fingers. All I can think about is brutally murdering my ex. He won’t leave me alone. He keeps trying to harass me on social media. I might absolutely fucking lose it if I ever see him in person. 

I don’t know what this turned into. I’m just so scared and so lost. I’m filled with so much rage that I don’t know how to get rid of. I can’t be around Patricia if this is all she’s gonna talk about now. She’s such a nice woman but I can’t talk about this anymore. I’m too afraid to tell her how my ex and his mom treated me because I don’t want her to get any authorities involved, but I feel like telling her what happened is the only way to get her to leave me alone about that fucked up family. I’m deteriorating inside. What do I do?"
487,Feeling extremely anxious after a dream,"Hello everyone. I don't know what to do anymore, so I need help.

Few nights ago I had a bad dream and it affected me (my thoughts, my mood).
In the dream, I was in a supermarket, minding my own business and after a few seconds I was a witness (kind of) of a murder. I didn't see anything I could hear stabbing noises. I think it was around 20+ times. I woke up scared, sweaty and a few seconds later, I started having these intrusive thoughts about stabbing my family.
I would never do it, but it's been two days and I can't get rid of these thoughts. Everytime I think about it, I start breathing heavily, and I feel pressure on my chest. 

Actually I feel like that all the time. I've always had problems with anxiety, but I feel like that dream sucked the energy out of me. I'm having these bad thoughts, I'm nervous and anxious all the time. I literally feel the pressure on my chest. I feel like something in my brain snapped and I became evil.

So I have recently figured out something about myself. I am the type of person to not have many friends, but a few really good friends. I am shy, socially awkward, and not many people in my grade talk to me or hang out with me. 

I find, that with the friends I do manage to have, I struggle with leaving them. I'm so scared of being alone. I am alone most of the time, but if I'm with a really good friend, I don't want to leave them because I don't want them to have a better friend. I don't want them to be with another friend. I don't want them to be having a better time with someone else. When I leave I'm scared of them going to be with a better friend that they're closer with. I guess I'm kind of jealous if they are better friends with someone else, or just sad about it. I don't like hearing about experiences they've had with other people. It makes me sad that they didn't have those times with me. 

And then I also feel like everyone hates me and they are only pretending to tolerate me because it's polite to not be rude to someone when you're in company with them. I feel like the only happiness and joy that people feel that is associated with me is the joy and happiness they feel when I leave them. I feel like I'm just some person. Not a friend. They have better people to hang out with. They could care less about me, I'm just wasting their time. I'm scared of them secretly not liking me at all and pretending to be my friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone help me here? Is it common to feel this way? Am I messed up? What can be done about it? 

Sorry for all the questions. Thank you for reading and/or your help. &lt;3"
489,I'm considering having my abusive mother confined to an assisted living facility. Advice?,
490,Internalising other people’s negativity,"I’m looking for some advice.

In the last 5 years I’ve went through a real journey with my mental health. I’ve taken different anti-depressants and I’ve been to see several different therapists and I think I’ve finally reached a stable point and I’ve definitely noticed an improvement in my output and productivity. Truthfully the lockdown situation has actually been really beneficial for me because social situations tend to exacerbate my anxiety. 

The only issue is that I’m really receptive to other people’s bad moods to the point where I literally can’t concentrate on whatever task I’m doing because my anxiety is out of control. In my view both my mother and my sister can come across as very passive aggressive at times and it’s incredibly unnerving. I left a previous job because it just felt like I was having other people’s frustration piled onto me.

I want to be able to distance myself from any kind of toxic atmosphere I might find myself in without walking away from the situation if that makes any sense. I understand that I can’t let somebody else’s bad mood prevent me from feeling happy but it’s easier said than done. I’m a people pleaser by nature and when I see people getting angry or upset it’s very difficult not to internalise it. I also know that it’s incredibly naive to expect people to be happy 24/7 I just don’t want to be so badly affected by these off moments.


I hope this made some kind of sense."
491,I don’t know about my future,"I am only 15 years old and incant see a future for myself. Since quarantine started I have gained some distance between me and a lot of people.
I still have friends but the girl I’ve had a crush on isn’t one of them anymore. I was also thinking about what life is about and can’t find any reason for me to live. Even though I’m young and I know there still is a lot coming towards me, I just don’t see a future for my life. So I reach out to some advice from you guys since no one else can give me one."
492,How to feel purpose in staying alive when you're not the best at anything and you don't have anyone who really loves and depends on you?,"So, I spent my whole life being depressed and using external accomplishments/validation to prop myself up. But what if you get to a point where you realize you're just not the best/brightest at any specific thing? That you CAN'T achieve your highest goals? That others will always be better than you? 

In the past, when I got depressed, I could point to an accomplishment I had achieved or could achieve. I also had someone in my life who I loved. I would always think of how much they would be devastated by my death and how in their eyes at least I had a lot of on earth. Now that person is dead, and I've been knocked in the gut with the fact that I really am not smart/mentally healthy/hard-working enough to be anything that special.

It makes it hard to even try fighting my depression. I wonder what is the point of me struggling and surviving when I really don't add much to anyone or anything. How do I find value in who I am? Has anyone else been through this?"
493,The trifecta of terror,"Thought I was coping ok with lockdown and working from home for 3 months and now my anxiety depression and OCD have teamed up to hit me all at the same time lol. 

I’m exhausted - and so angry that my mind is working against me like this. 

It’s not fair :("
494,2 Years Ago From Today,"Two years ago today (I was 16 years old) I was in the hospital because I finally had the courage to seek and ask for help with my constant s\*icidal thoughts. I remember I would have panic attacks, could not sleep at night at all, had massive anxiety about anything and I was just a mess overall. I took medication for over a year and now I am doing so much better. Sometimes it is hard to believe that I am where I am today. I did not think that I could be happy or live life again. I am extremely grateful for my friends and family who gave me constant support and without them, I would not have made it through. Thinking back now, I am so glad I asked for help. Ever since then I got to experience so many new things in life (I am 18 now) from new foods, new places, new games, new tv shows etc. What I want you to know whoever is reading this is that you are not alone and that getting better is possible. I wanted to share my experience to possibly show even the smallest glimpse of hope that you will get better and take it day by day &lt;3"

496,"I laugh off my mom still not getting things, but it actually does hurt","Just now, I was excited to say that I'm all clean because I took a shower (I'm ashamed to say that my hygiene is inconsistent) and she gave a little thumbs up. I read her face and asked her if it's weird to celebrate taking a shower and she was like ""yeah"" and gave a little nod. And I laughed but it kinda hurt. 

Eventually I told my brother and he explained why it's something to celebrate and she understood and apologized but I kinda feel like crying lol. Is it stupid to feel sad over this? It's just these little things that we've been going over for 3 years now and it's like we're still in phase 1?"
497,I need to be an inpatient,"I actually think I need to be an inpatient at a psyche ward for a while my parents dont really understand depression and anxiety and adhd. But mixed together its rough. I've been to hospital once for suicide but they weren't helpful and its put my parents off taking me there again for mental health things but I think its the only way for CAMHS to listen and help me stay safe from myself. I really want to kill myself but I really dont want to hurt my family so I'm living in a difficult situation. I'm worried my depression will take over and just forget about my family and finally end my life. Which I am not against but i dont want to hurt people. Hurting mentally is the worst type of pain anyone can suffer and I dont want anyone to go though the depression I have ( although ik I'm not the only one dw) like if I killed myself ppl around me would be shocked and hurt. But I am just tired of living this painful sad life. I need a crisis card to take to A&amp;E if I ever go. I want to be safe for them, but I cant stop my urges sometimes. Like when i cut myself i dont want to bc of my family would be upset but i cant stop myself. I'm worried I'm gonna finally kill myself. I dont know what to do. I'm on anti depressants but they are pretty crap. Also on adhd meds. And melatonin. Someone please help. Anyone know how the system works???"
498,Today I realised how important my medication is,"They pharmacy in my town messed up my prescriptions for my antidepressants and antipsychotics so I haven’t had wither yet. Without the antipsychotics I felt this horrible withdrawal from them and have been sick and tired all day.
At six o’clock I fell asleep finally and then woke up at what I thought was tomorrow morning and felt this intense confusion and took my morning medication because I thought it was the morning. I feel very well rested from the best two hour nap of my entire existence. But I also feel Fades and confused.

If I can’t get a 100% guarantee I won’t have to go through this again then I will ask to come off of my medication because not having them for 24 hours has messed me up so bad and I can not do this again. Please tell me if I being dramatic and if not the best way to go about it? Thank you"
499,Don't know what to do anymore,"In my past I've done something horrible, something that would ruin my life if the wrong people were to find out. Everyday, I'm very anxious that somebody will find out about this and my life will be over. How can I live with myself / move on with my life?"
500,Controlling family (M19),"I'm stuck living with my aunt, mother, sisters, cusion and a controlling grandmother. She tries to control everything everyone does  down to what we eat, when we sleep and everything else in between. I think you get the point, it's putting a strain on my mental health to the point of it almost cost me graduating  my senior year of high school. How much time I spend on Xbox?(my stress reliever) Bitched at for it, how much time I spend cleaning my living space? Bitched at if it's more than 10mins. Now pushing into college I'm scared it may push over into college. I'd move out but my current job just doesn't allow that and I honestly don't think I can take much more."
501,Little things matter,"To start with I'm a 16 year old boy. I've never been to a doctor about mental health as I find it uncomfortable to talk about. Some days are ok but most just pass by and I feel generally unhappy but I can deal with it. Dont get me wrong there are good days even some good weeks. But some days something not important will happen like my friend not being available to talk to or a realizing I did something wrong. And then after that I fall into a hole, most the time i just stay in my bedroom and dont talk to anyone all day. I dont know what to do. I feel alone. Does anyone have any advice?"
502,My mom is completely driving me crazy. I just want some help on how to keep myself sane.,"All the time, she just complains continually. I have to just stand there and take it in. Before I could have just shouted back. At least that way, I could have gotten some of my anger out. Now I just have to stand there and take it all of. Im just there, trying to calm myself down, and then with each word she says, she destroys any kind of calmness that I might have, with stuff like ""he's always rubbish"". Even now., the one person who I thought would never call me out for my weight, has done it. ""l.ok at how fat you are."" Its driving me insane. Each time I think about my mum, im wondering if she is. There was always shouting in this house, but now its just driving me mad. My dad always says that he cant take it anymore, while he is only subjected to the stuff my mum throws at me, and tries to calm her down. He has no ideaWhat its like. The last time I tried to reach  out for help, she found out, and for the next week, they both treated me like I had just committed major sin. Please. Just give me some advice. I need to stop them, and I need to stop myself from blowing up"

505,I’ve been struggling for the past few months,"
I’ve wanted to join the army for a long time now and I’ll be 18 in 2 days. My girlfriend really isn’t taking it that well and I’m really scared of everything at this point. She keeps begging me not to and she told me she didn’t change her major so she could be with me and that she wished that I’d do the same and it honestly made me feel like shit, I know she doesn’t mean to be manipulative or anything and she always has my best interests in mind but damn. She’s also really worried about the virus and I keep wanting to go out with my friends but it upsets her, I believe her when she says it’s the pandemic because she never cared what I did before as long as I was safe.

We are both worried about the other cheating which hurts, we both think we’re not good enough for each other but I know she’s the best for me. I really just want to be hers for as long as possible and even looking at someone else makes me sick.

I’ve dealt with mental health issues in the past and it feels like I’m spiraling down again. I have to gain a lot of weight just to make it through MEPS but sometimes it’s really hard to eat and whenever I eat a lot I don’t gain any weight."
506,I dont know what's wrong with me,"I'm kinda weird and I dont know what's wrong. I'm 14 practically 15 .

An I have the worst memory ever man like you dont understand. I cant concentrate on something unless I'm interested in it like it's so hard I have the shortest attention span. I'm super opinionated and excitable but that's not wierd lots of people are. I act without thinking. And it's so hard to get to sleep sometimes because I'm always thinkin and suddenly angie.hours have gone by because  I was thinking of digestives and tea or some music I heard or how trump is a twat or this one video game plot or the colour pink. I've suppressed these past fiew years but I've given up because it gives me such bad anxiety and I freak out it's been really bad recently because I'm so fookin bored and I cant mess about with me mates.
It helps to jump and dance to loud music to get my energy out."

508,"Struggling to get support, suicidal thoughts growing increasingly worse","Hi everyone

I am diagnosed with severe depression, severe GAD and psychosis. I am in the UK and struggling to get support from the people who are supposed to help me. I first went last November, after growing increasingly aware of my mental state declining rapidly. However, I feel even worse. I feel let down and forgotten, I have tried speaking to my so-called ""care co-ordinator"" however, she is so uncaring. She seems to just be going through the motions of her training and not taking in anything I say or offering any help.
I have tried to call the crisis team, who told me to go to A&amp;E for an emergency psychologist. However, in the long term, how would this be effective? I need ongoing care and support from someone who cares.

I'm struggling to see the point in living anymore. The only reason I'm still here is for my dog. Yes, I love my family, friends and boyfriend... But the pain of what's going on inside is too much to handle. I feel they'd be better off without me, I'm a burden to them and my mental health makes this even worse. I constantly rely on them for support and I can't do it anymore.

These voices in my head, the things I see.. I just can't deal with it anymore I want it ALL to stop. I have no quality of life and want to die. Yet, I am too cowardly to do it. I feel guilty, I feel scared. Part of me wants to stay, yet the majority of me wants to go. I'm like a loose tooth holding on by one string. I can't do this anymore."

512,Need Help - Is This An Issue?,"So,  I’ve recently been feeling kinda weird. Here are the reasons:

1. I feel like I have two distinct ways of thinking. To be easier to explain, I call them Mind and Heart. Mind works with logic, and doesn’t care about how other people are doing/feeling (a little bit selfish). It also does not feel emotions. It hides everything about me, like secrets and feelings, from others. Heart uses feelings/emotions. Almost no one has seen this part of me. I’ve tried but I just can’t show it. Heart is the part of me that is very selfless, and friendlier. It’s generally Mind that thinks, because using Heart to think hurts too much. Mind and Heart are the opposites and there’s like a gradient between them. You’ll never see me fully Mind (unless you really deeply hurt me) and you’ll never see me fully Heart (unless there’s a very deep connection between us). I have only noticed this very recently, but looking back, I think this is how I work since late 2018 (clearly the worst year of my life).
2. When I’m talking to myself, it’s not actually to me, but to an imagination of my friends. I act as if I were with them, in a place where we are generally together. And I walk throughout my house as if I were in the place that I’m imagining the conversation happening. Sometimes I might even be talking to a faceless/nameless person, in an imaginary place. I have this since I was 12 (I’m now 16).
3. I can imagine the voice of any of the people I know, except one in particular. There’s this dude that, well, was my bestfriend for years but then ruined my life (in 2018). I cannot imagine his voice, although I (unfortunately) have to listen to it every single day (we’re in the same class so...)
4. If I think about this dude or about sad things, my heart jumps/skips a beat. I feel a terrible ache in my chest. (But only if I’m thinking with Heart, with Mind it doesn’t happen)
5. Every time I feel sad, I feel like everyone’s plotting something against me.
6. I hear sounds that don’t exist. In March last year, I couldn’t sleep because I was imagining voices and steps. (The voices didn’t sound like anything in specific, it was more just like people whispering/speaking in a different language). Nothing was actually there, but they just sounded real. Not even with all lights on, I could sleep. I was so scared that I generally was immovable. I had to have someone sleeping with me (or in the room next to mine) so that I’d feel safer and could actually fall asleep. Then it got even worse, every time I took a shower or was walking alone outside I would listen to the same exact things. This also connects with the fear that everyone is out to get me. I thought someone was following me and had broken into my house. The sounds then disappeared during the summer (I went to a psychologist - she said it was due to anxiety) but came back in September. After a while, they stopped but since April this year, they’re back. I already know they’re my imagination and there’s nothing to fear, but I still feel frightened (but thankfully I can fall asleep). If I’m too busy, the sounds get louder, but as I’m distracted, I kinda forget they exist. But sometimes there’s a scream and then I get totally scared.
7. Sometimes I see flashes of light.
8. Most of my friendships fail. In 2017 I had a lot of close friends. In 2018 that fell to 0 (not exaggerating - it’s related to what happened between me and that dude. Long story short, he is the most popular dude, so if you don’t agree with him, then you’re wrong, and should not have friends, according to everyone else). In 2019 I had 4. Now I only have 2. These two I met as recently as 2018 (while the others had been friends with me since 2010). Sometimes we’re just not meant together, but it’s sad that one day you know who they are and you understand how they feel, but months later they seem like total strangers.

I would like to know if any of these things are a big issue and if I should seek help.  Feel free to ask any questions."
513,Need help dealing with a father with (possibly) post-hemorrhage depression and denial.,"A few years ago my dad had a cerebral hemorrhage. Most of the long-term side effects have been mental with aphasia being the most noticeable one. Even though we knew he'd always be different, he did improve over time. He still has aphasia here and there, but it's not happening every sentence like it did when he was discharged. He's 66.

My mom text me yesterday saying my dad missed two appointments because he forgot what day of the week it was. She said she is getting the doctor to do a wellness check on his head. Later that night my sister called me in tears to tell me much of what my mom omitted. She said our dad is getting worse and has low oxygen levels, he's saying cruel things, forgetting names, not eating, low activity, and saying things like ""I don't want to live forever anyway, I don't want people taking care of me."" Immediately I thought he might be suffering from depression, which I read is common in people after they have a stroke-related event. My sister was not being receptive at all, saying he's permanently damaged and nothing will help.

I call my mom this morning and she tells me she knows he's depressed, but the problem is he tells the doctors he is not. For context, my dad denied he had a stroke for up to a year AFTER HE HAD THE STROKE. My dad and denial have a closer marriage than my parents, and they've been together for 37 years. I know I'm not a doctor. I'm thinking depression only based on how he acts similar to behavior I have seen in friends who suffer from clinical depression.

My question is, can my dad be diagnosed with depression if he doesn't admit to it? If the doctor thinks he has depression, can he ethically be prescribed medication if he denies it? I asked my mom if she could talk to his doctor, even if he isn't in the room. He has been mentally checked out for years and I don't expect a medication to fix everything, but I hope that something can work on neurotransmitters to balance his emotions and bring him back to a state of better self-care."
514,"Hello, I’m an artist who is in the process of making a comic and I wanted to ask some questions in order to get my information regarding depression right (sensitive)","I myself have suffered from depression and attempted suicide by pill overdose when I was 13, I tried jumping off a window when I was 15 and so on and on. I understand the emotional part of the disease how and it can wear down a person so the questions I will be making are purely physical/medical.

One of my characters attempts suicide by slitting his wrists and fails. I want to ask some questions to those who are comfortable speaking about this topic.

1. Did slitting your wrists cause any permanent damages to the movement of your arms?

2. Can you move your arms normally after a month? Ex: brushing your hair, etc you get the idea

3. Do you remember any medical recomendations that were given to you after the incident?

4. Could you pratice any hand sports after it? Ex: volleyball, basketball, etc."
515,"My service dog is very sick, i dont know what to do.",Over the past several months my service dog Cooper has been very ill. I've been trying to get my mother to take him to the vet to see what is actually wrong. He's been throwing up like crazy and seems very sad. Seeing my energetic little bundle of joy so sad and sick makes me feel so useless knowing I can't do anything to help him. In a way I feel like it's my fault that he's sick. I've been trying to get my mom take him to the vet for almost three months now but everytime she tells me it's too expensive. I myself dont have enough money to take him myself. I dont know what to do. I dont want to lose my baby.
516,"This has been the worst year of my life, im getting too close to ending it all","Im quite young, not going to specify but since lockdown I've realised who my mum truly is, she screams and shouts at me for the tiniest of reasons - take to day for example, today she shouted at me because i didnt answer the phone and she has a bad leg and had to walk up a flight of stairs - i was full on crying and felt like I dont deserve to live, this has happened all through lockdown mind you
I've tried to tell her what she does is really upsetting (in a respectful manner) and she shouts at me!
I think something is wrong with her, she tells me she loves me and than makes me want to die
She says she's sorry then does it all over again
I've been so close to ending it all, but i haven't, not only am i afraid of dying, but afraid of the aftermath, all the sadness, all the pain

I see a future in myself and i dont want to take that away from myself, i just dont think i can go on living like this anymore, she shames me for everything

She shames me for being me"
517,Feel like I’m losing myself,"I (23f) have always been a fairly confident person but I’d say for about the past year my confidence has got lower and lower to the point now that it doesn’t exist. 

I just feel awful! I can’t bare to look at myself in the mirror or a reflection of any type without just breaking down and crying, I hate what I see. 

It’s also affecting my relationship, I feel like my boyfriend doesn’t find me attractive enough or interesting enough anymore and I’m constantly thinking that he’s just with me for the sake of it and it’s always on my mind that he’s going to cheat on me and find someone much better than me. 

It’s got to the point where I feel like I’m going insane, this low confidence is all I can think about and I feel like it’s taking over my life, I just don’t know what to do but I want to stop feeling so sad all of the time but I can’t."

519,Why do I keep attracting toxic people?,"So a little bit of history about myself: I struggle with several mental health disorders. Bipolar, depression, and borderline personality disorder. I've been going through DBT and therapy for several months now.

So my question is why do I keep attracting toxic people? The answer I guess is somewhat obvious. I tend to be attracted to people who struggle with the same issues I do. People who struggle with depression and mental illness. I tend to make friends with people who are overly clingy, dramatic, who attention seek and usually don't do much to try and change these things.

I am very much the same way. I hate being alone, I act out when I feel like I'm not getting enough attention, and I can be pretty resentful. The difference is that I'm aware of these issues and I want to change. Because I'm aware of these things I try not to act out on my negative impulses, even though I don't always succeed sometimes.

Here's where I need help: As I work more on my treatment I find myself wanting to break away from my stigmas, and from the people that basically exist within those stigmas. I want healthier friends who don't always make me feel bad when I say I need space because I'm trying to do things to better my life like go to college so I can get a better job and educate myself, or turn in paperwork so I can get assistance (which in turn allows me to go to school). I'm not going to say I want normal friends or friends who don't have struggles because that doesn't exist. Everyone as some kind of dysfunction or another. 

But the truth is I still don't know how to tell healthy people from unhealthy people. By the time I see the red flags it's too late.

Any ideas/suggestions? Even if you just want to share your personal stories or thoughts it would be helpful. I'm truly curious."

521,Has anyone experienced a lapse in memory (forgetting you did something completely)? Struggling w dissociation,"I'm feeling so confused right now.

I've been trying to make amends with my ex, who I broke up with in a really heinous way and I've come to realize is a really important friend to me.  I have asked him to bring up any negative feelings he might have towards me so we can communicate and work it out.  So recently he casually mentioned that his mom really doesn't like me because of the email I sent her (which he said he didn't know anything about and didn't want to know about).

Guys, I have no recollection of this email at all and I am so freaked out.  I have PTSD from childhood abuse and have struggled w dissociation I think as a result of that and have experienced lapse in memory before but only in relation to memories of events I was a part of, not my actions (like I would forget an objectively 'pleasant' memory that involved an abusive parent).  I literally have no recollection of contacting his mom and I have no idea why I would try to contact her.  I remember her name but I don't actually know her email address or anything.  I went through all my old email addresses and went back to messages from when my ex and I were still dating, but through everything I couldn't find anything sent to his mom or even really mentioning his mom (I think he mentioned her in one or two emails).

I feel really confused and I don't know what's going on.  I feel like I'm in a dream.  I don't know how I could have done something like this and not remember, and I don't know how I did it.  I apologized to him profusely but I don't know.  I thought my mental health was stabilizing after a really long journey and now I'm fucking freaked out"

523,Self Forgiveness....Who gets to use it? (possible OCD),"I just can not seem to forgive myself for the mistakes of my past. Therpists have told me its my OCD but the burden is getting so great that I feel like I am cursed to be a miserable forever. It hurts because I believe the person I am today has a good heart and I have a strong set values and morals that I stand by. I feel like I could be proud of myself today....if I didnt hate my past self so much. Whenever I look online about self forgiveness, there are always articles for people who are blaming themselves when they dont deserve it but this is not what Im talking about. 

I want to know about people who have genuinely done something wrong. Lets say you were a bully in school, lets say you used to be a manipulative person, maybe you were a thug etc. How does a person who genuinely did wrong and has now changed their ways....exist in peace? Do we deserve to exist in peace? Do we deserve to be loved? Are we worthy of having a second chance? Are we doomed to walk in shame, guilt and pain until we die? What do you do when you cant undo the past and you cant make amends? 

I have been told by a psychiatrist that I have OCD though Im not sure that counts as an official diagnosis. The point is sometimes my brain latches on to memories and mistakes and plays them over and over again until they drive me mad. I dont know for sure if its my OCD or if this is something real but I figure if I hear other peoples perspectives I can come closer to the truth.

Please any help, advice, books, videos would be appreciated."
524,lost most friends,"i just lost most of my friends. they were excluding me from things for a while and pretty much just hitting me up when they needed weed or a ride (we're all 18m and only two of us have cars). when i brought this up to them, they got extremely defensive and dismissive, essentially pushing me to the point where i either said ""look, we're talking abt this or we arent friends"". i was hit back with a ""kk"" and that really fucking hurt. ive known these guys for so long, through an abusive relationship i was in, through drug addiction, overdoses, suicide attempts, not just me but most of them too. 

i just dont get how after all that they can just brish me off because ive become a bother. i know what im saying isnt bullshit, and theyve only proven that by distracting from every point i make yet never refuting one. but regardless its so upsetting to see the guys i thought were my brothers leave me by the wayside over a simple argument, and with just a ""kk"" nonetheless! they know i struggle with depression and panic disorder as well as anxiety, idk why they would just treat me like this after so long, it doesnt make any sense"

527,Anxiety due to twilight? Is this normal?,"Does anyone else get a sudden feeling of anxiety (or the intensification of anxiety that was already there) while the sun is going down or at other specific times of the day?

In my case I'm not sure if theres any deeper reason, my first memory of this is from when I was 5 but theres a huge chance it's been going on for longer. It's really weird because i can feel that the twilight is affecting my mood, not in any esoteric way but because just paying specific attention to the sky worsens the feeling.

I'm not really sure what to do when I feel like that because I cant avoid the environment? And its often just some mild anxiety/sadness but sometimes it gives me crazy ideas and sometimes I act on them, so does anyone have any insight on how to handle it? I've discussed it with my therapist before but she really insists on finding a reason, but if theres any i was too young to remember and today has been quite urgent for reasons I'd rather not disclose."
528,I feel like I should be doing something.,"This is a weird thing to ask, but what’s the explanation for this? It’s midnight and my mind is telling me to do something. I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m motivated and not at the same time.

530,is this emotional abuse?,"I have a strained relationship with my mother. She has been severely depressed since I've been born  (on and off), which led to us never developing a typical and crucial  mother-daughter-relationship. We barely talk nowadays (I'm 18 now and still live at home) and don't have a real connection. Anyway, because of her depression, she never really could be there for me and my siblings the way a mother should be there for her kids and the way children crave  and I don't resent her for that, because it's not her fault, it just makes me sad and sometimes feel hollow and like sth is missing. But the issue with her has always been, that she used to  always talk to me and especially my older sister, when she struggled or was stressed. She was  like 80 percent of the time in distress  and she would tell us as children (maybe like since we're ten or even earlier), how she struggled and how she needed more support and help.How sad she was and then she would go on and talk badly about my dad or my other siblings. Once she even told us (my little brother, 4 years old, was not there), that he ruined her life and it's his fault she feels this way, which totally pissed me off. She never really degraded us face to face  or said mean things, it was just complaining about being a teenager, being too often away and not helping enough. She always said, that we had to help more and didn't do enough chores. She always preached, that, as children (!) we had to be able to see &amp; notice  ourselves, where she needed our help. And even though we did try to help enough, as typical, we were teens and didn't ALWAYS want to help.  I have to add, that we weren't like expect to do all of the stuff, maybe a little bit more than would be considered as  normal. Often, I would feel bad, when I  stayed for a few hours away, fearing, she would be in distress and not really shout at me, but raise her voice and get really emotional in front of me. That led to us children feeling emotionally stressed, when we felt like we didn't help enough or when she was especially emotional and stressed. But the worst part was, when she had emotional outbursts at the dinner table, where she would shout at us, tell us, how shitty everything is and that she needed our support. These dinners were the worst and sometimes, when she would struggle with my dad, there were dinners, where  they would fight, discuss and complain from the first second to the end. The part, that was super detrimental and where my question really comes to place (sorry for the long  background story) was, when she would occasionally at a  breakdown, tell us following sentences and threats: ""I need your support, I cannot do this without you"", ""Otherwise, I'll go into the forest and hang myself"", ""I don't want to continue my life like this"" ""If I don't get the support, I will probably kill myself, if I can't handle it"", You can probably visit me at the cemetary in a few months, if this doesn't get better"" and ""Maybe I should kill myself, then all of this shit would end."" I don't know, how serious these threats were meant, but it totally freaked us children and my dad out and often I would run in my room and cry. She just said it a couple times  a year, but in the end, these sentences  and the connotated negative feelings are burned in my memory and had quite an impact on me and my sisters. Instead of being able to really life our life as teens and worry about school stuff or whether a boy likes us, we had to consider the possiblility of our mother completely losing it or killing herself in the end.
Last summer, I had the shock of my life, when I found a box of knifes, a corkscrew, plasters, bandages and sharp objects in her drawer. I completely freaked out that evening, threw the box far away from the house away and made her some kind of love - letter - book. Could these threats and the constant offloading of her struggles, problems and conflicts and  having to carry such responsibility for your own mother / your siblings be considered as emotionally abusive, even if they were not meant mean? She was never really intentionally mean to us, but her whole buck of constant negativity,  her conplaints , worries and threats  really had a negative impact on all of us. It is probably sad, but due to our difficult upbringing and bad genes, three of four  children  are already mentally ill (Bipolar disorder for my older sister, depression for me and my younger sister), which is so tragic, that it's almost funny again, lol. Anyway, would you guys consider this as emotional abusive behaviour? Sorry for the long text."
531,Random thoughts...,"I dunno. I am in a pensive mood today, just thinking about my life (this morning I had an intake appt. over the phone so I can get a therapist, I think, which went deep into my past and all) and musing about how things have turned out so far.  


I need your honest opinions guys. I have been thinking a lot about what I am (look at my flair if you need to know, but I think 99% of you already know since I don't shut up about it) and I just am feeling...like I don't belong in this world. This isn't because I am suicidal this time--I (for once) don't want to die at the moment. I just feel like I have never fit, from the scant memories I have of my childhood, I seem to always have been an oddity--a freak, especially since I was so into fire all my life.

&amp;#x200B;

What I need to know is what did y'all think of me when I first started posting, as I revealed why I am posting...namely my disorder. It is exceedingly rare, as far as the doctors know, with only &lt;1% of the population of the US having the actual diagnosis....  


Do y'all think I am weird? I get a lot of questions (in real life) any time I reveal (rarely) that I am a pyromaniac. I have long since learned that people get afraid when you tell them that, so I don't really tell many people anymore. Prison had taught me to keep it to myself.   


Don't worry about me today, guys. I am depressed and anxious, but that isn't anything terribly unusual for me. I am no more depressed and anxious than usual. :) In fact, it might actually be a little milder today since my mind has been occupied with trying to figure this out. It has been an interesting mental journey for me today, and I feel good about who I am right now...somewhat. I still have this overwhelming urge to just grab a bunch of paper and light it all up and watch the flames (and feel that joy and calmness inside me whenever I see them) but right now, I am just content to watch videos on YouTube and read this subreddit. :)  


Sorry that this is a weird-ass question, but I would love to hear other people's perspective on my disorder and what perceptions they have of me as a person with this disorder.   


Thanks all and stay strong ok? (I am going to order hot wings now....YUMMIE!!!!)"

534,Unsupported,"I just started doing CBT for anxiety and depression. After my 3rd session, my mom asked me with twisted eyebrows and a slight frown on her face, “ is this really helping you?” All I could do was nod. She then followed with,   “You need to start thinking for yourself. You know, this may help you now, and you may be doing well after a while, but when you are alone, you will be all miserable”. I just want to tell her, we just started therapy. I want to tell her that I need her to support me because I dont want to support myself. I want to die. I dont care about myself right now, and it is so hard to try. I want to tell her that I have no expectations for myself, and that hers are too high. I want to tell her that I want to be treated like a kid. I want to tell her that I  want to be praised for having a clean room, and that I finished my schoolwork. I already spent my luck on asking for therapy, I cant ask her for more. I want to tell her.

535,Is there anyone who manages depression without medication who could give me some advice?,"(sorry if there are typos or grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language)

So, I (24f) am chronically depressed. I was diagnosed when I was 8, we treated it with therapy only up until I turned 18 and left for college. At that time (mid 2014) I had a major episode and my psychiatrist strongly recommended going on an antidepressant. The first one I tried didn't help much but I adapted ""well"" to the second one and took it until late 2018, when I moved abroad. 

The country I live in right now is very strict with psychiatric drugs, I could only take a month's worth with me when I came and the only way for me to get a prescription for that specific medication here was to be assessed by a psychiatrist, which could take months because of the waiting list and wouldn't be possible until I was assigned a social security number, which would only happen after my residence permit papers were processed, and that could take a few weeks. So I had to discontinue it for bureaucratic reasons and got a ""milder"" one from a general practitioner.

I took it for almost a year without good results and with some hard to manage side effects. By that time I'd had some major breakthroughs with my therapist that made me wanna try to manage my condition without medication, so I stopped taking it. It went quite well for the time I was home, but as soon as I got a job I started getting symptoms again. I've been working for around 5 months now (4 if you consider the place was closed for a while because of COVID-19), the job itself isn't even that bad, but just having to leave the house + talk to people + dealing with minor daily issues has been draining all my energy to the point I can't do anything else, then my house gets messy, I start eating bad, some unconstructive thought patterns start showing up, etc, and then I spiral down to a point where I just wanna stop existing (I'm not suicidal thought, never planned or attempted it). 

I've been trying my very best to manage with healthy coping mechanisms, but it's been very up and down and I feel like I can't really enjoy anything anymore. Like, even though I know where those depressive/anxious thought patterns are rooted and work really hard to build more constructive ways of thinking + try to keep my body's needs meet with sleep, healthy food, exercise, etc, sometimes it feels like there's not enough effort in the world that'll keep me from feeling like shit and then I start wondering if it's even worth it using so much energy on something that just can't be fixed.

I know that feelings like those are part of the depressive state, but at the same time I have never been non-depressed as an adult to know what is ""normal"" when it comes to struggling with life's responsibilities. It's even hard to compare how I'm feeling now to how I felt on antidepressants since there were some major changes in my life in this past year and I can't possibly know how I'd have reacted if I was still taking it.

Thing is, there were many upsides to being off the medications. I gained some weight while on this last antidepressant that I wasn't able to lose until I stopped taking it, my sex drive is much higher and the orgasms feel much better despite the depression, I can enjoy my occasional drinks (my psychiatrist said I could drink moderately and eventually while taking the antidepressant, but it kinda messed up my alcohol tolerance, I like to get slightly tipsy and while I was taking the medicine I'd go from 100% sober to shitfaced drunk and that sorta killed it for me), and I feel like I can better asses my feelings about things, since the antidepressant made my mood kinda ""flat"". So if there's any hope that my condition is manageable without it, I'd much rather not take it.

So I guess my question is, is there anyone out there who's been doing this and could share their experience? Does it get better with time? Is there some alternative approach that was helpful in your case? Any input is valid.

TLDR: I'm chronically depressed, have been off my meds for about 8 months now, have been struggling with symptoms but don't wanna start taking antidepressants again because of the side effects."

538,Took one of the biggest steps in my life.,"

I’m just writing this because I’m so happy I got up and started taking the first steps in getting this weight off. I’m 27M 260lbs and I just recently watched David Goggins on Joe Rogan and read his book! It made me think so much about my life and what the hell I have done with it, depression has completely wrecked havoc on my mind and health for the past 2 years and crippling anxiety causing panic attacks all the time. This virus has made me a ticking time bomb because it’s made me so paranoid. So today I’m taking a stand to fight this damn problem.  

I used to be 215 with a six pack and could bench over 300lbs and then the work grind  and a horrible relationship had completely taken any motivation out of me. I was the “big” guy everywhere I went, but I started partying hard so that led into smoking  cigarettes, drinking a 12 pack damn near every night, going to the bar every weekend, doing hard drugs and whatnot. Pretty much turned into a party animal. Well over time I quit working out and kept doing all the above, so I put myself into a horrible spiral. 

So today I decided when I got home from work I’m done making fucking excuses and get my ass back into the swing of things by carrying some of these huge stones on my shoulder up and down my driveway, then got 2 5 gallon buckets and mixed cement and farmers walked with them with some big handles. 

Just the feeling of being exhausted and knowing I got off my ass and put in the work even if it was just a little, it’s enough to get that ball rolling. I have missed this feeling for so long and finally have a purpose to wake up and look forward to making my mind stronger and do some suffering. Even though work sucks I’m not making anymore excuses to put in the work."
539,Is life always just bleak and boring?,"Life just feels so empty. Like is this really it? Is this all life has to offer? The only time I feel like I'm really living is when I party and take drugs- then the comedown highlights the harshly boring reality of life.

540,Social anxiety,"For the past year I’ve dealt with extreme social anxiety. Only recently did I find out the name of my condition, but now I know for sure it’s social anxiety. My family, girlfriend and friends are all super supportive and I was never really in a negative environment so I have no clue where this came from and it’s eating me inside. The symptom that has the biggest grasp on my life is my blushing where my face goes hot pink in almost any social situation. The fear and anticipation that I’m going to blush is what triggers the blush, this I know, but I can never fight it and my mind gives in. It’s not that I’m afraid to talk to people, it’s that I know that I am going to turn red and embarrass myself as a result of the social situation. It isn’t normal to just blush while talking to someone, and I tell myself there’s nothing to be embarrassed or scared of, but it still happens all the time.

Has anyone been through this and can help with with some tips? I feel it’s taking over my life and I’ve reached the point where I don’t want to go to social events or order from a restaurant anymore in fear of what’s to come. At this point I am desperate."

544,People’s ignorance about mental illness will never stop,"
It’s just not possible. Famous people will just die and die and die and die because no one gets them. You have everybody but nobody real. 

No one realizes how fucking scary depression is. It’s so fucking scary having depression.  If i had a chance to end this world, i would do it. I don’t want people to feel what depression feels like, or any other mental illness.

I forgot the point of this post the second i opened reddit. I cant even imagine the things famous people go through. Amplify it with 200x with depression. 

This world makes me so sad. Everybody seems robotic, like there isnt anybody that gets what i get. Not in the sense that im smarter or anything. I just feel like i can truly feel what a person is going through. It feels horrible. I dont want this.

Sometimes i feel like im alone in this world and everybody is just a robot programmed to look like a human. 

Everybody is trying to get famous and rich. ”Im famous on tiktok i got 100k views” ”oh this repost got 25k upvotes omg wtf give me karma” ”give likes for my big booty”
”Lets cancel this person because she said n word back in 2008”

Like seriously, getting triggered by a word. I get it, its has history. But what if no one cared? No one would react when someone says the word. No one would use it because thats what the word is for, attention.

I hope everybody goes through depression so they will feel what some people feel that they talk trash about.

Both times she basically told me that her time is precious and her sessions could be the difference between someone living or not, and then told me to find counseling through a community mental health service instead.

546,"What am I experiencing? Panic, Dread and Anxiety onset by thoughts of a difficult past 7 years...","Hi all, this may not sound too serious compared to other issues on here, so don’t worry about answering if there are other posts that need attention, but here goes... 

So I’ve just finished university, and managed to come out with a decent grade (hopefully). All in all, it has been a very bumpy road from start to finish which has lasted almost 7 years, from multiple jobs to overwhelming stress from balancing my priorities... It’s just not been at all straight forward and I’ve struggled a lot with the deterioration of my mental health, depression and the breakdown of relationships. It’s done now though, and I feel a lot of relief. However... 

I’ve been having strange ‘episodes’ as such, in the past month since finishing the degree, whereby I get an overwhelming feeling of panic, dread and anxiety whenever I look at/think about certain pieces of university work I’ve done, notes from lectures, scenarios I faced at work, and so forth. Most of the time it feels involuntary - like I’ll be doing something completely unrelated and my mind will suddenly fixate on something that will trigger these feelings, such as my dissertation for example. 

Looking back at my final dissertation in particular brings on these feelings fairly strongly and consistently, and I don’t really know how to explain it. It’s all fairly cut and dry, like I’ll look at/think of something that will trigger these feelings, then I’ll just take a moment and it’ll kinda fade out.  

This experience is similar to one I’ve had in the past following a motorcycle accident. Following my accident, I’d have daydreams at random points in the day or occasionally nightmares when I’d kinda relive the accident as it happened, when invoked the exact same feelings of panic, dread and anxiety that I’m feeling now... 

Has anyone else faced anything similar? Or could anyone identify what this could be? 

I’m quite embarrassed about this, hence the anonymous Reddit post asking for advice... 

But yeah, any insight would be greatly appreciated - thanks for hearing me out ✌️"

549,Does it sound like I had a bad relationship with food?,"I was a curvy 13 year old and felt really fat and ugly once I was 120lbs at 5ft1. I severely restricted my eating habits for 8/9 months at 14 until I was 100lbs and I was prone to dizziness and worried so much about gaining any weight ever again. While I had a healthy BMI technically, I looked way too thin in hindsight. I was hungry so much, wouldn't allow myself to even have ice cream at a family wedding for fear I would become ""fat"" again. I had a shorter lived phase at 17 for 3 months,  where I saved photos of skinny celebrities and used them to motivate myself not to eat. I would limit myself to 1200 calories for 2 or 3 days in a row, and then binge on 2400 calories one night and feel crazy guilty and worthless. It was horrible and I obsessed over calories 2 or 3 hours a day.

Is this normal teenage girl stuff or did I have a problem in hindsight? I'm a Size 2 now, I don't allow myself to check my weight anymore in case I panic and I haven't binged/restricted in a cycle or worried about getting fat in 3 years. I still have hang ups about Victoria Secret typed"

551,It Gets Better,"I’ve dealt with mental health and suicide for almost my whole life. From environmental factors and genetics. It’s very real. I have bad days, horrible horrible days. However, I’ve convinced myself that I can’t kill myself. And I say it with confidence, because it can’t really hurt. I know it sounds crazy. I’m not cured. I still get suicidal thoughts I still experience my illness. However, my reasonability has become so powerful that I literally can’t.. kill myself... like it doesn’t become an option. I’ve realized I don’t want to die I just didn’t want to suffer, you know? And this mindset has helped me become mentally stronger, more positive, and healthier. It’s so obvious but I understand how hard it is and how much the giving up seems so easy. Of course I still think you should seek help. It doesn’t hurt to get help. I know I say this like it’s so easy but I know it’s not. But I think it’s important to give yourself that chance. To stop seeking blame at yourself or others, because I know I did and probably will again. When you’re hard on yourself you simply excuse your actions, but you know, it’s not your fault that you feel shitty. You have to take things as opportunities to grow. The term “it gets better” is a little nonspecific to me because it makes the world seem all rainbow and sunshine when it’s not. When you’re simply expecting all good you become unprepared for the bad because that’s how things are. Good and bad. And you live for you and along the way there’s people you love, happy experiences, but also struggles. It all seems like common knowledge but for me, it was easy to forget. I don’t know if this is helpful at all but it doesn’t hurt to try and I say this all from a place of love. I’ve been pushing and have been clean from SH and attempts for a year. Take care of yourself and be kind, when you get the strength. I truly believe that there’s good solutions to everything. I’d like to think that, that’s true."

This sounds horrible to say but part of me wants to have it. I've never fit in or felt at home in the world and the thought of being able to find the illusion of interaction within myself sounds so nice. Basically I'd rather interact with delusions/hallucinations than have anything to do with the outside world. I know that's a dumb thing to think as there are people who genuinely suffer with this condition but none the less I crave it in a weird way.

554,Is it just fear or something more?,"I’m about to be 15, yet specific, normal sounds scare me. As far as I know, there is only two different situations that trigger this fear, but there may be more that I just don’t know of.
Usually loud sounds don’t really trigger me, but specifically loud shouting (out of anger) and music that is turned up too loud really scares me and I want to get away from it ASAP. This causes me to have the urge to cry and I instantly receive a headache. People talking loudly (e.g. in a crowd, in a room with a group of parents talking/laughing loudly, kids in school during P.E. class) gives me an awful headache and sometimes my headaches get so bad, I become emotional (want to cry), however this hasn’t really happened for a while now, thankfully. Although when little children are screaming around me, I don’t really mind it that much, I don’t understand it. One more thing, I also get emotional when I get told off for doing something wrong in school, like when I get pulled out of the classroom for something (which doesn’t usually occur, but when it does..), I just genuinely become scared and sometimes feel like crying, but I keep it in."

556,It’s my birthday..,How can I be happy today on my birthday if I haven’t had any friends tell me happy birthday and have no one to spend it with?
557,I can't stop worrying/overreacting when my mom tells me her problems.,"Backstory: my parents divorced when I was 5, and it was just me and my mom until I was 17. I was her support and she was mine, so we are really close (which I love, because we can talk about anything and everything in an open and honest manner). But after all those years of just being just the two of us, I sort of projected myself into the problem-solver role. I have a a great realationship with her partner, he has been in our lives for 11 years now, and he did stepped up to the plate a number of times. Also after the divorce, I developed a fear of losing my family again.

Now to the problem, even if they generally have a good relationship there are fights and stuff like that, which I know it's normal, but I always freak out. For example they had a squabble today and she called me to tell me about it, obviously she's being mad and being all like ""I'll show him"" , ""he is going to need x thing and I'm not gonna care"", "" I do this and that and he never does x"", and I know it's 99% just venting but my heart just sinks and I go into full damage control, then I keep creating these awful scenarios where they end up breaking up. 
I've talked to both of them togheter and separately and they both assured me that it would take more then some fights to break up. My mom also told me numerous times that usually after they fight and don't speak to one another for a while they end up laughing about it in the end, which was again confirmed by her partner. 
Still everytime this happens I go into panic/sad mood, and it takes me hours, or at least until she confirms that things are fine to get over it. Due to this is hard to enjoy my own life sometimes, or other times just being afarid being happy or doing stuff, because in the back of my mind there's always the though ""what if something bad happens?"".
How do you guys deal with stuff like this?"

559,Do i have any mental health's problems (maybe just boredom),"I(17,M) am a highschool student, who is currently in summer vacation. Next year will be a tough year, and i have to work hard so i could get to some good universities. But right now, when i need to focus on studying the most, my mind, is just totally empty. I mean, absolute empty, nothing come across my mind at anytime of the day, no emotions, nothing. I tried many ways, gaming, texting with random girl, try to communicate with my buds, but nothing helps. This is really important time with my life.
I afraid that may have some kind of mental health's issues. Any advices dear redditors?"

562,Good job,Hey you woke up today. You made it through yesterday and the day before. You fought the troubles of yesterday and made it here. Good job buddy.
563,why does it feel like I'm being deceived every time someone is nice to me?,"Title sums up pretty well, but every time someone shows me kindness it feels like they're trying to hurt me. I don't know how others perceive me so it feels like I'm secretly hated. Kind of like feeling like that One Kid from high school who has just zero sense of self and is so socially inept they're made into a laughingstock.Even in professional settings it feels like this. So whenever people are kind to me it almost seems like pity. Pity, being nice to me to fool me or just being maliciously manipulative by trying to lull me into a sense of false security. This paranoia is ruining my social life. 

For example, I was called over by my Japanese professor after class a few months back. She noted that I wasn't too into the practice activities and wanted to know why I wasn't as into it. When I told her it was because I already knew the material (I'm not wanting to puff myself up at all but I find the class very easy) and didn't see the point in fully participating bc of it, she offered to let me sit out the activities and peruse the textbook for self-study. I was shocked by this, I was expecting her to chide me and tell me any practice is important which would have been deserved, obviously. It felt like she was pitying me and singling me out. This led to me thinking she saw me as inept, needing of extra coddling etc. 

If I think logically about it, it's obvious she felt that if I didn't need the practice I should spend the time actually trying to learn but I can't help feeling this way. I hate being the 'special' one. Normally I can come off as a normal student without crippling social anxiety, I can socialize like anyone else when called for group work, I can sit down with a group and speak confidently. So I'm not some person in a hoodie in the corner refusing to interact with anybody. Why do I feel this way? I can only assume it's my insecurity in my own image."
564,Misdiagnosed?,"I've been to many different types of mental health services ever since I was like 5. I ended up having to see multiple behavioral specialists my whole life over anger. I was diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar type 2 at 7 because I ended up doing physical harm to my cousin for being rude to me. I harmed a lot of people throughout my young years which is hard for me to accept today. It was reason for me to get checked for issues and also because I never spoke to my mother unless I absolutely has to. I was kinda silent a lot in my life which I still am today. Not the point though, I feel like I was diagnosed with bipolar without actually having bipolar so I could get medication shoved down my throat to make me a zombie rather than working through my thoughts and problems. I've been on many medications my whole and none have helped besides for adhd and anxiety.  Recently when I think about it, it seems like I was misdiagnosed and that's why the medication never did anything for me. I ended up going to therapy at like 14 up until my current period in life and I was diagnosed with PTSD and I feel like I had a lot of anger because I was rejected, shut down, forced to change how I felt, and was forced to be my mother's therapist from a young age and it didn't help I missed out on my childhood because my mother is disabled and has been since I was a kid a long with a lot of other traumatic shit from medical issues to sexual assault. I did go through depression but I've been out of it for a year. I don't really experience episodes like a person with bipolar. I just had legitimate depression for a few years because of the situation I was in rather than having bipolar type episodes. I don't take medication now so I know I'm not making it up otherwise I would be feeling differently. I just want to know if anyone else felt like they were misdiagnosed or forced on medication when really if you were talked to and listened to some things could've been prevented rather than it being a mental health disorder?"

I have no support and am jusy lost"
567,My Obsession,"I feel like I spend most of my day in a dream. I'm always taking myself out of this world and putting myself in a new one. I've had these timelines for years that I made up that I sometimes go back to, but most of the time I just slightly adjust the current situation I'm in and make my own story. Like I could be sitting at my desk at work and say hi to a coworker. I'll then go into my dream where it's the exact same situation, except I have a whole new conversation. I even sometimes catch myself acting it out in real life, like actually speaking or making faces. But I'm obsessed with my worlds I make and I am almost always in them. Sometimes I make a choice to go but other times I don’t even realize I've left the real world til it's over. And even then my worlds are so real and repetitive I can't tell when something actually happened or it happened in my dreams. The worst part is there is usually an obsession over a person - not in a romantic or sexual way. Everyone in my life has been an obsession of mine at some point. Sometimes it lasts a few weeks, sometimes months. Then I switch to someone new, even if I've known them for years. I feel so out of control and disoriented. All I want to do is just lay in the dark and go to my worlds and stay there. 

Sometimes my dreams are of things that happened when I was younger, like the bad things. Like when I was taken advantage of when I was still a kid. I go back to specific moments of it. Like I don’t even remember his face or exactly how old. I just remember how I felt, how he felt on me and in me. How his right hand wrapped completely around my left thigh. How his hand was so hot it burned. It was like fire and like I was being shocked and I was paralyzed. I just remember the pressure. I only just started to remember these moments. And I keep going back. I think about this all the time. If I'm not there with him I'm in a new world with my current obsession. And those dreams usually end up with the person of my obsession just caring for me like family should, taking care of me, looking out for me. And when it doesn't happen in real life I feel so dark and isolated.

And the hardest part is like I know everyone is against me. Like I know they don’t like me, they're all in on it, they're faking and that's why. And they probably already know about my worlds and what happened. And I don’t get why they do that to me. They pretend to be nice and I fall for it every time but then I realize I can see past it. I know the truth right now but I'll forget by tomorrow when I see them and fall for it all again.

I feel so disgusting and dirty. Like whatever I'm made up of is the most vile substance and I can never get clean. If I touch things, if people try to hug me or whatever they might realize how gross I am."

Right now he is attempting to fast for 15 days which just seems idiotic to me? He swears that it’s purely for health and that there’s studies that show he’s right. He offered to show me but I refuse, I don’t think a study telling you not to eat for 15 days is a reliable source but I could be wrong. Before this fast he would only eat one meal a day, and if us and some friends went out to eat he would just sit there while everyone else eats. How can I get through to him that there may be something wrong and needs help when there’s a bunch of ‘studies’ online claiming he’s right and that it’s good for you?"

573,"Do you know what's really depressing? Finally being ready to deal with my mental health, just to find out I can't afford the help I need :'(","In my 34 years on this planet, I have never been ready to deal with my mental health. I've experienced trauma, rejections, big life changes, and failures that have impaired my ability to function both as a child and now, as a responsible adult.

I am a husband and a proud father, and though I'm passionate and ambitious, I've never had the courage and motivation to follow through with those passions and ambitions. I suppose I'm afraid to fail, afraid to put myself out there. So afraid that as soon as I get ready to try something new, I talk myself out of it before I even begin. I'd rather choose failure than get my hopes up, just to face what I imagine to be the unavoidable failure. I'm struggling with depression and find it difficult to deal with day to day responsibilities, such as finding work, keeping a job, household chores, and other various responsibilities. When loved ones try to support and help me through these challenges and ""stuckness"", I feel confronted and guilty. I feel so bad that I become suicidal both in thought and verbally.

Recently, my loving and supporting wife has had it with all the insanity both at home and in the world. Due to quarantine and the current economic landscape, stress, and pressure buildup, she expressed that she really needed me to step it up by taking on more financial responsibilities. My anxiety kicked in, but I agreed to make an attempt to improve. Two weeks later, she expressed how hard the current climate is for her, and for whatever reason, I took it as her commentary on how disappointed she is with me and my behavior (probably because of my own low self-image and fears). My anxiety intensified, but I was afraid to communicate that to her because I felt sooo guilty. Sure enough, we had a second conversation that day, and I had a total meltdown. I became quite suicidal and totally lost my temperament and self-control in front of her and our children. Fortunately, we live close enough to my parents, that after wanting to end it all and having a million and one feelings and emotions run through my head, I mustered the courage to head over to them for support. This was helpful, as they talked me off the ledge, but my wife and I both realized that I really need help, and I cannot afford to kick this can down the road any further.

Our kids are getting older, and it's becoming apparent that my mental health is beginning to affect their mental health too.

Although the idea of opening up to a complete stranger scares me, I feel that I must deal with my demons now before my life completely passes me by, or worse yet, my mental health will harm myself or the ones I love.

I live in the NY Metro area, I thought fiding therapists would be easy. It's not. Also, I'm a Medicaid recipient, turns out I can't afford proper help... 

What do I do now? 

I don't want to give up! I want to get better!

I want to be the Father and Husband I know I can be.

I need help, please..."

576,Adult brother (early 30s) with undisclosed mental disorder. Won’t get help. Has been in an episode for years now.,"My older brother who is in his early 30s had a manic episode in 2015 where he crashed his car, caused a multiple car pile up, got arrested and resisted and got off because we realized he was mentally ill. He drove 3 hours north of his home with no destination and left his wallet and phone behind. He went to a medical center (mental health specific) for involuntary observation to get diagnosed and he never told us what the final diagnosis was and refused to take medicine. During this time he was violent towards his twin sister when she was trying to talk to him and nobody could get through to him. He was erratic and talking nonsense after we bailed him out of jail after the car crash. 5 years later he has not been the person he used to be, always in a daze and as if he doesn’t know what day of the week it is or anything. He doesn’t go see his son ever. I don’t even think he calls him. He doesn’t care about anything. He can’t work. He sits in a room all day blasting music and when he leaves the room he either goes and sits outside or he goes and walks or drives around for hours at a time. One time he got a motel room and was found just sitting in there. He did not pick up his phone and apparently he does this often. He usually shuts off the phone or blocks peoples numbers.

Based on our experiences with him and google resources we think he is either bipolar, or has DID or schizophrenic. The hospitals will not release any information. It is really hard on my parents because they feel as if there is nothing they can do. My mom doesn’t want to live like this where he’s smelly and dirty in the room and can’t work and she doesn’t want to have to take care of him forever. My dad wants to help so bad but whatever he does makes my brother mad and then he will ignore my dad.

What CAN we do? If we don’t know his diagnosis, he wont take medicine, he’s a fully grown adult, etc. 

Please help, we miss how he used to be and would love to get his life and ours back on track"
577,Is it normal to be *extremely* dependant on a routine? And the thought of doing something outside of your daily routine fills you with anxiety and dread?,"For example, my son’s bath time is at 7pm sharp- if it’s even 7:01, I panic inside and feel very uncomfortable; it’s like a sense of doom washes over me. It’s really frustrating... I can’t bring myself to go to my friend’s cottage for the weekend because it’s not part of my routine. I avoid seeing friends and family because that’s also not part of my routine- and the list goes on and on and on. 🙄😑 I can only do specific things at specific set times.

Afraid to get it because of a tramuatising expirancace I had in a mental hospital in 2008 at 17 and 18 years old here’s my story. I refused treatment and I started having bipolar mood swings and I got depressed me and my friend got on the phone and texted random numbers and guys responded to us. I never met up with them but she did when I was in the hospital. One of the guys called me I was laughing and they were in there 20s and would freak when they found out I was 17. I was so young I didn’t understand why. My grandpa called the police they came and I was rude they tried to taser me because I refused to go with them one sat on me and I kicked him because I’m claustrophobic and my grandma told mental health I kicked him and they put me on 5150. They hand cuffed me and took me out of my house and I said to them my friends house is over there which it was just drop me off at her house and he wouldn’t. He took me to a crisis center the woman was mean and cold hearted I told her the walls were closing in on me can I step outside she was rude and said no. There’s plenty of space in here while I hyperventilated. Then they gave me a shot of haldol I told them I don’t want it they said it will calm you down. I just started sleeping on a couch they woke me up and told me they are sending me to a mental hospital 2 hours away I said I just wanna go home. I’m calm now they wouldn’t let me. When I got there they stripped searched me and took my pants away because they had strings and wouldn’t let me wear shoes even though they were slip on converse. I said give me my shoes. They told me we don’t wear shoes here I felt violated like I was raped then they gave me a bed there was a room mate. In the morning she woke up and said to me this place sucks I agreed with her then I went back to sleep and slept all day a lady asked me if I wanted dinner I expected good food. It was nasty so I took a couple bites and threw it in the trash. They got on my case for not eating it. Almost every meal was like that. I would take a bite or 2 and threw it away because it tasted gross. They wouldn’t let family bring you food. If they did I would have ate it. I was there 2 weeks they got mad because I wasn’t seeking treatment I just asked to go home every day I didn’t participate in groups because I didn’t want to be around people. And they over drugged me because I got mad because I wanted to go home. They made me stay 2 weeks and spend my birthday in there when I had a big party planned. When I got out I could barely talk. And they said I needed out patient treatment and to attend a group but I refused to."
581,is it likely that i have bad mental health and is it worth going to the doctors or is it just me being a teenager?,"(F17) i don’t feel sad, but i feel empty. i still have emotions and stuff but, i just don’t have joy in anything i do. i procrastinate everything i do and the only thing i excel in is work (i wash dishes at a restaurant, i think it’s the physical side of things that’s beneficial for me) im not sad but im not happy. going out to work and college terrifies me and ill make plans with friends and then change my mind last minute. i worry about everything i do and say, such as reading a text multiple times before sending it, checking details multiple times when i order things online, when counting for anything i count multiple times etc. i always worry about what people think about me and have no confidence and i hate the way i look, i hate my body. i always find myself comparing myself to others and i know it’s unhealthy but i can’t help all of this. i went to the doctors about 2 years ago while i was in high school and they didn’t really do much. this puts me off going again because i freak out about going to the doctors and don’t want me going to be another waste of time. im also worried to open up about certain things. depression and anxiety is a common thing in my family. my grandma, uncle and mum all suffer. however im not sure if i suffer from any mental health issues as everytime i bring it up with my mum she kind of downplays it and shrugs it off as me being a teenager. am i overreacting and is it just me being a teenager or is it possible that i could have something? i have had symptoms of depression and anxiety in the past but i don’t like to self diagnose and feel guilty whenever i think/say that i have/could have it. i used to cry and freak out at the thought of going to school and leaving the house. i manage now, and force myself to go to work and college, however it leaves a sick feeling in my stomach and all i can think of is going home. i used to enjoy playing games (xbox and switch) but all i seem to do now is watch netflix and it’s just for something to do. the only thing that ive really enjoyed doing lately is listening to music :/"
582,I hate my family members,"I am crying as I write this .My mother is so controlling and does everything to make me miserable.She insults me when I confide in her and lately I have been hiding everything from her.She tells me what to do, wear, eat.I am literally 19 and I am not even allowed to be outside the door of our apartment without her permission, my older sister takes her side and they gang up on me for the littlest things.I try to reason with her but she does not listen.I am really beginning to hate them.I am already depressed and this just aggravates it.I have no one."
583,I can’t stop manipulating people and I feel unwelcome in my own body.,"Look I’m sorry if I rant but I’m panicking and I don’t know what to think much less what to feel.

I, M15, can’t help but unconsciously guilt people and manipulate them, I’m genuinely horrified by what I say and do when I look back on it. 

I usually don’t even realize til I’ve fucked up MAJOR. I have ridiculously diverse mood swings and I can’t lose my temper in sub second timings. 

I’m naturally impulsive, and my mental health has deteriorated rapidly after recognizing my behavior and how I should be ashamed of everything I’ve done. I don’t have a specific event in mind but I’m starting to lose myself and I feel like I’m watching myself fuck up everything I’ve worked hard for and hold dear to myself. I have no clue what’s wrong with me and I need someone’s help.

I’m just disgusted by myself more and more each day.

Can anyone explain why I have all these problems? I talked to my mom about getting a mental health checkup for depression/schizophrenia/bipolar or whatever the fuck is going on.

I’m doing summer classes at the community college right now because of the virus and I really thought I could handle taking three classes and keeping up with my schoolwork, but apparently that’s not going to happen. My problem is is that I have had depression since middle school and anxiety as well. And whenever I get off track I can feel myself slipping into bad habits, like not starting because I’m already behind. I want to ask my instructors for leniency because I feel I can accomplish the courses if I could be forgiven for late work, but I don’t want to explain to them my mental health. Every day it seems to be harder and harder to get started, but I love to learn so I don’t want to completely quit. I know my gpa will suffer if I don’t do anything and I don’t want to risk ruining my future of going to an elite college. Also I took financial aid so I don’t want to withdraw and risk losing more financial aid down the line. 
I don’t want to make excuses, but I do want to explain my behavior and hopefully earn some forgiveness from my instructors. How can I balance this? Thank you in advance for any advice"
587,I can’t help but feel like I need to be “babied” by my boyfriend because of the lack of care I had as a child,"How do I get out of this mindset? I don’t mean baby as in like, I’m completely dependent on him or anything. I’m independent and we have an adult relationship, but I just *need* him to coddle me like a child at the same time. My dad is an asshole who was extremely neglectful, and my mom was great up until she abandoned me for a man she found. I’ve had literally no one, ever, truly treat me like you would a child, with love and protection. I was cooking my own food by 6 years old, I’ve always been an adult. So now that I found someone I love and who loves me, I can’t help revert to this very strong urge I have to want him to treat me like a baby. A part of me hates it, and I really don’t want to come across clingy, childish or anything like that so I’d like to get past it altogether. How do I do this?"
588,Managing feelings of being overwhelmed in public?,"How do you cope and calm yourself down when you start getting overwhelmed and overstimulated in public? I’m moving away to go to uni in a few months and the only way I know how to cope is with my mum. She can see the signs before I start to shutdown and she’ll know what I need before I do, it’s like mum’s have some kind of superpower lol. But I need to be able to manage it myself. Being with friends doesn’t help because I’m a very private person and I don’t like being vulnerable and admitting that I need help or that I’m not coping; whenever it’s started happening when I’m out with friends, I just have to squash it down and scream on the inside until I go completely numb and don’t really know what’s going on around me, or I have a complete meltdown and embarrass myself. What are people’s personal techniques when dealing with it? That horrible feeling of everything being too loud and too bright and too many people and too much going on. I know it’s bad that I’ve gone this long without learning to deal with it, so please don’t have a go at me. I’m just looking for some help so that I can help myself."

For context: he doesn’t have any experience with mental health issues and I had to explain what most of my issues were because he was unaware. He’s never had to help anyone with these type of problems or deal with them himself, and I’m worried about burdening him by asking for help."
593,anxiety over doctors appointments,"i get anxious really easily about almost everything.  honestly, even thinking of going out to meet good friends and have fun is nerve wracking.  somewhere along the line, i've internalized the idea that things need to be perfect or it's the end of the world and to stress over every single step.  i get consumed with every way things could go wrong and i visualize what's about to happen as though it will take place in the most chaotic scenario possible.  i barely talk about it with my current doctor because, frankly, she's not that helpful.  maybe if she were my first or second doctor she would be but i've had a lot of doctors.  i've basically gotten what i need to address this over the years of seeing people and have developed my own grasp on it even though it's not perfect.  i guess that's kind of how therapy goes, right?

doctor's appointments, ironically, have always been a huge source of anxiety for me.  i have never felt comfortable or looked forward to seeing any of my doctors.  the actual session is alright but for like two days leading up to it, i'm on edge and sometimes almost lose my appetite.  the worst part for me, usually, is planning how i'll get there and worrying about all the catastrophes waiting between my place and my doctor's place.  

in the past, i've left the house like two hours before my appointment simply because i *vastly* over-estimate my obstacles.  probably because there are none.  like, the bus might be five minutes late and in reality that's the worst that could happen.  i don't have to fight off a hoard or run through some corn maze, i just have to do something incredibly easy and normal.  i can't imagine how easy life would be if i could just forget my appointment was coming up and breeze through it all like it was no big deal.  because, it really isn't a big deal."
594,I get really sad when I cute girl in street sees me and then immediately puts all her attention on her smartphone.,"It really does make me sad because she's susceptible to tripping or getting hit by a car because she was typing and looking at her phone while crossing the street. Then when I looked back at her once we crossed paths I noticed that her eyes were a bit more focused on walking rather than texting. All of this makes me feel like garbage physically. This is what I was wearing. A black beanie to cover my long messy hair, an ugly extra large t shirt, I was carrying my package that I covered in a white garbage bag."
595,Possible assault,"For context I am 21yo and have autism. So I just remembered this. About a year ago it was the first and only time my ex and I had sex. I didn't really want to that night and wasn't expecting it so kept saying it hurt as an excuse to stop it. He tried having sex with me and after trying 3-4 times under that situation until he stopped. He then said we wouldn't have sex at all that night and would wait until we were at his and had lube and it could be good for me too, he then brought up the fact that I was sexually abused as a kid and how he would never do that to me. Directly after he said that we kissed once and he then tried having sex with me again, I said it still hurt and he stopped and he went to sleep. I couldn't sleep at all that night and went to pull the covers more over me like tow hours later and he started kissing me and fingering me and having sex with me. He asked if it hurt and I said no but the whole time I was waiting for him to stop and I couldn't even look him in the eye, I had just given up trying after trying to get it to stop like 6 times already, I wasn't wet at all and I didn't enjoy it I was just waiting for him to finish. I really liked him and trusted him so always thought this was just normal with couples and it was something wrong w me and my libido idk. It wasn't until reading about consent today that I remembered this experience, I never told any friends about these circumstances surrounding when we had sex. Did he rape me?"
596,I don’t think it’ll ever get better,"No matter how much I learn, how much I realize, how many things I come to accept and how many coping skills I develop...no matter how great life is going, how happy I’m feeling, there’s feelings that will always be there and they’re never going to go away. I hate the fact that we are dying. I am slowly deteriorating and so is everyone around me and it’s slipping through my fingers like sand and there’s not a single thing I can do about it. I can try to appreciate it but it’s all going to be gone one day. Everything around me will be gone. The more time I spend here, I spend caring about things, the harder it will be when it’s over. I don’t feel good enough to keep living in this world. It’s a shit hole. And I do nothing to make it better. I am just another beacon of pain. I know there are things worth living for. I know life is beautiful and this mentality is pointless unless I’m gonna kill myself because this life is the only one we have and I have to make the most of it. But it’s all going to be gone, my family will all die. I remember the day I realized it. I was in 5th grade, it was late at night and everyone was asleep. I suddenly felt so alone and truly realized that everyone around me is going to die some day. It filled me with incredible sadness and anxiety that hasn’t left my chest since. It’s always there. It’s not something I can ever get over. Imagine getting diagnosed with cancer, it sucks and it’s incredibly hard right? But it’s the same thing. We’re all dying and in the end it doesn’t matter how long it takes to get there because we get there either way. You’re gonna be just as afraid of death 50 years from now as you are today. I hate this. I hate feeling like this I hate that everything is sad and hard and the world is falling apart and I’m lonely and scared"
597,Confessing to the Horrible things I did before my BPD diagnosis.,"I've done/ said some nasty shit and my list of offensives is probably as bly months long, but I want to make sure I hold myself accountable during my process to being a better me. 
Horrible things I've done: 
1. I called my rapist out online and attacked his pregnant gf, I told her she and her baby could go fuck themselves.
2. I've stolen from both of mothers. I didnt really care how they were going to be affected, all I knew was that I needed money and it was easy to get my hands on their money. 
3. Told my ex boyfriend I was pregnant and a family member had died to make him come back. 
4. I told a dead woman's family she could fuck herself. (This deceased woman harassed me ag the beginning of my pregnancy and it got so bad I had to quit my job.) 
5. I've gotten so drunk I've neglected my personal hygiene and my daughter's hygiene because I physically felt like there was no point. 
6. Lashing out at people who did me wrong in middle school because I was drunk and the incident just happened to be on my mind. 
7. I've been so drunk I've physically attacked my mom and ended up in a psych ward. 
I could go on and on and I'm sure people will read this and immediately go to the negative. Whatever you feel is fine, I won't diminish it. I just needed to get everything off my chest. I am doing a lot better and I am looking forward to improving me. God bless everyone. ❤"
598,I need advice (school problem),"I think I might need some kind of help or guidance or something but I don’t know where to ask so I came here. 
Just for context, I am in my last year of high school (in my country school starts in February and ends in December, but the calendar might be different now because of the pandemic). 
So, I had my first physics and chemistry exams of the year today (it should have been earlier but the school was avoiding exams because of the lockdown), anyway I have been studying a lot more this year, more than I have ever studied in my life. I have online classes from 7 to 12 and then study alone from 14-15 to 20-22. So, back to the exams, I have been studying a lot and only got an 8/10. I know how it sounds. I know I shouldn’t complain about getting an 8 because it’s a good grade. The thing is it wasn’t more than my grades before, it was about the same if not worse. But the problem is when I got that grade I was really shook and started crying, and continued crying (for hours). I think that’s just really f****d up. It’s the first time something like this has ever happened to me and I don’t know what to do. I would really appreciate some advice on what to do."
599,Is something wrong with me or is it just my personality?,"I'm 17 so I feel this isn't me just going overboard from hormones and such. But I'm incredibly impartial to some very serious things.

I don't wish to sound over dramatic, but I have problems with death or other people having emotional issues. I don't feel anything thinking about people dying, and I feel very little about a family member dying as well. I don't care about other peoples problems and what they go through.

I've never experienced taking a life or having a life taken in front of me but I feel as if I would be fine, like it just wouldn't effect me, and I'm fairly certain I'm correct. I don't get any feelings about seeing blood or even smelling it, I don't have problems seeing a corpse either.

I don't feel as if I'm this way because I lack the experiences of such things, I feel as if it just doesn't effect me at all. I've recently found something about psychosis and negative symptoms, and I thought it matched what I was feeling, but looking into it more I think it's wrong.

I'm able to feign the correct emotions for such events and scenarios, because I understand it's not normal to just be deadpanned to being told someone died, or a friend tried taking their life. I still have happiness in my life, it's a little hard finding something to give me happiness but I still have that emotion, sadness is very difficult to find and I find myself bored with everything instead. So I know I'm not completely void of emotional reactions, but I just don't feel anything towards matters where most people hold especially strong emotions.

Do I just have a lack of emotions for such things? Do I have a high tolerance for it? Or is something wrong with my brain that's causing me to not produce the correct emotions? Can anybody provide a more clear understanding of this for me because I'm confused if it's just my personality and that's who I am or if it's something else."
600,I hate sleep and ive been trying to avoid it for a while now,"I'm gonna try to keep this short but resently I've been purposely tryin to avoid sleep by binge watching anime or going on my phone its not a genuine fear of sleep I just hate it and I've been getting sleepless nights because off it. I just try my hardest to keep my self awake even if it means headaches and being tired all day. idk if this is insomnia because all this came out of no were I've just randomly started hating sleeping        

(I have been sleeping a bit and that's because when I'm really really tired like struggling to keep my eyes open tired i close my eyes onaccident for bit and I just fall asleep)

Please reply even if you can't help just maybe tell me whats wrong with me"

602,How to make people know that I am there?,[removed]
603,This week was horrible for me mentally,"Another mental health post from me and I’m at a loss for words. It’s weird because nothing bad is happening to me yet my negative thoughts about myself keep wanting to to take over my brain. This also included suicidal ideation and extremely low self esteem. Even if nothing bad is happening, I can’t escape the thoughts that I have that have been caused by either society or horrible memories that I have of being truly alone in a situation where I felt like everything was against me. 

I went to a mental clinic two times in order to get me started and although my mom was trying to schedule me with a therapist, Corona hit so we can’t go due to safety precautions. I hate this, I was going to get help and then this happens.

I don’t understand why I can’t be happy all the time. We live in a flawed world but I want to at least feel happy about living. Yet i can’t even do that."
604,I keep feeling really sad but I never cry?,"at times I get really sad over something and it sorta escalates but I end up getting really sad (not being able to sleep sad) yet I don't cry? is this normal didn't know where else to ask 
(if it helps as far as I'm aware I don't have any mental health issues)"
605,Quarantine depression,"I just realized I haven’t talked to anyone but my dad irl for over a week, it’s making me depressed. Advice?"
606,Am I going to be ok?,"About a month and a half ago I (22M) had a sudden panic attack out of the blue. I had no direct cause of anxiety or stress but i may have had some stress related issues pile up in the back of my head. After this panic i suffered from severe insomnia and i haven’t felt the same since. I feel on edge all the time sensitive to noises and bright lights. I have constant tingling in my extremities and head. I had waves of panic that came with paraesthesia. My legs feel sore and terribly stiff every day no matter how much I sleep or rest. My eyes feel tired no matter how much i sleep. Occasionally i wake up feeling my left side of my body tingling that slowly goes away. I have terrible fatigue and occasional migraines as well. 

I managed to survive about a month until i couldn’t take it anymore and met with my doctor.  I admitted that i went through intense hypochondria during this time because of my terrible physical symptoms thinking at first i was getting schizophrenia then switched to ALS and then to MS and to brain cancer. I explained to him my symptoms and he examined my blood ,B12, and thyroid. All came back clear and he gave me a GAD diagnosis. He prescribed me antidepressants and buspar for the next few weeks. 

That same day at night i woke up shivering terribly in bed at 4 AM and was so scared. The shivering passed after about 20 minutes. I convinced my parents to take me to the ER and the doctors examined me and determined i had nothing and gave me xanax and pain relievers. I was very frustrated by this outcome so the next day i went back to the ER and asked for a CT scan of my head. They were reluctant because they were convinced i had nothing but they gave me it. The scan came back clear and i was relieved for a bit, until my symptoms persisted. 

About 2 weeks into my antidepressant treatment and I’ve noticed some improvement. The burning paraesthesia with waves of anxiety have stopped and my insomnia has improved. However, i still feel so stiff and fatigued that it feels like i ran a marathon everyday. I fear that this is going to be permanent and chronic and this is my new life. Ive been reading about chronic stress and this seems to check most of its boxes. I have always been a anxious guy terribly so believe me but this is something completely different and lasts the entire day from beginning to end. Have i entered a point of no return or is there some hope for my situation."
607,I don't get any of it anymore,
608,Hi. No advice needed. Just saying something out loud,"I just broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years.
The girl who had my first child. And then my second child. The girl who I've spend the last 6 years fighting for better jobs with, to better our situation. Building homes together as we moved around. 

But we just couldn't do it anymore. I can't be her support without any support for myself. We have to move apart, so we can grow the right way. I think we will be happier this way in the long run - and be better parents because of it. 

But it's still hard. 
Hard to say goodbye to being with my children every night. And despite our fighting - being with the one person I'm closest to and who understands me. 

I wish I had more friends and family, maybe this could be easier and not so lonely."
609,Going from 37.5 mg Effexor XR to 0mg,"Hello,

I started taking Venlafaxine (generic Effexor XR) about 5 days ago (I’m 18F if that matters btw). It worked really well for me, my anxiety and obsessive thoughts tampered down almost immediately (although they didn’t completely go away, and I do still feel quite blue from time to time). Only side effects I had was slight fatigue, decreased appetite and occasional yawning.

However, after reading other people’s experiences with this drug and the extreme withdrawal symptoms, I’ve decided to stop taking it and switch to Zoloft. The only issue I have now is deciding wether to quit cold turkey or taper. I would rather not get withdrawal symptoms, but I also really don’t want to continue taking this drug. I’ve talked to my doctor about quitting and she said that I could quite immediately and take Zoloft, but I’m still kinda worried. What are y’all thoughts on how I can safely? 

Thanks"
610,My Therapist is Leaving the Practice,"Today I had my final session with the 
therapist I’ve been seeing every week for the past 7 months. It’s been very hard for me to open up about my past, abuse, and trauma. I found myself just getting comfortable with my therapist. At the end of our session this morning my therapist told me it would be our last. She is leaving to open her own yoga business (or something to that nature). I know my therapist is just a person and that this is just their job. I know people leave jobs all the time. I’m told I would be contacted by a new therapist within the week, however I feel like I no longer want to continue therapy. I just got my official diagnosis of PTSD and Bipolar 2 and we were just talking medication. I know my new therapist will have all my notes but I feel like I’m completely starting over. I can’t shake this silly feeling of abandonment. I can’t help but to feel that no one from the office will reach out to me to get me a new therapist like I was told and I will be forgotten. It took me a very long time to convince myself to seek help and now I have to open up about the things that hurts so much to talk about to someone else. 
Part of me truly does not want to continue with a new therapist. I’m already overthinking things like “what if this person leaves?” and “Will they actually be invested in me?”  
Anyone else experience a change in therapist? Any positive stories to help convince me to stay?"
611,Sometimes I think somethings wrong with me,"I don’t know go on Reddit much, but sometimes I feel like my real friends don’t TRULY understand...
Does anyone else ever feel like they take care of themselves 100 times better when they are with a different person/significant other for a long period of time? When I’m with myself alone I don’t take care of myself as much, and enjoy when I actually do/feel like I have a purpose when I’m with my SO..but at the same time sometimes miss being alone..
What’s wrong with me ):"
612,I know life moves on but i still hold on to the past,"I'm (24M), and i just cant let things go, i pretend nothing bothers me but deep down i still feel bad for something happened years ago. Most of the time i know that the things which are making me anxious are not that important yet i come up with imaginary scenarios to make my life worse. I don't know how to deal with this, i can't forget things and that keeps me up at night."
613,How can I help my girlfriend in handling her depression?,"I just feel so useless because I can‘t do anything. I ask again and again what I can do for her and the answer is always nothing. That confuses me, because at times where she is feeling a little better, she always tells me that she needs someone nearby. I don‘t know what to do. I will never ever leave her, I love her too much, but at the same time I recognize how it is affecting me. Especially when she says hurtful things, which happens from time to time. I am just so lost. Can you guys advise me?"
614,Why can't I just kill myself? and other things I'd like to scream into the void about,"I've been having suicidal urges for the better part of the past five years. Always a different plan depending on where I spent most of my time. Here are some of my plans that I just never executed;

* When I was taking Isotretinoin, I was prescribed a really high dose so I had tons of it with me. I regularly thought of taking an entire box of the 40mg caps - I was hoping it would either kill me outright or cause enough liver damage to kill me that way. (thought out for about six months)
* When I was on a school trip, it was to jump straight off a museum's roof in a foreign country and hit the pavement below headfirst. (spontaneous thought)
* When I was in high school, there was a very known coffee shop across the road (70kmh limit). My plan was to pretend to be mobile ordering on my phone and cross on the red. Hopefully getting hit and instantly killed by the impact. (thought out for about a year)
* Last year it was to jump into an 80kmh road. (spontaneous thought)
* When I found out I was failing two classes at uni, I was going up to my rez roof to jump off into the road below. However, because my uni was well known for how many people kill themselves in rez (one a month minimum), the roof was not accessible. (spontaneous thought)
* Current plan is to travel to Japan and go back to the one happy place that I can remember having in my life, a wagyu beef place in Kyoto. After having the best beef ever, I'd probably use the rest of whatever money I have left from my credit cards to buy some time with some hookers and a bunch of drugs. Then, find an easy way to off myself in a remote area where hopefully no one will ever find me. I'll be declared dead in absentia and my insurance would pay out. (plan for the past 6 or so months)

I don't understand what is stopping me, I just never go through with it.

My ""friend"" group is playing CS:GO as I write this. I was initially in the call first and in the lobby, but another friend joined and they pushed me out to accommodate the five-person limit of a game. They just stopped responding to me talking in the discord. 

My stomach pain is getting worse and worse I have a hard time sleeping because of how much it hurts.

I always have a lingering feeling of sadness, sometimes it's relatively tame but most of the time (like all of the past 2 weeks) it's pretty bad. I just do not know when it's going to stop doing that. I've been hopeful but now am less and less hopeful since it started 7 years ago. 

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to say this somewhere"
615,My brother won’t forgive himself and continues to live in the past. He is emotionally beating himself up and I’m scared.,"I need advice. I just don’t know what to do for my little brother anymore. He’s 20 years old and is fixated on life being 100% planned. A few months ago he basically had a hiccup that made him feel embarrassed. He contacted his ex and leaned too much into it. He felt extremely embarrassed when word got out to his close friends what he had done. Because of this he is convinced he is a failure. He also was looking forward to being more involved in the community that he felt embarrassed in. He says his life is ruined. He isolates himself from my family. He will ignore questions (we all want to be there for him and offer help). If he even answers, there no depth. I’ve tried to get him out of the house for a little. One day he left and didn’t tell anyone where he was or what he was doing (very unlike him) and we were all terrified. He will not consider counseling. Even online counseling he shuts down. I understand giving space for someone, but it’s been a long time. It’s been 5 MONTHS since his “mistake” and he sits at home with his head in his hands sighing 24/7. It’s incredibly hard on my family too since he has stopped helping my dad with work. My two even younger brothers, and my mom, are taking it so hard because they feel like they can’t do anything to help. When I say we’ve tried everything, I meant it.  I’ve talked with him for hours about how his mistakes don’t define him and his feelings are valid. And he’ll be okay that day, but the next it just goes back to the way it was. I’m also not currently living there so I can’t check up on him everyday. I just feel stuck. Everyone feels stuck. I’m terrified of when he’ll actually make a horrible mistake that he won’t know how to process everything or forgive himself. He thinks a time machine is the only thing that will fix it. I’m even debating on putting this on here but I figured, well why not. Please share your thoughts or resources that may help."
616,"One of the worst days of my life, a crazy person gave me a lollipop.","Today I had to take my cat to the vet and they told me she's anemic and going to die soon and there's nothing I could do to prevent it. They tried to convince me to put her down on the spot, but I was a crying mess and couldn't so they told me to force feed her for the weekend then call them back. Tomorrow I'm going to go to another vet because I thought that vet was incompetent, but that's not the point of this story.  


While I was waiting a half hour for them to do bloodwork sitting outside of the vet office, crying uncontrollably into the mask they made me wear a crazy person started coming down the street. A large tattoo-covered man with no shirt just shorts and flip flops. He started talking loudly to the other people standing outside the vet office with their animals about how the night before on that street someone beat him up and now he's looking for a cop to tell them.   


Eventually the guy stopped talking to them and continued down the road. I was sitting a little further away from everyone against a street fixture.  I'm a weird hermit who doesn't know what the fuck your social distancing mask whatever covid nonsense rules are, got berrated for that by the receptionist and the doctor so I opted to sit down the street. The guy passed me without saying anything. A couple minutes later he I see him out of the corner of my eye standing next to me and he hands me a stack of fliers for a laptop repair shop and says ""here take this!""   


I take it and start to read it to figure out what the fuck the guy just handed me, squeeze out a ""thanks"" through my tears. A little bit later he pulls 3 blowpops out of his pocket, 2 were cherry and one was a sour apple I think. He asked me if I wanted one, I didn't, but I wasn't going to turn down his kindness so I took one of the cherry's because he had two of that kind and I figure leave him with one of each. He immediately said ""NO DON'T TAKE THAT ONE TAKE THIS ONE"" and handed me the other cherry one.   


Then he continued down the street. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later one of the other people hanging outside the vets office that the crazy guy told he got beat up saw a security guard walking down the street and shouted ""ARE YOU A REAL COP OR JUST SECURITY?"" guy is clearly wearing a security uniform and he has a rat-tail and goatee which I don't think most precincts would be cool with. 

""I'm security but there's a cop right there."" he points across the street. The two men start  walking down the street together with the man who was standing outside the vet now recounting the crazy man's story to the security guard. The doctor then came out to tell me my cat is dying and I can't do anything about it, so I didn't see what happened from there."

620,What is the difference between Intrusive Thoughts in people who have OCD and delusions in people who have various delusion-related disorders (such as Narcissism) ?,"For example: 

* A person with **OCD** may have constant intrusive thoughts that her family is dead.
* A person with delusional thoughts, may believe that her family is dead.

Are delusions just a stronger form of intrusive thoughts? And if said person's OCD goes untreated for too long, will her thoughts turn into delusions?"
621,How being on the spectrum has affected my mental health,"I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was very young, I've always struggled in school and continue to do so in college. Looking at my low GPA reminds me of my drawbacks, and makes me wish I could just be one of those smart kids who somehow get 4.0's, I'm on par with the lazy unenthused students who just kind of meander through college and somehow pass, and it really puts a lot of weight on me while I try to study diligently and practice good note-taking skills. I'm always a step behind, at least it feels like it. It'd be nice if I were just lazy, and all I needed to do is just /try/ and all my problems would feel less opressing.

 That brings me to my next point, I feel like I look lazy, in fact I'm called lazy by my stepfather when I feel too overwhelmed to do anything but shut myself in my room. Going out for a drive anywhere is anxiety-inducing, I'm looking for work but until then I just practice my art in private, to which im told isnt real work and that I ""literally dont do anything"" but game and draw. I'm trying to build a portfolio but im still young and far behind on my technical skill. I don't have any good art schools nearby and am in no position to take out heafty loans anyway. 

Getting back on the topic, I'm just so tired of the constant feeling of being overwhelmed, im sick of finding reasons to cry almost every other night, im tired of the self harm I inflict on myself as ""punishment for being slow"" that feels justifiable in the moment. Videogames don't bring me joy or escapeism like they used to, my problems still exist there. Art is my most positive outlet, but man is it hard sometimes. I'm just hoping for better days to come and to feel less reasons to look at my life like I'm failing.

TLDR: Asperger's has pulled me down mentally since I was a child, and I feel dumber and less confident than everyone around me, and I just want my outlook on life to change."
622,I'm so fucking tired.,"I've been struggling for a long time. But lately, I just don't have the energy for anything anymore. Interacting with people is exhausting. Going outside is exhausting. Playing games or doing pretty much anything I used to enjoy is exhausting. Watching things is exhausting. Fuck, half the time, just existing is exhausting.

I have to keep myself constantly distracted though, or things get weird in some pretty horrible ways. So I spend most my life playing stupid, mindless mobile games that I actually kind of hate, or staring at some random show that's on for background noise and doesn't really hold any interest for me. I genuinely don't find any enjoyment anything anymore, so it just feels pointless to spend the energy doing things.

I've been in some pretty dark places, but I really think that this is getting close to the very end of what a person can handle. I don't even have any motivation to end it, nor could I do that to the people in my life. I just kind of lay around, hoping it's going to be over soon."

I had “ given up” on what I thought would be my dream career, to focus on a different path. I’m struggling to keep up with school, I worked at very high stress mental health hospital, and felt so unbelievably alone. No friends, no mentor. Some days I thought I was ok, other days My depression would sneak up on me like a predator chasing its prey. The crying spells, the hopelessness would not end. Today I made the leap. Today I realized I want to change. I want to feel something. I no longer wish to mope around in self pity. I made an appointment to get help, and god it feels so good."
626,I have a hard time making friends because of my childhood and I hate it [long],"I'm a 21F and I'm moving soon. I'm excited to be starting over without my parents, but I'm also nervous too. See, growing up I had a hard time with friendships. I had a best friend in 6th grade who was awful to me. Would put me down and tell people my business without my permission and would play victim when I got mad. This was pretty much how our friendship ended. We had a bad falling out it was an awful fight that almost got physical, it really impacted me. No joke I cried for a week

•7th grade, I made friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of the boys. One of my friends in the group started tormenting me. I moved to a different school and made friends with two other girls. I was the third wheel and I fell out with them when one of the girls let the other girl text me nasty things from her phone. Me and the other girl who texted me got in a fight because she accused me of telling a classmate about her crush (even though she was right next to me when it happened)

•8th grade, one of my friends moved, and another started hanging out with a group of girls who didn't like me. These girls hit my little sister with glass one summer, which led to me almost getting jumped lol. Anyways, my friend fb messaged me to be nasty and say she never liked me and she felt sorry for me and such. I cursed her out and I feel terrible now because she passed away last year. 

•9th grade I was friends with two girls, but they slowly started pushing me away and became closer with each other. I don't have ill feelings for them, but it still hurt 14 year old me. I also had a friend who gave me the silent treatment out of nowhere and I still don't know why.

•10th grade and so on I had friends, but I never got too close to anyone. 

•This is just the tip of the iceberg, I had a friend in 4th grade who was jealous of me and told my best friend who she was also friends with to not talk to me. My best friend also told me I was the ""annoying"" one in our class and in 5th grade my friend used to clown me around boys and said always made fun of me not having boobs (ironic since they're big now lol). 

Even my casual friends now that I made in high school, I'm scared to get close to them. The thought of getting close to anyone now freaks me out and it makes it hard for me to make friends. I always assume people will find me annoying or not want to hang out with me anymore, so that's why I don't want to become friends with anyone because I have this irrational fear they'll turn their back on me later. Which sucks because I so desperately want that best friend feeling again. That feeling of being able to call someone whenever I'm happy, sad, angry, heartbroken, etc. But I don't want to let my guard down and get hurt again. I'm not saying I'm perfect because I'm definitely not, but I never did anything like this to a friend of mine. It sounds silly because I'm a grown up now and I don't want to be holding on to my childhood like that. And when I move, I want to make friends, but I honestly don't know how. I never realized how awkward I was until my coworker asked why I was so shy and reserved. I'm sorry if it's long, but can anyone give me some advice?"
627,Gaslighting,"I was in a relationship for about a year with a girl with (what she told me) depression, anxiety, social anxiety. She broke up with me and didn’t tell me why, and told others I was emotionally abusive. I can’t tell if we gaslit eachother, or I did to her, or she did to me. (hopefully makes sense lol). I honestly don’t know if I was and it’s fucking my mind because there’s no definitive way for me to know. When we started dating, she did this thing called “silent treatment” as kind of a joke, and so I followed along and it just turned petty and it was toxic. She would call herself ugly, I’d disagree and tell her she wasn’t, and she’d never “believe” me. I understand that some people have insecurities but her body language showed to me that she wasn’t insecure, as I’m insecure myself but I’m not her so I can’t for sure know. She broke up with me on ft and I begged her to come back, and then over the next three days I kept asking why and she wouldn’t give me a single reason besides that I always “assumed” things, which is hypocritical of her to say if you knew her. I helped repair almost all of her friends issues, (looking back, I was put in position where I could’ve isolated her easily when she was dead bent on not being friends with her two closest did not like me), and I helped her get through that and through her mental and emotional problems. She would cry sometimes on ft without reason (that I knew of). I remember never thinking I was good enough because I had this altered sense where she was the prettiest person in the world, and I didn’t deserve her. If anyone can help me with anything that would be great"
628,social anxiety issues,"hey i’m a 17m here, currently in college.

i’m currently in my first year. recently due to the pandemic, sch’s are closed, so I have HBL ( Home based learning ) in term one and term two ( 17 weeks i think for both ). 

so term one just ended and it was all zoom classes. as someone who has social anxiety ( though not diagnosed clinically ), i tried my best to be open, talk, and even make jokes in class, and I don’t think I was that one kid that was trying too hard. 

I just wanted to feel accepted and I just wanted to have friends that I can call my friends because most of them are not. People have already formed cliques on their own ( in zoom we had breakout sessions so it’s random, if you are in a room filled of ppl you vibe with then good for you, clique formed). however that’s not the case for me, i have the shittiest of lucks to be paired up w some of the people that already have cliques, or some whom do not share my humour. though in term one I thought i had friends that I can relate to and can talk to, it was different today.

Today was the first day of on campus lessons ( lab lessons ) and i was with my friend that was from the same sec sch, so we r quite close. we both have the same issues. we even joined an outing with some of our classmates but we feel like we tried to talk to them, tried to socialise but ... apparently it was a waste of time?... 

In class we have assigned seats, and i was paired up w a guy that already has a clique??? i’m not sure but i just feel that... he has something against me..? i don’t know, i just feel like whenever i interact w someone i feel that they already judged me pretty badly, thinking i’m weird etc...

I really don’t know how to feel better after seeing cliques posting their group selfies and then having a fun time, any tips?.. should i even ask tjem out even if they have their own cliques ??? i just feel so ostracised it’s crazy how this is affecting me so badly.."
629,I don't know what to do,"Lately, I've been more concerned with my mental health wince I've been experiencing more panic attacks. I've tried asking some facilities that can help me but damn they're expensive. So I've decided to just probably find remedies online :("
630,i’m tired. I need someone to talk to.,[removed]
631,I feel like I'm falling apart,"I though things were getting better. Things looked like they were getting better. But now my life is just a mess of worrying about weather or not I will have health insurance to help pay for my anti depressants, if the landlord will kick us out because he want to sell the house, dropping grades, having to go back to work in a global pandemic, my dad taking my mother to court again, and feeling like I'm repulsive and unwanted by people I though cared. I'm only 17, and my mother depends on me for emotional support. I can't blame her, times are hard, but I wish she wouldn't take out her anger on me. She gets snappy, and when I try to help I'm just told off because ""it's not always about me"". I'm tired, I want to disappear, and start again somewhere nobody knows me. It's been months since I got this feeling of absolute impending dread fill up every part of my brain. I just can't win."
632,I feel so bad and at this point,"I don't even know why I feel this bad. I used to have heaps of thing feel bad about.  Toxic relationships, assignments being due, pissing off friends, LOTS of things. But now I have nothing to feel bad about. And still, I feel bad. I hate this. It's really hard to put up with without knowing when this will end"
633,I can't find a therapist,"I can't find a therapist. Around January, I noticed I wasn't feeling like myself (to be honest it was building over the last 9 months). There were nights I would act manic and just ruminate on stressful thoughts. I just couldn't seem to find a therapist who I trusted or thought was listening to me. My general practitioner wasn't even much help (in his defense he knew I needed better help).   


On March 13th, after weeks of feeling suicidal and having a plan I called a hotline who convinced me to go to the ER. I did. I was hospitalized for a week.   


I'm grateful I went to the ER that day. I felt like I saved my life.   


After the ER, I was in an IOP for 3 months. I graduated from it 2 weeks ago.   


This all happened to me during COVID. Nothing about my treatment has been routine. I sat at home alone while being told a depressed person shouldn't isolate themselves. I did an entire IOP over zoom. I didn't have any other choice. It's not my fault this has happened to me during a global pandemic.   


To top it off, I lost my job 2 weeks ago (the morning after I finished the IOP).   


I'm now trying to find an outpatient therapist. I've talked with two so far who after I explain the last 6 months of my life tell me that I need a therapist whose more available or could give me more individual attention.   


What does that even mean?   


I appreciate their honesty but I'm starting to get fed up. I can't keep retelling my story for the last 6 months and be told they can't help me. It's making me distrustful of therapists.   


Also, am I that screwed up in the head that nobody thinks I'm worth helping? I'm just that damaged ...   


I want to get better. I do. I'm shouting for help and just can't seem to find it. I'm so afraid of relapsing right now."
634,Hey I Need Some Help/advice with my grandpa.,"First I would like to say I may not be the best at explaining myself. But for the last couple of years my grandpa has been getting worse from dementia and he goes into a rage all the time at his neighbors, and sometimes his family for no reasons at all. He can even get violent sometimes, when we asked him about it he says he doesn't remember why he did it or give us some non nonsensical excuse. It's get worse when he has any hard alcohol he goes insane, a month ago he pulled a gun on my mom and threatened to shoot her head off, my mom took the gun from him and handed it to my dad and then he whined to her asking why she took the gun. The doctors have said that he can't live by himself anymore, and he can't live with us. the problems with this is he has no one else who cares for him other than us, my mom who takes care of him has extreme heart problems and can't handle stress, she can barley walk sometimes she has some sort of implant for her back that vibrates to num the pain that is not working, along with other problems. The last problem he does not want to live in a retirement center, so we are afraid he will go into a rage and get kicked and even if he we get him to say okay to this he will just forget about it in a day and go into a rage. at the moment he lives in a retirement trailer park so if we send him off to a retirement center and he gets kicked out, We wont be able to send him back to the trailer park. I don't think my mom would be able to handle that stress. Don't get me wrong we love him dearly and he used to not be like this, we only put up with this because we care about him, so we don't want him to be treated badly but we can't deal with him anymore. So any advice would be appreciated. 

Also I live in U.S Arizona if that helps, I know some laws very in different states"
635,Anger Management Course,"Hello,

I'm looking for an online Anger Management Course, or even better, an Anger Management Counsellor, so to discuss my anger problems and learn how to cope with them best :)

Where could I find online counsellors to pay on a hourly rate? Or do you know of any course that helped you to deal with this problem?

Im located in Europe, but I can find my way to work around the timezones :)

Thank you!"
636,"Why do i get random, casual suicidal thoughts? looking for advice, please and thank you","i’m not gonna sit here and say my life is roses, i struggle with moderate depressive disorder, and chronic anxiety. i can usually keep it under control, but all the time i have casual suicide thoughts. passing, and not emotionally charged. it’s like “what if you killed yourself”. it’s really confusing. i go through usual bouts of random but severe depression, and then i get emotionally charged suicidal thoughts, but they are driven by emotion, not incident. what’s wrong with me? i would love some advice"
637,I’m tired of not “living” life. Could use some suggestions or things to experience.,"I really don’t have any friends to do anything with and I’ve never had a girl friend. I finally realized I shouldn’t use these things to hold myself back. I want to experience things and go on adventures but I don’t because I thought it would be pointless to do stuff like that alone. I guess I want to find out now because I’m tired of just going through my normal routine. I wake up, go to work for 8 hours, come home, take care of my pets, eat, run, and then chill for a couple of hours. I just turned 18 and graduated and I’ve been doing a bit better mentally. I definitely still have my share of struggles but I’m making improvements for sure. Anyways I know a lot of stuff will still be closed for a while but I’d still like some ideas of things I can try and do now AND once things go back to normal and open up. Any suggestions, advice or help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"
638,Trying my best but..,"I’ve been trying my best in hopes of achieving something that may be impossible, but I keep persisting through all the pain nonetheless, because I want what I want and want to change. But I keep just messing up and making things worse without even meaning to.. I’m making important people and friends dislike me even more without even trying and it feels awful. It makes me scared to try or say anything. I really want to try doing certain things but I’m scared because I feel like I’ll just be shut down or I’ll do something wrong and make things worse. I just feel like I’m in a pit of darkness and only have just an ember of hope that I keep holding onto because it’s my only light, but no matter how much I fan that ember it won’t grow any bigger and only really comes closer to going out at times leaving me to feel hopeless and sad. I don’t know how to make this ember grow."
639,what am i experiencing?,"these past days have been shitty but they werent the worst days of my life. ive experienced worse but my reaction to those days were shit. 

i would feel upset and go to the bathroom and start panicking. i dont know about what but i just do. i would sit down nd start rocking back nd forth nd all bad thoughts r coming to my head. recently ive been experiencing tics (head jerking) during these times. i would also cry for no reason nd start pacing around nd fidget and i cant sit still. i can breathe properly and all but i just dont feel right. what am i experiencing?"
640,"Today I found out that my mom has a pretty strong double standard, she takes my anxiety seriously but not my sister’s depression. I’m just really angered by this.","My parents both have mental illnesses. My mom has anxiety and my dad has several more specific disorders. Probably because of this, my mom has always presented herself to us as someone who takes mental health seriously. She has always encouraged us to tell her if we are struggling with mental health, and she will be there for us and help us get help. 

Last year, at the age of 18, I started to develop pretty severe anxiety symptoms. I’ve always been a high-strung person, so when I was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe GAD, it was a surprise to absolutely no one. My mom, true to her word, was pretty supportive. She encouraged me to find a good therapist and to get on meds. She didn’t judge me for it. She took my anxiety seriously. 

Today I found out that my 16-year-old sister was diagnosed with depression around the same time as my anxiety diagnosis. I was very surprised to learn this. My family is usually pretty open about mental health stuff, so I wondered how this had never come up until now. And I know this is a common theme with depression, but like... you’d never guess. She seems like one of the happiest individuals on the planet. She’s funny and sweet and has tons of friends. Anyway, she said the reason it’s never come up is because my mom hasn’t responded to it in the same way that she’s responded to my anxiety. My sister isn’t getting any sort of treatment right now, and my mom just doesn’t really think it’s a big deal.

Clearly, my mom has some sort of double standard. Maybe she takes me more seriously because my issues are more obvious (I behave like a stereotypical anxious person, my sister hides her emotions well). Maybe it’s because my mom can relate better to my disorder because of her own experiences with anxiety. Maybe it’s because depression is more common and “it seems like everyone has it these days”. 

Whatever the reason though, I’m angry, and I’m worried for my sister. I am an adult; my sister is not. My mom has an obligation to help my sister, and no such obligation to help me, yet her actions would make it seem as though it’s the other way around. Right now my sister has no issues with self-harm, substance abuse, or anything else like that, and I don’t want it to have to come to that for my mom to realize this is real. And I’m just so shaken to find out that my mom isn’t really who I thought she was."
641,Psychiatrist Quit on Me,"Hello! 

I'm really upset and need someone to talk to or help me out. I'm 22 and after 12 years of mental health issues I finally decided to get some help and I finally found a Psychiatrist that takes my insurance and was accepting new patients during COVID. I've been diagnosed with ADD, severe anxiety, and bipolar Disorder, and JUST started taking medication.

When I went to get my prescription filled I found out my psych didn't send authorization to my insurance company and I had to pay $60 or wait a week and hope he calls them and explains the medical necessity for it. Apparently he has to do it every month I want to have prescriptions filled. I emailed him about it, I paid the $60 (that I really didn't have) and thought it was going to be fine. He just sent me an email saying: 

""I have been practicing for many years, with many insurance companies, and have never had a situation where there is a requirement to seek specific authorization each month for the medication.  This is a time-consuming process (it often takes 1-2 hours) and if your insurance, in your case, requires this on my part, I am afraid that I will not be able to do this and continue to treat you."" 

And I'm really upset because so many people give up on me and this is just another straw on the camels back. Anyone else's psych do this or can y'all at least help me out?"
642,I just had my first full on Panic attack in years.,"I have never posted anything about my mental health online. Never spoken to anyone that wasn't a professional or a sibling or partner. I'm 26, just bought a house of my own, in a stable relationship and have had been in remission (if that's the right word) from my BPD/ depression/ anxiety for 3 years. 

You know what caused this panic attack that brought me to the brink of passing out???? An email from my boss asking if I could come in a little early on Monday so we could chat about a few things? Instantly I got anxious and sent her a text asking if she could tell me what it was about because otherwise I'd freak out. She casually responded with not to freak out or anything it's just a chat. I then pushed it more and she basically got annoyed with me pushing so I apologized. I think I know what it's about and it seriously isn't that big of a deal (had a conversation with a co worker that probably wasn't workplace appropriate and was on my phone a bit too much) which in Australia or my workplace is not a fireable offence and I won't even get a formal warning. Just a heads up saying I should probably present myself better. No biggy right? 

Wrong.

I could feel it building. Everything just exploded. The tears and the emotions that feel like it's so tight in your skull that your anxiety driven brain feels like it's literally about to burst out your ear drums and spray onto the walls. I was home alone and knew I had to stop but I couldn't. I sent 8 messages in succession to my partner but due to his recent promotion he can't be on his phone. I resorted to calling my mother who is the main cause of my BPD and not someone who I see as a caring or sympathetic soul. I just knew she would answer and keep talking until I felt my hands and feet again.

I don't know why I'm even writing on here. I've made like 3 Reddit posts in the past. I just feel like I'm carrying these secrets with me. All this #metoo stuff I keep seeing on twitter is making a flood of bad emotions slowly rise. I was raped by my ex and I had dealt with that until a close friend and his buddy drugged my drink and took me home with them... Just after I had started dating the man of my dreams. I never fully dealt with it. I pretended it didn't happen at first and even fucking tried to force myself to still be friends with him. I told my partner, well, it all exploded out when I experienced the same  not-in-control feeling I had that night while doing weed for the first time. I couldn't handle it and the second my boyfriend touched me I screamed it all out. After that I blocked the ""friend"" and all our mutuals so he wouldn't appear in my newsfeed, stopped going to the places he worked and prayed I'd never encounter him again (have seen him once in a shopping centre and when he walked passed I almost vomited) 

I think about the assault once a week, maybe if I'm lucky once every two weeks. Nothing overpowering just a little niggle in the back of my head. 

All this stuff I've seen lately has made it fester inside me like a disease. It spread inside me like a fucking cancer until...

Until my boss asked me to have a chat and I have a panic attack. Why? Because im scared I'll get in trouble? Yes that probably accounts for 10 drops of emotion that just made my bucket of anxiety spill out onto my loungeroom floor. Every little drop of emotion when looked at as it's dripping seems like nothing. Until you collect it all in a bucket without letting anyone help you empty it or even see how much is in there. Then, before you know it. All these little drips you have been keeping to yourself almost drowns you in your own living room.

Point to this? I don't even fucking know.... I just need to empty my bucket a little. Hopefully this takes a cup or two"
643,Diagnosis,"I started my journey of mental health about a year ago and things have been going pretty well. Through many sessions with numerous therapists and psychiatrists many of my doctors have suggested PTSD. I never felt like my trauma was enough to constitute PTSD. It just seems so extreme. Well finally my therapist and I sat down and went through the symptoms. We didn't even finish the questionnaire in our session and she felt pretty confident diagnosing me with PTSD. I don't know how to feel about it because on one hand it makes sense, but I also wonder if somehow I'm faking my mental illness for attention. Is it possible to feel impostor syndrome with mental health?"

645,How do you deal with losing both your kittens in 1 week?,"I adopted two baby kittens, and I’ve only had them for one week when the first one got extremely ill and died, the second followed two days later. There was nothing I or the vet I took them to could’ve done. I know I only had them for a short time, but the way it hurts feels like I’ve had them for longer and I don’t know why... Like I can really feel the void they left behind. It’s especially ironic because the decision to adopt them was basically for them to help me cope with depression and anxiety, and now I feel terrible. Anyway so it’s just really painful and I don’t know how to deal with it in any way, any time I try to distract myself with anything like books or movies or talking to someone I can’t get their little faces out of my mind at all.. Any suggestions on how you deal with such a loss?"
646,I honestly dont realise what my situation is,"So my dad has been a stereotypical indian dad since forever. Has never acknowledged any of my accomplishments ever, and contradicts me at every point even though he knows I'm right. But at the same time, he's letting a 25 y/o me stay home while I continue with my studies. 
Moving on to my mom,
I feel comfortable talking to her, I do share a lot of things with her, but somehow whenever I get into an argument with dad or sis, she's never on my side and reveals all the things I've said to her. In recent times, because of the way she has reacted to certain things I've said, I feel that she's changed. She no longer wants to listen to my stuff.
My sister, younger than me, I kinda always feel scared to talk to her, she's a little bit rude but i think its the workload that makes her so.
And then my own situation, unemployed but appearing certain exams to rectify the situation (99% will be employed in the next month or so)
I feel extremely embarrassed and ashamed of my employment situation
I want to say a lot more things but I dont know where to begin with them. 
Can anyone just point out stuff that I can do to make things easier?
It just feels like everything is getting worse every day. I am in an argument with someone every other day
Am I just an asshole or do I need help?"
647,The escapist fantasies I have are destroying my self-esteem.,"So I believe I may possess some degree of maladaptive daydreaming, for everyday I will walk around for hours on end to live my escapist fantasies, in which I am my ideal self. As you are aware, I am not my ideal self, and now that reality is just bombarding me with relentless slaps in the face I am realising that my physical appearance is nothing like what I dream of. But I wish it was. This 'ideal appearance' always changes, however, for sometimes I see someone I think is pretty and pretend it's me. This basically means that anything can serve as stimuli for my daydreams. Now, when I walk around, I often catch sight of my appearance in the mirror. I marvel, I gawk, I fuss, I obsess, and I wonder how a person can look so terrible?! I've got the ugliest, hugest nose that widens and turns into an arrow when I smile, eyes that are so light that their contrast with my ugly tan skin makes them look like a demon's. Not to mention that they are so close together and it looks horrible. My spots may not be too bad, but I've got the ugliest body ever. Not skinny enough to be considered desirably slender, not fat enough to be considered desirably curvy. My face is also asymmetrical and looks horrible in every selfie/ photo taken of me (that's why I take none). My hair always looks ugly and the way it frames my face makes me look worse. I need to stop comparing myself to everybody else, but my perfectionist mentality won't let me. It tells me I need to lose weight (it's right), but I can't find the motivation to. I sometimes even think of blocking my reflection out so I don't have to look at it anymore, because every time I do, I panic and cry."

652,"I desperately need help,but I don’t know how to get it","Hi,

I (21F) am a longtime reddit lurker and have finally made an account because I don’t know how to go on.
I’ve had issues with my mental health for as long as I can remember, but it got considerably worse when I was about 13.I started self harming,was dealing with an eating disorder and plunged into a deep depression that I don’t think I’ve come out of.I can’t point out one year,or even a moment where I might’ve done better since then.I was able to endure it for a long time but I finally feel like I have no way to go on and that scares me.
I’ve ghosted all of my friends and almost all of my family.I don’t know why,I don’t want to isolate myself to this point but I can’t control it.
I’ve recently come back from a year abroad and am now living with my mother and her boyfriend whom I’ve never met before.I lost both of my jobs and had to cut my trip short because of COVID.Going back home,especially moving back in with my mother,was devastating.I felt like I had made a lot of progress and had started to built a life for myself away from everything.
My relationship with my parents is very strained because of the way they treated me when I was younger up until now.I won’t go into detail,but I’ll say that I was never physically abused.I love them,but they are not understanding at all and don’t offer me support.
At 18,I was living on my own in our family home because everyone else moved out (long story) and finally talked to my parents about my issues.I was told to see my PCP about it,who then gave me a referral to a psychologist.All that was needed to do was to make a phone call and get an appointment.Because that day was very exhausting for me and I have problems with phone calls,I asked my mom to please make the appointment.When I asked about it later,she said that they only had appointments a few months down the road and that I would have to talk to my dad about it anyway because he would have to drive me there(at this point my parents were separated).I didn’t think much of it then,or maybe I just didn’t want to, but it turned out she never made the appointment.And my dad (whom I talked to first and who was the one who suggested seeing my PCP) never even asked what came of it.That was such a punch in the gut,you won’t believe it.Since then I’ve never dared to ask for help or support,never even brought up anything remotely close to my mental health ever again.

I feel like I’m at my breaking point now.I’m dependent on my parents again,I need their help but I’m so scared of trusting them.I could go out and just do it all by myself but unfortunately I don’t think I’m well enough to do that.

My friend told me that they drank out of a bottle from under their bathroom sink. They believe that it might have been this (shown in the images below). I'm not sure what might happen to them, or if they will be fine. So far, their symptoms are a sore throat (burning) and it feeling ""clogged"" when they try to swallow. They have been drinking water since this occurred.

Please, if you know anything about this, feel free to chat me. I could use the help.

654,My Hallucinations- A story,[removed]
655,"When it comes to psychs, is the concept of good/bad matches bullshit? Any advice on how to recognize specific approaches and respond accordingly?","I've been through 8 different psychologists/psychiatrists (shortened to ""psychs"" here). I moved on whenever I was sure they were a ""bad match"". The primary issues were laziness/apathy/empty promises, condescending attitudes, specialization mismatch, sadistic dehumanization (of me), and extreme forgetfulness (every session was fucking Groundhog Day).

I've honestly tolerated each one to the best of my ability. The flaws in their approach and demeanor eventually grate on me, and I grow to resent them.  
IDK, could this be a personal problem?  All I want's for someone to be somewhat familiar with me &amp; my struggles, be there for me to talk to about taboo shit, and maybe give me some advice about specific symptoms. So... general competency and openness!

Now, obviously I'm not ever expecting to find a psych straight out of a film. Almost certain that my expectations are not the issue here.  
But maybe all of my ideas revolving around therapy itself are skewed. Am I not supposed to like them, nor the process itself?

Admittedly, some of this discordance is likely my fault, as I have never expressed my frustrations to any of them. I just assumed that they have their own scripts to follow and would figure out how to best deal with me.  
Making direct demands or even suggestions seems taboo. Is there a way to recognize a psych's approach? Such as, what exactly they might aim to do (if anything lol). It'd help immensely if I felt something was happening. Well, assuming that psychs who do ""talk therapy"" mostly follow something that's formulaic at its core.

I haven't slept in 3 days so please excuse clumsy format."
656,"Hey, I want to tell you something.","I know bad things happened and the future seems dark, but today, this moment you are here, you are taking this breath while reading this, and that is a good thing. You are alive.

657,Drinking and depression,"Drinking is the only thing I’ve found that takes me out of my own mind. It’s the only thing that makes me feel ok and quiets the voices in my head that tell me I’m worthless and useless and a loser. When I get drunk, that voice goes away, and then another voice comes into my head which is confident, cocky even. But I don’t act cocky. It just is a nice reprieve from the chaos of every day life in my mind. When I’m sober, I’m constantly battling the voices in my head. I have full blown arguments with myself on a regular basis. I find that time slips away from me and I can’t focus. I’ve taken antidepressants, and they haven’t had much of an effect until lately, but I stopped taking those during COVID for no particular reason. There is more to say about that, but I don’t want to bore people. I’ve seen therapists, none of whom I felt provided a sense of understanding or insight that helped me. It felt like they had canned responses to whatever issue I brought up. If I tried to explain further, it felt like they saw that as me rationalizing my own behavior, but all I was trying to do was to lay everything on the table so they would understand better and be better equipped to help me. I’m drunk now. I don’t have work tomorrow. I like how I feel now. I don’t like how I feel most of the time. I have, in the past, gone a year without drinking. I went to rehab at 20, and didn’t drink for a year after. I have never abused drugs. I’ve smoked weed about 10 times in my entire life, and never liked it, and I’ve done nothing else except drink and smoke cigarettes. This is not the life path I want to be on, but I don’t see an off ramp. Does anyone relate to this? Do you have any insight or advice? Obviously there is a lot more I could say, like how I felt completely demoralized by my college experience, and how I used to blame my parents for it, but now realize I share much of the blame (without negating the environmental role they played). And more. I’m rambling. All thoughts are welcome. Please don’t tell me to kill myself. I’ve had those thoughts too, but would never act on them. I wouldn’t act on them if you told me to; I’d just think you’re an asshole."

662,Lockdown struggles,"So just as background, ah... the source of a lot of my mental ill health is a narcissistic upbringing, and i know many are cooped up at home with their abusive families right now and my heart seriously goes out to you guys... I can only imagine what kind of fresh hell that is!  


I am fortunate enough to have moved out from home however - I currently am at university. But because of many factors (inc. social anxiety and by university being really terrible at running social events; I tried my best for the 2 years Ive been here and nothing I joined ran even before covid) I havent been able to meet any friends here. I have a friend group from school, but ofc can only talk to them online... and theyre lovely lovely people but theyre very introverted and all have good families, so no matter what I feel like Im chasing them for any kind of social thing as they dont tend to initiate, and often when I do they'll forget to come and Im left on my own.

I feel really bad because I feel like Im putting more on them than their anxious selves can feel comfy with, but at the same time... Im really envious of them being home with good families whilst Im profoundly isolated, and am kinda angry inside because I feel kinda neglected, and I keep telling myself ""oh theyre home with their families, they dont need you, leave them alone theyre perfectly happy""  
Idk this has just been a big ramble but can anyone relate? It's hell being alone with nothing but the pain of my own thoughts from my upbringing, but I also dunno if Im being a bit entitled in expecting too much from my group? Idk haha  
Anyone relate?"
663,Trapping obsession -- What is it a symptom of?,"Hi there,

This is something I've been struggling with all my life but it's finally starting to piss me off.   
I get SO OBSESSED with things. Hyper fixations I guess, but this week has been the tipping point.

I got really into a book, invested in it, and couldn't put it down - but not like when people say ""wow can't put this book down x"" I mean I felt trapped.

I couldn't eat, sleep, wash, work, talk to people, anything. Whenever my family or partner tried talking to me I just wished they would go away and felt unreasonably irritated (and I'm an extrovert, so it's not just me being isolating.) 

I felt so trapped in this book and obsessed to continue it. I finished it today (2 days after I started, a 700 page book) and am now feeling dissociated like I'm watching my real life as if it's a tv show.

I have diagnosed BPD, anxiety, depression, and OCD. I thought maybe this level of obsession completely trapping my mind went under OCD because of the obsession but it feels different. I don't think I need to do it or ""something bad will happen"", I just literally can't help it, my brain in't under my own control. 

Could anyone offer me advice? 

Thanks,

Jessie"

I pray every night i live another day. I dont have any friends so i cant talk to anyone about my anxiety. When my dad committed suicide I've gained 50 pounds and a drinking problem that gave birth to this. I also have night panic attacks a few times a week were I jolt up out of sleep feeling like my heart is about to explode grabbing my heart rate monitor. This has been going on for a year and 6 months. I have anxiety about  having an heart attack or stroke and it makes it worse. I've spent so much money to fix this like bath supplies and cbd items.. I've got supplements and stopped my drinking. when my arm feels weird I put icy hot on it to distract me from stroke possibilities... Idk the answers to my problem but please if someone knows how to fix me... please let me know. :/
670,What Do You think I have? (Parents won’t disclose information),"My parents are REALLY trying to hide some of my disorders, and until recently I found out I have ADHD, because I looked up my medications (Stratera), but there’s also something I take as well and I don’t understand why.

As a kid, I used to be really, “gullible”. I thought what everyone said to me, was to be mean, but in actuality, they weren’t. I would have meltdowns, run down the halls screaming during times where I was overwhelmed or stressed. I’m affected by some loud noises, and being yelled at and I cry because of it, but I never understood why. The Medication I take is Respiradone. Is it Autism, cause when I asked my parents they said I had “developmental disability disorder”. Are they telling me I’m autistic, or could it be something else?"

Last year I applied to a broad range of colleges, and got into none of the places I wanted to be at. Its only further added to my dejection.

Honestly, I feel like I can't relate to anyone in my age group on an emotional level. Sometimes I feel I might as well accept that I'm a failure.

The truth is I don't know my value anymore. I just genuinely want to be happy in life, I just want to go out for once and be able to feel I don't have a worry in the world.  I just want to be able to feel love, to hold someone's hand and feel its warmth, or walk about unafraid without thinking of all the fire hazards around me.

676,In need of new friends.,"Throughout the years, I (31/F) have been losing friendships because either: they’re shady, don’t give a fuck, fake, etc. All of my social media accounts have been deactivated as of lately, well except for Reddit (although I don’t count this as one). I am currently in nursing school, focusing on classes online. Kinda sucks dealing with it because of the pandemic, not having interaction meeting new schoolmates. This pandemic has been feeling down and my sanity just goes up, down, and around like a damn roller coaster. I’m currently staying with my boyfriend. He’s doing his best to understand my depression and help. The past few months, I feel like I’ve been attacked by classmates and couple other people whom I thought were “friends,” for NO REASON AT ALL. Nightmares don’t help either.

Just want to make new friends with women around my age, who can relate with mental health and empowering/motivating one another. I need a mental reset."
677,I'm beyond terrified of anyone knowing about what goes on inside my head.,"My mom was talking about how I should try to avoid dark videos since it can lead to mental health issues or suicidal thoughts. I wanted to scream because she told me this too late and I'm already long past that threshold. I also cried in my room blaming myself for slipping up a little on the facade that I was okay the other night. 
It's not like I've been metaphorically sucker punched for opening up about issues before, but for as long as I remember I've just kept everything negative I thought inside, the few times I told someone how I felt can be counted on one finger and all except for one incident have been with friends online under anonymity. 
So yeah, vulnerability scares me. I want to yell about all my feelings to someone because I know one day this will all blow up in my face but nothing comes out of my mouth. I don't want to be more of a burden to anyone than I already am, I don't want anyone to deal with my problems because this is my mess that I myself made and no one should have to deal with that. My dad thanks me for growing up healthy and strong, and I always feel guilty about it because I'm not strong at all.
It's messed up, but sometimes I wished they didn't care so much about me, because they'll be better of not having had me at all. I don't know if I really mean it, but I think about how many people pray for parents who care, and if I could trade places with any of them I would because they deserve it. 
On one hand, I want to talk about this to someone, maybe a counsellor or my parents, and I want to know how I can do that. On the other hand, the thought of opening up to someone literally makes me cry. I don't understand myself at all."
678,Some light at the end of the tunnel,"I'm writing this post to express how I felt today. This sort of stuff should go into a journal, but I'm writing it here, because if someone who feels as hopeless as I do can see some positivity, you too will see it someday. Having said that, if this sort of post is not welcome here, I can understand.

I've had depression and anxiety that was left untreated for a very long time. I only started taking medication for it a week ago. It is bad. There is so much self-loathing and I hate talking to my fucking mind. Motherfucker won't shut up about the negativity of everything and my brain just decides to listen to it. I know they're the same thing, but you can imagine what I'm saying.

I only started taking medication because my doctor said the earliest appointment I could get with a psychologist is a month away. 

I also have mild insomnia which in turns leads to exacerbated anxiety and depression. Going through the night without any sleep is torture because I'm not rested and I also have to spend 6-8 hours of listening to my mind spew bullshit again.

Today, something different happened. I never really had a ear for music, despite having learned to play some instruments. I don't listen to music at the gym, when running, or even when I'm on a long bus journey. I just couldn't get into it.

For some reason, I decided to check out what Donald Glover has been creating because I loved his work as a comedian. The song that I picked was Redbone. 

Something happened. 6.30AM in the morning, the sun is not completely out yet, and I'm sipping some tea with my feet stretched out on the window enjoying the cold morning breeze while listening to this song. There is no background noise. No vehicles, no people moving about. Just me in this world, with this song. I just stared at a street sign, while listening to this song and I remembered how happiness felt again for the shortest flash of time. 

I remembered what it felt like to not be a depressed fuck. Into the emptiness of the street in front of me, I flashed an involuntary and genuine smile in reaction to the song and the conditions. I haven't had a genuine positive reaction in a very long time. 

And that is the new moment I am going to hold on to. If I can feel this way for a second, maybe not all is lost. I want to chase this feeling, and I want to make it last because now I remember how it feels. 

I know this can come across to some of you as ""Go take a walk in the woods, or go for a run! It'll cure your depression!"". I promise you, it's not about that. It's about paying attention to the tiniest glimmer of positivity in your life, even if it is a loose end of a thread, because today I feel like it is worth hanging on to that thread. 

Thank you for reading."
679,what do you do when your college degree isn’t what you think you should do anymore?,"I graduated with a film degree from a not so great school 2 years ago. I thought filmmaking was what I wanted to do, but it’s just been so hard for extreme reasons out of my control. 

I don’t have ANY friends, any job, and due to the pandemic I’m at home living with my parents. I’ve also been diagnosed with BPD so that’s made sense why everything has been harder for me. 

The film industry is hard to break into unless you form good connections in college, or have family working in it. My college connections are non existent due to unique reasons.

I’m Insanely depressed and don’t know how to turn my life around. I feel like I don’t even know what type of job (besides retail + barista/service) I can get with my degree and not having any other skill/not knowing what to do next. I don’t think I can put myself through another course due to money and not having an interest strong enough to do it. Also fear that I will waste money and time on another course, while I age, to only end up unemployed and overlooked once more. 

When I was younger I used to feel like I was destined for greatness in a creative field, but I don’t feel like that at all anymore. I do believe I have talent, but that’s irrelevant in an industry where others need to see the potential in you. Where do I go from here? I’m so scared and depressed. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life and I feel like a complete loser."
680,father is emotionally abusing me over insomnia,"i would not be making this post unless i genuinely had nowhere else to go with this. i don’t have a therapist because i cant afford one, my experiences with suicide hotlines have been terrible and usually result in me feeling worse, i have no friends, my family is emotionally abusive (not based on this issue alone, but based on other behaviour). that's why i'm on reddit right now.

I have lists and lists of mental health problems, have had severe debilitating depression since i was 13, have had other issues since i can remember. i'm 22 now. one problem that i've struggled with, apparently since infancy according to my mother, is insomnia. i either don't sleep at all or sleep completely nocturnally. as i hit puberty the symptoms of it got worse and i became essentially permanently nocturnal. 

at this time i lived with my mother and she didn't bother me about it but she got sick a few years ago and i had to move in with my father who was extremely unaccepting of it. he seems to think i don't actually have insomnia and that i'm merely lazy and that all i need is to be forced to wake up early every day and thus my insomnia and nocturnal circadian rhythm will right itself. 

he thinks my refusal to do this is me ""not helping myself"" and that i need ""a good kicking up the backside"" to stop being so lazy and spoilt. this is very painful to hear as my struggles with sleep and insomnia have been agonising for me to go through and the self hatred and punishment he has inspired in me over it is frightening for someone who already has terrible mental health.

the thing is i've attempted to force myself to get up early multiple times before. i've gone a week waking myself up at 10am with about 1-3 hours of sleep each 24hrs before i hit a total mental breakdown and tried to kill myself. i cut myself really deeply and ended up going to the hospital, they kept me for a few days before letting me go. i felt like i was in so much pain physically and mentally over not being able to sleep and like i was cognitively going insane that i got to that state. my dad doesn't take my risk of self harm seriously. 

i believe my reaction was so extreme because of my other mental health problems like depression. since then i ditched the attempt to force myself to wake up early. other things i've attempted is staying up a whole 24 hours and then choosing to go to sleep at a normal time, i succeeded at this once and managed to get up at a normal time during the day for about a month before it slowly inched later and later until i was nocturnal all over again. i've been prescribed temazepam before and it didn't get me to sleep, just made me feel even more tired. since it's addictive i was only given a small dosage. 

however since moving in with my dad he is adamant that i must be woken up earlier and earlier each day. every time he's brought it up he yells at me while i beg him to not wake me up early. 

right now im nocturnal, i get up at 4pm and fall asleep at 7am in the morning. i hate being nocturnal and i cry at night while i try to force myself to fall asleep and fail, knowing my dad will scream at me the next day for it. nothing i do has ever solved my insomnia or circadian rhythm. 

sometimes if i stop trying so hard to sleep at the right time and just let it run it's course it begins to shift naturally to me falling asleep at 4am and getting up at 2pm. in the past i've had time periods where i was able to get up at noon but i've struggled to get to this point for years. 

how do i get him to understand that him forcing me to wake up early isn't going to help me and that i'm terrified i will self harm again if he keeps doing it?"
681,Coping with one’s own health,"Lately I’ve found myself in a little bit of a bad spot.

I recently started taking medication, Sertraline, for those wondering, and at first it felt as if it was working wonders, everything was going well. But over the past few days things have spiralled out of control, leading to more emotional outbursts and its one of the worst feelings I’ve experienced. The helpless feeling of knowing that even with medication the problems are still present. 

The main issues seem to have been eased somewhat, but are still present - more prevalently found myself questioning reality as of late. The world, and myself, my own perception feels surreal. I can’t exactly self diagnose but I did some looking around and found Depersonalization/Derealization seemed to share a lot of similar traits to what I was feeling - or perhaps a hyper-awareness of one’s own existence. It’s honestly a hard feeling to try and describe.

There’s too much on my mind to really share here, and I’m aware that I should see a professional. I’m working on that for as soon as possible, but obviously, there is no easy fix, and that sort of thing would take a while. 


I suppose what I’m looking for is short term solutions, in the vein of coping, or learning to cope with possible issues until it’s dealt with professionally.

It's put me on a long waiting list and I'm seriously struggling. Is there a service (without a waiting list) where I could pay (I can't afford much but if it's good I'm willing to pay up to £50/hour - I'm unemployed and a student) to see a psychologist?

I've had CBT in the past so it would be helpful to do it again. I've had talking therapy before, and it never helped even though I did it for years. However I'm in such a difficult place right now and need support immediately. 

Please don't suggest Samaritans or those hotlines - I've tried them before and they can't really help. I don't want to be heard and have someone agree with all I say, I need genuine therapy. I'm in despair."
684,"Depression, the battle which lasts a lifetime.","You had a bad day and you think to yourself that tomorrow will be better. This feeling will be your everyday life from now on. As time goes on your mind is slowly making you lose the control of your life. You bare your teeth as your life is slowly getting worse day by day and no matter what you do, you can't reveal your bad Feeling to others. Your thoughts and actions are slowly becoming self-centered, because the feeling that's growing inside you has taken control of your life. You are still not aware of your situation, because you're always thinking of how to hide your feeling from others. Every event where you come in contact with others, you feel like you do not belong there, you are the problem. Every event making the feeling inside you grow stronger.

This is the point when you start distancing yourself from society. Not by choice, but more of a subconscious decision. You start feeling like you're the problem in your circle of people and by distancing yourself from them you're free of the thoughts that everything is against you. This goes on until you've become so distant from others that you're on your own with your thoughts all day long. The feeling consuming you completely, at least that's what it feels like, but you're only in the beginning of this trial. You are so consumed by the feeling inside you that you just can't take it anymore and you start seeking mental healthcare. This is the moment when you start realizing that this is not something you can face alone. Maybe this is depression?

During your mental healthcare you come across something amazing. You start to learn about yourself, what is the reason for everything that has happened in your life. You start learning of these events of the past that has defined everything in you. You are now becoming conscious of who you are, but the problem is that you can't change your past. No matter what, the past will always define the way you are in the future. You can change and overcome the depression, but what for? That is what everyone always says about depression, you just need to stop being depressed. You can't seem to find anything worth living and you just don't want to belong to this world anymore. From now on you struggle everyday with these thoughts in your head, when will it get better. You thought you hit the bottom multiple times during your depression, but the bottom can never be reached. It always surprises you how strong the feeling of depression inside you can get. When will this all end?

Would something in the story change if someone had asked him at the beginning stage, are you actually ok?"

She walks over the railing stand near the hole, put center of her body weight forward above the hole to see what's fucking inside again and again on and on. I talked to her for hours every time I caught her doing that, but she just won't listen, 'I will be careful nothing would happen.' Then hang out around the holes tomorrow!

I am feeling companionship would be a very helpful thing right about now. All of my friends live in different counties. They're not right around the corner. And COVID obviously hasn't helped out either.

I was just letting my mind wander for a bit and it got me to asking the million dollar question. What is my purpose? What is my life purpose? Don't worry, I have no rash thoughts going through my head. But my common theme thought popped up again: ""we're all really only here to procreate, pass on, and that's it."" It's obviously a depressing thought.

Sometimes I forget to take my daily meds. It happens maybe once in two-three weeks. Everytime after that I oversleep and have dreams about stuff that I know am inhibiting (partly intentionally) or about just weirdly tiring mix of memories. Then, after waking up, I can't stop thinking about my dreams, and if they were showing my inhibited thoughts, then I would start wondering what could happen if I let them drive my actions (okay, that's actually pretty hard to explain). It's not based on any obsessive behavior, at least I don't feel like it could be, but the thoughts are bugging my mind. Eventually this stuff leads me to the point where I feel exhausted and in pieces. Sometimes I even try to start arguments with  people like I was subconsciously trying to reach the state of things from my dreams or aggresively help myself out of the spiral of guilt I would develop in the meantime. Sometimes I can't come back to my normal state of mind even after a few days on the meds. 

It is really disrupting to me and I don't even know how to look this thing up. Maybe someone has experienced similar side effect and knows the name of it or if it's a common thing? I feel the need to understand it better so maybe I could help myself in some way."

697,Need advice - my little brother,"Hey Guys,

So this is the thing: 

My little brother is almost 30 years old. Basically his only content in life is playing video games. Maybe he leaves the house 1-2 times per year except for working of course. 

He never met his father and our mother was one of these mothers doing everything for him. He lived with her until she died 4 years ago. Now I live with him. He wanted food? Mom was doing it. Cleaning and laundry? Mom was doing it. One time I saw him coming home when I was at her place and he went fully bersek when the food was not ready. He said that he send her a message 30min ago that she can now start cooking. She just apologized and was not happy When I got involved. 

I have had my hard times to explain to him that we share any work in the apartment but even after 4 years he is unable to clean. It seems like all activities that do not include being online and playing games are almost impossible for him. He performed bad at work and wonders why. He is about 150kg on 180cm and tries to loose weight. You can imagine how this works. Lunch is like pizza or pasta. Lasagne is like 1Kg at once and cleaning after that is not possible „because I had so much food and need to rest now...“

At some point I need to step in and clean. He knows that but I would turn crazy living in such a mess. 

Any friends or even a girl? Never in his life so far. 

I moved in to support him financially when our mom died but now As he has a job I am about to move out soon. 

Does anyone of you has any advise how to influence him into a better direction? I tried all I can but obviously it is not enough."
698,I finally got the courage to seek help. What should I look for?,"Bit of backstory: I (16) have struggled with my mental health for the last 4 years a lot. Confusion about my gender plays a big part in it, but I’m pretty sure I’m also just depressed. A few months ago I opened up to my parents about some of it, but then Corona came. Now things are going better, I went to my GP (or something like that) this morning, who recommended I see a psychologist for my issues. 

The question: what are things I need to consider/think about/look for while looking for a psychologist? Any other tips for my start to a better mental health?

Thank you."
699,"Depression from abuse, failure, and now a bereavement. When does the pain end?","It’s like every time one bad thing happens to me, 5 more need to happen. 

I’ve been severely depressed with crippling anxiety for about 8 months now, since getting out of an abusive relationship. 

Then I got diagnosed with ADHD 6 months ago and I’ve been cycling through meds. Long story short I failed my uni this year, and had to apply for mitigating circumstances as I couldn’t do any of the work (the circumstances being my depression/anxiety/ADHD). 

It’s been 10x worse since 2020 started. Then lockdown happened so I have no reason to leave my house. Further fuelling my depression. 

To make matters worse my grandma got severely ill abroad and nearly died, and needed a triple heart bypass. I’m 19, and my parents flew out to help her. Obviously because of covid, they got stranded there. My dad has been there for half a year and my mum was there for 2 months, till April. Living alone in the house without my parents support, with my older brother, whilst dealing with depression and PTSD from my abusive relationship was the toughest thing ever. 

My brother didn’t do anything for the two months. I was cooking every single day and trying to save my uni work. I was exhausted and tired of life and questioned my existence/living. 

I got into a new relationship but with someone I trust with my entire life. He’s been my closest friend for 3 years now, so we know we’re in this for good. However my mum suddenly flipped after seeing what happened with my abusive ex. So she said she didn’t condone it. (She’s also very religious/strict and conservative). She ignored me for a week straight before she went abroad for 2 months. It was the most painful thing as I was still so depressed and she was my main support system, we’ve always been close as sisters, so her ignoring me for a week was a big deal. 

I overdosed on my ADHD meds and cried to her face and said I love her and she just got up and walked out on me without a word. I felt so alone. 

Since coming back from abroad she’s realised her mistakes and we’ve repaired our relationship back to how it was. 

My dad is still stranded abroad with my grandad. My relationship is going well and that’s the one good thing in my life rn. 

Then about 3 weeks ago my best friend of 5 years moved across the country. I feel so alone without her. I used to see her every day at uni, and every day through high school. I miss her so much, she feels so far away. She moved right when my depression had a really bad episode. I literally just laughed, because I didn’t think things could get worse, and then she suddenly moved across country within a week. 

Then it happened. On the 29th June 2020 I lost my closest aunty to a long and painful battle against cancer. I’m crying just writing this. She was my mums closest friend for 25 years. She was like a second mother to me, I’d go to her for everything. She was closer to mum than her own blood sisters and my mum was closer to her than any of her family. 
I saw her die in the hospice. We al had to wear masks and couldn’t comfort her children or her elderly parents or hug them. I saw her lying there. I kissed her through my mask and stroked her face. She was so cold. I miss her so much. 

I can’t imagine how her children feel. Her youngest is only 18, and he said that all he’s ever known is her having cancer and being in hospital. He also doesn’t have a good relationship with his dad and isn’t close with his siblings, so I’m worried for him and he must feel so alone. My aunty was diagnosed when he was just starting high school. Her other son was about to get married next month. She was so so excited, she adored his fiancé. And now she won’t be there to witness her own child’s wedding. And then her eldest just had a baby weeks before her death. She only got to see her newborn grandson once due to covid. And only for 10 minutes as she was in and out of consciousness from pain and medication. 

Her poor elderly parents are in shock. They keep questioning “why did our child go so young, it was meant to be us. It should’ve been us that went first”. I can’t imagine how it must feel for them, it’s so unnatural losing your child at that age. She was only 55. 

I also hate thinking about the pain she was in. She also faced a lot of injustice and difficult periods in her life. She had it tough but she was one of the most radiant, warm souls I’ve ever met. 

I’m planning on getting married this/next year, as I know that this man, my best friend for so many years, is the one for me and it’s been staring me in the face all these years and we never saw it. He’s been so supportive through my depression.  We want a very small wedding. My aunty, God bless her soul, was the first person I told my mum I want to be there, sitting front row. Idk how I’ll get through the wedding without completely breaking down, not seeing her there. Every time I’ve pictured it, she’s been there. 

We couldn’t even go to her funeral due to covid. Only 10 people allowed. So we visited after and did some prayers. It was tough. 

Tried therapy but there’s only 4 sessions on the NHS so it did absolutely nothing. 

I’ve been on and off antidepressants and they did nothing so I’m off them now again. I just needed to vent about the train wreck that’s been my life. I’ve also lost a lot of very close friends on top of all this over the last few years, who betrayed me in different ways. I’m tired of losing people. 

TL;DR: I’m tired of life."

but i’m currently having a pretty hard time eating. in the past week i’ve only been able to keep down three meals + one dessert. i have a concussion, and i was also on my period when the nausea started (only vomited twice) so i’m not concerned about it being anything too serious quite yet. but i’m also experiencing a complete lack of motivation the past few days. i feel as if the world is ending soon so there’s no point to try and be a better person. i feel like i’ve put out a lot of evil into the world and i cant shake the feeling i’m more harm than good. i also can’t seem to feel connected to any of my friends. one specifically made the comment of “why am i having to find things for us to talk about? you’re not really talking or reacting” and id just been thinking about the end of the world and how hot the chicken wing i ate was. i’m unable to sleep, even though i have been keeping my phone outside my room so that i don’t stay up. it’s been taking 2 or 3 hours to get to sleep, then i have nightmares about losing people i love, or the end of the world. my mind feels foggy, i have messed up simple things at work, even though i’m a manager and have worked there for a year and a half. 

but the thing is none of this feels like depression i’ve had before. i have no reason. and this came on very suddenly about a week ago. i cant tell you how many times i’ve cried this past week not really understanding why. i’m not sure what’s going on. i see a therapist and my mental health is typically pretty well managed. i know how to talk myself down and how to treat myself. i’m pretty self aware. but i’m freaked out that i don’t understand what’s going on right now."

706,"My friend doesn't want to burden me with her problems, but I want to help.","My friend (friend A) recently opened up to me and a friend (friend B) about an issue she experienced with her family, when we were talking in a group chat. Maybe it was because of the awkward nature of texting communication, but friend B and I were unsure how to respond and it took us a while to say something. Because of this, friend A responded that she didn't think she should have opened up about her problems in the first place, and then she doesn't want us to have to deal with her problems. 

This really sucks because me and friend B really want to help and hope she gives us the opportunity to do so (or at least try?). However, I'm kinda worried because I don't want to open up again only for us to not know what to say yet again, which may only make her more hesitant to open up in the future. Maybe texting just sucks for this type of communication and maybe we would have more luck speaking over a video chat. I suggested that we talk over voice chat but there's been no answer and I imagine she's avoiding going on the group chat maybe to avoid a conversation that from her perspective probably makes things awkward and uncomfortable (but maybe I'm reading too much into it?). 

I'm kinda unsure what to do. I want to talk to her in video form, but I want to know what to say. Any advice?"
707,My best friend may be in a psych hold and I’m conflicted about whether I should contact his family,"I’m in a very precarious position here 

My best friend, who I was living with, recently has been making some poor decisions that have placed both of our safety at risk.  This is someone I am very close to for many many years - we have met each other’s families, that’s sort of thing 

One incident in particular was so serious, that it caused me to move out in the middle of the night.   Some more events occurred after I moved out - I was contacted by police (I was in his emergency contacts) because he was drugged at a restaurant, and was found unable to speak.  After this incident, I got back in touch with him to check on him and he was crying asking me to come over since he was scared and alone.  He said some suicidal things and I kept pleading with him to talk to a counselor.  He was trying to tell me he didn’t want to do that, he is too afraid of being “committed.”  I told him it’s only 3 days, you’ll be okay if you do this

He texted me saying he called reporting suicidal thoughts, and he is an ambulance being taken to the hospital.  I told him I’m sorry for everything that’s happened (we had a lot of conflict this week which led to this).  and he asked me if he should call his parents, who live in another state.  I said YES absolutely, they would want to know this 

I have not heard from him since, so I think this means he is in a 72 hour hold and they took his cell phone.  

I have been debating very hard about texting his mother.  A while back, his mother gave me her phone number for emergencies.  I’ve never called or texted her.  I don’t even know if he contacted her or  if I should contact her, what do I say, etc."

714,Am I depressed? I think I need help.,"If you have the time to read through the whole thing I would appreciate it very much, thank you. But here is the tl;dr: I have 0 energy and I am loosing faith in myself. Idk why but it could be because I feel overwhelmed due to the stuff I put on myself. If that is the case though I can basically give up on my dream because getting to that would be even harder. **I really need help because I have no clue what I should even do. I just want to sleep and never wake up again.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 17 years old (M) and for a few weeks now I am totally hopeless. I lost all the fun in my life. I used to have a lot of hobbies and interests but in recent weeks I am just lying on my bed with no energy. Suicidal thoughts have become  the only content of my life and I have also not eaten anything in 2 days - I lost my appetite and can barely motivate me to drink some water here and there. 

My problem is that I don't really understand why I am feeling so badly.  Until recently I was super happy, always optimistic and basically checked every box in the ""happy life"" checklist (i know that something like that doesn't exist but you will get what I am saying.):

* I worked out 3 times a week 
* I had a healthy diet
* I was always drinking at least 3L (nearly 1 us gallon) of water a day
*  I am good at school and Work (It's time for me now to apply to university, I am easily good enough to get accepted by all the univercities in my area.) 
* I meditate everyday
* I journal everyday
* I take a walk for 1H/ day everyday (in addition to my workout)
* I have several Hobbies

Despite all that I'm just feeling super unmotivated in recent weeks. I broke it down to 3 things that **might** be the cause of my sadness but I am unsure about it and what I take from this is even more depressing:

\- Loneliness: I'm quite an introverted person so I have never been keen about meeting with other people or anything. I currently don't have any friends but I don't think that that is the problem. I am actually a fairly decent to be around I think. I got invited to a lot of parties before Covid-19 but I declined most of the time because I dislike company. 

I do value some nice discussion about topics I enjoy but because of my feelings in recent weeks I don't really enjoy anything so that isn't really a thing anymore either.

\-Overthinking: I'm overthinking way too much and I know that. I am simulating a lot of scenarios in my head all the time. In addition to that **every** solution I come up with I overthink every aspect of it and go down a spiral where I whine about how inaccurate and manipulative the human brain is. This really makes me feel horrible because it instatly puts me into this feeling of life sucks and there is no point in pursuing anything anyways.

It also makes me  think that every little thing is shit and even if it's just a conversation that I can't get around I lose all hope and sink into this feeling of absolute uselessness and worthlessness.

\-Overwhelmed: This sounds like the most realistic cause for my bad mood tbh. It's not because of school or anything but because of what I put on myself in my freetime ( I want to learn a lot of new stuff and if I can't accomplish what I set myself as a goal for that day I will hate myself when I go to bed). The problem I have with facing this truth is that It's not even that much or at least it's not much in comparison with what I have to deal with if I choose to chase the careerpath that I am aiming for eversince I am 12 years old. 

This really makes me think that I am useless because my dream (career) seems much more out of touch than ever before - it's becomming more and more of a dreamand less and less of a reality everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my parents about my feelings but my mom thinks it's just a lack of nutricion and my dad thinks it's because I am not partying every weekend like he did when he was 17.

715,What causes Sensory overload? Is it connected to anxiety? Is it high functioning autism?,"I’ve been experiencing sensory overload from things for a while but it has been worse recently being at home from college 

All my family members will be talking, the bright lights, clicking of the fan, and news on the tv give me such a sensory overload and makes me feel so overwhelmed 

They don’t understand it 

Autism runs in my family so I don’t know if I’m a high functioning austistic or if it is just my hyperactive anxiety"
716,Hope is paramount,"My life right now is a mess. I quit my job last year to be a writer. I have gotten nowhere since then, with the exception of a blog that hardly sees any visitors.

I'm dependent on my husband for money. My mom tells me I'm wasting my life.

But it's okay. You know why? Because I believe in myself. I will get there. I've taken the leap of faith. I will go on. And if I can do it, so can you!"
717,Taking time off work for mental health,"Hi, for years I have worked evenings (mainly 2-10pm, 1-9pm) and I was cool with this. But about five weeks ago my boss suddenly moved me to the graveyard shift full-time (8pm-4am). Our contracts state because we operate 24/7 that we should be flexible.

I have a son (aged 18 months) and my partner is now back to work starting 8am, finishing at 1pm (she is part-time in her job). She arranged this so she could be home by the time I usually started work. However now I find myself working extremely late and up at 7.30am with virtually little sleep to look after my son. I am now completely wiped out mentally, physically and emotionally. I have asked my boss to meet me half-way and alternate nights one week and my old pattern the next, but I was told no. I practically begged not to be put on this shift pattern but was again told no.

I am feeling great anxiety (which I have a history of) and it's affecting my relationship. It's also affecting how I care for my son as I don't feel alert when caring for him. I have never asked for time off work in 9 years with my company so if I explain this to my GP, will I get a fit note? I am at my wit's end as this can't go on long-term."

720,*Repost* My Psychiatrist Quit on Me,"Hello!

I'm really upset and need someone to talk to or help me out. I'm 22 and after 12 years of mental health issues I finally decided to get some help and I finally found a Psychiatrist that takes my insurance and was accepting new patients during COVID. I've been diagnosed with ADD, severe anxiety, and bipolar Disorder, and JUST started taking medication.

When I went to get my prescription filled I found out my psych didn't send authorization to my insurance company and I had to pay $60 or wait a week and hope he calls them and explains the medical necessity for it. Apparently he has to do it every month I want to have prescriptions filled. I emailed him about it, I paid the $60 (that I really didn't have) and thought it was going to be fine. He just sent me an email saying:

""I have been practicing for many years, with many insurance companies, and have never had a situation where there is a requirement to seek specific authorization each month for the medication.  This is a time-consuming process (it often takes 1-2 hours) and if your insurance, in your case, requires this on my part, I am afraid that I will not be able to do this and continue to treat you.""

And I'm really upset because so many people give up on me and this is just another straw on the camels back. Anyone else's psych do this or can y'all at least help me out?"
721,I panic when people touch me and I wish I knew why,"I have no idea why but I just can't handle physical contact, even just accidentally brushing my arm against someone. Every time someone touches me i just get a jolt of panic and fear through my whole body. My sister is a really touchy person and she likes to hug people, especially me and it's driving me crazy and she loves to torment me about it. I love the idea of holding hands, hugging ect. on paper but whenever something like that happens irl I can't do it, it makes me want to cry. It upsets my family when I pull away when they try to touch me but being touched is such a horrible feeling/sensation for me. Sometimes I can't even handle people being too close to me (sitting/standing close me) Does anyone have any idea why I'm like this? Of how to fix it?"
722,"I often think 'gosh I wish there were videos of people doing that, so I know what to do'. Is that a kind of masking people on the spectrum do?","Like 'I wish I could see someone walk up to a big group of strangers and talk with them so the I knew how I should do that.'
Or 'Let's watch how my brother walks out the door with the dog because my mum and neighbour are talking and I want to see how they do about that'.
Or 'Am I supposed to nod or say yes? Is it appropriate to shake hands (not during covid) or is that not necessary?' (like when someone comes to talk to my parents at home and I happen to be downstairs)"
723,I'm genuinely not sure if I can take any more.,"I've spent 4 years trying to find a new job to escape the hell that is hospitality and have got nowhere. Despite training, improving my CV countless times and applying for hundreds of jobs. We're due to start back at work tomorrow and I've cried at the thought of it every day this week. My wife has been diagnosed with bipolar and needs a lot of help at the moment. Asked work if I could go part time and they're compromise was to knock 2 hours a week off (52-50). I've spent the quarantine trying to set up my own business but I can't get the time to work on it between looking after wife, looking after two small children and running the house so that's not coming together. I'm angry at the slightest little thing which doesn't help anyone, and when I try to get support from family it falls on death ears. I'd get in the car and drive away but I've only got £3 to my name. Just sick of it all."
724,Has anyone else been excluded their entire life,"I’ve always been the odd one out. Every situation I can think of. School, previous jobs, “friends”, relationships, even by family. People go places without me, and it’s been this way for as long as I can remember. When we’ve been placed into groups in school I always tried to talk to everyone but still I noticed they just clicked better with each other. Same thing at my old job, I was just never good enough. People don’t gravitate towards me and never have. No matter how talkative and friendly I am. I’m sure you’ve guessed it by now, yes I’ve always been the therapist friend who never got anything in return. Now the one person who I’m the closest with and love the most went to breakfast with all his friends and I was invited but he left without telling me the plans were still on and excludes me from other plans too. Now I constantly question what’s wrong with me. I always try to talk and include myself and it’ll work for the time being but then I end up being excluded again. I can’t do this anymore."
725,Why your Anxiety has been through the roof since Covid-19 Lockdown [ADVICE],"Oh yes 2020, what a year! Who would have known right?! One moment, we’re all living our same-old, normal lives and BAM! A new-born deadly organism threatens life all over the planet and forces everyone to lock themselves at home.

They say humans are social animals and for the right reasons, we aren’t meant to be cooped up in our houses for extended periods of time. Social interaction is a very important aspect of our lives, unsurprisingly, taking that away drives us completely insane. But there’s more to it than it seems!

# 1) We love Routines!

Okay before you click away, just hear me out. The very fact that you’re here on Medium, reading articles on self improvement and betterment rather than binge-watching Sherlock on Netflix is enough to say that you are someone who takes their life very seriously and have high expectations from yourself. (and that’s applicable even if you did binge-watch Netflix, I know I did.)

Humans are creatures of habit, we freaking love Certainty! We love knowing what’s coming next and we enjoy being prepared. I mean think about it, our bodies adjust and refine themselves according to the external stimulus. That’s why you, at least for the most part, feel sleepy as the daylight recedes and darkness fills the sky. Your ancestors from 1000 years before did that and its coded in your cells.

If you eat your lunch at 12 noon every single day for a few months and forget to eat at the same time one fine day, the growling of your stomach will most definitely remind you. You see, when our bodies notice a pattern, it conditions itself to adapt accordingly so as to make our lives easier.

What our bodies also love is predictability. Haha no surprise here! To understand it in the easiest way possible, consider Homeostasis. Here’s an example- Our body has a tendency to regulate our internal temperature to 98.6°F (37°C) no matter how hot or cold it is outside. If it gets too hot, you start sweating to cool down yourself as sweat evaporates. Too cold? Healthline says “A shiver is caused by your muscles tightening and relaxing in rapid succession. This involuntary muscle movement is your body’s natural response to getting colder and trying to warm up.”

You get the gist of it, right? Well the lockdown imposed in response to this pandemic has shattered all the routines we set for ourselves. Routines- the only constants in the otherwise unpredictable, chaotic life. See where I’m getting at?

The lack of a routine, the very same one that you spent years perfecting no matter how difficult it must have been, was effectively triggered void. Suddenly everything stopped making sense.

&gt; ###### **What can you do about it?**

But it gets better you know. You might feel as if you’re stuck in rut of endless unproductivity and fruitlessness. All you need to do to get out of this is establish a discipline to your life. And I don’t mean allot activities to every minute of your life.

Just make an attempt to get your life back on track slowly and steadily. Start by just adding one productive habit to your life right now and follow it religiously everyday. Make sure to keep this habit easy and simple or the resistance will kill the motivation.

If you want to be healthy, start by exercising 2 minutes a day. If you wish to read more, aim to read for 2 minutes in a day. Only increase the time once you start looking forward to it. As and when you start adjusting to this new habit, add another and work it up the same way. Flexibility and adaption is the only way to survive.

# 2) Our Fear of Darkness

Man has always been afraid of the dark, both figuratively and literally. But it’s not really the darkness that we’re afraid of, rather what it represents- The Unknown.

I mean think about it, we’re afraid of what we don’t know, the mysterious, the supernatural. We fear anything that our minds cannot comprehend with logic and reason, so much so that we tell ourselves lies just to pacify the roaring mind.

And this is not a new pattern, we as humans, have always feared the unknown. Religion has been a very integral concept of human civilization, also a very successful one. It is easier and more convincing to believe that the world is created and maintained by something supernatural, something far superior to humans rather than by mere coincidence. People want to feel hopeful, they like to have a sense of familiarity than deal with the agony of fear and mystery.

You see, all this talk about darkness and atheism is not irrelevant. It indicates a pattern, our tendency to manifest and nourish anxiety when the future seems clouded with uncertainty. When will things get back to normal? Will I lose my job? Has my health been compromised? Do I have enough money? A once purposeful life suddenly rendered meaningless. Anxiety is a monster, one that dwells among fear and uncertainty. The lack of control over our life can feel hopeless and powerless to say the least. And hopelessness breeds further anxiety.

&gt; ###### **What can you do about it?**

Now that we’ve established that lack of control over our life is the cause of anxiety, all we have to do is bring about order and control to our life. Easier said than done right? There’s no harm in trying!

Like I already mentioned previously, one of the fastest way to take back control of your life is committing to a routine. Routines represent discipline and a sort of authority over the actions in your life.

Educate yourself with respect to your anxiety until it fearing it seems futile. If your concern is not having enough money, sit down and make a record of all you bank balance, expenses and incomes. Carefully evaluate your account statements and jot down the necessary changes.

Make plans! Back-up plans! Lots of them. Imagine the worst and armor yourself with shield of well-preparedness and strategy. Anxiety has no base to thrive if you take away to uncertainty factor.

# 3) Claustrophobia

Claustrophobia, like any other phobia is an irrational fear. An irrational fear of being trapped in closed spaces. Although claustrophobia is a real mental health disorder, I intend to use it figuratively rather than literally. Mental health issues are very much real and I don’t mean to subside its validity.

Being cooped up inside four walls for extended period of time is not really something we as humans are meant to be, rather any animal for that matter. Having literally no real social interaction isn’t just miserable but takes a toll on mental health.

Correct me if I’m wrong but the sense of loneliness is overwhelming since being quarantined. And that’s coming from me- a hardcore introvert. I am guilty of taking the long way home just so I avoid meeting people I know. I’ve always dreaded being in crowds and found comfort in the solitude of my four bedroom walls. Yes, I’ve definitely been alone but never really felt lonely.

Perhaps the difference between solitude and loneliness is willingness. Lesson learned-forced by the circumstances to be alone evokes loneliness rather than solitude.

&gt;###### **What you can do about it**

Catch up with your friends and relatives- they probably are lonely too. The other day one of my close friend happened to call me for something work related. We talked about that for a few minutes and spent time catching up for the rest 80 minutes.

Exercise. Yes I know how cliche and blah blah but believe me when I say it, it helps. Maybe because you trick your mind into substituting physical activity for social interaction. I completely stopped exercising since the outbreak and just started again a few weeks back and it makes so much difference in my life. I’m just doing for merely 10 minutes now cause I don’t want it to feel resisting.

This new situation is to remain for quite sometime, and we must make an effort and try our best to adjust to the new normal. I’m not going to lie, I don’t enjoy this but what does kill us makes us stronger right? And what even are we if not adaptable, we made it through the world wars and the plagues, this too shall pass. Perhaps this will make a good story to tell our kids and grand-kids.

726,"Should I quit my job for mental health reasons, while putting my family in financial jeopardy ?","Hey there, hope I'm posting to the right subreddit, r/AmItheAsshole sent me here. Apologies as English is not my first language.

Basically  I (30f) am struggling with my corporate job and have had bad anxiety,  barely getting out of bed, not been able to work, logging in on zoom  meetings only when high on antianxiolytics. I have a story of mental  health issues: burnout, low energy level and motivation, anxiety,  depression, psychotic thoughts. Earlier this year I was put on a  2-months sick leave and had to take a neuroleptic on top of the  antidepressant I've been taking for 3 years now. I have covered up my  failures at work the best I could and been upfront about feeling  overwhelmed (while staying vague about the cause) with my boss who is  actually happy with my performance and wants me to stay and grow in the  company.

However, I feel like this  situation will only get worse as I don't see how I can continue  performing in this job with such crippling thoughts, every day is a  uphill battle and I feel like Sisyphus. I feel like one day I will lash  out or disappear. I figured if I could just quit my job I would have the  mental space to work on bettering myself and figuring out what I want  to do with myself/who I want to be as a person.

Now  this decision does not just involve me. I have a husband (36m) that has  been struggling to find a job for a year so our whole household rely on  my income. He was working when we met 5 years ago but then 3 years ago I  had to move and he followed me in a new country, went back to school to  get such country diploma and learn the language. Given the current  economic situation, it could be anything from a month to a year before  he finds a new job that matches his skills.

So  if I quit, we will both be living solely on the state financial aid and  thus will need to sell our furnitures and move again, probably to a  small town in a rural area, which will make it harder for him to get a  job and put us both in a precarious situation.

I  am wrecked with guilt no matter which solution I lean toward. Neither  my therapist and psychiatrist want to weigh in. My mom thinks I should  go back on heavier medication so I can put up with my job (as the  neuroleptic makes me artificially more passive and accepting) and my  husband is supporting whichever decision I will take.

So I am turning to you, reddit. Thank you :)"
727,How to seek help,"Hey r/mentalhealth, I'm here to ask how to seek help. I've come to believe that a lot of the difficulties in my life may not just be ""the way it is,"" and I believe at least some of them may be a result of undiagnosed depression, anxiety, adhd, some combination of the 3, or something totally different. I've come to believe that life doesn't have to be this difficult and that I can do something about it, and I know that realizing I *can* do something about it is the first step for me.

I'm lost on the next step. I'm M/28/US, and the closest things I've done to visiting a doctor since I stopped living with my parents have been an appendectomy and a couple CVS MinuteClinic visits for a flu test and a stubborn athletes foot infection. I don't have a primary care provider, and I don't know what to do. I think my unwillingness to find one may be an anxiety coping mechanism, I won't get anxious if I don't do anything I'm uncertain about. That is a bit of a cycle though, because it means I don't deal with anything. Prior to COVID-19, I was able to cope through a regular work schedule, but working from home long-term has made it more difficult and that's why I'm finally making this post - It's the only thing I could think of to figure out what to do.

So, reddit, what should I do? I can find an ""Internal Medicine"" doctor through my insurance provider, but I don't want to get to an appointment only to be told ""Sorry, you need to see a psychologist/psychiatrist"". I could try and set up an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I don't understand health insurance enough to know if I need to see my nonexistent PCP first for a referral or something. I could set up something with a psychologist/therapist, but honestly that scares me for some damn reason even though it shouldn't - I think I've internalized some sort of stigma that therapy is for people with some kinda trauma or some real heavy shit to work out and that my problems aren't ""enough"" to warrant it. By that, I mean I don't have any major trauma, I'm content with my career and I'm mostly able to manage my work every day, I just struggle with some things most people seem to not have any issue with, such as nonexistent motivation, excessive procrastination ( see paragraph above as an example), and minor things seeming like too much work so I put them off which compounds the problem (e.g. I don't feel like cleaning up after dinner, I'll do it tomorrow, and then the next day, and then my apartment is such a mess that I wouldn't want anyone to see it, but then because nobody is gonna see it I can put it off another day or 30).

What should I do to stop struggling with things that shouldn't be hard?

Edit thanks to the AutoMod comment: I'm not exactly looking for specific resources, more just some direction on what resources I should find myself, but screw my ""I'll do it myself, just give me direction"" attitude this time, it hasn't exactly worked out for me so far in this context. I'm in Charlotte, NC, United States in case anyone has any specific recommendations. I know I'm not the only one out there in this boat, though, so I also hope for general advice so it might help anyone else in my position who comes across this post."

730,Tomorrow is My Birthday and Everything I Used to Do to Celebrate is Canceled,"I know lots of people have had birthdays since the whole covid thing and missed out on their usual celebrations. But it just really sucks to be cooped up for months and then have my birthday effectively be canceled. My favorite thing to do on this day is to watch fireworks from a big crowd of people and eat food from street vendors and basically be a part of something that so many people are enjoying. I thought about renting a hotel in a city that didn't cancel their fireworks and watching from the hotel room, but it's been impossible to talk to someone who works at the actual hotels to confirm the room has a view. And it's not just the fireworks that 'make it my birthday'.

Last year my birthday was pretty disappointing because of my mental health. I wasn't myself and was socially isolating and basically just slept all day. So I was looking forward to having a decent one this year. I also kind of feel like if I tried explaining this to anyone else, they'd just be like, ""Yeah we wanted to see fireworks too."""

738,Stopping antidepressants cold turkey,"I’m not this is the right subreddit. My partner was prescribed antidepressants (don’t know which one) by his urologist for something besides depression. I take off-label meds too so I take no issue with that. He is going off them because he was experiencing the side effect of losing his hair. I get that too. 

What I disagree with is that his doctor told him he should go off cold turkey. I’ve had this argument with my partner before. He’s prescribed antidepressants (for depression or other reason) but never by a mental health expert. 

So when he told me this morning, that his doctor told him cold turkey, I was upset. I said never go cold turkey and he told me he has a plan to take one every other day. Bad idea. He told me to watch him in case he does something. Once I told him it was a bad idea (I’ve been on antidepressants and other psych meds for probably close to ten years) he flipped out. He said he didn’t want to talk about it. Fine, but then he kept loudly talking, walking in and out of the room. He’s making this into an issue of trust. I don’t have faith in him. He’s smart and I should trust him."

I was enthusiastic in the beginning, I thought that I would at least get through to one round of interviews maybe but it’s been months and I’ve heard nothing from anyone. I’ve started to feel like I should just give up and go back to my undergrad job at a tea shop but they’re not even hiring because of the pandemic.

So slowly I felt my anxiety coming back except I don’t have the same access to my coping methods because I sold my musical instrument and I don’t live alone anymore so I don’t want to exercise because I hate the thought of somebody even being in the same place when I exercise (idk why I just get embarrassed, really anxious about it, that’s why I never go to gyms and I hate exercising outside). 

Once my anxiety kicked in it was relentless and I started feeling like my family was resenting me for being home. Now I’m not sleeping, I’m panicky, and I’ve slowed down applying to jobs because I feel so depressed thinking about how they’ll probably not even email me back. I believe now I’m not qualified for anything I apply for even though I probably am 

Logically I know I’m starting to spiral and I should keep trucking and find new coping mechanisms and I know I’ll eventually get hired somewhere but for now I just feel horrible in every possible way."

744,How do I keep eating on Wellbutrin?,"TW for discussions of weight, diet, food.

My dosage of Wellbutrin was upped from 150 mg to 300 about 3 weeks ago. I basically haven't felt hunger since then.

I haven't been weighed since March, but last week I went to a doctor's appointment and it turns out I've lost 10 lbs at some point since then. That would be basically about 7.5% of my body mass, which is why I'm more concerned. I've been unemployed, pretty sedentary, at home since March bc of COVID so if anything I would have expected gain. I already lost 50 lbs last year just from depression.

Eating has never been an issue for me. As it turns out I might be ADHD, working on finding assessment centers w/ my psychiatrist and therapist, but basically we've determined I'm ""feeling"" motivated. As in, I just don't do things if I don't feel like it, despite wanting to, being able to, or knowing I need to. So eating has become very hard when I don't feel hunger.

Even things I enjoy, like sweets, are hard to eat, but they make up a good portion of my daily diet now. I know that isn't particularly healthy but it's better than nothing. Cooking is out of the question, I've been relying on my parents to make home cooked meals, which typically are very healthy as we have a garden this summer. But I'll eat maybe one meal like that in a day, much smaller serving than I would have had 6 months ago. I've never counted calories before but if I had to guess I would imagine I'm eating 1000 or less calories in a day, and it doesn't feel particularly good at the end of the day if I forgot to eat at all.

TLDR; Basically I'm asking anyone else who's been on Wellbutrin/bupropion how do I keep eating when I can't feel hunger? I think the medicine is otherwise very effective for my depression, particularly my executive dysfunction, but this seems like something that could snowball very easily."

746,Short essay on western and eastern approaches to mental health," 

Hi! I’m writing this before you have agreed to read this because I really enjoy writing and bullshiting. What I’m writing about is the difference and similarities between Eastern and Western medicine. Remember to take this essay as a grain of salt. As we know from Chemistry class, table salt is Na+ Cl- held together with ionic bonds. We believe this to be true because when salt is dissolved into water, it is not a solid or grain anymore, and it conducts electricity when passing a current. Is this our explanation of what sea salt is? How can we be so sure? That was just a primer of thought before I continue about medicine.

Let us ask a medical professional how depakote works. Medical professionals will come out with an explanation that GABA is the culprit neurotransmitter to cause mood stabilization in bipolar patients and people with epilepsy. As a person diagnosed with bipolar, this only eases my curiosity to a certain age before I wonder why it doesn’t work. Are medical professionals lying to me for my own good? Is GABA or neurotransmitters just a “santa claus” explanation discovered in order to ease the curiosity of the kid so they live life in ignorance to the truth till death? This link is a whole explanation of how GABA is discovered, but I don’t expect a reader to read it because I’ll speak for the majority of people, that they don’t read into studies before they claim. That’s because when we hear double blind study that we KNOW is the gold standard for proofs; end of conversation or else you are labeled bipolar for the rest of your life for bringing disruption in other people’s lives. Also, please question your own beliefs before you judge me by my cover as being a bipolar and that none of my logic makes sense. Also, please don’t be one of medical professionals that say “don’t have children because you will spread your bipolar genes”. Rather give the person a sexually transmitted disease/infection test and give the diagnosis of HIV. Then as a medical professional, you know you scared the bejesus of them to never have sex again because they want the best for their partners. Okay my venting is over, let me compare western medicine with eastern.

There are so much similarities with Eastern and Western medicine. Both types of medicine give explanations to why a patient is feeling a certain way. But one is more likely to conclude that “I don’t know how to fix your problem”. Maybe it’s the practitioner not the style. I’m still alive unlike many of the great writers of the past.

747,I feel nothing,"Guys i literally feel nothing.. like old days i would cry over an ant i’ve killed and now i even won’t cry if someone i love died 
I can’t feel happy or sad i feel nothing 
Everytime i try to react my brain goes like “ do you feel like that really? “ and then i be numb this is weird
Ps: i’m not depressed and i feel anger but i can’t feel other emotions"
748,How to improve Avoidant Personality Disorder,"I haven't been properly diagnosed, but my doctor seemed to think that it was likely that I have this disorder. I'm still waiting on the psychologist. 
 I did some research. It seems to fit me pretty well."
749,How can I be there for my brother? (tw suicide mention),"My brother (20) was a huge fan of the gamer ""Reckful"" who committed suicide recently, and my mother (that he lives with) told me that his mental health has taken a big hit from this. 

He struggles with some mental health issues himself, and I think it that, besides mourning the loss of a hero of his, he is worried that there might not be ""light at the end of the tunnel"" regarding his depression, as there wasn't for his hero/inspiration. He took it hard too when Chester Bennington passed a few years back from suicide, and these feelings are resurfacing as well now. 

How can I show him that besides these really tragic and terrible situations, there is a way out and suicide is not the solution? We have never been the most touchy-feely or talkative of siblings, but our parents doesn't quite get it, and I want to make sure that he isn't having thoughts of his own like this. 

What do you tell someone when the person they look up to regarding depression and mental illness, ends up passing away from it?"
750,A Simple Ramble,"I see suffering everywhere. On every level. The older members of my family are slowing aging. My friends all have issues with things such as anxiety, eating disorders and feelings of inadequacy. All of humanity is suffering with this pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, lack of resources, over consumption of resources, inability to understand their own thought and emotions. 

I find myself increasing apathetic. I increasingly want to retreat into my own world of video games, porn and self harm. Things to dull the pain. I feel a intense self hatred at my actions and a feeling of overpowering worthless. When I was young I think I found joy in helping people and the world as a whole. But this goal feels increasing meaningless. I can't really help people. Suffering is embedding into the structure of the world. I had caring parents who still provide me with everything. And yet I can't pull myself together. 

My attempts at therapy haven't really changed anything. I still feel anxious about the future and still procrastinating doing anything productive. Is it just another waste of my parents money?

And underneath it as is the shame. My mother suffered similar things and still went on to be a doctor and help many people. My therapist themselves hinted they lost someone during the pandemic and yet after only a month break they are still wanted to start helping people again. People suffer through so much pain and yet are still hopeful. They don't back down and retreat into their own worlds. All the nurses, doctors, shop workers, care workers, teachers, firefighters etc. They don't stop working. They keep going in spite of everything. 

I can only wonder how. I feel my life slowly dissolve. I can managed enough at uni, procrastinating and doing things at the last minute. But well enough. But I am terrified of work. Of responsibly. I am afraid my girlfriend my release my inadequate nature and level me. But I really love her and she loves me. At least the parts that she sees. But I think if people saw the poison underneath me they would realise there is no hope for me. 

Not sure what this was. A bunch of cliche 'ohh look at poor me!' with a sprinkling pseudo-philosophy. Probably. Should probably go make dinner. Good luck to all."
751,Idk why I’m like this,"As I type this I am on vacation with my family (dads side cause parents are divorced) alone in the condo feeling bad for myself. I don’t even know where to begin describing what’s going on because it seems that every little thing that happens pisses me off. Just some back ground info I’m 17yrs old M, 6’3” 155lbs and just started a t break from cannabis (which while I don’t have a card, I still use it illegally to treat my Tourette’s syndrome.)  I started my break the morning we left for the beach which was Wed July 1st and didn’t bring anything with me so I couldn’t be tempted to give up on my break like I have every prior attempt. Before starting my break I was going through about a gram of wax about every 2-3 days, plus a g cart and an 8th of flower in about a week just to switch it up since probably a little before thanksgiving.  I know a bunch of people go through a lot more than that but for my current financial situation it makes sense to suffer through a break thank go keep paying $150 is dollars a week just to stay somewhat buzzed if you could even call it that. 

I know I’m depressed but since I’ve started my break it feels like I’ve developed every fucking mental illness imaginable and it’s driving me insane. First of all I’ve been super critical of every inconvenience and arguing with anything I hear that I know isn’t %100 true, it’s like I can’t hold my tongue for any reason and it’s starting to get me in trouble with my parents since I have to talk back to them any opportunity I get.  We’ve spent 3 nights at the beach so far and every single morning I have woken up way earlier than my sleep schedule usually would allow, I’ve woken up with cold sweats and random joint pain that I don’t remember going to sleep with. 

And to touch up on the depression part that I previously stated. I have terrible self worth issues and can’t let anyone know that I’m struggling ever because I don’t think I’m worth worrying about. I know that it would %100 be in my best interest to go to a therapist but my parents are divorced and I would want to financially burden either one of them. I’ve worked a part time job since I turned 16  because I want to pay for everything So that my parents have to spend as little on me as possible. 

One of the biggest contributing factors to my depression would definitely be my mother. I love my mother but I don’t know how at this point because she can make me feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world with just a couple words. I feel like she uses that against me to keep me under her finger and do all of her chores for her. Which I’m not saying I mind to help her but that’s the thing, she asks for me to help her with stuff and then leaves me alone to do it by myself. As I stated I’m 17rn and I’m turning 18 on the 19th of this month. But my mother has blatantly told me she will not let me move out when I turn 18 which I know I wouldn’t need her blessing or anything but I know life would be much easier if I could get her support. 

I hate to post this anywhere because it makes me feel like I’m begging for attention but since I can’t make myself reach out to friends or family here we are."
752,im scared and confused,"Im not sure what this is.and im not sure if its even from my BPD because its not really like splitting...So i have this problem.I feel like my emotions or presonality are splitting into pieces,and i have triggers for them,its kinda like DID but not really.I have like a really sad one,a creppy scary one that even scares me,the logical one (the one whos typing this),we have the childish one,the *very* queer one,the lazy one and the bratty one.I dont  know if they are feelings or its my personality going crazy but last night the sad one and the really scary one had a huge fight over something i imagined.I imagined how amazing it would be to be adopted by 2 gay people,because thwy wpuld be pro-lgbtqi and caring.Or maybe i had a huge fight?i am so confused..maybe its my brain making it all up just to scare me or maybe not...this is starting to drive me insane but maybe im already crazy.Who knows,i wont know till im 18 and can get my own help..."
753,Suddenly rude reply from psychiatrist,"So I have been seeing a Consultant Psychiatrist for over a year. Half of that time has been virtual as I moved areas. I felt she had been great and we had a good relationship. 

Anyway on Wednesday for the first time I took cocaine cos I was so low, I then took a slightly larger dose of my prescribed sleeping pills than normal (22.5mg Zopiclone) and 1mg Xanax as I cudn’t sleep. I then panicked and went to A&amp;E to make sure I hadn’t put myself in danger. They weren’t overly concerned and said I should def contact my psychiatrist to discuss. So I sent her a message explaining what had happened, that I went to A&amp;E and was safe and would like to arrange a consultation when she was free to discuss.  

This was my text:

Hello Dr. Xxxxx, this is (name removed). Apologies for contacting you unawares but I wanted to explain the last couple of weeks my symptoms have gotten worse. Things got a bit bad and I ended up in A&amp;E yesterday. I told the A&amp;E consultant that I had my own psychiatrist that I would speak to, and that I would make contact with you. I know how busy you are at the moment but if you had time for a consultation I’d really appreciate it. Thanks 

This is their reply:

Xxxx I do not have time to reply to this message or emails today. You need to accept any mental health care that is offered to you locally in the NHS. If you are in crisis I am not able to adequately help you manage risks to yourself in (location removed) at a distance from (location removed). Unfortunately I am not able to offer an emergency support service. I’m pleased you went to A and E in crisis and you can attend again if necessary . Your GP can refer you to the local mental health crisis team for over the weekend. I’m sorry I am not able to offer a crisis service. 

I wasn’t asking for an emergency treatment and made it clear that I was keeping myself safe by going to A&amp;E of my own accord. I think my email wasn’t pushy or needy, I just wanted to arrange a consultation. I was rather upset to receive this message and will now look for a different psychiatrist.

What do you guys think?"
754,Not in a good place...,"I'm really not doing well right now. Going to be a long post, so appreciate anyone willing to read through.

First issue, is a very complicated situation with a guy I know. To try and keep things as short as possible, he and I met 2 years ago and started off as fwb. A few months in, he said he was too conflicted between me and another fwb and was shutting everything down sexually. He said he was figuring out feelings for her, which hurt. Fast forward a few months and he drops a bombshell on me that they're in a relationship. I was devastated and things weren't good between us for several months. They broke up a few months later and of course, I wanted things to rekindle with him and I. After months of excuses, it comes back to him deciding if he was going to get back together with her. A few weeks ago, he initiates a conversation with me that he has decided they aren't going to get back together, but he doesn't want anything with anyone right now.

Not easy to hear, especially since it's been almost 2 years of us not having sex and I haven't stopped wanting it back and for things to go back to how they were. There's been some soft sexual activity (dry humping), but he says he's got this ""block"" where he can't go further than that. 

We've been fighting a lot lately because I've made it clear that I'm not happy with things as they are. He's said he needs to just have some space to figure out what, if anything, he wants. I would be understanding of this, and I am still going to give him space, but I've heard it before and don't trust it. He's said he's gone back to being platonic and then resumed things with this other woman numerous times and I don't doubt he will again. This absolutely tears me apart and makes it nearly impossible to do what he's asking. I've flat out asked him what I need to do for him to reconsider things with me and hit ""for starters, stop bringing it up"". I feel like he's just manipulating me to get me off his back instead of having the decency to be honest with me. So, now I'm wrestling with walking away entirely because I'm just sick of it.


Second issue, my relationship with my siblings, sisters especially, is strained. My youngest sister and I have lived in the same city for about the last two years, and she never replies to my messages, calls, etc and almost never initiates contact with me. I stopped trying to reach out to her quite a while ago because it's just draining. I won't see her for 6+ months and am genuinely excited to see her, but within minutes she has to make some bitchy comment and it's disheartening to deal with. I've called her out on it and she constantly makes excuses - she's too busy, she claims to her phone isn't sending her messages/calls (I work for a cell company so I know that's bs). My other sister is better about keeping in contact, but same behaviour - I maybe see her twice a year and the last time we went on vacation and both of them wanted nothing to do with me. I've reached the point where I just give up, because I don't know what to do anymore.



Third issue, I've just moved out of a place I was renting and my landlords are giving me a headache. They're trying to pin water damage on the baseboards and windowsills on me when they've admitted it looks like there is water coming in from somewhere (we've had a lot of rain over the last few weeks) and that their baseboards also have water damage, to a lesser extent, just from mopping - ie, the contractors used poor quality materials. Now they aren't giving me an answer about what the findings were when they had their home builder come in to inspect. It's probably going to have to go to court, which is a whole headache I really don't want to deal with.

I'm just at my wits end right now. I'm stressed out, worn out, heartbroken and just tired of all of it. I'm alone and have no one to talk to and am not taking care of myself. I just can't snap out of it."

Where I'm the Nazi and I will forever go down in history as a satirical representation of the true nature of society.  What is that?"
758,Is it normal to have random bursts of anger for no reason where I'm angry at everything and nothing at the same time?,"So I'm 18. Idk why, but maybe knowing that would help. So sometimes I just get random bursts of anger for no reason, out of nowhere and I can't seem to stop it no matter what I do or wherever I distract my mind at, I can't stop it and it really becomes an obstacle in me working. Is this normal? What should I do about it?"

762,I need some advice,"Hello, recently I have been feeling very stress, like my head feels really heavy and I have trouble sleeping at night due to 2 of my close friends have passed on. 1 from lymphoma and the other from a bike accident and both are just within a time of 1.5 weeks and I just kept thinking about them. Today, I heard that one of my junior had committed suicide, this makes it 3 people have passed on in 1.5 weeks and we are all used to be from the same school. I feel like, not sure is it anxiety or stress or depressed but my head just feels really really troubled and probably because of school work as well... I feel that if this continues, I will really really go crazy and I do not want to see my friends and I to be in this state. Are there any ways for me to get rid of these thoughts/ heavy head as some of the ways I’ve tried like music did helped a bit but not for a Long time."
763,Fear of missing out (kinda),"I have like a reverse fear of missing out, but it doesnt feel like JOMO (joy of missing out). When me and my friends make plans to go out, I often cancel in the last minute without any reason, but then I see (on social media) or just think about how they are having fun without me and I feel like Im missing out, but I dont know why because its my fault because I canceled it and I decided not to go. Idk its like sometimes I am afraid of socializing which I am, I am socially awkward and I dont like to socialize or go anywhere that much, but not with my friends. This week some of my friends went camping (because of some program in school) and I decided not to go. To I regret my decision? Yes.(at first I felt really bad because I didnt go, but now I feel better about it). It was also with some friends I will never see again, because we are going to high school next year. It was just dumb decision not to go. I dont really know how to explain this and why I decide not to go to something like this. I this case there were more reasons, but other times I just decide not to go, I just see everybody having fun without me and it makes me feel like that friend in the group thats less of a friend or something like that, but I feel like that even when I am with my friends because I often feel like a third wheel. Maybe thats why sometimes I dont go, but I never think that Im going to he a third wheel and I dont go because of that. I hope I learned this time that in the future I wont miss out on going out. Im sorry the whole thing is kinda complicated and Im really bad at explaining things and Im not even sure if this is the subreddit for this, Im just feeling really down lately. Maybe something like this has happend to some of you or you at least kinda know what Im talking about. Thanks for reading, stay safe and have a great day."
764,Dog is being euthanized today and I’m thinking of self harming,"Basically title. None of my friends are answering their phones right now, so I don’t really have anyone to talk too. She’s been my best friend for 11 years, and I’m never going to see her again. Also, how can I go about calling out of work tomorrow because I can’t talk without crying?"
765,when should i be concerned after my brain has blocked out a good percentage of a certain time frame?,"i know that this kind of question is meant for a psychiatrist, but i don’t have health insurance so reddit it is. i figured some of you might have experiences with this type of thing, i don’t know. 

A little backstory- last august i went through a very horrible, manipulative breakup. about a month later, i finally told myself enough was enough and i forced myself to get over it after i started talking to someone else that had recently moved several hours away, which resulted in me moving up there to be with them because i had nothing left for me in the position that i was in, so why not. only people that cared about me enough was my parents and a couple of close friends who were supportive of my move (my friends, i might add, not my parents). the relationship after moving was great at first, but then it started to get really rocky and became toxic very quickly. i spent about 9 months there, and decided to move back home after a another failed relationship that i was mentally manipulated in and ignored sexually/physically/emotionally for the last 4 months of it. 

i’ve been home since may, living with my parents again like i was before i moved away, working the same job i had as before, my room even decorated the same way as i had it before, and it’s starting to feel like i never left and that the things in that time period never happened. over the last couple of months my brain has pushed out almost every single memory i’ve had of living away from home- from relationship things, friendships, working, etc. i can’t recall certain things about my ex partner, i can’t remember conversations or memories of pictures. it’s only gotten worse and i don’t know if it’s the emotional trauma that’s making me forget or what. text messages, pictures, and people on social media are the only grips i have with reality right now. 

so my question is, when does something like this need to be considered concerning?"

767,I just rewatched Jurassic Park 3 and a scene stuck with me,"
It’s a very small scene towards the end of the movie. The T-Rex is walking through the suburbs at night where it crashes through a fence to drink water from a pool. The part that I am specifically talking about is when the family dog barks at the dinosaur only to retreat to his dog house whimpering. 

What stuck with me about this is I liken it deeply to my situation.  It feels like the world has insurmountable odds facing me and I just retreat to my bedroom which I’m am likening to the doghouse for salvation and shelter. It makes me realize how pitiful I am and my life’s attempts are and how my little bedroom in my own naivety is the only peace I have.  Just like that dog I go back whimpering with my tail between my legs defeated.

768,Advice please,Hi everyone. I had a 'relationship' with someone over a year ago. It’s been six months since I last talked to him and my heart still feels horrible. I think about him all the time.

Or keep trying to forget.
769,(CW: suicide) what kind of preventive community support would benefit you most? What should change about society's current approach to suicide and suicidal ideation?,"(If these seems familiar, I posted something very similar to askreddit) 

Recently, a friend of mine took his own life. He was a vital part of our community and loved every single person he met, and was endlessly kind. Some of my friends and I are trying to work with our school  to start some sort of program to locally revolutionize suicide prevention and support for mentally ill (or anyone struggling) community members. 

I have experienced suicidal ideation very, very frequently and for a very long time. I have my own personal ideas on dissipating astigmatism, support for suicidal people and how we treat the topic of suicide. However, I am only one person and everyone experiences suicidal ideation and mental illness differently in their own way.

I am asking this in order to learn how to support people like me and hopefully prevent something like this from happening. I want to make people (including myself) want to live rather than live in guilt. I want to carry on the legacy of kindness that he left us and help others as he did. 

Tell me what kind of support YOU would want to be shown, and how to move forward from the general mindset surrounding suicide. How can we do better for ourselves and each other?"

I feel like I'm going insane. I feel alone and isolated. Because I am. I have no life. Im scared. And now I've taken the sedative and yes I have had happy moments today. But I shouldn't have to be okay with a sedative. I want to be happy with life without it. 
I dont know
I just dont know."
775,Always falling behind...,"What’s wrong with me? I always feel like I’m falling behind. First it was not making friends (I’m so nervous to go to some meetup tomorrow), then it was not getting a boyfriend/girlfriend, my career, my college... I feel like I’m falling behind on everything and I’m disgusted with myself. I don’t know how others deal with this, or what I’m doing wrong. 

Right now I’m deciding where to go with my life, but my head keeps taking me so many different places. I just feel so unhappy and so trapped... I don’t know what to do. I want to study what I enjoy, but is it worth worrying about the money? My parents keep telling me, how are you gonna live? And they’re right... and I hate my life, and maybe I’m just spoiled but it’s taking me so long and I’m falling behind."
776,What's wrong with me?,"About a month and a half ago I (22M) had a sudden panic attack out of the blue. I had no direct cause of anxiety or stress but i may have had some stress related issues pile up in the back of my head. After this panic i suffered from severe insomnia and i haven’t felt the same since. I feel on edge all the time sensitive to noises and bright lights. I have constant tingling in my extremities and head. I had waves of panic that came with paraesthesia. My legs feel sore and terribly stiff every day no matter how much I sleep or rest. My eyes feel tired no matter how much i sleep. Occasionally i wake up feeling my left side of my body tingling that slowly goes away. I have terrible fatigue and occasional migraines as well. 

I managed to survive about a month until i couldn’t take it anymore and met with my doctor.  I admitted that i went through intense hypochondria during this time because of my terrible physical symptoms thinking at first i was getting schizophrenia then switched to ALS and then to MS and to brain cancer. I explained to him my symptoms and he examined my blood ,B12, and thyroid. All came back clear and he gave me a GAD diagnosis. He prescribed me antidepressants and buspar for the next few weeks. 

That same day at night i woke up shivering terribly in bed at 4 AM and was so scared. The shivering passed after about 20 minutes. I convinced my parents to take me to the ER and the doctors examined me and determined i had nothing and gave me xanax and pain relievers. I was very frustrated by this outcome so the next day i went back to the ER and asked for a CT scan of my head. They were reluctant because they were convinced i had nothing but they gave me it. The scan came back clear and i was relieved for a bit, until my symptoms persisted. 

About 2 weeks into my antidepressant treatment and I’ve noticed some improvement. The burning paraesthesia with waves of anxiety have stopped and my insomnia has improved. However, i still feel so stiff and fatigued all the time that it feels like i ran a marathon everyday. I fear that this is going to be permanent and chronic and this is my new life. Ive been reading about chronic stress and this seems to check most of its boxes. I have always been a anxious guy terribly so believe me but this is something completely different and lasts the entire day from beginning to end. Have i entered a point of no return or is there some hope for my situation."
777,Been feeling disconnected from reality and heavily dark," Yep, the title says it all. I have never felt so distressed in my life, i feel like there is a black hole just expanding in me. Everything seems less happy, nothing seems right and sometimes i just wonder what the hell am i doing on this planet and i feel very very very pointless to the point where i just am shaking. It's really dark, something is hurting me i dont know what, but its as if sometimes there is something evil , dark and wicked inside of me trying to guide me into just feeling suicidal. It hurts so fucking much, nothing in this world seems real to me anymore i've reached out for help but i'm still going to have to wait months upon months for CBT. Because only i feel depressed, and sometimes i even feel like im going insane , and as if i do not belong in reality. I feel scared of reality even, sometimes i'm just terrified of being conscious, worst thing is i dont think this is puberty like they all say man, i've been starting to get serious mental health problems , its like something is consuming me from the inside out BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS MAN ITS AS IF IM ALONE , my mom just says stop being negative, shes not a bad person but she just wont understand. I just feel in distress all the time, and i dont want to end up like twitch streamers, i dont want to go on that road of mental insanity that seriously makes me lose my shit. Ah to be honest i dont know what im asking for, because im just worthless and unworthy. What am i supposed to do? My mom just tells me toughen up, but its not as simple as that... I guess im asking for advice and help if any of you guys have it , it would really make my day. Because these feelings just keep on coming back, i just feel scared of reality and being here. I feel quite depressed i think, but like in a very strange way."
778,Been having certain thoughts about suicide,"Its not that I necessarily want to commit suicide, but if something happened and I could potentially stop it.. well I wouldn't. 

I have so much hatred for myself. I feel like i dont have a purpose"
779,I feel “ok” now but it’s just not good enough,"I hit a pretty bad depression. Then got on some meds and at times felt so much happier than I had long before the medication. I’m still on the meds.

Now I’m back into “neutral” and I feel like I should be grateful. I’m not sad or exhausted like when I was depressed before. That type of depression is painful. I can manage my everyday activities pretty well.

I guess I’m still kind of depressed but since I’m able to deal with everyday life so much better I feel like that should make me feel better. I don’t think I’d be feeling bad at all about being kinda numb if I hadn’t experienced that happiness recently

Also my other mental illnesses are pretty good right now, I live with some people I like a lot, and I have a remote job that’s a great match for me.

But it’s just not enough. Like I don’t struggle to make it to the next day, but if something happens and it gets hard to make it to the next day again...I don’t feel like now is so great it’ll motivate me to work through that

And now I keep drinking, probably (lol) too much...kind of a cruel joke that depression makes you want to drink and drinking can make you depressed"
780,Can someone just reassure me that I’m a good person. I don’t really feel like I am.,[deleted]
781,Can someone just reassure me that I’m a good person. I don’t really feel like I am.,"I’ve been sitting at home for about an hour, and all of a sudden, my thoughts are really dark. I feel like a failure, like everyone around me would be better off without me. It’s taking over my mind at the moment and I just need reassurance that that’s wrong. That I’m a good person. I’m afraid that if I fight this alone, those thoughts will win out. I’m sorry to burden, I’m just scared."
782,Has anyone ever been admitted to hospital?,"I’m strongly considering going to the ER, but I don’t know what to do

I’ve gone in the past and they’ve treated me like I was faking it, and then sent me home

How do I make sure they listen to me? What do I do if they send me home again?

If I do end up staying, what should I pack?"
783,How do I learn to express my emotions healthily instead of bottling it up?,"Unlike most people I know, I can't be expressive of the things that bother me or make me sad. It's not like I try and pick up this macho persona that I can't be emotional. It's just, I just can't get myself emotional and talk about myself. It always feels like my problems can't be as serious, or I don't want them to feel sorry for me, or I don't want to ruin my cheerful persona and see me as emotionally distressed. It generally works fine but the caveat is that, those emotions spur out in breakdowns, whether when someone is angry at me or I'm alone and feeling overwhelmed and it can be extremely draining. How did you guys get yourself out of situation like this and learned to expressed your emotions healthily?"
784,Got a nice new...,"AIR CONDITIONER FOR OUR ROOM!!!!!!

Can you say aaaaaaahhhhhhh?? You know we old people can't tolerate heat and humidity like the young'uns anymore. :D  


I just had a really nice day out with hubby...went to WalMart (busy!!) and did some other errands. :) Now I am here on my bed, about to order pizza for supper, in my nice cool bedroom...

&amp;#x200B;

Life. Is. Good today! My mood is happy and my impulses are quiet for the moment.

Hope all of you are staying cool now!"

786,Where to seek help ?,I have tried psycotherapist and psycologist in my area and they have helped me to some extent. It has been 4 years since i last talked to a profesional or anyone about my problems and they have gotten worse. Is there any psycotherapist online for free or just people who can listen to my story and give me some advice ?
787,What’s wrong with me?,"For a few months now, I’ve allowed comments on my weight affect me greatly. Ive created this mindset where if im not super skinny i’ll never be attractive in my eyes. I’ve been extremely sad lately about it. i don’t look at myself in the mirror, i hate myself even more everyday, and i have a horrible relationship with food. I see food as calories, Seeing large amounts of food scares me and i don’t like the thought of me being hungry. I eat once a day, and even then i feel like crap for even eating that. I feel bad CONSTANTLY and put myself down about my weight. I was 209, then i dropped to 194 and now i’m 189. I don’t see a difference, despite everyone else saying they do. I feel bad when i end up eating something outside of the one meal a day (which usually only comes up to 400 calories, sometimes). I even had a point in time where i’d not eat for a full day, eat something that’s 200 calories one day, and then skip another day. I have no idea what this means, and idk if anyone else feels this same way or experienced it. But any idea??"
788,I’m beginning to struggle with a subconscious need to please those around me.,"I’m not entirely sure how to go about this. My entire life growing up I knew that asking permission was something very important in my family and something that I began to do for many things even within my own house. Now, I’m 21, and looking to take a pretty big step in my life, but don’t fully have the support of my parents when it comes to one possible decision, and then could throw my entire relationship with my girlfriend of 5 years into turmoil on the other end of the spectrum. 

When I’m asked, point blank, what I want to do, I can’t answer the question. I know you’re supposed to live life for you and not for anyone else, but I have this subconscious fear of letting people down and being a disappointment and it has torn me apart for the last 18 hours. I cried myself to sleep last night, I’ve cried multiple times today, and I know more is coming when I see my parents later. I wasn’t sure what to tag this as between needing support or just venting, but any comments or feedback, especially from someone who has this same fear wired into them, would be appreciated greatly. Comment, dm, whatever you want. I’m just having a tough day and realizing that perhaps my mental health really isn’t what I thought it was."
789,Need someone to talk to,"I don't know if this is a place to ask for this but I'll go on.

I definitely need professional help, I understand that finally after many years. I have wanted to kill myself since I was 6 years old. I kept delaying and distracting myself and somehow made it to almost 25 years old. I don't think I can ignore it any longer. I have always known that I have a problem but thought that having good friends or a girlfriend will cure it. I realise that any good things that happen in my life is just delaying the inevitable. I can't seem to handle even a small bad thing in my life. 

Recently many things have started going wrong and I have this huge urge to just end everything. Since I can't get professional help until covid is gone I don't know what to do.

I am not that articulate in this post, sorry about that. I'm writing this in a bad state of mind. 

Since it's mentioned in the rules to include the country, I am from India"
790,One big clusterfuck,"In 2008 one my best friends died to alcohol poisoning. In 2010 another friend of mine and my cousin both lived at my place we pretty much split everything. All you could hear was video games being played throughout the night. They died in horrible truck accident. They were drunk and the truck flipped multiple times ejecting them. I got the news when the phone rang and I got up and tried to run over and answer but just missed it and had to listen to some girls say they were both dead. 2013 my mother passed away after a long fight with HIV. My grandmother called and left a message she had died. To this day I've always wanted to ask her why she thought that was good idea. 3 months later I was watching a movie, my brother was in the guest room playing a game. He struggled with addiction for many years and had finally cleaned up and it was the happiest time for me to see him finally laughing and hanging out considering at one point I yelled at him to never come back to my home. He walked past the living room and went into the bathroom and was taking a shower. I got up and walked over to the kitchen and grabbed a drink and heard him struggling to breath and knocked on the door asking what was happening and he walked out and said he couldn't catch his breath.  He looked at me one last time before he went with paramedics.  He died of a blood clot that traveled up into his lung. Towards the end of that year my youngest brother was found dead in a hotel from an overdose.  My grandmother would ask me to come to church so I did, I remember someone talking to someone else and saying God has a way of bringing you back to him. That he took them home to bring me back to church. I didn't like that at all but just ignored it out of respect to grandma. I also found out a couple years later I have early stages of congestive heart failure. Then after having my blood taken and the doctor asking me to do 3 tests that took like 3 weeks to finish I was told I may have a benign tumor in my head. Through out all this my good friend who I've always told everyone is my 3rd brother is now struggling with alcohol and drug addiction in this present day. I tried to have a conversation with him and he looked at me and said ""you don't know what I'm going through"" and I suddenly felt this intense anger towards him. I felt like I hated him. I also felt like he's gonna end up like my other two brothers. I said some stuff I'm not gonna repeat. Ever since that happened I feel like anger and sadness is crushing me. I will feel like I'm gonna  be alright when I wake up in the morning and suddenly I am completely depressed and easily angered at the slightest thing. I feel like I need to give my dogs away because I start yelling at them for doing normal things dogs do. I feel like Im gonna lose my mind when they run and hide and wont come to me. Every day I start crying. Almost everyone I grew up with are dead either from substance or alcohol abuse. I never drank or smoked and one day said fuck it and took edibles. Everyone said it was medicine but it all did was make me feel like I couldn't walk across the room to my bed without falling(I have no experience with alcohol or most of the drugs I hear people talk about). I'm obsessed with watching youtube and twitch because it completely distracts me most of the time. If I'm not watching I play fallout or skyrim or some arpg by myself. I've always heard call a hotline or something and talk to someone if you feel trapped. Telling someone face to face or even talking on the phone right now scares the hell out of me. I typed this all out and considered deleting it when I looked at and said to myself I sound like some crazy person making shit up. There's more I could've told but I feel like I will never tell anyone other details I have ""locked away"". I don't know if I will come back to this."

793,My brain melted,"Not sure if this is the right sub so sorry if not but  I had a really bad concussion 5 days ago. I’m a heavy drinker which Ive since stopped. Anyway smoked a few joints with a friend yesterday (3-4 days post concussion). Was fine and actually felt better until a few hours after then I started getting a splitting headache that grew to encompass the left half of my brain and felt like it was melting. Then I lost control of my left eyelid and then eventually the left half of my face went numb, bar from my lips which felt like they were on fire. Since the left half of my body has been a bit numb. Anyone have any ideas why this happened?"
794,"A friend of mine wrote about her experience recovering from ECT, and asked me to share it to Reddit.","A friend of mine has asked me to share this to Reddit as she doesn't have an account, and would like to remain completely anonymous. 

I have not changed the formatting out of respect, as this is how she sent it to me. 

Below is her writing about her experience with recovering from ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) and the impacts it had on her life.

This was written after her most recent experience.

Welcome back. Savour the sound of crickets and become absorbed by the stillness of midday. Sunlight hits the white of the paper, creating a startlingly bright canvas for the unfolding of a strange and disquieting tale. Tell me if you can, how many times can a person be born? If your answer was once, that would be a reasonable conclusion to draw. As we grow and change into the people we become, we collect experiences and file them away. Inside us there exists a catalogue of experiences that dictate and influence our responses and beliefs. There is a communication that occurs between the external world and the inner identity we have constructed across a lifetime. Without that communication what we are would cease to be because we are the sum of our experiences at a core level. What if that person on the most intimate level becomes interrupted? Fractured even? Have you ever looked into a mirror and in all sincerity responded with the question ""who is that?"" There exists a sense of unsafety and racing pulse a palatable discomfort in one's own skin. If so perhaps you have become fractured. When something severe happens it ultimately disturbs a person. There are a number of tragic experiences that can result in a fractured state of being. Someone that can never entirely become recovered. The world can leave an inner self in a proverbial corner, tape across the mouth stunned into silence. A quiet nod to you if you also are aqquainted with this silence. My inner person has been held for ransom on multiple occasions. In the beginning I was aware of myself, and my physical body. Two entities facing an unpredictable world when the unimaginable overwhelmed us and the fracture began. To survive we construct other ""self's"". Unable to identify the voice of the first, concentration and energy is utilized on the development of a new person. A new person with a little less curiosity and slightly elevated levels of caution for the outside world is formed. For the outside world is uncompromising and requires constant adaption. To illustrate there is the sound of hustle and bustle outside my room. This room is certainly not home like nor does it suggest itself to be. It is a hospital room and personally, it is the place where my every fear comes to congregate. There is shuffling footsteps in the halls and iridescent lighting. The misery and anticipation is thick and palatable in the air, I try not to be swept up in it. outside the breeze is cool the bushes are home to misplaced possums and lizards the sounds of traffic often interrupting the silence. I notice I can't swallow there is a lump in my throat too large and an ache in the depths of my gut beckoning me to go in search of a cigarette despite having given up. In this place there is no thought of restraint, or is abstinence applauded. This is a place of acute turmoil a last stop for survival and a resting place for broken dreams. Optimism here seems delusional and people would sell their very soul in exchange for some relief. I'm summoned into the treatment room and brace myself in disbelief for what is about to unfold. I lie down on a starched white rigid bed as if readying myself for an execution which in some ways is not entirely innacurate. For me, a further fraction is about to take place another split in the self. A recalibration, rewiring and resetting is occuring, and I feel reborn into the world to start from scratch. Through induced seizure I am reformed and prepared for release. But as a patchy canvas I have lost context texture and storage. like a wiped computer I am ready to be reloaded and filled, but never with exactly the same content. I am alone but surrounded by glitching data some times during the neural shuffle, memories are brought forward to re experience. I feel I have lived a strange life with merging identities that together create the sum of a fully formed person. A hub of colorful fear and dysfunction full of secrets. Inbuilt is a permanent caution toward the world which only the fractured will ever have to know. "
795,I'm so tired of my father.,"He had an extremely difficult upbringing with his mom getting severe Parkinson's disease and paralyzed when he was 15. His dad became a depressed alcoholic, I think he was sexually abused as well when he was very young by his aunt... 

We grew up in complete and constant terror throughout my childhood, I realized later in adulthood that he had a wide range of mental disorders which manifested in rage, constant anger, paranoia and the list keeps going. 

My childhood was full of severe emotional abuse, constant stress and fear. 

Later in life when I was 22 just graduated from college he got lung cancer (he chimney smoked for decades, quit five years before he got cancer) anyways, god decided not to take him yet, but make him handicapped (ataxia) now, 11 years later, he's still alive, 10× more abusive, 10x more manipulative.

I've realized now, that I was conditioned to be completely obedient and do whatever he says. He had controlled my entire life, and had sabotaged every single attempt I made at achieving independence and making a life for myself. He ruined my career with his cunning manipulation, ruined my emotional life and relationships with women. Interfered in every corner of my life.

If it weren't for my mother, his fulltime caregiver I don't know what I would do... he abuses her constantly and she literally collects his piss whenever he needs to go for the last 10 years.

I'm so damn tired of this, so tired of living because of him.

You hear stories of good people getting cancer and dying soon after, devastating everyone around them. But you never hear of people who's illness exacerbates everything that is evil and destructive about them and ruines the life of everyone around them intentionally and they just wouldn't die, for 11 years, to have the most aggressive form of lung cancer, and to survive it solely for the purpose of destroying everyone around you. 

I don't understand, why? Why is this happening? It is like a horrible hurricane that comes, but doesn't go away, just stays for decades hammering you and swallowing every minute of life and happiness from your soul. I just don't understand why this is happening. I'm so tired."
796,I am Lonely,"So I have struggled with suicidal tendencies for 10 years(I’m 18)and I still struggle with them,just last night I tried to commit suicide again.I feel alone,every day I wake up feeling empty and emotionally cold,I have tried to socialize but my main language is Englishs where as in where I live it’s spanish,it makes it extremely hard for me to make friends and get to know people and honestly sometimes i just get segregated from my groups all together,I have done everything for my group of friends and school groups but all of them see me as a freak cuz I’m different,it’s been like that my whole life,the few friends I do have never even talk to me and when they do it’s only if they need/want something from me.This has always gotten under my nerves but since I don’t have any other friends or social circles it makes it hard for me.Sometimes I just feel like I’m cursed to be alone all together,the only actual friends I’ve had have been long distance(I live in Puerto Rico for more Context,everyone speaks Spanish),from Florida to Oregon it’s just frustrating and lonely every day for me."
797,My first appointment,"I don't know when my first appointment is going to be with one of the six clinicians I picked out from the list but whoever its gonna be, I'm nervous to meet. My first therapist worked with me but we didn't click. If I didn't talk she'd stare at me the rest of the hour and gave me some bogus coping mechanism to help with anxiety that didn't even work. It wasn't breathing exercises or counting. Nope. It was imagining a snowball of problems rolling down a hill and as it got closer it disappeared. Not good? Thought so. She didn't get me comfortable or anything. Will one of the other ladies do this as well? Will they be too critical of me? Will they judge me based on the jokes I make or how I dress?"
798,How can I establish firm boundaries with my brother who literally searches for things to complain about?,"I know not to take him seriously.


He approached me a bit ago and ‘jokingly’ said he’s had a bad day and he wants to fight, got 1-2 feet from my face, so I rolled my eyes and told him to back up. He tugged my hair, beard, and nipple cuz my shirt was off. I was like:

Uhh... stop?!

 &gt; Oh don’t be a douchebag!

I know that he searches for things to complain about. I’m not intimidated by him. 

Currently saving, but probably going to need to save for months. 

He claimed he’s ‘renting to own the house and it’s his house’. I told him I know people who’ve known the landlord for years and said landlord doesn’t sell the houses, so he’s literally making shit up.

What can I do while I’m saving? A few months back he got upset because I left a styrofoam cup out... okay Mr. Angry."
799,Give me ideas to better myself!,"So I went from being extremely outgoing, carefree and motivated to the complete opposite. Past 2 years I can barely remember because I sat in my house all day and it was just a cycle. I have been depressed but more anxiety than anything I find it really hard to talk to new people and always think of the worst scenarios and I try to remind myself thoughts are just thoughts but its easier said than done. Ive tried getting back on track a few times by exercising etc but Ive never stuck to it but on and off this month I have got some motivation to improve myself. Ive started exercising and going for walks and im gonna try to start reading and be off my phone more everyday. If anyone has anything they do themselves to lift themselves up or to just have fun please let me know so I can try it, im trying to be productive as i can and find new hobbies! Im also thinking of learning piano but I have no coordination at all so if anyone plays let me know if i have a chance lol

While im here i just want to say if anyone needs a friend or someone to talk to im here! I can actually give some good advice for someone who doesnt listen to their own advice lol. Appreciate it if u leave a comment :)"
800,Does this mean anything bad?,"Basically, recently I’ve been having an issue.... everything feels boring, and I never want to talk to anyone, I just want to shut myself off from everyone and everything... my friends, my family, and my girlfriend, I know they care about me... but I still feel so lonely, and I’m scared.. I don’t know what to do, who to talk to, and I’m worried I might hurt someone on accident..."
801,nothing can help me,"i have ptsd/cptsd from being abused since birth until i turned 14 and was taken into cps custody (almost a year ago) 
i recently lied to my friends (not with ill intent) because i was scared and i hurt everyone deeply. im slipping back into old habits but worse so badly. i think ive gotten all the medical help that i can, and im as healed as ill ever be.
sick of this."
802,20M am I the only one who feels this way?,[deleted]
803,I can feel myself going down a bad path and I need help.,"I (18F) have not been doing well recently. I've always struggled with anxiety, depression, and dissociation disorder, but I have never felt this low before. I am not even sad, I'm just numb. Like truly numb and emotionless, no matter what. I've also started using unhealthy coping mechanisms. I smoke weed multiple times a day because I rely on it to not feel empty and as pathetic as I do sober. On multiple occasions per week I have also taken other drugs and I know its bad but I don't want to stop yet. I'm not addicted but I fear I wont be able to be sober again, even though it's mostly just weed that I'm ever -not sober- with. I think that the weed also makes me dissociate more which is another coping mechanism of mine I guess. I am going to one of the top 5 public universities in the country in the fall and I know I need to pull myself together to stick with my bright future. I have so much ahead of me but I really just don't care anymore. I am writing this because I know it's bad that I don't care and the first step is to ask for help."
804,Everyone hates me and I don't care,"I act as someone different in public, and I realized a lot of people do. They don't realize it. That's when I decided to step out and stop being shy, and that's when I realized that no one liked me. Not only did no one like me, everyone hated me. I think this applies to a lot of shy people.

My thing is just to ignore it and stop worrying about it. It doesn't matter if everyone hates me. It's better to cry because I know it's a challenge, kinda've like climbing a mountain. Or doing a workout. And I'm fine with it."
805,Sick and tired of everything,[deleted]
806,"I’d do anything for a stable adult figure in my life, is what I’ve done wrong?","(Question at the bottom, this just provides context)

I’m fifteen, I live with both of my parents and everything is so wrong. It’s not right to say they’re bad parents, because I couldn’t do that to them. They call me names, they’ve physically fought with me, they shout, they argue with eachother, but most importantly they’re hard to talk to about anything with. Despite being lucky enough to be blessed with having both my parents, it feels like I may as well have none. 

The only time I feel like they cared is when I was sick, I had a really bad case of pneumonia and it was the only time I ever felt like they cared at all about me. 

So I tried to get ill again. 

It sounds so horrible looking back at it, and I wish I didn’t. I had the mindset of “if I get ill they’ll notice again” and part of me still thinks that way. I’m disgusted with the mindset and I’m trying to get past it. 

I’ve done so many stupid things in pursuit of one of these good adult figures in my life, like actually message older people who aren’t my parents to try get some kind of relationship. Nearly all of which have turned out to be *bad* people and try coerce me to do *stuff*. I was really naive looking back at it and I’m glad I caught myself before I did anything I’d regret forever. 

I can’t put into words how badly I just wanted someone to talk to, someone who was just mature and  older, is it weird? I didn’t want *that* kind of relationship or anything weird, just an adult figure in my life I could rely on. I dunno, maybe I’m just attention seeking and there’s nothing more too it. It just makes me sad when I see all of my friends with their families.

I’ve become close with some teachers, I wouldn’t tell them anything like this though. Just have a laugh with them. That’s the extent of good adult relationships I have.

TLDR; Is attention seeking wrong and is wanting a healthy (platonic) relationship with someone older than you wrong?"
807,How do you feel satisfied with yourself?,"I just. Don’t. I’m running out of things for me to do.

809,I can’t shake the feeling that nothing is really worth it,"I can’t bring myself to do anything other than lay in bed and eat all day. I am transgender and this makes me feel like even if I get all the resources and surgeries I need, I will still not be satisfied because I was not born correctly. I can no longer enjoy any of the things I used to love doing because they all require me to speak, I can’t even enjoy tv shows or anything because I end up getting jealous of the characters. 
I have been living like this for at least a year and cannot see myself coming out of it any time soon. I always say I can’t take a single second longer but I always do because there is no other choice. I am not suicidal, but I feel like I will soon become suicidal if my life continues like this. I cannot see a therapist because of the pandemic. I truly do not have any hope for my future"

&amp;#x200B;

I thought this has only been for the last couple of years but the more and more I've thought about it I actually cant remember when it started. I always got made fun of in middle school. Just everyday. For being poor, how I dressed, for how I acted( My grandma raised me and kinda sheltered me cause she was terrified of the outside world pretty much). Made a few friends in High School and somehow even had a girlfriend for 4 years. She didnt really know me when we started dating and i really dont think she would have if she had gotten to know me first. Still got made fun of but it was more tolerable when I had people who actually seemed like they cared for me. 

Growing up I was always told by my family and teachers how I was really smart and was gonna go somewhere in life. Don't think I let that get to my head but I might have. Passed every grade with A's and B's. Graduated with a scholarship to a local college near my town. Had pell grant too so I was getting a lot of money back every semester because my scholarship nearly paid for everything. Could have literally bought land and small home or trailer with how much i would have gotten back by the end of  my college. And a degree I might could get a decent job at and work my way up. 

When I started college was about halfway or more through my relationship with my gf. I really think this is when things started to go downhill. I started making mistakes left and right. I wrecked my gf's car when she didn't know i was driving it. I offered to change the title of my car over into her name but she said she didnt want me to. We were staying at her parents at the time. We had to move out because of  me so we got a trailer. I didnt have a job for a while deciding to not save my pell grant money and instead use it to live while I went to college. Ended up spending most of it on junk. Missed paying bills constantly. Started struggling in college and started to not go more and more frequently. A friend who had been living in a bad situation started living with us. My idea. Thought I was being a nice guy. Made bad decision after bad decision. Dude has people over at my house constantly and my gf seems like she's flirting with all of them and him everyday. Weird shit starts happening. She ends up getting pregnant and wants an abortion instantly. I tell her no please we can do this. But I def obviously didn't know how to be an adult so no i didn't have that. She ended up leaving and going back to her parents and would occasionally come by to fuck until eventually she started dating someone and told me she was only coming by cause she was desperate for sex. Dude stayed for about a month or two longer and kept promising to get a job while I got one and worked on trying to pay my bills and fix shit so I could get her back. He eventually dipped when he got a girlfriend and got a job so he could live with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I say I tried to fix shit but I was so depressed and lonely (literal first time just being absolutely alone in life). I started drinking heavily, took pills, etc. anything to drown out the feels. I still worked constantly through all the depression. Even tried to help other people with their problems. Was going to the hospital and checkups with  my ex so I could see what was going on with our child. Was in the operating room when he was born. Very premature. I tried to go up there to the hospital( a 2 and half hour drive there and same back) every weekend. I had started having paranoia towards the dude and my gf and our ""friends"" a couple months before the pregnancy had even been known about. After he was born I started hearing stuff from lots of different people about how the kid wasn't mine. People would laugh at me when they told me. The dude who I let live with me for free for months and who I was still trying to be friends with for some reason would smile and smirk in front of me when people would talk about the kid not being mine. Two people who he was good friends with told me how he bragged about fucking her. I was still trying to go see the kid who now lived with her at her parents house. But at this point I had no faith he was mine. They still wanted me to come over and watch him all the time though. Thinking back on it now, my ex had gotten a boyfriend as soon as she left the hospital. It tore me up, literally fucked me up seeing her with him every time I went over there. It was a guy she had worked with and literally everyone knew he was on some bad drugs. She started acting sketchy I guess trying to act out or something. I don't really know. But I think I was pretty much a glorified babysitter while she went out with him. Her parents didn't watch the kid alot. 

At this time I had basically let everything in my trailer go. Rent, water, power were months behind. My water had been cut off and there was a literal pile of shit in both of my toilets. Would try to get water from somewhere to flush the toilet but for the most part just didn't care.  I got kicked out and I had to start living at my grandma's old home by myself or with my dad who has always made me feel like a child just like I don't know anything at all. I was still working at the time and was actually paying the bills at my grandmas for a little while. My gf broke up with her boyfriend and sometimes I would stay the night at her parents to help watch the kid and she would let me fuck her. Let is a big word. She always seemed disinterested and would constantly tell me how her dad would kill me if he found out. Like it was a privilege getting to have sex with her. At this point I had no faith that the kid was mine but I still loved her and wanted to be with her which wasn't happening. We ended up getting in a fight and I left her parents and never went back over. Quit my job and stopped paying my bills. Started doing drugs with my dad(who has always seen me as a child and will not acknowledge me as a man). Everything I did in my dads eyes before I gave up like back in highschool and going to that college was a mistake. Doing drugs with my dad was a bad idea cause he could get a lot of different shit. Went down a long spiral that eventually ended up with me getting arrested. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even waiting the year and a half for my trial I just didn't care. I kept doing drugs and just being general trash. Stole from a lot of my family  so I could get spice, pills, just whatever. The drugs never helped though. Obviously. during this whole span of i think 3-4 years(Beginning mildly in my trailer after my gf had left and progressing to more intense levels as time went by), I suffered from constant panic attacks(Short breath, tight chest, feeling like everything was closing in on me, tingling feeling all over my body), extreme paranoia, anxiety and social anxiety. I didn't even think or worry about my trial until a month before hand. I wasn't clean when I went to trial and I got put on a drug screening program along with probation. But somehow my lawyer got it to where I wouldn't have to drug test until I was clean. I dont know how I didn't end up going to prison. But I got clean. Got a job met a roommate who I thought was pretty cool and we got a place together. Made a couple of friends at that job. Thought everything was going great. Lived with my roommate and his on and off gf for 4 years. Turns out he hated life just as much as I did. And took it out on me every time he got the chance calling me names, telling me I was a weird little man. All kinds of shit. He was an awful drunk. But I had nowhere else to go. All my problems started getting worse again and I started hating working. Lost all of my friends to paranoia and other bullshit. Had let some dude I felt sorry for live with us and of course he fucked me over as hard as he could too. I left that job and got a new one for six months left that job and got a new one and now I want to leave this job because of my paranoia and anxiety. I feel awful every time I step in the building I don't talk to people a whole lot now because I'm literally scared to trust anyone. When I do talk I can barely make a jumbled sentence before I just walk away. I get made fun of a lot now or else my mind tells me that I am. IDK. People stare at me and when I look at them they avert their eyes like they are scared to make eye contact. I think they literally think I'm a loaded gun and I might come firing the place up at any time. I don't even really trust the two friends I have. I actually believe they make fun of me a lot. 

 I think people see me as a bitch now that they can manipulate. And they can because I'm gullible and just want anyone to want to be around me. But when i'm around people I can't stop feeling anxious and paranoid. I only truly have any kind of happiness now when I'm alone. and I hate that more than anything. I just want someone to care about me. Genuinely. But I'm like a side piece in every interaction. My roommate now( I really don't know how to afford to live by myself) acts likes he's my best friend but at the same time acts like I'm mentally challenged and he's my special mentor. I don't see my family a lot now days and they don't ever contact me. I have 2 ""friend's"" who I can barely trust. And that's it. I'm miserable, lonely, anxious in every situation, paranoid, and I just feel dead inside. I cried a lot when this first started but it slowly stopped and now i just don't feel like crying either. I hate my life and constantly think about suicide as the only option that's really left. I'm 28 years old and I'm not gonna let this be the rest of my life. its been around 6-7 years now and this is just fucking insane. It's like everything about me is just fundamentally broken. I work and pay my bills so i can survive. But I'm literally like a child in a mans body. It's like unconsciously my mind tells me that everyone in the world whose considered an adult(be it younger or older than me) is a lot more mature and adult like than I am. I do adult shit everyday but I can't make myself feel like an adult. I barely feel like a human being. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all i can think of for now. There is a whole lot more but those are definitely some of the most major things I can think of. I'm sorry if things seem jumbled or incoherent. I've been awake for over a day now and haven't been able to sleep. I'm not looking for pity or for cries. I just want some actual good advice. 

Am I a man child? Some giant fucking baby who just cant grow up? Do I have a mental disorder? Autism or just mental illness? Am I a lost cause? Should I try and seek help(I have before but to know avail). 

One last thing I want to mention is that when my dad moved into my grandmas old house with me, he had went through almost the same identical situation. My step mom cheated on him with his ""best friend"". They had been together for about a decade and after she did that he just threw everything in his life away. Before he had worked all the time had cars constantly, boats, etc. was always buying and trading stuff. To this day he lives in shop that almost rotted and collapsed outside my grandma's. He refuses to work or to do anything at all to get back to a normal spot in society. He just doesn't care anymore. The only difference between us is that I went back and tried to at least partially fix my life. But I'm scared I could just mentally collapse and fuck everything up all over again. I can't end up like my dad. I have to either fix it now or just finally realize its time to give up on life. I won't be homeless again.

811,Misdiagnosis has ruined my life,"Doctors misdiagnosed my cancer and let it get worse. Now I have to take pills for the rest of my life and my vision is severely impaired. Also the medication they gave me because of the misdiagnosis covered my body with stretch marks.

Im very fuck pissed and depressed. They ruined my life. People say at least you're alive, but my doctors were shit and did bare minimum and because of it I'm disabled for life"

813,I’m being pressured to have another child.,"I am 27F and have struggled with Bipolar 2 for 10 years now. I have a 7yo daughter already. But now that I’m getting closer to 30, my husband and in-laws are pressuring me to have another child to try for a boy, because “our last name dies with” my husband. I gave him a free pass to leave if he wanted a divorce to find someone who wanted more kids, but he declined. But he is still pressuring me. 

My postpartum depression was unbearable, I’ve been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts in the last 3 years, and struggle daily with my mental health. Not to mention the plethora of medications. 

I don’t want another baby. I can’t handle it mentally or physically. But no one seems to see that or even take it into account everything that I have struggled with. I don’t know what to do, I just want to end the guilt trips and feeling shitty."
814,I don't think therapy will ever work for me,"Here's a little background: turned 24 years old last week and have been dealing with what I believe is depression and anxiety for half of my life (I think I've been diagnosed with depression once but I'll explain). 

I don't think therapy will ever work for me, and at this point I really wish it would because I'm in need of support. But that isn't the point; I want to explain why I think therapy won't work for me and have anyone else's input or advice. 

Long story short, when I was 17, my older sister found out that I was cutting myself and forced my dad to take me to see someone. 
This was the first time I saw a psychologist. I did the initial session of getting to know each other. I liked her, and I was relieved to have someone to talk to. I looked forward to our next session in two weeks. That session finally comes, and as soon as I sit in her office, she tells me that I would be better off in group therapy. For the sake of keeping this post as short as possible, I won't list the reasons why I believed I would not benefit from group therapy without any one-on-one beforehand. She doesn't listen -- she gets my dad and the group therapist involved while I'm standing in the hallway trying to leave. Eventually my dad says he won't force me to do group therapy and we leave. I don't attend group therapy and never see that therapist again. 

Now, the second person I saw was a psychiatrist. It was only a couple weeks after seeing the therapist. I tell the psychiatrist the issues I was having; I put a lot of emphasis on my anxiety because I was struggling to leave my house without vomiting or being unable to speak to strangers. She told me she believed I was depressed and wanted to prescribe anti-depressants. However, the type she wanted to prescribe worsened anxiety but prevented weight gain. I never mentioned issues with my weight, and I stressed how upset I was over my anxiety, so I was confused and sad that she didn't seem to listen to me. I decided against taking the medication because I was scared about the side effects, and I never saw the psychitrist again. 

Lastly, when I was an adult, I decided to try an online service. I filled out questionares and applications for all the reccomended online therapy sites, and each one sent an email back saying I was not the proper candidate for them. 

I have no idea what's wrong with me. I feel like I'm too much even for people I'd pay to listen and help me. It's so hard finding a therapist, and while I think I really need help, I already know it wouldn't work because of my past experiences. I just feel very stuck and like I have no hope. 
Has anyone else ever been through this? Were you ever able to find a therapist? Or did you do other self care type stuff to make yourself feel better? Any advice would be nice. Thank-you."
815,I've dealt with depression before and got the help I need. Having a hard time managing to convince my friend to do the same for her.,"I have a friend who deals with depression and even talked about being suicidal before. I am also depressed, but I started seeing a therapist not that long ago and I feel like I am already starting to get better just by having someone to talk to. 

The thing is that I have been trying to convince my friend to ask her parents to get her a therapist too (we're both teenagers so we need parents permission...) to start visiting a therapist but she has either told me she might or just ignored my advice. I don't know what else to do...

I know it is hard, I went through it too, but I hate the fact that she won't be willing to even try.

Any advice about what else I can do for a friend struggling with depression?"

817,I hallucinated?!,"18F. Pretty severe anxiety. I’m on 10mg lexapro and 150mg welbutrin and take 0.5-1mg Ativan and 50mg trazedone as needed. This week I’ve been getting many panic attacks and have basically been confined to my bed most of the time trying not to cry or trying to distract myself.

The medications, idk which one of them or if it’s both, they’ve been me wake up during the night for a while. This has never happened to me in the past before the meds. I’m a very deep sleeper. But I wake up totally naturally at like 3am every night and then again at 5am, 7am, etc. It seems to get much worse before my period, which is coming up in a few days.

Last night was extremely scary. The night before I had seen this black translucent cat walking around my room, exactly like a cat. The tail was curling, etc. I thought maybe it could be like a ghost or something even though I don’t necessarily believe in them? But tonight was so much worse. I was 100% awake, not dreaming at all, not half asleep. I was awake for one to two hours and the same cat was walking around my bed, curling it’s tail, jumping, lying down, and the scariest thing was when it looked me in the eyes. The eyes were glowing when it opened its eyes and I felt truly frightened to my core, like my heart was sinking. I just kept on turning away and trying to fall back to sleep and ignore it. When I put my hand out, it went through but the cat was still there. This wasn’t going on for like 15 mins. It was going on for a long time.

It’s so freaking creepy. I obviously know this wasn’t real, I’m not detached from reality or anything. This has made me even more anxious and scared it’s something serious. I’m worried maybe it’s the medications but I’ve been on them for a few months and this has never happened. This has never happened in my life. Could this happen from anxiety? Could it possibly be something paranormal? Could there be some medical condition going on? What should I do? Has this happened to anyone else?"

819,All I want to do everyday is lie in bed and cry or just stare at a screen.,"This isn’t me being lazy this is just me trying so hard to stay afloat. Nobody seems to get this though, everyone always saying to “smile” and “hangout with people” “go on walks” “have a shower itll make you feel better”."
820,I don’t know what is wrong with me,"Tw: self-harm

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 3 years ago my mental health started getting really poor, I cried a lot and felt really alone even though I had a lot of friends. I started cutting myself, and I’m not going to lie, I feel like at first I wanted people to see it, I thought a lot about people seeing it and I had these conversations in my head where I talked about my problems and cried, or thought about what would happen If I killed myself, as If I would be here to see it. I think it’s also important to say that everytime someone was close to finding out I would freak out and hide it. Then people actually started to find out, I hated that feeling, It made my mental health worse. But it made me stop for a while. I started to get really scared of people finding out about it so I stopped doing it. It’s not like I was better. At the same time It wasn’t regular, sometimes I felt really good, like I was never bad to begin with and wondered If I actually was sick or if I was just pretending (i feel like that a lot) and other times I was so bad that I felt like I had been like that forever, and that I could not escape from myself. I don’t understand my brain, I’m having a really hard time trying to wrote this because it feels fake, it always feels so confusing, like my brain is trying to hide stuff from me if that makes sense. Now I don’t cut myself regularly, but sometimes I have a huge urge to do it, and sometimes I scratch myself really hard on my wrists, it calms me when I’m freaking out. I also think too much about stuff and idealize life a lot and it is starting to ruin my perception of reality because I have too high expectations. And to know that my future will be exactly like the present, makes me feel really awful. I am obsessive, i have a lot of anxiety, and I worry a lot about what other people think of me, to the point of changing myself so I can please people. I don’t know if it is possible to have traumas without knowing but I feel like I have some because I don’t remember most of my childhood and I think that it might be related to these behaviors idk. i feel like I have lost myself and I can’t even be genuine when I’m all alone. 
Right now I feel numb, and I have been feeling like this for a while, I really want to cry so I put sad music and force myself to be sad with thoughts that I know will make me cry. 
Lastly even when I’m apparently okay, if anyone asks me if I am okay, or says that I look down I want to start to cry and start to really feel down. 
I want to know what I have but I can’t tell my parents, they think I’m perfect and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with me and I just can’t ruin that for them. But I can’t live like this. I need to know what’s wrong with me, and I’m really scared of not having anything because that just means that I will feel like this forever and there’s nothing I can do about it. 
Sometimes I just want it to stop, just want peace and to not exist at all. 
I know this is all over the place. I probably said too many things. I know I can’t solve my problems online but I’m really tired and just need to speak about it I guess and I just found reddit and I am trying to understand myself better."
821,Therapy/counselling concerns,"I'm considering seeking professional mental health support which is way overdue but I'm still really hesitant. The main issue is that I'm not as comfortable opening up to a stranger as I am with people I already know/trust, but I also don't want to use friends as free therapy or burden them with emotional labour they may not always have the capacity for.

I've tried therapy before and I just find it really awkward and I'm not good at articulating my thoughts/feelings/problems when I'm feeling awkward. For some reason, I also feel like I'm being judged even though I know it's their job not to judge, and I worry that they'll give bad advice which will make it a waste of time and money.

Is there a way to overcome the awkwardness of opening up to a stranger and are clients obligated to always take the advice given to them?"

My mum and brother arguing tonight again. I keep posting hoping his OCD will just go away lol but it won’t. We all know it won’t. Tonight was bad. My mum started crying (again) but she started saying how all she wants at this point is for us (her kids) to send her to a home. She doesn’t care what drugs they have her on she doesn’t care if she hates it she just wants ANYTHING else but this life.

826,I’m setting a date for my suicide,"Today I decided on July 18th I’m going to kill myself. That marks one year since my girlfriend and I broke up. And this past year has been by far the worst of my life. 

She’s my best friend, and even after we were no longer together we still were. We’d talk all the time, still say we love each other (in a more platonic way) and although I struggled with mental health and have for a long time, I could live with it bc I still had her as my friend. But 6 months ago she got a boyfriend, and obviously that changes a lot of things, and although the change was extremely gradual, now we barely communicate at all. I see her once every couple months, and I can’t live like this anymore. Since we’ve broken up I’ve been with other girls, even in a semi serious relationship, but nothing lasts. I don’t even want to get back with her nearly as much as I just want her in my life as a friend. I’ve tried telling her this, but she says that she needs to commit to her boyfriend and can’t be saying she loves me or talking as much to me (as an ex bf) and although I understand and am not angry or upset with her, I can’t handle it. She’s the only person I can be myself around. 
 
I’ve tried therapy, I’m on anti depressants, but I just want out. I’m tired of being a burden. I look and reflect on the way I affect people’s lives and I honestly think that no one will be too hurt without me: the good of my suicide out weighs the bad. 

The only thing I’m not sure on is I want to make sure I don’t hurt her too much, as I feel like although we’re more distant she would still blame herself for it and especially with it being on the anniversary of us breaking up would blame herself. I want to figure out a way to see her in person one last time and tell her it’s not her fault without saying what I’m going to do. Idk"
827,Another poem I wrote a few years ago.. still feels like this honestly,"Isn't it funny how no one actually gives a shit?

You give them love, support, and everything that you never get

I'll never understand how people can just watch someone suffering and act like it's okay

You'll never even start to think to ask about my day

Feed into it and forget it's even there

You won't even try on the deepest, darkest dare 

I give you the greatest hints and the best clues

But you just say I'm only having the blues

I say it straight out in front of you

Exactly what I'm going through

Yet you still won't do shit

Not even a little bit

You could care less

Ignoring is what you do god damn best"
828,How do you say sorry,"I hate apologising, not because I don't like apologising, or don't want to (I want to apologise after most things I do) but I always overthink my apologies, and then worry that they come out sounding rehearsed, unnatural and forced. Or I feel like I took too long to come up with the apology and that the time has passed and I missed it and fucked everything up."
829,Laughing and crying,"I don't know how to say this but for a long time I almost feel like I had issues with how I see my face and body when I am expressing. It got so bad that I stopped or tried hard to reduce talking and physically emoting if I thought people could hear or see me...

I was beaten badly as a kid by me father and it's only now I realized that the behaviours that I adopted to deal with the abuse are the same things I do now even though the abuse has stopped... The behaviours include going into shock mode in myself and being mute so that I don't have to deal with the emotions I couldn't deal with.

Unfortunately these behaviors have gotten in the way of me living a decent life...I feel like I live my whole life in this date of heightened stress that I can't talk or even laugh...I think I've forgotten how to talk and laugh naturally... I think because laughing and crying are similar overlapping experiences on the physiological level that im scared if I laugh that it'll open the flood gates to crying to and put my in a PTSD state where I was abused as a kid...and it's like I'm scared of the intensity of my sad feelings that I've held down for so long...but I got to laugh or I feel like at the very least I have to give up my resistance to it and try to enjoy life.

My neighbor all think I'm weird because I constantly hear them remarking about how tight faced I appear and how they never hear me laughing or yelling when I'm indoors...I'm the village freak but I would like to learn to cry and laugh more as a way to come back to myself...

I feel like i can't maintain eye contact properly because i find things to be distracted about all the time. Sometimes i stop someone mid sentence just to say something that that has nothing to do with the conversation.

Another thing is i need something to play in the background or my attention to be divided into 2 places for me to be able to function. Otherwise something feels wrong and i start getting restless.

Im also very forgetful and lose just about everything i touch and have to place my things in very specific places to remember where they are. Sometimes I'd ask something, get an answer, and ask it again a couple minutes later like it never happened.

It took me about 40 mins to write this because, ironically i got distracted by my friends talking on hangouts. It's getting to my nerves"
833,What kind of depression is this?,"I have different types of depression moods and today’s flavor is one of the worst. I feel very creative and energized, but irritated and over sensitive at the same time. I am excited to do some art, but fuck it up and have to resist the urge to throw it across the room. I try to relax, but I’m super fidgety. I feel like I’m being pulled in multiple directions at once. I did some angry dancing trying to burn some of the feeling off.   
Does anyone else ever get like this?"
834,6 WEEKS SINCE I LAST SELF HARMED GUYS! I cooked and watched anime. Life is good :)🌈,"My own parents ignore my unhappiness and this quarantine made things difficult for me but I think I have found things to hang on to. The urge to relapse is strong but I will not give up I swear.

I love you guys...❤️ I'm so grateful that Reddit exists honestly. Take care of yourself, take it easy today. If someone wants advice, or want to talk about their problems or just how's life for you, please feel free to send me a message. &lt;3 Have a good day/night!

(Sorry for the people who had already seen my post on r/teenagers, people had been very respectful but some just wanted to make me feel guilty and I think I'm too fragile psychologically to continue reading this, I don't want to relapse. But the mental health sub has been my safe place for a long time so I wanted to say that I love you all 💕)

835,Psychotic,"I (23 M) feel as if I am on the verge of a psychotic break or something. I’m tired of everything. I am very introspective so usually when my emotions get the best of me I can realize it and not be so mad about it but now even when I know I’m over reacting I don’t care I just get more upset over the fact that I’m over reacting. Little shit will just cause me to mood swing. My GF (21 M) has been seeing it lately and I feel so bad about it after. Just now we went to the mall so I could buy a shirt before heading to my family dinner, I pointed one a few out and grabbed them and they were a style she said I should wear but after I grabbed a few she retracted the statement and said maybe not and I grabbed a different style and I pointed to the pants the mannequin with the same style of shirt was wearing and she recommended jeans.

 

Just a recommendation but it annoyed me and it’s like she didn’t believe in me or something. I took it too personal. She recommended my typical style and I went with it but then quickly realized I was no longer interested in being there with her so I asked if there was anywhere she wanted to go because I didn’t want to shop with her around, and when I went back by myself I quickly realized my confidence and/or interest must have been depleted because now I couldn’t care less and just wanted an outlet for my anger.

 

I knew I over reacted but that just made me more mad. I didn’t show it, but I’m so annoyed. Maybe I feel like she’s taken my masculinity or personal identity? Maybe I have resentment built up? Maybe a newly developed chemical imbalance? Whatever it is I just want to get away from everyone for no reason at times and even if there is a good reason this never used to be like me but I’m scared of this feeling like I’m about to flip and just ruin everything simply to make them see how I feel. I hate this. Feels like a break is coming but I know there’s something causing it.

Also this is a very small example, these things have been extremely frequent, some bigger and more reasonable, some less so."
836,i’m in a bad place. any words of encouragement would be appreciated,I don’t even have the energy to elaborate but I feel like I just fucked everything up.
837,I am completely unaware of my own emotions and never know how to deal with them other than ignore them,"I've had more than a few occasions were someone will look at me worried , or as if people actually know what I'm think and feel more than I do, 

Generally I just ignore them until it dissipates or I've worked my way through it somehow

Am I dense as fuck or emotionally retarded  

Days I know I feel like shit but don't really pay attention to it , then look in the mirror and actually look depressed as fuck.

I generally don't pay any attention to my emotions and ultimately never deal with them or know what to even do about them other than ignore them

I think I live in some sort of dissacociated state most of the time because I don't understand or recognise emotions to deal with them. For the most part things just eventually occur.

I'm definitely emotionally retarded how can I work on this ?"
838,I can't get through to my friend,"I'm trying to talk to my friend about intrusive thoughts and her self-esteem issues and it's just not working. We text often about her mental health, and have done for the past 2 years, and I've never been able to inch her out of her negative cycle of thinking.

Tonight she tells me that she doesn't believe her friends (our friend group included) like her, and just keep her around. I approach her with logic, saying ""The grass is green, the sun is round, someone with lots of friends is likable- it make sense"" just to paraphrase. And I figure she might accept that line of thinking, or that it might help her sort of compartmentalise a complex issue into something more simple. But, she turned it into an argument as she often does and defended her thinking and attacked me as an enemy. Like she claimed that's just how her brain worked and it'll take time, two things she knows I understand. So I reiterate that I'm only attacking her negative and intrusive thoughts, and she replies really short, just saying ""Okay"" when I try to go into detail about ways to combat negative thinking that have worked for me, and I know are medically sound because they're things I've discussed with my therapist.

I tell her then that she resists a lot of positivity, because I really think she does. I tell her to recognise when she has that thought, ""My brain doesn't work that way,"" and recognise its just the same as the positive thought shes resisting, and to just look at both objectively. Again, sound advice I think, but then she tells me ""So I can't think how I usually think?', again resisting my advice and turning a positive into a negative.

In the end I try to reitarate again I'm not attacking her, but it's just not getting through. Everything I put forward, is just deflecting off a brick wall.

I'm not a proffessional, but one of my favourite livestreamers killed himself last night and I've been frantic since then just trying to do something to help my friend. I don't want her to end up like Reckful."
839,Petition to get C-PTSD added to the DSM-5,"Hello everyone, I have contacted mods but haven't heard back. If this isn't allowed I understand and feel free to take it down.

[https://www.change.org/properdiagnosismeanspropertreatment](https://www.change.org/properdiagnosismeanspropertreatment)

 PTSD treats one time events of terror that leave lasting symptoms, and often PTSD treatments aren’t reliable for complex and prolonged terror such in years of neglect or abuse in childhood. I’m collecting signatures for the APA to add Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) to the DSM-5. C-PTSD is already recognized in the ICD and in other countries. This has been a long standing argument in the psychology community here in America, and other countries that use the DSM-5 for diagnosis. Many times researchers and doctors have come together to say this diagnosis is absolutely needed for treatment to those who have experienced long standing traumatic experiences but has been shut down by the APA.

The reason the APA claims they did not add C-PTSD is because 92% of people with C-PTSD could qualify for PTSD instead. Thats kind of like saying PTSD diagnosis isn’t needed either, because those who qualify for PTSD diagnosis would also qualify for an anxiety diagnosis, so we should just use anxiety instead. People with PTSD feel extreme anxiety, but it needs a specific diagnosis. People with C-PTSD have developed or altered their personalities in trauma and therefore have much deeper rooted and many triggers from prolonged terror. There is data to back up symptom differences in and PTSD and C-PTSD, as well as differences in what treatments work. There is some overlap to PTSD and C-PTSD in the ICD pages explaining both diagnosis, but there is overlap in a variety of different disorders and the ICD still found it needed to have C-PTSD as a separate diagnosis.

There is some thought that because the APA has accepted millions of dollars from drug companies, such as those who create medications for Borderline Personality Disorder, that it is actually politics behind the reasoning to not add C-PTSD to the DSM-5. Drug companies fear losing money from a C-PTSD diagnosis instead of a BPD diagnosis (as roughly 80% of BPD diagnosis have trauma histories) and C-PTSD is typically treated with trauma therapies instead of medications, other than minor stabilizing medications which are short term.

Misdiagnosis is a huge issue, if a patient has C-PTSD and has been incorrectly diagnosed with a variety of different disorders instead (anxiety, BPD, depression, reactive attachment, ect), or even are incorrectly diagnosed with just typical PTSD, an incorrect diagnosis equals mistreatment. It’s possible the patient doesn’t respond to typical PTSD treatments (say, EDMR therapy that works not as well in C-PTSD patients) and because of it the patient may feel untreatable, or broken, and opt for a medication cycle that continues having to be upped and changed to keep it’s positive effects. Or worse, they could develop an addiction. Or maybe stop all treatment all together. In severe cases, this hopelessness and brokenness feeling and lack of faith in care can lead to suicide attempts, some successful.   


With a proper C-PTSD diagnosis, insurance covers therapies that are for proper treatment, and proper treatment can be given. Our already victimized parts of the community who have suffered prolonged abuse, childhoods in cults and sex rings, severe neglect, and have been forced to develop or alter personalities in horror should not have to suffer to get the most basic mental health treatments.

A proper diagnosis means proper treatment. The community must band together to demand this where the APA will not listen to professionals and data alone. Please consider signing my petition.

840,"WHAT IS THIS: Random feeling during childhood of disgust, intense guilt that lasts for around 30 seconds, then leaves","PLEASE, tell me I’m not the only one on here who knows what this is and has experienced it pretty much their whole life. 

On TikTok today I came across a video (@avereyshmaverey) with this text: “Y’all know that feeling where you are with your family and you feel comfy and cozy but then suddenly you feel TOO comfy and then you feel icky and miserable and there’s dread in your chest”. I was mindlessly scrolling and vibing to the song she put on the vid when I comprehended the text and my mouth dropped wide open. I have never, in my life, been able to put this feelings into words. I’ve always wondered why it happened. It happened randomly throughout my whole life, and I felt it a couple years ago again but I’ve been dead inside from depression for years so I don’t feel much of anything. But I *remember* and *know* very vividly what it is. Here are some of the comments on the vid to explain it even more: 

“It feels like guilt and sickness” “Is it like when you’ve had a really good day at the beach and you’re all chilling in the house after you shower but before dinner?” “It’s like an intrusive thought but an intrusive feeling” “it feels like a violation even though nothing bad has happened to me”

I’ve learned as an adult we all experience pretty much the same things and aren’t alone, however, I thought I was alone on this. It used to bother me so bad as a kid I could tell when I was in a situation where it could come, and I’d think “not the feeling don’t feel the feeling please don’t feel the feeling”. AM I ALONE? I really need answers, this is bothering me very badly.

Edited to stress: it’s not simply anxiety, or something. It’s this intense wave of feeling you can almost physically feel that lasts for about 30 seconds, and after it’s gone it feels fine again, you just feel weird for experiencing it."
841,Been feeling bummed since hearing news about Reckful suicide,Mental health is very real and scary. The second biggest killer of anyone between ages 10-34 is suicide. Just reaching out to anyone. There is help available. If you put the work in you CAN get better. Do not isolate. Talk to someone. Stay safe everyone.
842,"I can't be happy, but not in the way you'd expect.","Whenever I'm happy or positive I become an annoying as hell, self centered, naive little shit. This is only amplified by me being happy, even when I'm neutral my jokes are crappy, my conversations are just me rambling about random shit that people don't care about, and everything that encompasses my personality is just me being annoying.

This explains why no one ever invites me to anything. I feel like the few times I've been invited to things was out of pity or because they had no one else to go with. The worst thing is that I love hanging out and talking with my friends, but I don't think anyone else enjoys my company. And when I'm happy I get annoying, and the cycle continues. I don't think I matter to anyone outside my mom, and that isn't saying much. I try to keep optimistic about how others see me, but its kind of faltering these days.

Thanks everyone!"
848,Anybody feel a similar way?,"TLDR: I don’t care about anything but I’m not sad and I don’t hate myself. Suicide seems rational but I can’t be bothered.


Let me preface this by saying that I don’t hate myself, I don’t think I’m ugly, I’m not sad over someone dying/not loving me back, I don’t think I’m a worthless piece of shit, etc etc etc.
I’m fine with my appearance, my abilities, who I am as a person. I hate saying this because I’ll always end up sounding like some edgy kid but I just really don’t care about anything. I’ve never had any real ambition, drive, motivation, or goal to pursue so I’ve always just gone with the flow or taken the path of least resistance. After high school I went to college because that’s what you do no? I applied for an engineering major because I show aptitude for science so sure, stem, let’s go.


Afterwards I went to graduate school. Why? It was that or work and I got my acceptance letter before I heard back from any of the job applications I sent out. That’s where I am now.
I’ve never had particularly strong feelings about anything, I’ve never felt any sort of real bond with other people. As a kid I think other people felt I was odd or distant so I was mostly ignored. I made friends in high school but it was one of those “this is a group of people I just spend time with” kind of things. I keep in touch with one friend from high school because we just meet up and catch up when I’m in town, otherwise we don’t speak.
I have one “close friend”, the only one I’ve ever had, that I’ve actively kept up with since undergrad. It’s primarily because of effort on their part although I do reciprocate. I think they find my being super accepting of other people (I don’t care enough to judge) and willingness to indulge other people’s interests comforting. I like them and I enjoy speaking to them but if they left, I’d be fine and get over it.


I’ve dated before “to see what happens”. I don’t think I ever even had any real romantic interest in them or anybody, so those things never lasted wrong. I was never upset about it. I haven’t bothered dating since after high school (it feels cruel on my part) and I haven’t been interested or felt drawn to anybody. I don’t understand what people mean when they say they “feel close” to someone.


As a kid I understood that my mindset isn’t typical. Suicide is something that’s always been at the back of my mind since middle school but it’s not some “I can’t deal with life, it hurts” kind of thing, it’s just “why not when I care so little”. There are times when I’ve felt down but I mostly just feel empty. I go through life robotically.

I’m not actively suicidal, there's so much work and research involved and I'll definitely have a reason to be if I fuck it up and I end up with a blown off jaw or paralyzed, but it feels like some sort of inevitability that’s always in the back of my mind. I exist just to exist, I’m already here so sure lets put some effort into things and not be a total waste of space, but why am I doing these things? They mean nothing to me.
I have hobbies to keep me my mind occupied, I crochet, I draw, I study, I’ll play video games. Do I enjoy them? I don’t know, I just like having something to do although sometimes I’m equally satisfied just laying in bed and staring at the ceiling.
Everything I’ve written up until now makes total sense to me.
Here’s when I’ll admit I start sounding off. I don’t think I was ever meant to exist. My mother was on the verge of dying giving birth to me. The only reason she didn’t is because some doctor that happened to drop by (they weren’t supposed to be there) that day knew what to do and was able to direct the other medical staff. I didn’t know this until I was an adult so it’s not like this was a catalyst for the way I think. It was more of an “oh that makes sense” moment, but that’s just confirmation bias no?
I don't think i'm a nihilist. I don’t think there’s real meaning to anything or a reason for anybody to exist but I think self-appointed meaning is just as valid as any sort of significance granted on a cosmic/spiritual level. I just don’t seem capable of giving that to myself."

However, during that time we discovered that we both had feelings for each other. We got together and were together for 15 days. That was last month. We broke up when she realized that she didn't have feelings anymore. And we've had a couple of talks about it but I just can't stop missing her. I don't get attached often and nor do I get feelings often, so when I grew to love her, it was a very strong and deep love. She is my main best friend, and we have another friend that we talk to and play with everyday. We've been a close-knit group, the three of us.

857,Has anyone experienced this emotional/physical state before?,"I’ll try to keep it brief. 

When I was a kid I remember feeling this intense, overwhelming fear usually around bedtime but sometimes during the day too. It would come on out of seemingly nowhere but it was an intense/disturbing fear as though something really bad was happening even though nothing had/was going to happen. 

It was almost always accompanied by a physical sensation and sometimes even visuals if I had my eyes closed. Not that this part is that relevant but, in the best way I can describe it, I’d feel as though I was expanding and contracting physically. My pupils would also start widening and shrinking rapidly, like big and then small and then big again within seconds and the light in the room would go dark and light along with it rapidly. I also used to get this visual distortion I called the “far away” thing where everything looked extremely small/far away while this feeling was happening. 

I sometimes get this now in adulthood and I have throughout my whole life when I’ve been overwhelmed by anxiety but it also happens at times randomly, but usually when I’ve had a lot of stress. It takes me immediately back to the same feeling I had as a child and the same fear comes over me. I have never heard of anyone else experiencing anything like this in the same way I’ve described. It’s so difficult to explain but if anyone’s got any idea what this sounds similar to it could give me some idea what could have caused this to start."

864,Tired of arguing on Reddit,"I usually love browsing reddit, to see new happenings about my interests, music and my job. However, recently, I feel as though I am being targeting by people just wanting to spew negativity at me. Twice today I've had people start an argument at me, and I only feel bad about it. I never want to start arguments, and I would never post something to start an argument. But why do people always seem to immediately become harsh? I might just be sensitive or something, but deep down its really bothering me. I can't stand arguments, I get so uncomfortable and immediately feel like I'm hurting people. 

Even last week with the troll this subreddit, he told me to kill myself and im still reminded of it every day when I deal with these people. God it is insanely annoying. 

Just to clarify, yes I do have severe OCD. Once an incident happens that slightly hurts me, it will not leave for an unreasonable amount of time. Please, if you have any advice dealing with these repetitive and obsessive thoughts, please let me know. I can't fucking sleep at night anymore. I'm considering deleting the app altogether, even though it is literally the only app I ever use.

Also, please feel free to browse my page to see what I'm talking about. It's mainly on the ShiptShoppers and Instacart subreddit (which I both work for, grocery delivery service if didn't know what it was). Am I being irrational or are my feelings justified??"
865,Frequent forgetting and reading troubles?,"First post on reddit so I'm not too familiar with how this really works but here it goes.

I've been pretty forgetful and have had trouble reading pretty much my whole life(M22), but recently its been been getting worse I guess. 

So I'll start with the forgetting. As far as forgetting little things like my wallet, keys, phone etc i feel like thats common for everyone. However I've had the issue of forgetting what I was doing at a certain moment or forgetting what my wife told me 2 seconds ago (or anyone for that matter) and/or completely losing my train of thought in the middle of talking. My wife seems to think im just using it as an excuse to not do things or be accountable, but I would forget my own ass if it weren't attached. This happens frequently throughout the day, on a normal day. It seems to get worse with stress and such. 

Now the reading part. I struggle a lot with reading, always have. Im a very slow reader and I have a hard time making sense of sentences or even short texts. Find myself rereading the same thing multiple times before it makes sense or just completely misunderstanding something and reading words that aren't there or seeing them as different words i guess is the best way to describe it. I also cant seem to focus for shit, often lost in thought or imagination. Took me 45 minutes to type this. I get made fun of a lot, even by the wifey. Makes me feel like a real ding dong but I can't help it.

The question is, is this something thats common or normal? If anyone has some insight or at least can relate. Not sure where to go from here."

I don’t really know how to begin with this and I’m so sorry if this upsets anyone or if it becomes a burden to read I just don’t know who to turn to anymore. Also this post is pretty long but please try to read the most you can, I’m so sorry.

I’ve dealt with a lot of things in the past four years, but this past year has become especially hard. I’m a girl who has always suffered in silence, I deal with my problems on my own so I don’t become a hassle to anyone and I do whatever it takes to please people and make them happy—even if that means discarding all my feelings or needs. I’m a pushover. I’m a people pleaser. I take things way too seriously, I can never take a joke. These traits of mine have gotten me into so much trouble that it haunts me day &amp; night. This past year I was sexually coerced and abused more times than I can count by my own boyfriend, I was in a horrible relationship with a him. He was absolutely horrible to me. And still continues to twist my mind even though we’ve been broken up for a while. Despite everything he’s done I’ve still kept him as a friend because I don’t know how to say no and let go. I still feel the need to help him, protect him, and make him happy. The trauma I carry with me has turned me into a shell of myself, I am bitter and cold. Defenses always on high and I treat my family like utter garbage when they’ve given me everything in life that I could’ve possibly asked for. I also know that I battle heavily with anxiety and depression, and even though I haven’t been officially/medically diagnosed with these &amp; it’s EXTREMELY horrible to self diagnose I know I have them. The signs are there. The anxiety attacks are there—they never go away. They’ve lingered with me for years. And I don’t know how to make it stop.

My parents aren’t big believers in mental illnesses. Every time I bring up the possibility of me getting help, or my anxiety they quickly shut me down with a simple “no, you don’t have that.” I haven’t been able to tell them about the sexual assaults, and frankly I never want to do so because I’d hate for them to see me in that way. I’ve tried to hint at my mom about it, to see if she’d notice. To see if she could realize that it was a cry for her help. She didn’t. I feel ashamed every day and I constantly blame myself for what happened. Even my ex, the one who hurt me, told me it was my fault. That I should’ve spoken out louder. I should’ve. Only two other people know, and my brother—who is my absolute guardian angel on Earth. And I still feel like my story and my feelings are invalid because people have gone through so much worse, I feel like I have no right to complain and feel this way all the time. I feel like the only way I can get help is by seeing a therapist. And this is where the problem truly comes in.

How do I go about telling my parents I’d like to see a therapist? Someone who can give me a diagnosis, help me, heal me, and get me through this without telling my parents the real reason why I’d like the see them? I was waiting until my annual checkup in a few months so I could tell my doctor, and see if they could convince my mom and help me find one. That checkup isn’t for another few months, and I don’t know what else to do or how else to approach this. Obviously with the pandemic my parents don’t let me leave the house at all, I doubt they’d let me see a therapist now. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve lost all hope. I don’t even know how to go about finding a therapist that is right for me, one who deals with what I need help with. I just want to know how to approach this is the best way possible. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this, any advice is appreciated. And sorry if any of this was triggering or upsetting or if I made anyone mad, I just feel completely alone. I need help before things get worse.

TL;DR: parents aren’t to keen on mental health and i’m afraid to tell them the real reason why i want to see a therapist after getting out of a toxic relationship. How do i go about looking for one that’s right for me?"

870,My 13yo sister just told me she hates her life and sometimes wants to die.,Depression runs in our family and I’ve understood that my sister has been particularly struggling lately. Our father passed away from suicide but we have yet to tell her because she is still too young. We know we will have to tell her eventually. Today she told me that she hates her life and sometimes wants to die. I don’t really know what to do and it’s all kind of difficult for me. I want to help. It’s also important to note that we are Latino so our culture isn’t always as forgiving or supportive of mental health. I’m studying to be a therapist myself but am early in my education. I know I should talk to my mom but I’m wondering if there’s any advice that could make this process easier for her. We’re located in the US.

She raised me and was a huge part of my childhood and even teens. I also feel guilty for not being there for my dad during this time. I should be there supporting them right now. There's no way I can travel in the foreseeable future and I'm having panic attacks every time my phone vibrates.

877,Opinion,"Hi everyone, 

I am not looking for a medical diagnosis I just want opinions on whether or not people think that I should speak to someone about this and/or if they are signs/symptoms related to a mental disorder (I’m thinking anxiety). 

I’ll explain how I have been feeling probably for the last year if not longer. 

I am constantly worked up and I usually can’t pin point what I am worked up about (sometimes I can). My partner notices (and so do I) that my heart is always beating so fast and I convince myself about once a week or more  that something bad is going to happen to me, my partner or my loved ones. 

I make scenarios up in my head and convince them that they’re real (i.e everyone hates me, people think I’m annoying, no one actually likes me they just pretend, etc.)

For example, as I sit here writing this - it is 12:33am. I have to be up at 5am but I can’t sleep because my heart is pounding since I am so anxious about what I am doing tomorrow (a fun weekend trip with friends). I am thinking that my friends, who have been together since Wednesday (I wasn’t since I had to work up until tonight) have been talking/gossiping about me and don’t really want me there. Although I don’t have any real reason to believe this. 

Does anyone think I should talk to someone? How would I go about this - what do you think could solve this issue I am having? I want to calm down and be happy and not worry so much."

881,Can someone help me with where I am at?,"I’ve been battling anxiety for about 4 years now. My life hasn’t been the same since. I started seeing a psychiatrist back in September after last summer I tried getting off my medication on my own (which was dumb) and I no longer was consistently not anxious. From September through February, I had got that consistency back. I have a good relationship with my doctor and I was making progress. However, since March, I feel things have really went downhill. The consistency is gone again. The majority of my days are fine, don’t get me wrong. But the routine and flow is not there. Two good weeks becomes an off week, or one off becomes an on. Now, this seems like a daily thing. My doctor thought maybe the quarantine was a factor, but I don’t believe it is. My anxiety is over my anxiety at this point. Last Saturday, he upped my dosage of Fluoxetine to 40mg. Haven’t noticed too much of a change yet, but I know it takes time. I’ve read books, I exercise, and I feel like I’m still in the same place. I’ve had days where I feel I’ve finally beaten it, and others where it’s just beginning again. I know the path to recovery is acceptance, my doctor says it all the time. Books I’m reading as well. Accept and not fight it. My symptoms now are a constant checking in to see how I feel. Uneasiness and rumination. Am I anxious now? What if this never ends? What if it gets worse? What if I become suicidal even though I’m not? My doctor assures me the dosage adjustment will help. But I’ve posted on here a few times and I feel like I keep repeating my story. I don’t know why i take the time to bother, I guess I’m looking for reassurance. My life is good. If I can figure this out, I’ll be golden. But I don’t know how."

I also feel like no one cares about me I get swept under the rug after I’m done being used I know my parents love me I think but it doesn’t feel like that sometimes, so here’s a few people that cause some of this stuff my sister 15 years old she’s one of the worst people I’ve met everything she does is for her own good and when she doesn’t get her way she cries about it and my parents give in she’s always making fun of me and my parents don’t care anymore they’ll give her a slap on the wrist and that’s it ( oh and my parents are divorced) and she goes and does it again. My dad is awesome I love him so much and I think he’s genuinely cares for me more then my sister but he’s pulled me and my siblings through some shit my mom she’s also awesome kind of I know the stuff she does is “ for the best” but it doesn’t feel like that she definitely cares more about my sister and me and my brother 12 years old are just kind of in the middle, my brother i love him so much I mean I would kill anyone if they laid a hand on him he acts like I don’t care for him and I can understand but I love him so much , and more on the way I feel I don’t cry I just get tense and want to punch something so hard that I break my fist but I can keep myself under control and that’s about it.

885,Never gone to therapy or a psychiatrist. I have questions.,So I’ve (25M) been thinking recently that it might be time to see a psychiatrist or something. I’ve had anxiety almost every day of my life. I always thought most people are like this. I’ve been irritable most of my adult life. The hours leading up to plans are me hoping someone will cancel or I will cancel.  After a recent conversation I found out it’s not typical. I’m wondering what the protocol is typically? I’ve always been too anxious/nervous to even look for one or let alone go to one. How much will this cost me (USA) typically? I’m in Los Angeles and am a 25M.

886,Problem processing events and flashbacks,"Hey, I’d love advice on something that has been troubling me for a while. It feels really hard to put into words but I’m going to try because it’s really getting to me. 

Basically my whole life I’ve had this issue where I don’t seem to process events that happen to me. I’ll just suppress it I guess. And then ill almost forget and flashbacks. Sometimes these flashbacks are really upsetting and I don’t know what to do about them. I’ll give 2 examples 

1. 5 years ago I went to a mental hospital. Of course I remember I went there, but I really don’t think about it very often especially any details. Sometimes I’ll be hit with this extremely overwhelming flashback of events that occurred there. They may not even be horrible. Something like I’ll picture the socks I was wearing 
These flashbacks are so vivid it’s almost like I’m there

2. This one is stranger to me because it wasn’t a bad time necessarily. I was living out of state and moved home with my parents due to covid. I’ll get flashbacks of being there with friends or work and it was only a couple months ago and feel like I forgot already. I get feel horrible nostalgic feeling come over me and just want to cry my eyes out

I have no clue what is happening, and it feels really odd because something I used to hate became something that I sexualize a lot (even though I sexualize it, it still hurts a lot). I even asked him to have sex with other women and record it for me, and the idea turns me on... What is going on?"

Keeping the AC off in 90 degree weather has been a big one. It's my way of slipping self harm in a form that my brain accepts and isn't super harmful.

I am thin and have body dismorphia about my general appearance but nothing to do with my weight I actually love the weight I am now and have an insecurity about being too skinny most of my life so I definitely don’t want to throw up to loose weight."

To begin, i’m at a stage in my life where I generally sleep later (i’m a junior in high school) but usually I make that up for sleeping in longer. Sometimes I get around 12 hrs of sleep, but usually it’s around 10. Problem is, i’m still tired when I wake up. Could this be a depression thing? I definitely feel depressed or low energy a lot of the time, but i’ve never been properly diagnosed since a stigma in my family was set up against mental illness. That’s been changing lately but I haven’t been jumping to get a therapist or diagnosed. Could it also be something like narcolepsy? Honestly I don’t know and I just wanted to see if anybody else experiences something similar to me and what they know abt it."

899,How do I overcome a serious victim complex/mentality?,"Apologies if this isnt the right sub to post it in, please let me know if there's somewhere more suitable to ask.

After months of fighting with a person who means the world to me, I have realized (or forced myself to come to terms with, because I think I've known this for quite a while) that I have a major victim complex. It ruined my last relationship and is well on its way to ruining my current one. 

I am constantly in the state of thought that the world is against my own success and happiness, and that those I am closest to do not have any love, compassion, or good feelings in general towards me at all. Often I feel as if it is a ""me against the world and everyone in it"" situation. When my loved ones sit down and talk to me and reassure me of my importance in their lives, it seems that the next day I find some reason that it isnt true, and convince myself they were lying. I always make myself the victim, even when I am well aware that I am in the wrong. I dont want to make excuses, but it may be related to extreme anxiety issues I've had since I was a child. (My anxiety has been another relationship ruining factor that I am currently seeking help for and will likely ask for advice on later)

If there are suggestions, books, advice, or even just kind words that can be offered about my problem, they would be appreciated. I do not want to be mentally unhealthy, mean, and toxic in this way anymore."

I don't have friends because I keep an emotional barrier. I acknowledge that I don't have the best image of people, it's often negative and I react coldly to people wanting to get to know me better. I do occasionally get into very short term relationships. Once I know it's getting serious though, I would start causing trouble (not by cheating) and it wasn't even a concious habit.

+If this post doesn't fit here please leave a comment!

It all started from last year. I was on the internet, I was visiting here and there. But then suddenly I witnessed something weird. So weird and creepy that made me almost cry. It was a video of me. Well, more sepcifically, a leaked [insert facepalm here] kind of video of me I took. My face was not on there but I immediately knew it was me. Yep. I was hacked. Without even knowing anything. And then my life has changed completely. I became extremely, EXTREMELY paranoid (mainly about cybersecurity stuff). And I mean REALLY paranoid. I started to doubt everything. I started making up weird irrational thoughts in my head to figure out what exactly caused this. I searched about all kinds of shits on google. THAT was nightmare. I was becoming more and more irrational and paranoid(and I am STILL quite paranoid. But I think it's becoming better) The thoughts I made up were so irrational that if I tell about them to other people they would ignore that. I didn't even watch Netflix. I didn't even take selfie or anything anymore.. well this is reasonable I guess. Now I don't even turn light on my room now(that is because I fear that there MIGHT be a sort of shady chip(I know. I know. Tech guys would laugh at me and I would laugh too.. Just if I were not this paranoid) on my lightbulb or whatever so I'd end up get hacked again. I use freaking candle at night now. And I use match to light them. Well some of you guys would say if you are that paranoid how tf you're on the interent. That's kinda right but hey, I'm telling you. All this is completely irrational and weird lol. I'm starting to doubt myself too. Like when I lock the door, I start to make up weird reasons in my head that the door wouldn't be properly locked(sorry, English is so difficult) even though it WOULD be properly locked. So I repeat the same thing several times just to literally convince myself about the fact that the goddamn door would be properly locked. I format my computer every day, and I factory resetted my phone over 50 times til now. I've spent 12 hours on that sort of stuff yesterday. Maybe it's just me being that kind of easily-being-paranoid person but I live like this anyway. I DO miss my old life when I didn't bothered with formatting computer for 12 hours a day.. but I just can't help with that. Anyway.. I think this is it. I just wanted to share my story.. Lol. I really hope you guys won't go through this nightmare."
906,Moving Shadows,"Hello, I’m not really sure how posting works or the formalities of it all, but I just wanted to put this out here and maybe get some advice. I’ve had this issue since middle school (although it was mild back then) where I see things in the dark that aren’t really there. I’ve seen shadow men standing in dark rooms, creatures following me down hallways, and sometimes weird specific figures. During the worst of it I believe I started hearing sounds that weren’t there either, and I genuinely believed them. I can recognize that these are not real outside of the moment, but I feel an overwhelming fear in dark areas that there is someone or something in there with me with the intent to hurt me.

It calmed down for several years, but it’s back and it’s starting to happen during the day too (meaning I see figures like this under daylight as well). People hiding in the backseat of my car and a face poking out of a supply closet are common ones. Just typing these descriptions are making me cry, and I have no understanding of what is going on. I was wondering if there was an obvious reason for any of this or if there was some way to help alleviate the fear. My parents won’t let me see is psychologist and I’m not sure what other options I have."
907,I'm extremely lost,"This year has been the shittest year for me yet!  

I'm doing okay at school (BUT I'M FAILING HIGHER LEVEL MATH HORRIBLY) However, I love math, but I've been trying so fucking hard. I'm getting nowhere (I'm burning out) I failed my maths exam and a math test last week, and I feel devastated, I have a super close bond with my math teacher who supports me a lot (he is my inspiration), and I think I've disappointed him as well. I used techniques that would help me study effectively, I always asked my teacher and my math tutor for help when I needed it, I'm still here, and I'm just a failure.

  
My parents want me to do medicine, something that I'm not capable of even though I do well in my other subjects. I want to be a math teacher and give others the support that I never really had. I want to be that teacher that I never had. I want to keep inspiring and motivating students for the rest of my life. I want to share my experiences with my future students and encourage them. I want to wake up every day and teach math until it pours out of my soul!  
 My parents keep leading me into subjects that are related to medicine, they want me to sit the UCAT test, and they keep getting annoyed when I bring up teaching. They keep telling me that I'm not worth it and that I'm just a disappointment. They keep comparing me to other smart ass people, and they are ashamed of telling their friends that I'm a teacher in the future. I'm just severely depressed for ages, and I also have anxiety, and I have been talking to a school counsellor. 

  
 I honestly don't know what to say to my parents. I want to be a secondary school maths teacher, and THAT'S FINAL. Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk and please give me advice. I NEED IT! :)"
908,Why can’t I feel sadness?,"For as long as I can remember I have felt different than those around me when it came to expressing/feeling sadness. Yet it never was something that was at the forefront of my mind until recently, when my grandmother passed away. She was the closest person I had and the person I loved the most yet when she died I felt next to nothing and it made me réalisé that I’ve never truly felt sad my entire life. I have a wide variety of emotions and I seem to be able to experience them normally with the exception of sadness, and I don’t understand why. I can empathize with others when it comes to most things unless it involves them being extremely upset and sad. I understand that they are upset and I want to comfort them, yet I don’t truly understand what they are going through. I don’t think that I fall into the spectrum of antisocial personality disorder as I can still empathize with others however, since I’ve never truly felt what it’s like to be sad I find it difficult to truly grasp the concept. came here to see if anyone else experiences life the way I do.

How do you deal with people on gaming, social media, internet in general, whatever, when they are saying stuff that's really hurtful?"
910,I'm too embarrassed to ask for mental health help.,I just want to be normal
911,What should I do?,"Hey there guys. Last week I went to see the doctor that I always gone to because lately I've been unable to sleep well (I keep waking up in the middle of the night and can't go back to bed), my neck feels super tight, my head hurts, I've not been able to focus on anything, I keep staring off into the distance, my BPM has been higher than usual (95 or above while doing absolutely nothing), I'm constantly on guard for no reason at all, I've been really short tempered, and I constantly feel stressed, anxious and sad about life for some reason. Even while doing basic daily things like brushing my teeth, I feel pissed off and rushed for no reason and want to get things done as quick as possible. I tried to play soft music to relax myself a bit but it doesn't help one bit. It's been like this for a week or so and it's really affected my quality of life. But my visit to the doctor's has been no help at all. My doctor asked me to do a blood test to see if there's any physical causes for these symptoms. I went to get my results yesterday and it was good, nothing unusual. So he said maybe it's a mental health problem, then I tried to told him I've been really stressed out lately and I feel quite annoyed for no reason at all again (I told him all the above while I was getting my blood test), and he said well all people have things to worry about and just sent me home. He told me to contact him if something was off. What should I do?"
912,Oral health causing depression,"I've gotten a lot of work done over the last two years and I'm feeling very stressed and depressed about it all. As of now,  I have 4 crowns, 1 bridge, 2-4 pending crowns, and possibly a gum graft. I haven't really felt okay orally for years and I understand that fixing my mouth will be good but thinking about how much work I've had done and will get done at my age(22) makes me want to break down. I really don't know what to do anymore. Any advice?"
913,My ramblings from 2am about everything I need to get off my chest (a little explicit and really long),"First off I would like to apologize for any typos, and anything that I said that may have sounded weird. I wrote this at 2am in notes, so it’s just a pile of things I needed to say to something. Thank you for your support if you decide to, and if not I don’t really care because I just thought that I might as well post it for some karma. Here it is.

. It all started when I was eight, I can remember it like it was yesterday. That was when I had my first depressive episode. I had some “friends” around my grandmother’s town house that I was hanging out with. We stopped in front of her house, and said our goodbyes before I headed in. I put in the code while mumbling the numbers to myself, and one of my friends asked me what I was saying. I stupidly responded with 9276 that’s the password, and without realizing what I had just said I walked inside and closed the garage door. A few minutes after I got inside, we heard the garage door open and close a few more times, and I realized what had just happened and told my uncle and grandmother. My uncle hurriedly went downstairs to scare off the kids, and I was locked in my room  for 2 hours after getting an earful about how the kids could have found the gun safe and about how we lost our privacy. I sat in that room stewing in thoughts about how useless and worthless I was for nearly killing a bunch of kids or possibly my family. I honestly wanted to jump out of the second story window in my room, but remembered that when my grandmother was teaching about fire safety that the drop was only 21 feet and that I would only break a leg at the most. That was the only thing that stood between me and willing death. My grandmother has always been somehow related to all of my worst episodes. In one more recent one, I was bored one Summer day, and decided to see whether hand sanitizer was flammable or not. Nothing was damaged luckily, and I threw the match out after cooling it off in the sink. I knew this was incredibly stupid, and I feel like it would have just been better to tell me not to do it again but my grandmother is a little crazy sometimes and I was young and didn’t really understand what I was doing. When my grandmother found it she yelled at me calling me a psychopath and saying that I would never become successful like that. That really struck a cord with my inferiority complex that I had developed by then, and I cried in the corner of my room telling myself that I should just die since I was such a danger to those around me. That I could end up possibly killing them from some psychopathic mishap, and that I thought I was just stealing from a society that only suffered because of my existence really made me just want to die right then and there. I know she really cares for me, and that everyone else in my family really does too. It is that fact that makes me stay alive the most. Because if I die I’m just causing more pain to others, which is the entire point of why I was depressed. I have shared so so many great memories with my grandmother, but when she misunderstands something or just gets angry in general she really stabs you where it hurts the most. I have this voice in my head that I like to call Brian as it’s an anagram for brain. To make this short Brian is the biggest asshole I’ve ever met. When I talk to people I always hear him screaming in my head that if I don’t please them that I will be abandoned, and that I will die homeless,cold,starving,alone, and diseased. It’s because of this constant screaming that I’m “useless,” “a burden,” and that I have to impress everyone makes me try to find ways to escape from it. Whether that’s playing games, reading a good book, talking to someone I’m close with, or just watching porn, it always ends up taking time out of things that are actually important like doing my homework, chores, learning how to drive, etc, and I always end up doing this until the early hours of the day or I don’t sleep at all. All of that stacks up over time, and my grades plummet, my hygiene gets bad, and my room gets messy. It’s so bad I end up neglecting everything else including my health. Then, my dad sees my grades and has another talk with me about my future and how depressed I’m making him. He tells me I make him want to commit suicide, and that pressure on top of being told to get perfect grades, and contribute to cleaning the house, and being a man, and learning how to be self sufficient, having my own father’s life hinged upon whether or not I can endure all of this pain and pull through, just stresses me out even more. I’ve gotten him to be better about cleaning by reporting him to my grandmother’s nice side, but if I hadn’t done that I would’ve been living in a cramped pig pen as well. More on my grandmother though, she is usually very kind, but once she gets stressed out she gets really argumentative and unwavering in her views. To make an example, one time I was having a hard time trying to connect to my history class to no avail. I had emailed my teacher back and forth and messaged my dad since he has a degree in computer science. My grades also weren’t in danger because I could still access the class work and homework. I told her about the situation, and she screamed at me saying that I wasn’t trying hard enough and that I was a failure. I eventually came back to her later crying (which was bad because she is one of the people who want me to be a manly man) and was able to clear out the misunderstanding, but she still blamed me for getting yelled at with no reason as to why. Earlier today, I was talking about my trip to Paris with my mom’s side of my family, so I was excitedly telling her about the details of it. She interrupted me 3 different times talking about her own experiences there, and it took everything I had to keep my cool.She also likes to retell stories about me embellished with extra details that never happened, and they always make me sound whiny or wimpy. She always talks about how the fact that she used to be a lawyer makes her want to argue the other point even if she doesn’t believe in it, and that it isn’t her fault because she couldn’t help it which is absolute bullshit because everyone has agency over what they do most of the time. Everyone always chooses to do what they do unless they have a mental disorder, or they’re being threatened. That’s enough ranting for today though. The sleep deprivation may be getting to me because I don’t know if I would normally be this vulgar. Sorry for the typos if anyone decides to read this."

915,im not gonna make friends with this post (love &amp; sex),"am I the only one who prefers sex more than love? i seen my friends go through awkward and sometimes difficult moments when they were in a relationship (with their gf's)  and i dont want that in my life other than sex

i dont have much confidence in me so i dont meet girls at bars so I  pay for sex and I did at least 20 times, i havent told  my friends any of this because of what they might think of me

it seems like being in a relationship is hard work and I want to avoid it , idk what do u think? am I sick? is it ok to think that way?
(and please no comments saying ""oh one day you'll meet the right one"" i heard it a thousand times this year)"
916,My anxiety and religious ocd are eating me alive... it feels like the demons are winning.,"I've struggled with anxiety for quite some time now, but I'm soon going to college and it's gotten much worse. I feel unfit for college. I feel like a little kid amongst young adults when I try talking to people going to my college. I really feel like a little kid, and that it's all happening too fast. I already know the work load is going to take a toll on me as well. I was so afraid of having homework in high school because of my fear of failure, and would stay up until 5 am out of that fear just to complete it and study. I'm not ready to do that again, I'm afraid it will literally hurt my physical health in some way, as my anxiety has already hurt my health while in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Something that has been messing me up as well is intrusive thoughts regarding religious figures. Something that isn't me is making me deny Jesus too, but I don't want to deny Him. Other Christians on here know it can be scary to have some denials here and there, but they all go away, not for me though. The guilt of denying Him and trying to reassure myself that He is with me has kept me up all night. I always feel light headed because of this and I've been having alot of panic attacks because of it as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was also very paranoid these last few weeks and have seen things that aren't there, if that makes any sense. I've had auditory hallucinations before, but nothing to this extent. I've seen shadows moving past me, a rat scatter across the floor that wasn't there in the first place, and I even heard a man whisper ""get out"" in my ear. This is my first time posting on this subreddit, but if any of you could give advice for me to calm down, that would be great. Thank you."
917,"I'm in so much pain, my body aches",[removed]
918,Mental Health Community YouTube Channel,"Would you all be interested in a shared mental health community YouTube channel?   


Essentially 5 to 10 people would be selected to be in charge, and users could submit original content such as poetry, research, personal stories, podcast style interviews, etc. It could be an online hub of video discussion on mental health and a place for this community to do mental health advocacy and education in another way."
919,Why do I feel this way? *language warnings*,"I’m not one to use foul language when venting but I DONT FUCKING KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

I was doing good for a while, not even quarantine was getting to me. I had a regular sleep schedule, I had school/a job to distract me, everything was great. But now school is out, I got laid off from my job because of corona, I can’t fall asleep at a decent time anymore, everything is just shit.

Before all of this, my thoughts were tangible, I could understand them and talk to someone about my issues and thoughts clearly if I absolutely needed to, but now I don’t know how the fuck to explain them. I lay awake every night letting my thoughts wander and it’s like I hear all these little voices yelling “HELP ME! WHY CANT ANYONE FUCKING HEAR ME?”

I have a really hard time talking to other people about my issues. It’s not just the whole “I don’t want to burden you with my problems” at this point, it’s a physical feeling I get whenever I feel the need to vent to someone I love. I feel like a hand is strangling me, forcing me to stay quiet. I’ll cry silently in bed, but you won’t hear anything come from my mouth if anyone is around.

The other night I finally had the courage to voice my thoughts, I didn’t feel forced to stay silent and I finally told my mom, “What is wrong with me? I have a great family, great friends, my life is pretty much perfect but I don’t feel... perfect. I’m not happy.”

Unfortunately, earlier that day I had been heartbroken by my best friend. She took it as, “my friend broke my heart, so now I’m depressed and I’m gonna be a dramatic teenager.” So all she told me was, “Today was a bad day, don’t let him bring you down.”

I could tell she had misunderstood what I told her and said desperately, “It’s more than just today. I’ve been feeling with way for a long time now. I’ve tried to fix it, but I can’t.”

She shrugged it off. She didn’t seem to understand me. I told her the most basic part of my mental state and she couldn’t understand it. If she can’t understand that, how is she supposed to understand everything else when I can’t even begin to wrap my head around it? I’m the one experiencing all of this, but I can’t understand what the fuck is wrong with me. I want help, but I don’t know how to get it. I want some sort of diagnosis, someone to tell me what’s wrong with me and why I feel this way so that I can fix the problem.

I keep being told that I’ll be okay, I’ll be alright, I’m fine, that I should be happy BUT IM NOT HAPPY! IM NOT FINE! I JUST WANT HELP!

Why can’t they understand that? Why can’t they see that I’m not happy? Why can’t anyone hear me?

Why can’t I just feel happy and “normal” again?"
920,I feel like i’m never good enough,"I kinda just realized that i keep putting myself down for not being like other people. i’ve been behind in every aspect of my life due to anxiety. and even when i get to a good spot in my life and i feel like i’ve improved, i still feel like everyone is 50 steps ahead of me. and it sucks because to them, i may appear dumb or lazy or weird. but to me, its the crippling anxiety and depression that holds me back. idk how to get rid of this negative way of thinking. i know that the obvious answer is to not think about others and to just focus on yourself and your progress or whatever, but it’s easier said than done"
921,Start up,"Having suffered from depression and anxiety my entire life I recently started up a company aimed at helping end the stigma of mental illness through various donations from my business “I am not and never will be looking for donations”

923,so its getting bad again,"25f, no proper diagnosis but suspect bpd and/or autism. 
when i was 17 i had a bad accident. and i had ptsd from it. and as i was learning to walk again i was bedridden. so i just sat in bed. trying to not have a panic attack so i found a safe show. my little pony. 
then i dyed my hair pink
my mom took me to target in my wheel chair when i got a little stronger. and i bought pink clothes and school supplies for my senior year of high school. 
when i was 19 i had a mental break down because i was still dealing with ptsd from the accident and my first boyfriend who was abusive broke up with me. so i went back go pink and relapsed in self harming behavior. 
now im 25. and im unemployed. i dropped out of grad school. and getting by day to day is emotionally stripping. im going back to pink. im watching my little pony because literally anything else is too hard to watch and i just cry. im scared when the pink comes, ill relapse. since thats what usually happens. like a cycle. 

im autoimmune compromised. im scared. im frustrated. im going crazy in my house. but im so depressed and anxious i cant do anything. i cant concentrate. literally right now its 3am, 
im covered in blankets, cuddling stuffies, and watching my little pony. i took my anxiety pill and i just need to be knocked the fuck out. 

i guess this is a rant. and im sorry. if anyone has any good vibes or advice its appreciated."
924,How do I start seeking help?,I've had what I think is social anxiety for a while now and a number of people have suggested going for counselling on this. How do I even tell my parents about this and what steps do I take?
925,Mental health,"Hey guys, I have thoughts and visions about future self and past. Sometimes I feel like I need to stop it but realization is too blurry for me. I feel like past and future is the same time. Even not the present moment. How can you help me in this mental state?  [and this video helps me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxkFO0EDUJA)"
926,Signs of depression,[removed]
927,Sadness and happiness,"Why do i think that some people or maybe just me are moved by sadness , pain and anger more than happines, many people like sad or calm music that just gives you sad and depressed vibes although nothing happened to them to make them sad, sometimes I think people like to but themselves in angry and sad situations while like listening to music, people even sometimes don’t like happy ending movies, books or fics because they are boring, it is like happiness is bpring and sometimes I myself think that there is no a truly happy ending, I always thought that happy ending is just a break before another problem break out, so my question is : do sadness, pain and anger motivate and push people more than happiness?"
928,Should I be worried about potential disassociation?,"Hi!  At least since I was 13 (I'm 17 now), I would sometimes enter this weird state in which nothing felt real; the best way to describe it is as though I'm watching a movie of my life play out in front of me or as if I'm dreaming.  I still have a sense of reality and I know that something is wrong when I enter this state, but it's completely uncontrollable.  When I was younger, this would only be brought on from being under distress (i.e. a panic attack, severe lack of sleep, stress, etc.), however for the past year-and-a-half or so I've been entering this state with seemingly no trigger.  These experiences stated becoming a lot more frequent at the start of this year.  I did some research and it sounds like disassociation, however I obviously won't diagnose myself as that would just be silly.  Is this something I should be concerned about?  I'm going to be talking to my therapist at some point next week and I'm not sure if I should bring it up to her or if it's not a big deal.  Sorry if this is a dumb question, I just don't want to bring something up to my therapist if it's nothing to worry about; I don't want to seem dumb or over dramatic."
929,I'm dead serious about this.,"Hello, i had this question in my mind for quite a while.
Would it  be possible with enough concentration and will-power to beat a mental disability such as schizophrenia, alzheimers or dislexia."
930,Does this happen to you?,When you’re crying about several minor inconveniences in your life but then you hear about someone having actual problems and struggles so you cry about the guilt you feel regarding your privilege
931,How do you make them understand...,"How do you make understand your friends and family that you are fucked up in the head, that you are not normal, that what they perceive as laziness or otherwise is cause by a mental illness.

A friend was trying to help me but he could not understand how different it is to process everything if you live with anxiety or depression or something else"
932,What’s happening to me?,"I don’t know what’s happening to me, i have always been depressed and lately i got panic attack for the first time which in my experience was the worst to ever happen to me. And now my mind is like crazy.. I will explain in the best way i can... lately in a single day  I’m feeling good and positive feeling hopeful and out of nowhere it changes. I become so sad and depressed, like i want to die in that minute then after a while i will be okay again and that cycle continues. Has anyone been like that? Why this keeps happening?"
933,Quote of the day,""" When people get to where they're going, they forget where they came from"""
934,"Huge energy and clarity in the mornings, none in evenings","I always wake up early, and am super energised and alert in the morning, manic even, and always have super productive days. In the early evenings though I’m always burned out, in a fog, with no mental energy to socialise. Makes it tough to engage with people at dinners / parties without caffeine / drugs to re wake me up again. Anyone else get this and know how I can try stretch my mental clarity out into the evenings?"
935,I wish i can do anything again crying in my bed got really boring real quick,"2 years ago i left my friends, i thought it was for the best at the time, for a short while i felt like a whole new world opened up for me, i was so wrong because after that like for 2 years my life is just a fuck up after a fuck up, i spent both my junior year and senior year in bed 24/7, eating masturbating and sleeping, i used to be really good at school i loved learning, but in these 2 years my whole school experience was go to school because i had to, i didn't listen most of the the time, i was planning where to hide from people because i was so embarrassed to sit alone or run into my old friends.

and this is the year i graduate, of course i'm planning to disappoint my mom and skip graduation, i'm resetting my a levels, 3 to be exact, and i should finish preparing in 3 months which is impossible, whenever i pick my books i just remember my old friends, how much fun those days were and it all ended because of me, i feel like i can't study anymore.

i'm just either crying or too anxious to study, i tried my best but this is killing me."
936,I Don't know how to feel," So yesterday like everyone I heard that reckful took his own life, I only watched his streams twice and I know him via others streamers and because of his project. At first I was sad but okay, then i watched some videos of him with DR K about his depression and that made me mad sad beacuse I don't really deal well with death and he's such a pure human being, so the rest of the day I felt really sad and later I learned that i got accepted in the School that I wanted, so now I feel weird because I feel like I have no right to be happy in these sad times..."
937,"Whenever i'm on the verge of crying, i always tell myself that i'm the happiest girl in the world, there is nothing to cry about but in reality i just wanna die.","I'm such a disappointment. My whole life i was not enough for people but the disappintment thing grew on me in these recent years i was told by my mother that i was worthless, i don't have morals, i'm ugly and i should just die.(when she gets angry she will yell at me the harshest words soo, that i feel bad)  I know i'm not the best person to be around but few years back i was sexually assaulted no one knows and that thing is eating me alive, there are days when i just wanna sleep and don't wanna wake up. In general i'm just a toxic bitch but believe me i try to be best but i can't. My grandma died, my dog died they were the ones who made me happy and now, there is sometimes just a wave of sadness and i just wanna cry. I don't know if i'm suffering from mental illness or not cause i really do have everything. There isn't any reason for me to be sad like this but still there are many days that i just wanna end my life and i'm constantly thinking about what if i get into an accident, i would die and it would not be a suicide. 


Sorry, if my english is bad. It isn't my first language."
938,How do I appear more outgoing and not panic during social interactions?,"Yeah, I'm not good at talking to people. Never have been. But I wanna change that. I'm changing and improving my life daily and I really just want to get ahead of this irrational fear I have. Thanks guys, in advance for any help I recieve!"
939,How do you support your gf/bf when you're also going through depression too?,"I want to be there for him and support him mentally, but I feel like it is too heavy for me to deal with him and his problems when it's draining out of my mental.  What do I do?"
940,I made an emotional support groupchat!,"This group chat is a safe place to talk, and everyone is accepted!

Reply to join. Don’t reply to replies because I won’t get the notification."
941,Why her and not me?,"Ever since I was a child, I have been struggling with terrible mental health. Depression, suicidal thoughts, anger outbursts, severe social anxiety, etc and my mother’s emotional abuse and neglect never helped it. I have a twin sister. My mother definitely loves her more cause she was never emotionally abusive to her a day in her life, and she literally got therapy before me. Me, who has had all those shitty problems that are just being constantly ignored. I have been waiting for therapy since December 2019 now, and I’m going to have to wait a few more months. Meanwhile, my sister, who only has a *mild* case of depression, has occasional therapy sessions and is getting all the help and support in the world. Why her? Why not me? I have always had problems with my emotions, so why is she getting therapy over a little case of depression? I don’t even mind if I sound terrible saying this, I hate her. I’m so jealous of her. She’s always stuck to my mom’s stupid ass and that’s why she’s getting therapy probably. We’ve had several talks on why does she keep on loving my stupid mother and she just always ignore the question. She has become just like her. Manipulative, excellent at gaslighting, she even responds to things she doesn’t want to answer in the same way which is fucking triggering. I despise them both. I’m becoming extremely suicidal again lately. Can’t wait to take my own life and then for them to say how much they cared for me and loved me, and I won’t be able to say anything cause I’ll be dead. This life truly isn’t fair. Just if I was born to a different family, a different mother, I wouldn’t need to experience all this bullshit. I’m jealous of people my age that are having the time of their lives. They’re all pretty, social , fit girls and I am so SOOO jealous of them. Why can’t I be like them? Why was I born into this shit family? I don’t think this life is worth it. I want to kill myself. 

I probably sound so aggressive and I’m gonna regret posting this later haha niceeee I love being ashamed"
942,Which mental disorders/to what extent are considered a disability?,I wish to have a discussion with someone who claims no mental disorders are disabilities. To what extent is that true?
943,I want something horrible to happen to me just so I can feel something...,"I've lost friends left and right and my own mother told me I'm useless and don't do anything and I don't feel anything.

I've even tried hopelessly to find a video to make me cry but nothing works. I feel like I'm in a pit of nothing everything's numb. I haven't been truly happy in weeks but I also haven't been sad or mad or anything my whole world is nothing anymore.

I just want to feel something, feel normal again, feel like I'm not emotionally drained."
944,Help.,"I don’t want to self diagnose.When I feel a certain emotion let’s say anger,I just becomes more intense no matter what happens.For example I was triggered by people talking and laughing while I was on the phone with my friends.I felt this urge to kill the people laughing the hang up on my friends."

Mid breakdown I tell myself I have to but then I’ll have a good day or two and convince myself that it was just a moment I was having . I don’t know if my problems are “ big” enough  I guess ? Or valid enough , I’m scared of wasting someone’s time . Does anyone have any experiences or advice they’d be willing to share on seeking help ?"

My parents on the other hand, has been making things extremely hard for me. I had left school an hour late and my mother went to contact the school just because of that and making it an issue for my teacher. They do not trust me at all even if they say they do and they always blame ME for breaking their trust. Recently, I've been diagnosed with scoliosis and I have to do back exercises every single day and update my parents via text. However, they told me off and accused me for not doing exercises because I didn't send texts. I know I probably should have, but do they really think I wanna do harm to myself that way? It pisses me off so much, especially when my father said, ""If you didn't send a text, you didn't do it."" Like what the hell? 1) I feel like he shouldn't be saying stuff that downgrades my progress and 2) I feel that you shouldn't need to have to send a text if they fully trust you. Every single day, I have to come home to this toxic family and I'm honestly tired from it that I have successfully reached mental exhaustion faster than physical exhaustion.

962,struggling with intrusive thoughts,"i’ve come to the conclusion that i’ve been having intrusive thoughts for a while (i hope that’s the right way to describe them) and they cause me a lot of stress.

(kind of embarrassing but) as a child and even up until now i had a lot of anxiety about not being able to go to the toilet. if there wasn’t easy access to one and i hadn’t been immediately beforehand, my mind would tell me that i needed it right in that second and i’d get so anxious about that idea. there was a point in time when i was going to the toilet every 20 mins bc i was so nervous. rationally i knew that i didn’t need it again but it’s almost as if the anxiety created the feeling that i did.

right now the thoughts have been more surrounding food. i’d tell myself i want to eat better today but then my mind tells me to eat this snack and that snack and just a little bit of that etc, i feel powerless trying not to concede.

other thoughts are quite random but they’re similar to those pictures you see on social media like ‘if you don’t repost this you’ll have 10 years bad luck’. it puts my mind at rest once i’ve complied but it really feeds into the anxiety.

so i was wondering if anyone knows how i can combat this. as i said the ones surrounding eating are my biggest issue at the moment, but i’d feel a lot better if i could rid them altogether, if that’s even possible. thanks"

966,"Being falsely accused of molestation, rape, and spreading of STDs has pushed me into the darkest realm I’ve ever been in.","Recently, I had my ex-fiancée who I was with for 4 years come out with her story about how I physically abused her and raped her and molested her and apparently 9 other underage girls (15 and under) from when I was 18-24 and apparently got two of them pregnant. 

Anyway it was posted on twitter and it got huge, every single person in my life has left me besides my mom and my wife. It’s beyond wild how people can just read a tweet and believe it all. 

The wildest part of this whole thing is I’ve been in the military since I was 18 and I’m currently 26 and I’ve been married for 3 years so far, the amount of strain it puts on your mental health to be accused of this shit is beyond insane and I never thought a girl from 5 years ago, could come back into my life and be relevant.

967,Hyper Awareness of oneself and conscience,"Sorry if I this is grammatically wrong, but for the past week I've been grappling with myself. Have you ever had thoughts about how you're conscious and start questioning your existence? Questions like how did I get here, why am I in this body, how am I experiencing all of this or maybe a bit more drastic like rationalizing how I'm a lone god. 

I've always had these thoughts of my very existence and  it always terrifies me, however I've been good at ignoring them. But now they're in my head for the days and hours. 

I suspect this has something to do with my anxiety. When I was 16, my mind constantly tortured me. Every day I would be constantly questioning my sexuality, worried about my parent's reaction. This episode lasted throughout the entire summer until school started. 

Ever since then, my anxiety transformed into something else. That something being existentialism. 

I just want to know if someone here experiences the same thing as I did. Right now I'm combating this anxiety by eating more nutritious food, controlled breathing and talking with family, but it still lingers and I'm now scared of myself"
968,What happens to someone’s fight or flight response after years of fear?,"Okay, a little description. I’m not sure what community to post this to, but I’ve been thinking about this for hours. 
I (19F), was in fear for most of my childhood. Excusing a handful memories, the only ones I have from before 8th grade are ones of fear (and even those memories are few and far between). So it became my baseline. As expected, I had anxiety, insomnia, an eating disorder, and depression all through high school. I began to actually heal at 16 because of a housing change and actual support. 
I am now 19, and I am in a good place right now, the best of my life. 
But I wonder how many life decisions I make because... well I wonder if I even have a fight or flight trigger now. I do extremely reckless shit a lot, and have been in many situations where it could have gone a lot worse than it did and felt relatively nothing. I don’t know how to explain how I feel. (Given, I am 19. A horrible age to be able to know how I feel.) the best way I can explain how fucked my wiring is, that when I want to fall asleep soundly I have to be afraid. I normally don’t do this a lot because I realize it’s super fucked up for my psyche, but I’ll imagine that there’s someone outside my house, or just around the corner ready to hurt me and I’ll immediately feel comfortable enough to drift to sleep. 
So, does anyone know if a brain can be so accustom to being in fight or flight, but can do nothing about it, that it can just, go numb? Go away? Get so used to it that it’s not even a thing anymore?"
969,What It's Like To be A Highly Sensitive Man with Anxiety,"This was a huge step for me, to make a raw, unedited video talking openly about my experiences as a Highly sensitive male with anxiety, suicide ideation and an ability to overemphasize with others. 

A highly sensitive person is defined as ""a temperamental or personality trait involving ""an increased sensitivity of the central nervous system and a deeper cognitive processing of physical, social and emotional stimuli"".\[2\] The trait is characterized by ""a tendency to 'pause to check' in novel situations, greater sensitivity to subtle stimuli, and the engagement of deeper cognitive processing strategies for employing coping actions, all of which is driven by heightened emotional reactivity, both positive and negative"".

no one cares about me, no one cares about anyone but themselves, people have proved time and time again they are selfish, I remember a few months ago an elderly man was asking for help and so many people walked by and didn’t help him so then there I was with 50 shopping bags in my hand helping the guy while everyone just stood there on their phone. 

the world is just not fair no matter how hard I’ve worked or done the ‘right thing’ nothing ever works out. No money, lost job, no friends, made out to be weird because I don’t want to do what society expects of me oh and soon I’ll have no where to live. What’s the fucking point, struggle might make you stronger but if you struggle time and time and time again what’s the fucking point, life as an adult is just miserable and unfair, I’ve worked hard and where am I now huh? Poor and soon living in my car. 

24 and already struggling and tired. what’s life like when you are 40, exhausted working 9-5 in a job you hate but have to have to in order to survive, can’t quit or you’ll be living in the street, no time for nothing, no time or money to do what you want. then one day you realise life has passed you by and you are reaching 70 and miserable and struggling to walk, what is the fucking point of any of it, what is the point, this is NOT living.

973,Abandonment Recovery," 

I have tried literally everything under the sun to heal my abandonment wounds to no avail. Right when I had thought I overcame my abandonment issues I would go and sabotage my progress and end up in a world of shame, guilt and resentment towards myself for my actions. It wasn’t until I came across Outer Child Therapy that I was able to curb my self-defeating behaviours. Through the combination of Outer Child Therapy, Inner Child Healing and energy work I was able to love myself more than I ever thought possible and discipline my own behaviours. ⠀  
⠀  
I decided to replicate what worked so well for me to help others who are dealing with their own abandonment issues. Abandonment is a universal process for all humans. Unfortunately we all have to experience this one way or another. ⠀  
⠀  
Thankfully there is hope and ways to heal these wounds and move forward with more clarity and understanding than you previously thought possible.

This program utilizes new developments in the field of psychology by combining Inner Child healing with Outer Child therapy and spiritual practices. By blending these fields together this program will teach you new techniques to love yourself unconditionally and leave behind any abandonment wounds.

**What is abandonment?**

Abandonment is the primal fear which stems from the worry of being left behind or losing our essential supports and loved ones. It takes many shapes and forms but it can stem from the loss of a loved one, family, closed friends or a betrayal.

**What is Outer Child Therapy and how does it differ from traditional Inner Child Healing?**

Traditional Inner Child Healing allows us to tap into our emotional core to begin to love ourselves unconditionally. It has shown to be effective at erasing co-dependency and faulty programming that we developed in our childhood. By re-parenting ourselves we can look inwards for validation rather than outwards. However, one issue with traditional Inner Child programs is that they do not address our behaviours. We learn to love ourselves unconditionally but then we act out in self-sabotaging ways. Rather than blaming our Inner Child for these behaviours, you will learn to redirect the blame to your Outer Child. In this way you will learn to nurture your Inner Child and validate their feelings while disciplining your Outer Child for their behaviours.

**What does this program entail?**

This program combines weekly activity workbooks, intuitive counselling and energy healing. Each week, participants will receive a workbook with 2 activities from the following approaches to help you in your recovery: seperational therapy, visualization techniques, art therapy and goal-orientated actions. After completing each week’s activity we will have a 15 minute intuitive counselling session. In this session, I will work alongside your spiritual guidance team to create a plan to help you heal your abandonment wounds. Finally, this program incorporates energy healing techniques to help clear trapped emotions or feelings from your childhood. When we experience pain or traumatic moments we have feelings that accompany those memories. If we do not properly process these emotions and release them they become trapped within our energy bodies. Through different energy healing modalities, I am able to access these trapped emotions and release them for good.

Hope you are doing well. I've been journaling since March 21st and I'm currently at 100+ days into it.

I have constant anxiety, obsession (it could be everything) intense emotional reactions (but I'm not reacting it on outside) but the most prominent symptom is black or white thinking and going for extremes. When I was a child I thought that someone hates me beacuse he/she looked at me without smiling... it sounds irrational but yeah. I used to take things really personally. I can tame myself but I'm shutting down and isolate myself from people. 

Could somebody help me to find a lead?"

981,What is it called when you get a sudden feeling of numbness,"Every so often I get this feeling of numbness. i think thats the best word. It’s like everything happy drops and life feels empty, not in a depressed sense, I don’t think. It can happen at any point in time, I could be hanging out with family/friends, I could be going for a walk, I could just be laying in bed. it doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing, it just happens randomly and can last anywhere from a few seconds, to declining in to a day long depressive episode. 

I’m wondering if anyone knows what this is called, and if there’s anyway to prevent it, because it’s at best a very unpleasant experience."
982,Why do i feel sick when i study?,"I am in third grade of highschool and i have to study hard for my finals but everytime i try to study after a bit (like half and hour maybe? Sooner if i have studied again that day) i start to get nauseated and dizzy, like the feeling 
when you get up too quickly and you black out? My head starts hurting and my ears kind of block (? Maybe too much pressure in the brain?) and i feel too hot and uncomfortable, and then everything i try to read just stops making sense. I am not overstudying and I have stopped studying for school because of this and that is really not ideal. Doesn’t anyone know what this is and how i can solve it? Because i really need to study and this problem takes too much time away from that and i dont get any actual work done."
983,Do I have to see a doctor?,"I have been overthinking lately. I overthink so much it gave me anxiety, and then after some time I threw off the thought but then now I have started over thinking that something is happening with me. Like I worry about how I cannot stop worrying about things. I have lost my self-confidence. I am overthinking about it rn, and I just think about my condition of overthinking again and again until I make it worse. I even want to try doing something that distracts me but I cannot concentrate with this heavy feeling on my chest. What should I do ?"
984,suicidal a week or two leading up to my period,"i’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but i’ve noticed that i struggle a lot with my mental health a week or two  before i get my period. every. single. month. 

i have struggled with depression and anxiety in the past, but i have worked on it and i’m much better now, however - as i’ve mentioned - the weeks leading up to my period, no matter how hard i try to avoid it, i’m put back in a depressive state to the point where suicide constantly lingers on my mind.

my self hatred gradually increases to the point where i have to avoid every mirror in my house, because i despise everything about myself. 
while on a regular day i am somewhat fine with my appearance and looking in the mirror.

i find myself not enjoying anything i usually would, in fact nothing gives me joy when i’m in this state and that’s when the suicidal thoughts creep in. i’ll be doing something regular, such as sitting on the couch, and then everything in the room will start to irritate me. the lighting will anger me, so i’ll convince my dad to turn off the light so the room is dark. however even then everything makes me anxious. i can’t look at my phone because of irrational thoughts and fears of seeing something that’ll trigger me, so i instead sit in silence zoning out to the thought of ending it. 
this usually only happens when i’m home, so once i’ve tried to calm myself down enough, i’ll try to stay in touch with friends and family by calling or messaging as a way of distracting these thoughts. 

however for the first time it happened outside the house while i was with people. i went out a few days ago with my family on a scenic drive, and on the way back home, i found myself zoning off as i stared out the window and suicidal thoughts creeped in. 
my sister and her husband were speaking to me, but everything they said was muffled. for the first time, i wasn’t scared or anxious. i just really wanted to be dead. every day since, i’ve been at home and the zoning off still happens. 

my eating habits also become dreadful. i won’t eat for hours to the point where i get headaches and my head feels like it’s going to explode, but by that point my stomach is killing me and i just want to vomit from all of it. so whenever my period is over, i have to eat the minute i’m hungry to avoid any feeling remotely similar to this. 

i think this time is the worst it’s ever been, as i wrote a suicide letter earlier this week. 
i am certain everyone i know is capable of living without me, so i think this is the closest i’ve been to actually doing it. 

i’m too scared to tell anyone i personally know about this, because i don’t want them to start treating me differently. however, it terrifies me how much i really want to die when i’m in the state that i’m currently in. 

does anyone else experience anything similar? and if so how do you deal with it?"
985,How to apologize properly when the source of the conflict is your mental health?,"I was an ass. Vented very negatively to my ex-close friend few months ago. We had two group chats back then, one for a group project for our art course, and another one for my group of friends. We were deciding for a place to practice, and I didn’t like the majority vote. Since I have anxiety, 
the thought that the place WE (I said ‘yes’ to it) chose was a park and it was too out in the open and too public, I freaked out and vented to the group chat where my friends were included. Like, I freaked out too much in a sense that my friend got mad for it because I was being aggressive with my choice of words. The reason for this past behavior of mine was that I don’t like being in crowded places since it gives me terrible anxiety attacks. 

She was a good friend. I know I messed up. She knew I had anxiety and she always tried her best to understand me. I guess it had gotten to the point that she couldn’t take any of my shit anymore.

I just want to know how to apologize to her without being self-conceited and unapologetic. I want to be sincere, internallt and through words. But how do you say sorry if the source of your conflict is your mental health? We have this notion that your mental health doesn’t excuse you for being an ass, and I believe in that. So how do I do it? How do we do it?"
986,My wife is struggling with mental health - help- (young couple),"My wife and I have been married for 5 years and this is the first time we are going through this. Her dad passed away in December of last year and she was overworked by week 12 of the pandemic, her family dynamics aren’t the best and I have little support from them. My family is helping but this is all new to us too. In early June she had two trips to the ER due to panic attacks and not taking her prescribed meds. I feel guilty because I feel like I should have known about how volatile her mental health could be and I should have been on top of her meds. I  always knew she was under some type of prescribed medication to help her with anxiety issues during grad school but I didn’t know how serious it was until the recent episodes she’s had. 

Since those episodes; I’ve been educating myself and learning more about how I can help her, it’s tougher because we are stuck at home; she’s taking PTO but I’m not..I’m  running a small business and working full time from home and taking two grad school summer classes. I’ve managed to get her follow up medical care and individual counseling and we started a couples counseling program. She’s been instructed to take Zoloft, Zanax and Klonopin. However she often complains about the side effects and argues with me about what to take, how much to take, and when to take it. The hard part is that she’s very smart and makes compelling arguments to me and it’s hard for me to tell her to follow the doctors orders when she starts to google how all these meds are really poison. I’m no doctor but I am sure not being consistent with her meds isn’t helping. She’s stopped taking the Zanax and she’s reduced her Zoloft dose to half, she continues to take the Klonopin but refuses to take it as prescribed( she’s been taking one daily but is supposed to take two daily after fourteen days)

The verbal abuse and mistreatment continues to increase towards me despite all the efforts we are making. I know it’s not the real her, I am making sure she eats, takes her meds, showers, and is at peace as much as she can be. I know it’s the chemical imbalance in her brain but it still hurts my feelings when she tells me I’m not enough/I don’t do enough or that she wants to divorce me because I’m not up to her standards. I’m posting this here because despite having a therapist myself and working out to try and cope with all this....I am scared, I am scared for her safety, for our marriage, and I’m scared to learn if this is something I want to keep doing or if I should move on once she’s back to “normal”....thanks for reading, sometimes I feel very alone and lost."

989,Is this normal? Like do people feel like this and have learnt to control or do I have a problem?,"I'm asking this because for the past few years I have been feeling very anxious and moody.  I  initially brushed it off as a hormonal change but then it persisted for 4 years ( I have learned to live with it, not that it has made my life much better). I also feel like I'm unable to think clearly and obsess over a singular thought to the point that it physically hurts. It's like there a solid mass at the back of my head that is pulling down my thinking capacity ( My motor skills and cognitive capacity are completely fine ) and wouldn't let me be free. You know how the game you are playing starts to lag because chrome keeps taking all the RAM, that's how i feel. Like even though there is a big task in front of me I can't focus because my mind keeps going to that recurring thought and I am only half there. The other half is doing something which has nothing to do with what I am doing. If I force myself to concentrate fully I find myself easily overwhelmed with reality.

As expected this has made me quite emotionally stunted. Either I feel nothing or I feel a wave of emotion wash over me ( Sadness, excitement, anger and even fear). It has strained all my relationships and as expected made the situation worse.  

I'm not gonna lie, the thoughts sometimes get violent.

Am I just over reacting or is this normal? 

P.S. English is not my first language, so forgive any mistakes. Could any of this be caused by early masturbation? My first masturbation was when I was 7 years old."
990,"The pandemic and ""productivity""","Ever since the beginning of the pandemic around March or April I and others probably have hit some hard times since then.

For a while I thought this was normal cause we are in a crisis and that's asking what I figured was too much from people and I thought most of us understood that. Recently though from friends and family I feel like I'm getting shit thrown my way for being ""lazy"" for not having a job during this, for not working out as much, for seeing my friends as much (during a pandemic!!!!!) for not doing a lot of shit, for not being productive from people who aren't being particularly productive either. Honestly it's just exhausting and kinda taking it's toll on me slowly"
991,"If ""the world"" doesn't care about how I feel, why should I?","I suppose this is more of a philosophical question but I feel like a lot of mental health related topics are kind of philosophical in nature, because in the end, pretty much everything boils down to the meaning of life and everything else is just a logical conclusion to whatever the answer to THAT question is, and I'm noticing that I'm going off on a tangent here so please everyone stick to the original question and ignore the fact that I can't?

Fuck me I can't even ask a simple question...

Edit: Well I suppose that I should mention that I'm a freak. I'm different, I think differently, I like things that are questionable.... I mean no harm to anyone but there's just no place in this world where I would fit, and even if there was, I would have to hurt a lot of people if I were to ""go to"" that place where I would feel at home and comfortable. Which just seems to be absolutely impossible without a hefty dose of egotism, hence the question."

I cant believe I’m doing this. I have a whole script typed out and I roughly know what I’m going to say, but I feel like I may back out last minute and panic and not say anything.

Vulnerability is scary because there is no guarantee. I don’t know what the person will say or think or do. I don’t know if I will leave the session feeling hopeful or devastated.

I've thought about killing myself after seeing photos of myself because it doesn't look remotely close to how I want to look or how I think I look. I usually have one part of my body that I'll fixate on for a couple months, then I'll switch to another one. Last year in was my hairline, early this year it was my brow ridge, and right now it's the ""hunch"" in my back. I can't stop thinking about these things. They affect my every thought.

995,I don't want to feel worthless anymore,"I have felt worthless for years. I'm not suicidal or anything, but I just feel extremely worthless. I'm 18, don't even have a ged or HS diploma, no drivers license either.

 I stopped going to school in junior year because my mental health was just getting to bad, I didn't fit in really, didn't talk to people, I pretty much never did my homework my whole time in highschool, it was to damn time consuming. So I just dropped out.

I don't really leave the house much either. I go to work, and that's pretty much my time away from home for the day. I don't really talk much at work either, there is no one in my life that I really talk to. I don't really talk with any emotion, just monotone words with no substance, so I'm not the kinda person people what to talk to also.  At work there are people that are kinda ""friends"" but I only make small talk with them, I never open up. I don't want to burden people with my feelings if you know what I mean. A part of me wants to, but work isn't really the place for that, and I'm not really close enough to anybody to be friends outside work also.

I also never feel like I am loved/wanted, even by people who are family. And I really have anyone to love either. I want something/someone to love, but that won't happen anytime soon. I would get a cat/dog, but I can't where I live. I have dreams where I am wanted, or have a girlfriend, or just have somebody that I love, and they love me back, and I get sad af when I wake up, because feeling wanted feels like a long lost ideology for me.

Ive been this way for a long time, how do I get my life together? I want to be happy, happiness isn't a feeling anymore, it's just an unobtainable wish.

I'm not sad or anything either, just feel trapped and lost"
996,I feel happy reading depressed books,"Hi
It seems like reddit has become my best friend recently so I am back with another of my dumb questions I guess. Lockdown has made me really self introspect more than I would like really. Basically whenever I feel sad or anxious I read books which helps a lot. Whenever I feel my anxiety rise I read books to distract and get control over my emotions. 
I kind of discovered that I tend to read books which are depressing in nature like which contain abuse but in the end have a happy ending. And while reading them when I am feeling low it makes me feel good and happy in a way. 
Is something wrong with this or just okay? I don't know. To me it just seems something is wrong me.. Any help is appreciated."

999,Its all getting to me and I just want to vent a little,"Quick introduction, this is my first time on this sub. I just wanted to talk about this because its something I noticed about myself. 

With whats been going on on social media and around the world such as Covid, politics, BLM and the new wave of sexual misconduct allegations, Im starting to feel disengaged? Emotionally numb? Detached? Idk what to call it but I think its affecting my real life. 

I noticed this yesterday when my sister came over and she talked about her history of being sexually assaulted. It didnt really get to me like I think it should have. My mom was in tears even though she already knew these things and I was just kinda there listening and asking questions. I felt like I should have had a stronger emotional reaction than I got. 

Ive told my friends on Discord ""Im in full Doomer mode"" kind of as a funny way of describing this cloud of hopelessness that has been following me around the last couple of months. Im hoping it'll pass but its something I started to feel concerned about after yesterday. 

It feels trivial to all the stuff Ive read on this sub prior to posting, but I still wanted to share. 👌"
1000,Feeling really weird/depressed about moving out from parents house?,"
there thanks in advance for the help! 

Im a male 22 years old Hey

I’m moving out of the house ive always lived in my whole life with my parents.
I left today and honestly I cried a bit (and I haven’t cried in years)
The thought of leaving my parents alone, and them being sad with me going and missing me, is making me feel extremely anxious and guilty or something. 
I feel like I need to make sure they’re alright with it. I think it was also because my dad showed emotion towards me (really sad) when we said goodbye and it just tripped me out.

Is it normal to feel like this? 
Any suggestions on what to do to ease this weird feeling? I don’t really know how to word it so was hoping someone else could relate or tell me it’s normal?
Thanks again!"
1001,I convince myself people don't like me. from america,"I literally can't control these thoughts its like everytime i go out or something i have this underlying feeling that im like acting stupid and my friends just feel bad so they dont say anything but deep down they don't really like me. But its all in my head, i build up the confidence to ask if they actually dont rly like me anymore but they always say they do and im just overthinking and stuff. and after everytime this happens i tell myself, ""just dont think like that again because they are your friends they like you"" but then time passes and i get the same feeling all over again. It seems that there is literally nothing i can do to control these irrational thoughts, they always come back. It has even prevented me from being in a lasting relationship because almost everyday i just start to assume im doing something wrong and they just want me to leave them alone. Sometimes i even think my family has had enough of me, i just feel so out of place sometimes. What is wrong with me and how do i help myself?

TLDR: i have reaccuring thoughts that my friends dont like me and theres nothing i can do about it."

Ive forgotten how to be myself around people except for a close few. I always think Ill say the wrong thing or sound weird or just be irrelevant to any conversation so I tend to just barely speak at all. It feels like my whole life is a performance and Im constantly under pressure to fit in. just 2 years ago I was carefree and outgoing and got along with every one as if they were my best friend and then anxiery and depression hit especially after smoking a lot of weed. Ive just forgotten who I was and I dont know if its just maturity and growth as Im 18 now or Ill just never be able to be my authentic self and enjoy a conversation with people. It is hard because I feel like I come off to people as ignorant and rude because I dont make an effort much to talk in work but that's just how I prefer it atm because if I were to speak I would overthink everything I say and it just wouldnt be worth the stress. Has anyone been in a similar situation and can give me some advice? Id really appreciate it Im trying to change"
1004,Having Sudden Feel Of Emptiness and Drought,"I’m 19, still young, got many things to do in life still. Been through a lot of failure recently these past few years. Failed to get selected to my dream Academy two times. My foundation got wrecked hard due to not attending classes because of the interviews. Got a heart complication after an accident during my cycling training. Well basically too much crap happened in a link of failures.

At some points in my life, I felt very empty. Feeling so useless... my parents think I’m lost of direction...  I started to change ambition... but lost their trust... im not sure is it because of my failures or choices I made through my high school years and pre University years...

At certain day or night I feel so drowned... like I’m suffocating, don’t know what to do with my life. Always doing stuffs I really like for example gaming and cycling... but these few years, I lost the feel of enjoyment doing those things... sometimes I willl just sleep for a longer period of time just to not give a damn about the world or feeling the feel of being dead...

I know this is not healthy to do... I cycle everyday, do normal daily life activities, follow my routine and all. But slowly I feel empty, like as I’m a zombie."

1006,Betterhelp for affordable therapy,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my experience, in hopes anyone in a similar position may find inspiration to do the same. I wanted to start seeing a therapist before Covid started, and definitely needed to see one after. Unfortunately I lost my job and wasn’t able to afford $200/ hour for an in person therapist (which are all doing video now anyway) so I thought I’d give betterhelp a try. I signed up, completed a detailed survey about my therapy needs and goals, and was matched with a Therapist that specializes in the area I want to work on (she has a PHD and is highly qualified, which was one of my initial concerns) , and she is just lovely. Fast forward 2 months and I’ve been working through past trauma, and making huge progress in my relationship and my life. It feels great and like there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I pay $260/ month (when you sign up if you click the option that you’re unemployed because of COVID, you get a solid discount) , which gets me 1 hour video therapy session / week , and text , email chat back and fourth daily with the therapist. To anyone feeling like it’s just too much right now, I recommend giving it a try. There’s no commitment and you can cancel anytime. They gave me a link to share with people that gets you a free week of therapy. Hope this is helpful ! [free week of therapy with betterhelp](https://www.betterhelp.com/rpc/1c2930aa78886d1a-1-11)"

1008,How do you feel worthy enough to work on yourself ?,"I have been struggling with anxiety, depression and fear for a long time now. I am not confident enough in my decisions to be able to accept them and work on them. I am also not confident in myself to feel 'worthy' of even trying. Of being a beautiful person. It feels weird, because I know for myself that all people are worthy. The same. And that it is not even about worth. But I am just afraid to live my own life. I feel like I just don't belong here, and I don't really want to live..
I am slowly coming out of a cult, and it has played a big factor in all the fear. But I feel like I will never accept myself enough to live. Life is a haze of fear and impulsive decisions. And when they are not impulsive, (they still feel like that) I am impulsive in trying to fail them all, because I feel I don't deserve beautiful things. I just make it difficult for myself to prove that I shouldn't even try.. 
How do you work towards self-love?
I am stuck.

I don't think that I'm emotionally ready to handle it. I don't feel like an adult. I don't know what I want to do with my life or how to go about getting it. I'm supposed to get a car and a house and a girlfriend and a bunch of other things, but I don't even know where to start. I wish that there was some sort of roadmap that I could follow. I'm terrified, that if I just rely on my own sense of intuition, I'll just screw things up. I hate thinking about all of this. It makes me sick to my stomach and puts me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. The worst part is how immature I feel about all of it. I feel like, if I wasn't such a whiny man child, I'd have already figured this out. There's a lot of self-hatred inside of me right now and I'm worried that it'll eventually drive me insane."

1013,I AM SO TIRED BUT I NEED TO BE OPTIMISTIC AND WORK HARD,"Hi. I'm Li and as you've noticed in my account, what I usually do on reddit is advertise my art to earn commissions. I've scored a few commissioned works that has help me earn for my tuition fee this semester. Though I still need like a thousand more, I was quite happy about it 'cause I am a few dollars closer to achieving my target BUT then bills and stuff happened. My brother is going to college, my mother's salary is reduced because of the pandemic (we can barely live with how much it was originally), my father can't work cause he can no longer walk straight and I still have a 6-year old baby bro who also goes to school. I haven't graduated college yet and life hasn't been easy for us, I've been used to it but there are times when I just want to vent about stuff. Like right now. I feel like everything's just jumbled and messy and very very disappointing, The closer I am to earning my tuition fee, the more money problems I encounter, the more money I need to work hard for to help my family. Honestly, I am so drained. My back hurts from drawing things 24/7 straight weeks. My emotional health isn't in good places lately. And though I've been trying to get optimistic, life can sometimes destroy you in a second. I try to rest but then I'm always reminded about this financial problems. And I hate it like even resting only gives me more time to think about problems.

My mother tells me I'm not obliged to help but I just can't leave her, turn my back or watch her tire herself out. She's been stressing a lot. And I don't want to be a burden to her so I try to get as much gigs, commissioned works BUT it's just taking a toll on me. I am so tired. I am really, really tired. Nothing is getting better even if I try.  I just want to disappear and come back when it's all better. But even with all these emotions and heaviness I'm feeling, I still try and be positive and keep looking for more jobs or anything I can do. I think the money I've been saving will go to my family. I don't feel bad about giving it to them. I'm just frustrated that even with the amount of work I'm doing, it's never enough.

I don't wanna tell this to anyone I know especially my family so I'm turning to reddit. And no, I don't wanna have me checked to a psychiatrist because that thing needs money as well. I don't have it. 

I'm sorry if this was long. I'm sorry if I'm just overreacting. Please don't leave any bad comments, it's better to ignore me. But thank you if you've read this up until here.

I may not reply to your comments as I am only here to vent and I am not good at communicating or talking, responding to people. But I do appreciate messages and I'll be reading them still. Thank you."

But whenever we talk she only seems to focus or talk about her physical state. Her whole house is full of tissueboxes, painkillers, bandaids etc.
Last week she canceled on me because she felt a cold coming up. I'm a little worried. 
It has been like this for a year now almost (gradually getting more severe) , and since corona she rarely will leave the house. 

I DON'T doubt her actual complaints and discomfort, and I truly believe she doesn't feel well when she says so. But I want to have a talk with her to see if we can help her together, or maybe understand her situation better, but I don't know how best to approach this. What do think?"
1016,"I need help, we live in a household where the foster child yelled at us that it will end bloddy the next time..","Hello redditors,

That's the first time posting something on reddit.. I just need help right now.. (ignore typos, pls) also im sorry when the stuff I write is a bit twisted. My head is just a hurricane atm. 

Short story abouth me. I'm a 20 years old boy who moved away from my alcoholic father 3 years ago. I moved from Germany to Austria. to my fiance which I've known vor 10 + years now.  I know his family is toxic but it was better than living with my dad. (He luckily never beat me but was  away often, lots of woman, lots of alcohol, lots of fighting yelling. Some of his ex gf's came to fight with him and got themself drunk af.)

Well now I live here and my fiancé is in a mental hospital because of Anorexia. (he gets good help and I'm happy that he's there.) Well you guys need to know something abouth his family.
He lives with his mother, his step-dad and a foster child.
Well the step dad is ignorant as Frick, the foster child is spoiled af.
It takes drugs, once I called the police on him because he kept banging on the door playing with a knife on 1.a.m, when he's in a fight with the mom of my fiance. He treathens to destroy everything here.
He does nothing in this hous, yet complains abouth having it soo hard. Stealing money from the mother, stealing cigarettes. Smoking weed (well if it just stayed by weed he would be calmer.), I don't know if he's taking some chemical drugs but I know he drinks.
He brings a boy home who sexual abused my fiance when they were teens.
Well the mother of my love just always comes with the slang ""oh its puperty!""
One day the foster child literally fricked with his gf and the door was open.. My fiance saw it and told them to close their door next time.. He yelled at my fiance that the next time he comes up with such bullshit that ""it will end bloody."" Jesus I was standing at the doorframe ready to take that Bastard down after I heard what he said.
The mother again was just like: ""Oh he will calm! That's just puperty!""
He also is just so disrespectful to their mother. He lives here since he was a thew months old.. I know that his real mother abused him, didn't wanted him but that doesn't give you the right to do such things.
He got therapy when he was a child but just is spoiled so fricking bad..

Well now the present, he still complains why we don't feed the dogs when Noone else does. Because ""his mother has so much to do.""
He complains that ""he has such a hard day."" when he's sitting al day at home (his gf basicly also lives here now.. Who brings him EVERYTHING. She brings him his food she takes out HIS trash.). 
He is telling EVERYONE he knows that I'm a transmasculin boy. 
I've heard once what he was talking abouth me.. What a bitch I am, and the guy hes talking with told him, that when he would be here he ""would brake me, that I know my position in this house.""  (after they told them that I'm  transgender) 
And the mother of my fiance does NOTHING against it.. 

Now I also hear that ""I'm bad influence on her son."" (my fiance not the foster child) 
Well I'm the reason her only biological child is still alive. I did everything for him, I skipped school to pick him up when he didn't had therapy because I knew he could not be left alone. I watched over him that he at least gets something to eat. I drove him EVERYWHERE, I called like 30 therapist to get one for him. I got him inside this mental hospital... 
And now I need to hear from a mother who ignores the health of her child that I'm bad influence... 
The carrying for her son gave me burnout, I had my transition, I can't find therapy for myself for 1 1/2 year now.. I struggle with major depression and Ptsd.. I nerd to quit a year from my school because I need to get myself inside a mental health hospital now. But it would bring nothing, because I would come home and would be still in constant fear. 

We don't have money and first need to get help by the government, but that's a lot of paperwork. Also I don't know how long it will take.. Also I don't know if we'll get enough for an apartment.. I'm so fricking scared to live here, my ptsd is triggered so hard. The kid is a ticking bomb. I don't know when the next brake out will be. Noone would care because ""it's just puperty.""

I'm done, my whole body is just, with every loud door I instantly look the room.. Also the mother wonders why I sometimes look the door at night. 

Just.. Need help from you guys.. If anyone can help us with what's so called  ""Sozialhilfe"" in Austria.. We need to get out of this house to get healthy, and I want to be healthy. I just don't have any strength anymore.. I told my fiance he should not worry I got the government stuff, because he couldn't handle it right now. He should focus on himself.. (easyer said than done with me drowning in ptsd at home..)"

I’m in constant fear of being rejected and replaced. I’m scared of being not important to someone anymore. I don’t want pressure or competition (like another person appears and he or she “threatens” my relationships or seems to replace me). If I get the feeling that competition arises, I want to flee. I don’t want to have to fight. I’m too scared of losing. Maybe that’s self-protection, or maybe it’s just stupid. I’m scared of being not enough. I’m scared of being lonely and therefore I can be clingy, which makes me feel like I’m a burden.

I have social anxiety and depression and my energy levels for things like being social fluctuates a lot. I feel shitty when I have to cancel, especially because he will mention it in a mocking way when I do it. But I also feel shitty for rejecting him.

1025,Recurring Nightmares Targeting Different Fears/Insecurities,"I've been having dreams for the past month or so about many fears/insecurities. It's feels like a different theme every week and can even be stuff I didn't know I was afraid of.
For example I've had dreams about losing friends or their trust and then I've had dreams about literally having to fight for my rights as a human. Sometimes they end with me fighting off the fear and other times I'm left in despair. 
They started off as just my friends getting angry at me, abandoning me, or being pushed away and then evolved to my own disorder and personality. The ones about my personal issues involved people not accepting me and trying to attack me.
The dream where I had to fight for my rights involved my disorder and I couldn't fight off the oppressors alone and the dream ended with people aiding me and I made it.
Another dream was one where my friends were all ganging up on me angrily and I didn't know what to do but curl up and cry and it ended like that.

I quit my job just before lockdown as I needed to be able to work round my son and I have zero childcare options other than myself. So I thought I'll work from home as beauty therapist. I started a free business course and booked on some beauty training then the lockdown hit. I still haven't been able to start my business  as all my training has been cancelled and been stuck in limbo.
I distracted myself by doing up the garden and painting the house. But now I've hit a wall. No motivation, no passion, no money.
I'm devastated. I'm 31 with no job, I feel so stuck and alone and isolated its unreal. 
My son is more on the demand avoidance spectrum  and everything I suggest to do, or anything I do he hates. I've tried reverse psychology  but he's too clever for that. So there is absolutely  no reward in my life. I dont have many friends I feel I've been so isolated as there has been so so much I've had to deal with with my son over the years, again on my own.

My dream wasn't beauty therapy, it was wildlife conservation but I had to leave uni because my son was removed from school because they couldn't cope with him. So I sadly quit my dreams to get my son in a better position, which is an ongoing rollercoaster and I'm scared of the future.

1027,Excessive daydreaming?,"I tend to daydream a lot. By a lot I mean that I daydream in every moment that I'm not talking to someone(I dont talk to people much but I'll do it while sitting next to someone or even immediately after a conversation with someone). I'm very aware of the fact that the world in my head is not real, but I cant help but slip back at every chance that I get. Do you think this might be unhealthy?"

1029,What is wrong with me?,"Hi Reddit. 
I'm sitting here in my bed crying as I write this. I'm not too sure where to start. During the last couple of weeks, my mental health has been worse than it ever has. My work is so stressful and physically taxing (I work in food service), my relationship with the love of my life is deteriorating because I can barely even function on a day-to-day basis, and I feel so much pain and like I'm totally helpless.

I woke up today feeling so great. Last night, my girlfriend and I worked out a small problem we had this week. We planned on seeing eachother later today for fireworks and a friend's gathering, but I will no longer be seeing her for a long time after the events that took place this morning.

My hair is my life. I'm a male, but I live and breathe rock and roll. I spend hours making my hair look the best it can possibly look. This morning, my mom decided it was time for me to get a small trim. She had trimmed my hair in the past, so I trusted her to do a good job. I had to stop her about halfway thru the proccess because she cut my hair so damn short. I've spent the whole day crying because I don't know what to do.

I've lost so much of myself in the past few weeks. I've lost my self image and my sense of being the person I am. Losing the one thing I love most and the thing that is synonymous with my self image and my name is devastating, but nobody (and especially my parents) understand the pain I am feeling right now.

I don't know what to do. I never want to leave my house again. I never want to see my friends again. I cancelled all of the plans I had made for today and tomorrow. My friends and my girlfriend are so disappointed. I feel so alone and helpless right now.

Should I shave my head? What do I tell everyone? I'm so hurt and I just need to share this with somebody. I'm sorry if I sound crazy. I really am sorry."
1030,Fellow OCD sufferers: I don't know where my boyfriend's OCD ends and what is true anymore,"He's 20, undiagnosed but it's pretty obvious he has it. Today I've felt so overwhelmed and like I don't even know what's him and what's OCD anymore. 

He confessed to being in a bar/pub with his friends a few months ago when loads of 16-18 year olds were out (this is Ireland so underage drinking is pretty common). He thought one who was 17ish was hot and felt really guilty. Then he heard about some 17 year old girl and another guy that age having sex outside and he was scared he found that idea hot or if its just because he would've liked that at that age or if it's just that it would be hot if I wanted to do that with him. He also confessed to not being sure if he's into the idea of virginity and taking it? We were both virgins when we met at 18. I'm a feminist and deeply troubled by the patriarchal notions of purity and shit. He said he is scared he would be into the idea of ""showing someone what to do"" and is scared that makes him a major creep, even though he never recalls actively thinking or fantasizing about this.  He also admitted to being scared about the idea of a new, fresh model, like a 17/18 year old virgin and be can't tell if it's intrusive or not?

I'm so so upset Reddit. This all came out while we had a 2 hour conversation where I asked like 30 questions to discover whether or not he is a creep. He was near tears and flustered and couldn't give me straight answers and said I was interrogating him. I feel so broken and useless, like I'm already old and boring at 20!!! My therapist thinks I too have OCD because I'm so obsessed with whether or not he's a bad person."

1035,Can depression or antidepressants cause disorientation?,
1036,Trigger Warning: Heavy sad stuff &gt; I wanna get checked but at the same time I don't wanna if there is something there...,"ive just woken up ffrom a drinking episode(note i havent had a drink since december) so im sorry about any rudeness and english errors.  


I've struggled with this for months now as it's just gotten a bit INSANE in the last few months. And I wake up and it's the first thing I think about and perpetuates through my day.

A lot of my life, I have felt completely just off. Nothing has felt right or well stable, especially when I think back to my school days with friends I always felt off, like I was there with them but just not at the same time something was never right.

Growing up in my teens I struggled with massssssive depression for a long time starting when I was 13, I wanna say starting at 12 but at 12 it was when things started going downhill, but 13 was the rolling down the hill. By 14 and 15 with ALOT of things tumbling down. I was just completely dead inside, at 15 I tried to kill myself by slashing my arms, legs, wrists, thighs and torso hoping I bleed to death into the night. Poor mum finds me, rings dad and we go see a ""therapist"" who btw wasn't the most helpful person I naturally bounced back without her ""breathing exercises"", I get the whole mindfulness thing, I'ma psych student but back then it didn't cut it for me. Her therapy wasn't helpful and I feel guilty that my parents paid her for a terrible service or what I thought of as a terrible service.  


 While to be noted I am transgender, the second I figured this out it made so much sense why I have this constant disassociation with my body and my identity as a whole. After repressing that for so long I finnally sucked it up and well so far beginning my transition has IMMENSELY given me a good will to live, everyday my disassociation with my body feels less and less as time goes on. But I feel there is something else that ails me.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my friends pointed out that sometimes despite me reporting positive things as we talk alot, she asked why I would go through depressive episodes then ""bounce back outta it like a crack addict who just won tons of cash"". I thought nothing of it but I was bored late at night at 4am and went ""googling"" i know trust me im kicking myself doing it. But I feel like my impulsiveness and my episode cycles seem to point towards bipolar. I can recall many times going through a depressive few weeks not knowing why and then one day absolutely nothing changes and I want to just feel the rush of driving at 200kmh and my whole mindset is racing and I go and do stupid things without a logical way of thinking or assessing them, all of which in that moment i know ""ITS GONNA BE GOOD ITS GONNA BE GOOD"" and then when i wind down i think back and its like ""what the actual fuck were you thinking"". heck sometimes in my uppity WEEEW states i get suicidal ideation? i dont wanna killmyself i really dont, not anymore never now. but i sometimes get the little thought train of ""WOULDNT THAT BE HILARIOUS"" and then it turns into a full thought out suicide plan though i do not want to kill myself, nor feel the urge to anymore at all. death now terrfies me more than ever. 15yo me was ready to blissfully launch myself into a bus.

&amp;#x200B;

theres so much moreeee i wanna say but i just cant rn im in a downy state the past few weeks waiting for a WEEEW. 

&amp;#x200B;

the thing is. I want to go see someone a professional or whatever. but im terrified of receiving a diagnosis and following a treatment, i honetly wouldnt want to be treated IFFFF i have something else in my head. the thing is if i dont have something, then why the hell do i feel so off despite practically saving myself and having a will and a drive to better myself in relation to my transition? 

i just feel like i wanna know why i dont feel right and if theres nothing wrong with me then why does it feel like that. im pretty sure i have bipolar but i just dont wanna find out but i do if i really do or if im just trying to find anything that just explains why i feel so off and why i behave the way i do."
1037,So I think I might be getting better,"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for the past 5 years of my life now. I am 20 and have never had a full diagnosis. A it would switch between major depressive disorder to borderline to bipolar disorder. Either way to me the diagnosis hasn’t been that important. I’m on a cocktail of medications such as lamictal, abilify, and have recently added Prozac. I’ve been taking Prozac for a while and when talking to my psychiatrist I do think my life is getting better and it seems to be working. This is the most improvement I’ve seen in myself for that past 5 years and well I just want to say that because I’m happy and all my other friends are depressed and I don’t want to rub it in their faces."

I am very embarrassed by it and would die of shame if someone ever read it but my main worry is the fact that I wanna write it so bad, daydreaming is awesome and imagination is way clearer than words but I just feel this \*need\* to write. I wonder if it's a mental health thing..."
1040,Do you know any resources where I can get free therapy and consultation?,[deleted]
1041,I feel unstable,"I’ve lived a relatively sheltered life until I was 24 (very few friends, went to uni 5mins away from my house, never did anything social in college/uni). 

This is partly due to my dad, who’s slightly overprotective &amp; would rather I stay home than go out. Couple this with my introverted &amp; meek personality and you have someone who rarely explored life. 

At 24, I got my first job, started driving, saw someone for the first time, and plunged head first into the real world. It was a steep learning curve which I think affected me mentally. 

I feel like I’m going through an arrested development and feel a disconnect to my age (26 now). I’m trying my best to pick things up &amp; get out there but I constantly feel like I’m drowning. I come off as naive compared to peers my age &amp; I have difficulty forming friendships &amp; relationships because of this. The first person I saw was 2 years older than me but they broke it off partly due to differences in life experience levels.

I don’t trust anyone because I feel like everyone is somehow operating on a level above me. I’m supposed to date guys my age or above but I don’t feel comfortable with it. People my age are starting to settle down when I’ve barely started learning about my surroundings.

I feel like I’m spinning out of control &amp; have difficulty sensing boundaries &amp; am afraid of going overboard. I constantly convince myself of outlandish ideas (planning solo trips, embarking on new projects, etc), only to realize the ridiculousness of it a few days later. I don’t trust myself &amp; am highly codependent because of this. Is this a cause for concern?"
1042,is there a way to trick the body into turning off the fight or flight response?,"I'm literally just chilling in my room on a nice sunny day, drawing with my favorite candle lit while listening to my favorite youtube channel, no plans for today really, and my body feels like the same type of ""fear"" you get when you're in the basement and you turn off the lights,  ready to go up and you race up the stairs cause you feel like something's going to chase you or something... it's a terrible feeling and my body feels like it wants to flee but I'm in no danger"
1043,What are your biggest struggles?,"I'll start.

My biggest struggle is to live by the hatred that exists on the internet (or in general, but more so online). I'm generally a tough person but I think it can get to anyone, no matter how tough they are.
Especially with the news of predators calling outs &amp; reckfuls passing... It's been really tough.
And you know what? I feel terrible for the victims, reckful included. But I also feel bad for those people who get called out. When the whole world is against you it doesn't make sense to think of yourself as anything but what they're saying about you. And yeah they deserve it - but it's so fucking brutal. I don't know if anyone is doing better by raising their pitchfork and wishing the absolute worse for another person, without ever having room for any kind of forgiveness. Am I terrible for thinking that? 
I just wanted to give a warm but funny message to someone who (I thought always appreciated humour) but someone replied with so much fucking aggression because I overstepped a little, that wasn't the worst part of everything that I just said but I think this just broke me. I'm actually so thankful for this person for calling me out on it because joking isn't always appropriate and I didn't know. But holy fuck were all human beings.

Twitter can be such a terrible place to be sometimes."
1044,Please suggest me how to cope.,"Hi, I’m a 20 year old girl whose been through some things, i thought i was past all of them, that i was stronger and happier, but i’ve been experiencing shortness of breath almost every night before i go to sleep, i have an empty feeling in my stomach, i have trouble falling asleep and i’m always feeling so tired and dizzy... can anyone suggest me how to cope with them? It’s not comfortable."
1045,How do I escape this immature mind and start acting and feeling like an adult?,"I am so ashamed. I am 21F and I have never had a job, or a boyfriend, I can’t drive, have no friends, and have been socially isolated from my peers for six years. I live with my “family” and it is a toxic place to be. I feel like I cannot escape my child-like self living with them, yet I seem to be too incompetent to move out. I still feel 15/16 and have never done anything by myself. I have been to numerous psychologists/therapists over the course of my life, but it seems that none of them have ever really evaluated me and helped. However, I have always convinced myself that they must see nothing to evaluate and I am just being a hypochondriac and reading too much into things that aren’t there. I worry that I have autism, adhd, or a personality disorder.

I have tantrums, complain endlessly because I can’t think of any ways to solve my problem, cannot handle social situations, am obsessive, have no hobbies, has germaphobia, no self-esteem, am not able to focus on things, secretly likes childish stuff such as nostalgic cartoons, just to name a few things. I’ve been at this awhile. I’ve tried multiple meds (anti-depressants/psychotics, mood stabilizers) to no avail and was introduced to DBT but ultimately decided it was not for me (it was not convincing at all). I am finally going to have an intensive psychological evaluation and I am scared. I am partially scared it won’t find anything wrong and that this is just how I am. I don’t think I could continue living with myself if that were true. I’m a college student (online) and I feel I am learning nothing and wasting time and money (that I don't even have). I just would like to be a smart, mature, and functioning adult. Please let me know if you have advice. I have no one else to ask."
1046,"Why people who got ""everything"" does it","Hi everyone.

I don't know if I can ask this here, but I would like an answer on something.

Why people that seems to be happy, have money, a job, a activity that they like, someone, friends, still commit the act of suicide ?

I understand totally that having all this doesn't mean everything, but what about people that even got way less and doesn't commit suicide. Society standards dictate this sense of having everything.

I had a theory that it is because the one who nearly got everything has maybe nothing else to do anymore, compared to the one that got less. In my opinion that's not enough to drive to suicide, then, I am not judging. I heard that it's a lot about mental health and diseases.

What do you think ? Could you enlighten me please ?"
1047,A Story of Treatment Resistive Depression,"As the title says I've suffered with depression for almost 10 years on and off, but mostly every day. I started abusing opiates at a very young age and it seemed to fix all of those problems. It gave me the opportunity to completely escape from all of my problems in the matter of seconds. This went on for 3 or 4 years until I overdosed. 

I was driving in the car with two other people I knew to pick up. I ended up being sold heroin that was cut with Fentanyl. Unknowingly, I used the normal dose that I would use but it was far too powerful. I don't remember much, but I do remember waking up in the hospital with a police officer and my mom standing over me. The pure look of horror on my mom's face was instantly enough motivation to try to get sober. 

So I went through rehab, the first time it didn't really stick but the second time I went through something clicked. That was in February 2013. I remember distinctly the exact day I decided I would no longer subject myself or my family to everything that comes with addiction. I was literally shooting myself in the foot everyday hoping a miracle would happen to save me. The answer I eventually came to was that the only way I would be able to stay sober was to give it my all and really WANT to stay sober. Since then, I've been completely sober. 

I wish I could say that it magically fixed all of my depression issues but it didn't, if anything it made it a lot worse. It wasn't until I started seeing a therapist and actively trying different anti depressants until I realized I was finally starting to find some semblance of happiness. 

I can't say today that I'm 100% happy, but I definitely have found a way to accept that there are some things I'll never be able to change. Everyone I've hurt in the past has forgiven me, but forgiving myself is and always has been the hardest part. I'm slowly getting there and just want my story to be an example that even in your lowest of lows, things can and always will get better. When you hit rock bottom, there's truly only one way you can go, and that's up. 

Thanks for reading, anyone struggling out there please feel free to message me, im willing to talk about whatever, even if you just need to vent. Sending love everyone's way!"

1050,Why do I get so incredibly angry whenever someone (especially with BPD) has a crush on me?,"I'm in my early twenties and female and idk what's up, it's like whenever I sense or someone admits that they have a crush on me I will initially feel flattered but then as it progresses I will harbour such intense hatred towards them that (depending on how close we are) I will become more and more aggressive towards them. especially when they are mirroring me I will feel VIOLATED and just want to destroy them. I usually just distance myself but there had been an occasional where I ended up becoming physical and outright bullying them. I just can't handle their affection towards me for some reason.

If it helps to know, my mother has bpd and she would always mirror me and paint me as the golden child. And I for some reason really hate people who display any bpd traits."
1051,My uncle almost flew across the country to beat me up. I was a 18 year old woman at the time.,"

I’m going to clear up a few things real quickly so the story doesn’t get confusing. At the time that my uncle threatened me, I was 18years old and I am a woman. He was 44 years old at the time. I did not find out that he threatened to assault me until years later. My mom only told me that he threatened me because she was mad at me about something. She and no one else in my family stood up for me.
I snuck my boyfriend at the time over to my moms house. My mom told personal information about me to other people in my family. My grandmother decided to get involved ,even though I did not ask for her to, and I expressed to her that I Felt disrespected by her getting involved in something that had nothing to do with her. My grandmother got mad and told my uncle and he literally said that he would catch a flight across the country to slap me in the mouth. He told my grandmother and mother. I have talked with him since he had threatened me ,but I did not know at all that he had said that he would hit me. Otherwise, I would’ve never talked to him again. I don’t know how to address the situation or if I should talk to anybody in my family about it because it happened so long ago. I never talk to him or see him but there are times when we will come together as a family and he doesn’t know that I know that he threatened me. I don’t even really want to bring it up to my family because I feel like they are going to take his side. But there will eventually come a time where I need to and will have to say something to him. Does anyone have any tips for how should I approach this?"
1052,What is an over-giver?,"I've found myself in a unusual circumstance where I'm told that just looking at my life for the past year, my therapist told me that I seam to have the qualities of an over-giver. To make things clear i have had a bad run of events recently with a injury that has caused me to not be able to work, throwing me off my groove of life. To being a young independent man that had to move back with his parents because I no longer had an income due to said injury and along the way I've found that I'm still giving even when I have nothing. What little I have saved up on someone over here just to make them happy for a small but, a small bit there to get my siblings icecream while I watch them while my parents work. The only thing is I have nothing else to give now and I am utterly and gravely depressed about it. Before I could finance my giving due to long hours at work and overtime that I was able to budget out of a extra spending weekly which most the time I never spent on myself directly. And now I can't help but feel a sense of loneliness due to me not being able to afford to go out with friends because I have no money or what ever you can think of in a quarentine environment. But I can't help but feel like me spending money on people was the extent of my social life, even if I was used I didn't mind. But now I feel like I have no one with me, and for so long I've been so emotionally drained that I've been able to hide it with the satisfaction of others. Now I lay in my bed useless to society just wishing someone would come and hug me. Just some sort of satisfaction that I exist in their life. But now I don't have any of that, and it really hurts to think that my whole recovery has been me just giving what I can and being able to be alright with that but when it all comes crashing down I have nothing and am nothing. Just wanted to share with everyone since I don't really have anyone I'd directly tell it too so thankyou for reading through."
1053,My Mental Health Experience,"It's a long story and feel free to ask any questions if you feel like you need more info.

I have suffered from what I perceive as depression for the majority of my life. School was tough, I had friends and was never bullied apart from the odd slap around and a lot of name calling. However, I was a weird kid and a lot of people suddenly turned on me for no apparent reason. Barely anyone wanted anything to do with me. I have been skinny my entire life (6'4 140lbs currently) but I do not look anorexic. It used to really affect me, not so much from 18-23, but now I am 24, I am letting it start to bug me again, ever so slightly.

I struggled to make friends especially in secondary school, and a lot of my friends I found out were not genuine and used to snake me a lot. This has led to a few trust issues etc. I also found out shortly after my parents were divorcing, that my mum was cheating on my dad (I found the texts) which led me to turn on her. She became very, very nasty towards my dad, which made me turn on her. Strange because I have always been terrified of my dad, until I saw him cry when my mum said she didn't love him anymore. I was 14 at the time. My now ex girlfriend had also cheated on me and I took it very hard. I was 19 when this happened. I ended up pulling the evidence out of her, when she returned from her holiday.

These are the main things I can think of that may have contributed to my childhood trauma. I was also arrested with my friends when I was 19 (a few weeks before my GF cheated) after getting into a fight with half of the pub we were at. All of our friends turned on us, and it was just us 4 for a while. It didn't lead to anything but I was constantly on edge that someone would jump me after that. My friends also started to become anxious people, when they were the most sociable, fun people you could meet.

Now, for roughly the past few years, I have suffered from anxiety, the rare panic attack, and just generally feeling like shit. I have been a daily weed smoker (usually one a night, or a few in the evening if with friends) and sometimes I think that this is a main contributor. However, I have smoked for around 2/3 years before that without any issues.

I also tried LSD once, around 3 years ago. It was the worst experience of my life. The first hour was incredible - so enlightening, and then I felt like I had been dragged into a mental hospital and left inside a padded room. Time had stopped, and I was terrified. I couldn't stop throwing up for hours.

I have had a lot of suicidal thoughts but I doubt I would ever act on them. I'm very bipolar in the sense that I have very good days, but sometimes it just gets too much and the bad days come. It leads to me laying in bed, ovetthinking absolutely everything you could imagine.

I also developed a lot of anger the past few years, I can go hot headed very easily now, just like my dad, despite me being a pussy most of my life. I have also been quite a lazy and unmotivated person, even before I began smoking weed.

I have also gotten myself into a lot of debt from payday loans, just generally spending money on anything as if it was fake currency. I am slowly but surely reducing it, and it should be all over by next year.


If you have any advice how to beat the anxiety, let me know. Thank you for reading."

1057,Can anyone advise me on what I might actually have/ what is wrong with me,"I’ll cut a long story short. Lost my farther to suicide a few months back. I was pretty sad/lonely ( probably depressed ) ect before hand. But this has started something new 

Absolutely everything is boring, the hobbies I used to love have become mundane in every way. If there is no risk in what I’m doing. I can’t see the point in doing it 

I find my self purposely seaking negative situations, because that’s the only way I can feel. I want to hit rock bottom to see how bad it really is. 

I avoided fixing something on my car knowing full well it could cause an accident or lead to an even bigger repair job. Because if I did have a crash, I’d at least feel something. Some small rush. 

My general regard for safety and well-being of myself has all but diminished. I don’t care what happens. I just want to feel something. 

I’ve done some research but I can only come as close as a serous adrenaline addiction. 

I can very closely relate to the movie character Tyler durden from fight club, and the tv character rick from rick and morty. Both massive nihilists. 

Any one got any ideas? 

thanks!"
1058,How to cope with my thoughts...,Today I just feel not good enough.... I feel like I am wasting my life. I am studying Biology in university but I can’t stop thinking I am already on 1/4 of my life and haven’t achieved anything. I can’t stop thinking I should start playing an instrument or a sport or something. It is hard to describe how I feel. I want so many things and I can’t do them all at once and it feels like I have to do more than I do right now. Like I have to start dancing classes and photography classes and study abroad and taking music classes. And I don’t know why I feel this way. Why do I feel this way? How do I cope with these thoughts?
1059,good to watch,[removed]
1060,Just wanna vent. Been a while since I let everything out,"So I followed this sub a few days ago and I just thought how nice it is seeing people I relate too and knowing that even though I'm alone in my personal life, I'm not alone in the world. So I thought I'd just tell my story. 

Right now I'm a 24M who has absolutely no idea where my life is leading. Generally speaking, I'm not doing to bad. I have a job, my own apartment, and a car. It's barely running, but it's better than nothing. But that's really all I have. 

I have no friends. I lived with some roommates before I moved into my place at the beginning of the year, but my anxiety got so bad. I had panic attacks and believed that they were talking about me behind my back really badly. I didn't trust any of them at all. One was my best friend for 12 years and I just left and haven't spoken to him since. It makes me feel like shit. I moved here 5 years ago so he was really my only link to being social, and now that I've severed that connection I don't do anything but work and sit in my home. I have no furniture for the simple fact that I know I won't ever have anyone over. I just come home and sit in my room all day. I have no one. 

When I'm home I do next to nothing. I used to love gaming, but now if it's not a multiplayer game that requires little to no effort I just can't seem to keep at it. I used to love single player games and exploring world and things like that, but now it seems as if it just requires more energy than I can possibly gather. And when I finally do start up a game, I can't help but think ""I wonder what so and so would think about this"" or ""I wonder what the general opinion is on this"". Its so hard to immerse myself fully into the game because my thoughts are constantly running. So most of the time I just put something random on TV, lay in bed and find something mind numbing on my phone. I can't watch anime and TV shows like I used to because it feels as if it requires effort to focus on those things and I just don't have it. So I don't do any.  No going out, not contacting anyone. Lay in bed, work, repeat. 

My job isn't a bad job, it's actually very easy, but I hate it. I feel like my co-workers look at me like I'm the weird on because I literally don't talk at all. I never start a conversation, and when someone starts a combo with me it's usually just one word replies, nothing productive to the convo. That pressure to be social has cost me to quit jobs before, not wanting to be the odd one out. I've already thought multiple times of just not showing back up, but I can't. I usually just sit and daydream so the day goes by faster. I can daydream for hours, it can be about the same thing to. Just rethinking it over and over again. Unfortunately I feel as if that's part of the reason why I'm so detached. Another reason I hate it is because I know I could be doing something better. I was so smart in school and had so much potential. I'm not saying I could be a rocket scientist, but if actually cared more I could've been something. Now I'm just wrapping pallets and driving a forklift. It makes me hate myself knowing how far I've fallen. 

Life is just meh. I'm just going through it, hoping something changes, but doing absolutely nothing to change it. But it's because I don't have the energy or effort. I would have to figure out what I really want in life. I can barely shower once a week, how am I supposed to do that? So I'm just going through life repeating the same cycle, all alone. I guess I should say I have my family but they're pretty much in the same if not worse spot I'm in. But they're content with it. And I'm not. I keep telling myself it'll get better, but I don't know if it will. 

I have an appointment with a therapist next month. Which is unfortunately part of the reason I cant quit my job because my insurance is gonna pay for it, but I question if I'll make it another month. And if I don't I don't know what will happen then. 

Sorry for the really long post. There was so much more I wanted to say but I feel this is already just random splurging at this point. Just want to say to everyone that I hope what they say is true, and that it does get better. For all of us."
1061,I need help urgent,"I’m 17 years old and I drank whiskey and blackouted. 2 days later this I’m feeling depression and I feel like

I have no one to talk to"
1062,Some support please,"I have anxiety and depression,

Last night I had a big panic attack and I was all by myself. It passed as they always do and I'm trying so hard to see the positives in this experience.

I've felt so low and sad all day, I've just been crying and crying and it hurts so bad.

Can I have some words of encouragement from anyone please, I need to hear the good stuff right now and from people over than my lovely boyfriend.

I just feel so upset tut anxiety is a part of my life when it's so horrible and it makes me want to die but I don't want to do that."
1063,how do I help a friend?,"Since the start of the year, I've found stuff... struggling to cope with. I've had extreme ups and downs and naturally suicide multiple times before, I had meetings with doctors, self-reflection, etc. The one thing that truly had me happy for life was, playing games. Now, I'm completely infatuated with games, it might be stupid yeah but genuinely, it's the only thing that allows me to be able to cope with life, considering I mainly depersonalise.  The same goes to music, some youtubers and a general thing that I like.

The month before 2020, I made a friend in a game, we friended each other on Steam, eventually moving to discord and started becoming more and more good with one another. More and more did I interact with himbecau rather than the ones I know in real life, simply because sometimes life doesn't cut it and as a person with unsurprisingly low self-esteem, bad social networking and fairly quiet about my problems, I didn't want to bother them. Over the next few months isnce then, they can be described as one of the most happiest parts of my life as we discovered more things about each other, we were essentially... doppelgangers.

What I mean by that is, we shared the same taste of music, games and hobbies. He made me enjoy and appreciate music genres like Hardcore, Speedcore, Artcore, artists like Tano\*C, Sakuzyo, games like OSU and Terraria. All in all, he made me love and enjoy life once more. Of course, however, by doppelgangers, we also shared the same... mental issues. It isn't common for depression on the interent, that's just fact, we shared the same issues between our parents disliking their child for, existing.

His Mom didn't like him, the relationship is strained and she's never done anything for him ever. She doesn't like him for being the ""social kind handsome and smart son she wanted"" despite him being her literal blood-related fucking son. It's honestly appalling to me and I just want her to be happy, at the very least a smile, for him just once. Now, keep in mind that the only reason why he's in an un-loving household is simply because she wanted a girl, not him. 

Two-Three months ago, he had confessed to me, albeit he was drunk and it was late in the night, as his best friend, the first thing I did was ""force"" him to go sleep and forget everything at the moment, I didn't care about what he said at first because I was too focused on getting him to sleep so he doesn't fuck up the next morning. By then, I had noticed it and I didn't know what to say because it was essentially one-sided. Yes, I do love him as a friend but because of self-doubt, our long distance between each other and the fact that he was my literal best friend, I feared that I might fuck up and rejected him.

It didn't change our friendships no, if it did then I would've never made this post. We did, however, got closer to each other, he started opening up more on his life and so did I. His health issues are... something else, from what I know in the hospital, even the people on practical death's door pity him, he's pitied because of his fragile body. I won't go into much details but he has survived corona and multiple surgeries and so forth. 

Right now, however, I don't know how or what to comfort him. What he planned to do was move out when he was of age with the money he's gotten from work, thing is that he has a frail body and is a literal stick figure, having a lack of energy and motivation for every day but, he STILL does work. Why? Simply just to get away from her because it's fucking him up. I fully support him on this, I wish that he would be able to move away from his parents because it's honestly disgusting to me for what negligence they give him but recently, his heart started acting up. In his words, it's a struggle to get up or sleep, precisely because he doesn't know if he'll be awake the next day. I'm a really emotional person and as he's the only form of contact I've had since the few months, I had him promise me, yes it's fucking childish, to try his best and stay alive/healthy. But every day, I know that the chances of it grows slim because of his need for a surgery. Just a few minutes ago, while I started writing it, he sent me""

I work so hard and I still get nothing

""

Honestly, I don't even know why I'm even writing to this at the moment because I'm halfway between crying my eyes out and praying to whatever God's out there for his safety. I want to help him but I don't feel cut out for the job, he needs better people than me but I don't know how I can help him do that. I've contemplated taking a break, making a message to his IRL friends so they can help him out in my place because I feel at fault. I feel that if I didn't come into his life, then this wouldn't have even happened, I feel like I fucking ruined it but I don't know how to fix it or make up for it.

Does anybody have any help or form of suggestion that I can use to help him?

1064,Antidepressants,"I've recently been diagnosed and have been taking antidepressants and anxiety meds for about two weeks now. My doctor has been making two week follow up appointments to determine if I need a higher dose or if my dosage I'm at is working for me. My question is, how do you know if you need a higher dose? The first week I had a lot of side effects and since then have gone. I feel like its helping me with my anxiety but the last three days I've been having intrusive thoughts and feeling very low. I know I'm supposed to still have bad days, but I'm so new to this and don't want to up my dose if we really don't need to."
1065,Sad vent,"So i have been wanting to talk to someone for so long about this. Some days ago, I said something ""political"" in front of my father and the next thing I knew, I was dragged into the room and shouted at. He was like - ""What are you even saying? If someone else hears this, what will they think, what kind of a law student are you?""

For a week, I was traumatized. I didn't understand what I did wrong? I only said something that I believed in and the next thing I knew my father was too concerned about ""what would other people think"" rather than asking me why do I hold such an opinion, what led me to believing in the same but no, I was shouted at. Can children not have opinions contradictory to their parents'? Even after that week, he didn't really talk to me about it we just went back to normal like nothing had happened. And then when I am shy in front of my relatives and don't really talk in front of them, my father rebukes me by saying that I don't have any sense of how to behave in front of other people. Like, you raised me like this who are you even blaming?

I still feel so ashamed from that day like I did something wrong. I feel like I should just leave my house, this country, and just flee away somewhere really really far away, have a new life, and never look back."
1066,Did I win?,"I've was depressed for so many years. It was a constant and potent struggle that I faced alone, without friends, medication or therapy (I tried the latter two to no avail). I caught depression at an early age, during the time I was still developing a personality. As such this disease of the mind had become so ingrained into my being that it ultimately molded me as a person and was solidified into my mind and perception of the world. As the years passed I became more and more indifferent, and less and less in touch with my emotions. At the age of 20 I had declared myself completely and utterly numb and devoid of emotion and beyond return. I was so out of it and apathetic that I would sometimes do outrageous things in public just because I felt impulses to do so, e.g., throwing a glass bottle to the ground shattering it into a thousand pieces for no apparent reason whatsoever. I was no longer able to pick up on social cues and could not hold a conversation for longer than a minute or so because I'd lose interest and walk away.

Now I'm 21 and I still feel nothing, it does however feel like I'm losing the ability to think, the ability to recognize myself as an identity, I'm becoming less aware of myself as a person and I'm becoming more reliant on instincts and impulses. I'm losing my self conscience. Now more than ever I feel content with life, I feel fulfilled, evolved past humanity. And now more than ever I feel the urge to kill myself. Is this the epitome of enlightenment and the meaning of life, did I win?"
1067,I feel dismissed and alone,"So the past few months I've been traveling a lot between my student home and my real home because of the ""situation"". And I've really noticed the difference between home and where I'm studying. It doesn't seem like I have a single friend back home. 

I'm currently at home because of my summer job, and the last few weekends have been horrible. It's okay when I'm at work, but since I've got weekends off I want to do something du ring them. I've been talking to my ""friends"" out here about hanging out, but all of them has either dismissed me or just told me maybe and then made other plans with someone else ASAP.

All I want is someone who isn't my colleague to interact with me without talking about work. Since all of whom I consider my good friends live really far away from me I feel extremely lonely. Communicating with them online just isn't the same. 

I'm at a huge loss and I'm really far down. I feel like it's unfair that all these people that I thought were my friends seemingly dislikes me. This might sound dramatic, but I've honestly tried too many times to spend time with them without results.

I've always been told that you should be the friend you'd want to have, and I think I've followed that philosophy all my life. I love my friends to bits, but they not a single one seems to ""repay"", so to speak, the favor. And this whole thing just makes me wonder if they dislike me because I'm some kind of horrible person or if there's something wrong with me. 

It's late at night and my good friends are either asleep or out partying atm so I can't even reach out to them. I would really appreciate it if someone could help me feel a little better, because for the past few hours my minds just been dragging me further down the rabbit hole.

Sorry for the formatting (mobile), potential typos and the cluttered rant. I'm not really at my best atm.. Also I'm completely new to this subreddit, but I really just wanted somewhere to vent and someone's to talk too and thought this was the place."
1068,Why do I feel this way and how can I feel better?,"For some time now I’ve been feeling...off. I don’t feel like doing anything but sleeping and I never have the energy to go out. I don’t even like talking to my friends anymore...it feels like a chore more than anything. My family says that I’ve been really irritable. I think I’m starting eating more than usual too. Not to mention the bad dreams I’ve been having lately. I don’t feel happy, but I’m not sad, like crying all the time sad.

I was hoping you guys would be able to help me out. How can I feel good again? I’ve heard that the bad diet can make you feel sluggish so is there foods I should start eating to feel better? 

Edit: I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post to, I should’ve posted to a diet subreddit instead. But your suggestions are still appreciated."
1069,Either I’m experiencing mild paranoia or I’m being followed by a ghost,"So for some background recently I visited a cemetery to see my uncles grave, I visited his grave and after that I explored for a little bit and then I left.

So I came to the conclusion I’m either experiencing mild paranoia or I’m being followed by a ghost/spirit. What do you think?"

1071,My mind is refusing to work at all what do I do,"So basically the situation is I’ve been rendered completely unable to do my hobbies and can barely manage to take care of myself. It’s like my brain is constantly shut off, but the rest of me isn’t. I have desires to do something- like draw or play a video game- but I can’t actually do it. I just can’t be present enough and actually have that kind of mental clarity. Lately I’ve just been trying to sleep all the time because I just can’t fill up all the time in the day. It’s really caused a lot of stress with me and my parents because I can’t even do things I want to 99% of the time, how am I going to do things I have to do??? It’s also made it extremely hard to make friends because I just can’t really care about much anymore (of course since I’m on the autism spectrum it was already hard, but this lack of cognitive function has added a whole new degree of difficulty) and just have trouble following conversations and thinking of things to say. 
The situation just feels so hopeless and it really hurts, the idea that I’ll be miserable, lonely and listless forever. So far nothing I’ve tried with my doctor and therapist has helped and I can’t explain this to my family in a way that they can understand. I just want to be ok again... 
If you know of any resources that can help I’m from SE Texas. I sure hope they work, it feels like even reaching out and saying something’s wrong is becoming a huge challenge!"
1072,"just started zoloft for anxiety, severe anger - lots of questions (19F)","hi there, 19F here! :) i will try to keep it nice and short for anyone reading! for about two months, I've been having severe anger issues and anxiety. it started out as irritability but started to consume my everyday. every little thing now bothers me. if someone eats a way i don't like, I'll get angry. if someone says something or does something i disagree with, i cannot handle it. i dropped a pint of blueberries at work (i work at trader joes) and i blacked out with rage for a second. i have lots of road rage, flipping people off, screaming in the car. i had an episode a few weeks ago and stabbed my dads hand with some car keys (he is completely fine and i felt so bad immediately afterwards). i've also been having violent, intrusive thoughts. images that scare me and are very aggressive, violent (not my nature at all).  to keep it short, I'll just put it out there that this is only the tip of the iceberg. 

my psychiatrist prescribed me half a tablet of a Zoloft a day (half of a 25mg tab) and we talked about me not smoking weed as well to see if things change. i just took my first pill today at 2:30pm. my plan is to take it everyday at this time. i know i probably should've taken it in the morning or night but i was having a major anxiety attack and decided to just start it now. 

I've always been scared of mental health medication and would like to hear others' experiences with this medication and/or anger issues. how can i get my life under control besides this medication? are there side effects to Zoloft?"

1075,Just need to let go of this,"I didn't think COVID would be this bad. I spent all of last year struggling out of isolation and just as I was gaining momentum, quarantine happened. Zoom is a poor substitute for seeing people, but all of my MFA classes next semester will be online, the twelve step group I attend is only online, even the writers' group I joined uses conference calls in the near future. Safety first, but damn man... 

I slip back into old patterns week by week. I'm trying, I promise, to stay engaged in the world. I'm taking courses, I'm still getting to most of my meetings and the group meetings, I write ever day, but it just sucks. I feel like I'm imprisoned at home again.  

When I talk to my fellow travellers, I feel like I'm supposed to say I'm getting better, that I'm doing tons of work and I'm not struggling anymore. Admittedly, I have a victimhood streak - my suffering WAS part of my identity, but I can't tell what the difference is between feeling so empty and clinging to it.

Any help is appreciated!"
1077,Need help identifying a constant cycle,"Sorry for the long post. I just have been noticing a bad pattern in my life that I don't really know what it is. I've been having a lot of up and down moments. Sometimes it'll all happen in a day or sometimes I'll feel incredibly down one day and then the next day, I have lots of energy. To be more detailed, on the days where I feel low (or moment of the day where I feel it), I just stay in bed and let my mind focus on so many various negative thoughts. I know, it's unhealthy, but it's become such a constant and reoccurring thing that I feel I can no longer stop and I just let it run it's course because a 'up' moment usually follows eventually. It also doesn't help that, during these low moments, my eating disorder is worsened to a max. That's another bad thing that's come out of my self-quarantine, my eating disorder, but I feel like that's getting sidetracked. Then, during my up days or moments in a day, I feel so energized. I begin to feel like doing all these new, random things. My mind becomes so fixated on something that seems exciting to me and I just want to keep going at it. I hope this isn't too confusing, but I have an example that happened earlier this week since it's been the worst that it's gotten so far: 

Last Sunday, I felt incredibly alone and not in the mood to do anything despite being around  someone I love and care deeply about and who feels the same way. Being around him usually makes me so happy, but I just felt so alone and incredibly insecure, even though he was being the same person I love. I let all these negative thoughts run through my mind about our relationship and it just kept picking my brain. I additionally felt worse about myself because I began thinking that I ate too much for the day--I broke my system of meals and how I eat because I was hanging out with this person and you know, you just don't think about it when you're with someone. This low moment continued for the rest of the night.

Monday comes and I feel better than the previous night, but not 100%. Still, I knew I was close to my up moment because I begun cleaning my entire room and online browsing and finding new things to do. (I found this book that a friend gave and it had all these things about new stuff I could do, so I literally went through every page and did as much as I could). Then, it came time for my first meal of the day and though I ate less than Sunday, I went back to a low moment and didn't get out of it until before bed that night where it was like I snapped out of my low moment and went back to an up one, because I decided that I would go on a run tomorrow at 6 in the morning.

So, Tuesday might've become the highest moment of the week. I got up and immediately felt so energized for my run. I especially made it so I was right there in time to see the sunrise, then ran about 2 miles, which is a lot for me since I hate running. I got back home and, still on my up moment, offered to make everyone in my family breakfast. I just wanted to do something, then I went and did another workout. This high moment continued the rest of the day, as it ended with me wanting to start a blog (?!) for some reason and I set it all up and everything. I was so excited about just doing this new thing.

After this, I began to feel a crash on Wednesday and up until today. My crash felt terrible and I was too tired to do anything. My body and mind hurt from all the work it'd been up to in the last couple of days. Today, I slept in for the first time since Tuesday (I somehow managed to continue my morning runs on Wed, Thurs, and Friday but with much less enthusiasm as the first day) and felt a bit better, but just drained. I have to go socialize now with my family and it's the last thing I want to do. Also, if my pattern today is anything like my past patterns, then my mood is going to continuously change today and keep it's ups and downs. And it's just tiring.

None of my loved ones, friends or family know about this either because I had a bad experience a couple months ago when I did speak up. (I told my 'best friend' about how I felt and she just said ""it's probably just because of quarantine"" and changed the subject). I don't know what to think. Is this just a side effect of quarantine or has this always been there and I just used to never care about it because I hung out with people and went out to places to keep me busy? I also don't want to self-diagnose myself, so my point of this long post is: someone please help me figure out what's going on with my mood changes and ups and downs. Ask any questions too. I just want answers, but am afraid to be a burden or bother or come-off as self centered to people."

1081,How to cope after witnessing something horrible?,"TW- death, suicide


I’m sorry, I don’t want to post a story that’s upsetting but I’m in need of support. 

A couple of days ago, I saw some horrifying things and I don’t know how to cope. I live in Texas. 

I live in a high rise apartment building. I woke up around 8:30am and got up to walk my dog. As I’m exiting the elevator in the lobby, I noticed about 4 cop cars roll up. I walked outside and I could tell something bad was going on. I could see a group of people gathered about 4 yards from me and I just couldn’t stop thinking “please don’t let this be what I think it is”. I quickly walked my dog and as I headed back inside, I saw a body with about 5 people around it trying to resuscitate it to no avail. 

About 2 minutes after I got back home, the police knocked on my door and had about 10 officers scour my apartment and question me after they told me they were looking for the balcony from which “an individual jumped”. After that, they knocked on my neighbor’s door and nobody answered. They had to break in with guns in their hands. Though I knew my neighbors were out of town, it was still very unnerving. 

I decided to go out an hour long walk to calm down. I cried, I tried to process. For context, I had a family member commit suicide when I was younger, so this topic hits really close to home. When I walked back, I figured the body might have been moved or at least covered. It was not. He was just there, uncovered, with no one around him. Dozens of cops were in the lobby. I was angry and confused and so much more. He was there for hours. 

I recognize what I’m going through is NOWHERE near what this man and his loved ones had and have been going through. What I saw, however, was horrible. I have GAD and this has drudged up some really shitty memories and feelings. I’m not depressed nor am I thinking about hurting myself or anybody, I just don’t know how to cope. What’s a healthy way to process something like this? 

TLDR- I saw my neighbor’s body right after he committed suicide. I had to talk to police and be exposed to the scene multiple times that day. How does one process witnessing something like this? How does one cope?"
1082,We need to acknowledge more unconventional self harm methods,"Whenever people think of self harm, they think of cutting, and thats basically it. So many people self harm without realizing it, so here is a list of things I've seen/done that aren't typically thought of as self harm:

-Making yourself pass out
-punching yourself/punching things
-drinking till you throw up
-putting yourself in danger (walking the streets alone at night, provoking people, etc)
-pinching/biting yourself
-distancing yourself from friends/driving them away
-forcing yourself to do/eat things you hate
-picking at your nails until they bleed/ripping your nails out
-being haphazard with knives/guns/dangerous things 


Feel free to add to this, but these are things I've noticed. Some people can't handle pain or are scared of people seeing scars, so cutting isn't an option to them. Personally, I spent years forcing myself to pass out, ripping my nails out, putting myself in danger. Even just a few months ago, I was the only one around me that noticed a kid had a gun, so i got them to leave without telling them. I spent about half an hour in the middle of the woods with a stranger who had a gun, alone. People said i was brave, but really a part of me hoped he would shoot me, and only called the cops when I realized he wasn't going to."
1083,Does anyone know what might be my problem?,"Hello! So, I've been going though this weird period for a few months now, basically since the virus took me out of school, where I question everything, and I mean *everything* about myself. 

Things like my sexual identity, the way I look, the thoughts I have, what I want to be, things I have done in the past that nobody thinks about or remembers, and the general way I am. I think about things I know the answer to, but I question myself to the point where I think I don't. I know it's normal for teenagers to question themselves and change but I have this negative obsession with my flaws and traits that's so persistent that I am loosing sleep and my day can get turned around for the worst because I looked at myself in the mirror, or remembered something I did when I was 8, or question if I am being a lesbian for attention, despite the fact I know I'm not deep down.

If anyone is going through something similar or knows what this might be, please tell me!   
Thank you for reading."

1085,Is it better to seek non professional help than no help at all?,"So, some classmates of mine started a forum in which people can post their mental health issues and the moderators will give advice. However, I’m not sure whether or not it could be more harmful than not getting advice at all because the moderators are teenagers with no professional background. For example, someone confessed that they were a victim of sexual assault and one of the moderators advised them to speak out in order to “inspire others”. While speaking out is certainly good, I’m not sure whether or not pressuring victims to is beneficial - thoughts?"
1086,I don’t want the future,"Hi. I’m a 17-year old girl who struggles a lot with some dumb thoughts. 

Right now I’m on summerbreak from school and work. I don’t want to experience tomorrow or any other day after that, I just want it all to end. I really thought this summer would be great, because I have a lovely boyfriend, family and a great friendgroup, but when I get home and I’m alone, it gets bad. I really feel like it would be for the best if I fell asleep and never woke up again. I don’t want to deal with the future and this feeling is eating me up from the inside. I have almost no will to live. I don’t wanna talk to anyone near me because I know it would hurt them and ruin the “always happy”-person I am known as. I don’t know what to do, and I am scared that these thoughts will lead to something even worse

I hope it’s understandable english is hard for me"
1087,why am i crying about something that happened years ago?,"I don't cry that often, a normal amount I think. I'm 20F and today suddenly something i saw on tv  reminded me of something that happened to me years ago, when I was literally 12 years old.  
At the time it was something that made me feel confused upset and isolated, but I don't think i've ever thought of it again until now?   
But it made me really angry when i thought of it today and I don't know why but now i feel irationally angry at the world and I'm crying about it."

1089,forgiveness?,"for context, i am 18 years old. the guy i am dating (not officially boyfriend girlfriend but more than just friends if that makes sense) told me he had plans to commit suicide this morning. he was being strangely secretive and not answering my calls which is unusual - and he had been posting on social media about wanting to die. when i asked him to let me help him, he told me that he didn't deserve/want help. not knowing what else to do, i threatened to call the cops. he told me if i did that he would ""never forgive me"". but i called the cops anyway, and they were able to save his life. all i know at the moment is that he is in a mental health hospital. should i reach out to his brother to ask for more updates or not pry since he said he wouldn't be able to forgive me? i feel so selfish because i am worried about our relationship ending when i really see a future with this guy. do i keep my distance or try to see how he is? what if he hates me forever?
any advice/thoughts would be appreciated &lt;3"
1090,I can't tell if I m have anxiety or depression,It sounds dumb but I'm too scared to go to the doctors. I get extremely anxious over a lot of things where I feel faint and sick yet I also have suicidal thoughts... I don't know which it might be
1091,I contemplated getting therapy a few days ago but I have decided not to.,"I'm happy to say that I fundamentally disagree with psychology, therapy, and psychiatry and do not consider them legitimate fields of medicine. I think that people tend to use the ""mentally ill"" label too liberally and, despite what people have said, I do not consider myself mentally ill and nobody can ever force me to go into therapy. The very idea that someone thinks I'm defective enough to require therapy only infuriates me.

Just had to get this out. Fuck therapy."

1093,There is a rapper out there named JackG. He desperately needs help.,"He was bullied in school. He felt lonely and unloved. He has gambling and alcohol issues. Because of this, he ended up creating a defense mechanic in the form of a fake lifestyle of being a famous celebrity rap star. he has kept it up for various years with no recognition until he was disvvered by Memeulous, who was diss by JackG with a diss track. Around this time, he stole all of the money from his 87 year old grandfather with parkinsons and asked a teenage boy for pics of gay sex, only to spread false rumors about him when he refused. He then accused ANOTHER teenage boy of stealing his grandfathers money, raping a 3 year old and raping him at knifepoint. After confessing (he did show some remorse), he was arrested for almost 1 year. He then got out of prison and kept up with the fake rapper lifestyle.

How can we help this guy?

It's not too late to save him, he just turned 23. It's also worth noting that he has Asperger syndrome and lives in Britain. Is there a way we could get him on Dr. Phil?"
1094,I hate myself,"I’m not depressed, I just hate myself. I hate how I look and talk. I hate how I can’t socialise and sweat and panic when I find myself having to talk to someone. I hate how I no longer have friends because I’ve pushed away anyone who I was once close with. I hate how I have no motivation and energy. I’m months behind on schoolwork because what’s the point in getting good grades when I am how I am. I hate how one glimpse of my face in a reflection can ruin my mood for days, yet I can sit in front of a mirror for half an hour picking out my insecurities. 

It’s funny how I don’t even believe myself typing this up. I’m overreacting, none of this is true, stop being dramatic."
1095,I feel empty,These past few years I've been feeling empty. Like there's a void inside me. Like there's something missing. I can't really wrap my head around it. It's making me depressed. I've tried to fill it with drugs but has had no effect. I'm not expecting any advice just wanting to get it off my chest.
1096,I am feeling horrible again,"I've started having suicidal thoughts again. I always feel like I am worthless, untalented, stupid and ugly. I felt like this in the past, it was gone for a while, but it slowly came back. I can't really put it into words... I feel like I am empty inside. Yes, I laugh and smile but the feeling of happiness is not there. I lack motivation and hate the things I used to enjoy. I don't feel loved, only judged.  I can't really feel anything except sadness
I attempted suicide two times before, and I think about it again.
I think people will also judge me here, but it's worth  a try, so all I am asking for is support, I don't want to feel like this anymore, and I don't have anyone to talk to"
1097,Is it anxiety or OCD?,"I’m trying to figure out if I have anxiety or OCD. I can’t go to a doctor because my extremely religious parents think mental health problems are sins and a result of the devil. That being said, I’d like to know which I have so I can find accurate self-help resources. Anything helps! here are my symptoms that have been going on for 2-3 years: 

- constant worry
- worrying about the same thing almost constantly throughout the day for weeks on end (mostly my current relationship, if it will last, worrying about if he’ll be faithful when we’re LDR this fall, etc)
- same worrisome repetitive thoughts throughout the day (ex. is he cheating? should i break up?) consistently and constantly, the same thoughts
- restless, jumpy, various tics (kicking feet, tapping toes, rubbing neck, drumming fingers on desk, picking at bumps on skin)
- nitpicking small details, analyzing everything
- restlessness, inability to relax
- trouble sleeping, easily exhausted"
1098,My cat,"I got a cat recently. I’ve been super depressed and just wanted a pet to stop being lonely. I’ve always been a cat person, I had a cat for many years, up until my mom died in December 2018. I lived with my grandparents after that, but they didn’t like pets in the house so I gave it to my brother. Last October I moved out on my own. But I’ve always wanted another cat. So I got one. But it ended up being too much. First she was keeping me up at night, I know she’s getting adjusted and I found a way to cope. She has a respiratory infection, and the shelter gave me liquid medication to give her. But I can’t get her to take it. She’s always running away and I can’t catch her. I’m also supposed to take her to the vet soon, but I can’t afford it. I really couldn’t even afford the cat. I love her and she’s sweet, but this is too much for me. It’s hurting me very bad emotionally because she’s sick and there’s nothing I can do, I’m already very weak emotionally, it’s putting me in tears. I feel like the best thing to do would be to give her back to the shelter, but everyone says I need to keep her, which I want to do, but if this is stressing me out this much, wouldn’t it be better to just give her to someone who can afford to take care of her. It’s way too much pressure for me. I honestly can barely take care of myself, idk why I thought this would be a good idea. It’s a result of me doing things without thinking like normal. I’ve never had any friends or been in a relationship and I’m 22. So I didn’t want to be lonely. But of course as usual, I made a decision that ends up hurting me. All I do is shoot myself in the foot. Maybe this is the final nail in my coffin."
1099,Are there certain phrases that drive us to madness?,"The ones that particularly do it to me are either; ""Sorry, I don't follow."" Or, ""I don't know what any of that means.""
Whether online or in public, it makes me feel insulted. And while I fully try to re-explain whatever I just said, I tend to fire back both threats and insults at the same time. 


Some will feel a little more informed, yet scared of me now and leave. While others will drop the original subject and go on about ""getting help"". I'll usually just leave and ignore their pleas knowing I've been ""getting help"" off and on for years.


Life is all about taking criticism and I'll use it to try and fix myself. But at the same time, the ones that criticize me I'll treat like dirt until our business is done and I'm rid of them. It's like; ""Yes, you're correct and I'll follow your teachings. But I'm going to pretend I didn't get my lessons from you"".


Of course this seems to happen more online now than anything thanks to the pandemic and myself vigorously maintaining distance. But it has happened in person many times before."
1100,I just want to drive my car into a lake and drown to death so I can stop suffering and be at peace,I have severe crippling health anxiety and stressing so damn hard
1101,What do I have ?,"Years ago I was looking for the worst videos on internet, I was bored , idk why exactly, maybe because I was angry at my father asweel (I'm not so sur about that) until I saw a killing video that was actually real about a Canadian dude killing and ripping apart another guy. I didn't believe at first video was real but after some moments I figured out that it was. I was shocked so I tried to sleep asap to forget it. I woke up next morning and I couldn't forget it, like it was repeating non stop in my mind and I could not support it. At the end of the day I talked about it to my father. He told be all was fine, and you know that these kind of people are just lost &amp; sick, that I should move on. 

Except I couldn't move on. It was non stop on my mind. Them others negatives ideas came into the mix, like that I would suicide by the window and the worst I think that I was just like that guy because at the time I used to look at gore videos &amp; co. I was at the time 17 if I remember right. I couldn't stay without doing nothing and be at peace so I started to play video games a lot, I tried to talk to my mother and my father again but that didn't fix it. So I started to play non stop so I could think about other things by stimulation I guess.

When my family and I went on vacations to Portugal, while I was in the car the idea that I liked the killer and I was like him came I to my mind, I tried to change ideas but I didn't succeed until I like ""accepted"" the idea and at that moment I almost passed out l, I couldn't see anything and we had to stop the car because I was in shock I think. 

My family at this point didn't know how they could help me, and I felt as I do now guilty for that fucking stupid mistake that made my like a disaster. I actually felt very bad when at some moment my father said something like ""I can't help you more good luck"". He doesn't believe much in psychologists and think that everyone can help themselves. 

On vacations without games I felt very bad, like every reminder of the video made me feel anxious, I saw myself hurting other people, or worse like my grand mother of which I was close. 

When I came back my grades got terrible since I could not keep myself focus on anything and I started to play h24 to forget about that and isolating myself more and more. 

I somehow managed to get my baccalaureat S with a 10/20 but could not follow on medicine. I was actually very good at school if I wanted to before that event. So I hated myself even more.

I Continued on computer dev. The next 2 years were relatively easy since I got them without much problems. Then I continued on a Master. People were fine but I always had problems with regularity since by moment I'm better but I also have breakdowns. Like now I guess.

I tried to consult at the beginning or on the second year after it started but never followed up first constant with a psychiatrist, a big mistake when I think about it now l, but, I'm not looking for excuses but my family was very anti psychiatry.

In master I failed 1 year but I got it this year.

Monday I have a rdv with a psychiatrist but I'm afraid of what I'm gonna find out. If he gonna give me drugs. But when I think about it can it really be worse . 

I can't talk with my family, I just see myself hurting anyone around me physically, my mother say it's anxiety, Idk anymore.

I can't see myself evolving in this mood and I feel like a hypocrite when people ask me if I'm fine. 

I have friends but when I get on vacations I will 99% of the time have a breakdown, projects keep me focused on  other things.

Do I jus6 have anxiety or it's worse?"

1106,How to tell loved ones about your suicide attempt?,[removed]
1107,My birthday is soon.,[removed]
1108,I am Going Abosutely Insane! I am Losing My Sanity And Well Being.,"I was a cyber-mob victim in February of 2019. I was 23/m. 

I was terribly bullied, humiliated and ridiculed by hundreds of people. Name calling, hate speech, threats and insults. 

I have since dealt with severe depression and disturbing suicidal thoughts and fantasies and I am 25/m later this month. 

If they were male, I don't give a fuck. Even If they are female, if they were either underage, elderly, overweight or black or had several large tattoos or piercings they are fine and also have nothing to worry about they're not a psychological threat to me.  

But if them bitches bullying me were white/caucasian, highly attractive females and without any tattoos or piercings, 18+, I'd wanna threaten them, scare them and terrorize them! 

I'd suffering delusions and beyond sickening fantasies of wanting to cause physical harm to these particular women.  

Why? Because My Sexuality was shattered, and the quality of my life had dropped exponentially to the point I fantasize suicide everyday. 

In return for causing unpleasant, and severe psychological harm on me, I suffer extreme fantasies of wanting to hurt them. Worse, the fantasies can even reach such extreme extents of, wanting to more than just harm them, but could also include thoughts of killing them! 

It is actually extremely common for people who are bully victims to seek revenge look it up!! 

I want them cunts brought to justice for the pain and gried they have inflected me for the past 16 months.  

the male people participating in the bullying did not commit the crime of destroying my sexuality. The same is said for any girl who is under the age of 18, who is elderly, black, overweight or physically handicapped is not at risk. even if these women had participated they are not a threat to me and they didn't destroy my sexuality so they have committed no crime to me. 

I need extreme psychiatric treatment."

1110,i get very overwhelmed easily- sensory overload?,"hi! so, i’ve had this issue for a while but it’s recently gotten worse, so i thought i’d try to get some answers. 

sometimes i get very overwhelmed- like it feels like everything is just too much. like i can’t be in the same room as people eating anymore because the noises that they make upset me so much, we have glass cups that i can’t touch because the texture makes me so uncomfortable, and when people touch me too much or talk to me for too long i freak out. 

like, the other day, i was on my mom’s bed in her room (im 15f, btw) talking to her, and then my little sister came in and laid on the bed next to me, and then the dog jumped onto the bed, and they were all talking to me and i was just trying to read the article on my phone, and my sister kept brushing against me, and then the dog kinda sniffed me, and then i just yelled “stop!” threw myself off the bed, and then kinda squatted on the ground, closed my eyes, and plugged my ears. i had to stay like that for like fifteen seconds, which seems like a long time when your family is staring at you in a shocked silence lol

also, whenever im with people for too long and they talk too much at me, i cant handle it and start snapping at people. 

like, ive had to leave classes to go sit in the bathroom to calm myself down because it was too loud. it got to the point where, by the end of the school year, i preferred to eat lunch in the bathroom. 

im more on the extrovert side, so i just find it strange that i cant handle people anymore. 

i looked it up, and it sounds a lot like sensory overload. i was just wondering if you all agreed with that? ive never been diagnosed with anything, though my parents suspect that i have adhd and a VERY mild case of ocd. i also thought that i had/have depression or anxiety, but never told anyone. im not trying to self-diagnose, i just thought that that might be helpful information!

thank you so much! i hope you all have a great day, and remember to drink water!"

1112,I know I’m not the only one but COVID is giving me so much anxiety lately,"I live in a super rural area and have been home from college since March due to Covid. I’m stressing about going back to campus in the fall since a bar on campus was linked last week to almost 200 positive Covid cases. 

Most recently, my cousin was at a bonfire with a kid whose mom and uncle tested positive. I had been with my cousin twice since he had been around that kid and got his results back from his test today and they were negative. Since then, I’ve been super nervous, especially since we luckily haven’t had many Covid cases in my home county. My younger brother is at a bonfire tonight and it makes me feel very uncomfortable that my parents are allowing him to hang out with large groups of his friends, knowing a kid a year older than them has been exposed. My parents don’t say too much and even if they tell him to stay home, he’ll complain about it and they’ll let him go. It makes me want to go back to my apartment and quarantine myself there alone and never leave there."

1114,I need to get this off my chest before I break.,"Hey everyone, I hope you're all well. (Im sorry if this doesn't make sense, I've tried this so many times before without having the guts to hit post.)  
I'm a 21 y/o male, a few years ago (when I was 18) my whole life changed. I got broken up with which I took horribly, lost all my so-called friends, my job all in my last year of school. Which, in turn, fucked over my studies and I finished with some less-than-adequate results.  
I took this on the chin, started hanging with a new group of people I met at school (completely different, these guys were the best. I would have considered them my family (in a way I still do)). I started to feel this ""empty-happy"" where I knew I was supposed to be happy but I just didn't know how to feel it or express it to others. So we would party, a lot. go to bars, clubs, pubs and have some pretty insane nights out. Still didn't feel totally convinced on my happiness, but it felt like life had started to get more steady. 

Without much warning, my friends wanted to stop hanging out and stopped inviting me round because I would ""bring down the mood"". Two weeks after my best-doggo friend passed away, this hurts the most and im a fucking mess because I haven't had anyone to talk to about it -  I either bring their mood down or do something else to screw it all. I literally was handed a second chance on a silver platter and I blew it. It has been 3 years since then and nothing has changed. I still haven't spoken to many people (outside work), all relationships seem like a waste of time because it all ends in the same way, And I break down in tears almost every day because I miss my little squish so god damn much and I wish there was a way i could have her back for 5 more seconds. But there isnt.

My thoughts have started to get so dark, it really terrifies me to the point I can't eat or sleep. The one thing I have always been scared of is being alone and yet I can't stop thinking about how once my old man leaves this world, I will be totally alone. Just a sad, alone, pathetic excuse for a man.  
again im so very sorry if this doesnt make sense or if im just being a downer, I know this is a safe place to talk about these things but I've been so hesitant because the last thing I want is to make anyone sad. I just needed to speak my mind.  
I'm going to lie down for a moment, writing this took it out of me a bit. Have a wonderful evening/night x"

He has his toxicity for reasons that I won’t say on here because  it’s not my place. But I want to work on my own because I want to make this work. But honestly it starts with my head. I am insanely jealous. It’s not a normal bit of jealousy, it’s actually consuming me. I’m paranoid over it I’m stressed and worried 247. I’m a suck person. And I say this based on the toxic shitty stuff I did, deleting girls and monitoring stuff 247. It’s so bad, these girls are people he grew up with old best friends. Guys can have girl best friends but mine apparently can’t, because if my messed up head. And lately I mean we have been fighting over other stuff, and he threatens to cheat on me and he says that when he is mad to upset me, but saying that even if it’s not true is just adding fuel to the fire. So basically I need help. I don’t know what to do or how to get better from this. It’s to the point that we’ll I know I won’t hurt myself but I think about it because how can one live like this. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
1116,Weird things I do,"I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD combined type so it could be because of those or just because I'm weird but I was wondering if it was anything anyone else does because I feel like it makes me look weird or childish to act this way but it's hard to not act this way. I sit in cubby holes like closets, cupboards, and any little alcove I can find. I also enjoy wearing ear plugs because when everything around me is muffled I don't feel as lost and like I'm just a ghost walking around--I feel grounded and engaged instead of my head being in the clouds. I have a shake I do with my head like a twitch, and I like sucking/chewing on things that have the texture of gel pencil grips. Speaking of textures, I have to touch good textures after I touch a bad one. I hope this makes sense I'm sorry if it doesn't I can't connect my thoughts into words well ❤️"
1117,Is most of psychology/mindfulness/etc. simply narratives that we adopt?,"It seems like there are so many conflicting schools of what causes what, or what you need to be XYZ, what’s good for you, what’s bad. 

I feel like a lot of these are just concepts that make enough sense to adopt, then they become our reality.  In the same way that our identities and personalities are always morphing based off of our own narratives."
1118,How do I stop freaking out when weight is brought up?,"Like when people are upset about being overweight or anything to do with eating disorders or body image. It makes my amygdala light up like a fucking Christmas tree and I don’t even have an eating disorder that gets triggered or anything. It’s like the one things I can’t stand to talk or hear about, and seeing as my Gf actually does have a severe eating disorder and needs my support, I need to get over this and preferably quickly.

I just don’t know what my problem is. It scares me to the point of dissociation or hyper vigilance. I usually cannot speak or respond at all if she’s upset about her weight. And if she compares her body to mine especially. It makes me freak out and although I’m not mad at her it makes me sound pissed off and defensive if I open my mouth at all. 

The only things I can think of that could’ve caused this are:

1. My mom was hospitalized for anorexia growing up, and has been a calorie counter to the point of obsession my entire life. Has controlled what I ate until late highschool when I realized I can actually just buy whatever I want and eat it behind her back. I have always had a voracious appetite, especially in highschool when I started stress eating. My mom starting cracking down on portion control and what I should and shouldn’t eat. I think she even was on the verge of confronting me about possibly being pregnant lol. Just a lot of my mom subtly trying to control my weight and diet without outright telling me. I didn’t realize how much I wasn’t allowed to eat or was criticized for eating until I moved out.

2. During a hard time any talk of self hate, especially body hate was usually immediately followed with self harm right in front of me. Or vivid suicidal thoughts.

3. I have been on the chunkier side. I took an anti psychotic for about two months that made me drop around 11 pounds. I always thought I wanted to be skinnier and despised it. Everyone was in my business constantly and touching me and I hated it. I ate a fuck ton of junk food and quit the medicine (for other reasons too) to gain the weight back. I was also afraid of weighing less than my gf and possibly triggering her eating disorder. 

4. The concept of starving to death or starving in general scares the fuck out of me. Ive worked with old folks and had pets shrivel up before me so I associate being very underweight with being on deaths door. It’s like the marker of death for me. 

5. I was also cripplingly afraid of vomit and vomiting for most of my life. And while I’ve managed to overcome this fear almost entirely and completely by myself, I still couldn’t make myself vomit even if I tried. I feel like maybe part of this phobia sticks to me in the way that an eating disorder or speaking about weight could cause it to flare up in the deeper parts of my brain.

Sorry if this sounds really dumb and my points sound irrelevant. I think they sound really irrelevant and I feel like I’m just being a pussy around a topic that makes me uncomfortable. I’d appreciate any advice at all. Thank you so much."
1119,Understanding mental health and what is anxiety?,"Just a year ago, I had no grounding for mental health issues. Like I knew people with mental health struggles and friends who went to therapy, and I sympathised. But that was the best I could do at the time and I didn't really understand the battle. I supported from the sidelines but couldn't help fight in the fray.

Fast forward to now - I've not been diagnosed with anything but I am quite sure I have some mental health issue. It's like something you can't control, but on the face of it it seems like you should be able to control it because it's you, and logically you're the only one in control of yourself. I've lost motivation for everything that I've been interested in (dancing, baking, exercising, socialising, studying maths and physics) and studies have suffered as a result. It's like I can't concentrate on anything and I can't remember anything. I can't sleep and I can't seem to have the self-discipline to do the things I want to do. I think that I've been thinking about the bad aspects of life more often in my free time; that or the little things in life affect me a lot more emotionally. Every time I do make it out of the slump, it's only temporary and I get pulled back in. I'm worried that I'll forget who I once was or that I'll never get back to being that person. It's so weird to think how far I've fallen and how different I used to be.

Rant over. Anyway, I've done minimalistic research into anxiety and I'm still not entirely sure what it is. Like what are some symptoms that exemplify characteristics of it (i.e. how can you tell if you have it)?"

1123,I am not sure who I am anymore,"Recently I (17M) have been feeling down, and this is because I don't really know who I am anymore. I used to know what made me happy in life and I had goals that I would aim towards.

But now I don't know, the motivation I had isn't there anymore with the exception of spermatic bursts of motivation for my spare time (trading card games)

I want to be able to sit down and talk through my feelings, even if just to myself. But doing that feels impossible because I immediately get overwhelmed with emotions. As if just thinking about who I am results in my mind defending itself by scaring me into distracting myself and when I confronted those feelings recently they made me scared to go to sleep.

I don't know what to do, as I haven't had anything like this before but I have had these deep routed feelings for a few months now and probably started 2 years ago

What I want to do is become motivated again into aiming toward goals but I don't even have goals anymore, not ones that feel in reach anyway"
1124,Finishing things.,"I have a lot of trouble finishing things. It comes from laziness, self doubt, fear, negative self talk, lack of passion etc. I start books but don’t finish them, a school degree, scripts, paintings. Mostly all personal things. 

When I force myself to do one of them, I really don’t enjoy it or my head gets flooded with thoughts of this will be too hard, why did you start this late, what’s the point, you’re not that good, imagine where you would be if you started four years ago. I don’t know if I should keep trying or officially give up. If I don’t even like it then why am I doing it. All of those things I did have interests in at one point but now it’s such a burden. I don’t know why I can’t just finish one task and be proud of something I made. Does anyone else feel the same?"
1125,Is feeling suicidal sufficient to go to a&amp;e,"Ok so I (19f) don’t want to die like there is literally nothing going bad in my life right now, but each day I feel worse and worse. My mind keeps telling me that I should just end it, however as a rational person I’m refraining from attempting such a thing because I have learnt from past attempts and because my family would be sad. I just wonder wether I would be able to go to a&amp;e about these thoughts without being turned away even though I currently have these thoughts under control. I have been recently self harming much more than I usually would and I’m scared that I will deteriorate to the point that I will attempt again. Any advice on what to do? Also I’m nervous about going to the GP whilst coronavirus is occurring as last time was a flop when everything was normal.
Cheers for reading, any advice is welcome"
1126,How Do I Go About Talking To My Doctor,"Hello everyone, I am 17F and I have been dealing with mental health issues my entire life. I’ve never been diagnosed professionally with anything as I’ve always been too scared to speak up. I self harmed at a young age and haven’t done it in years. After looking up many different things with the way I act and how i work,,, I truly believe I may have BPD. How do I talk to my doctor and have her take me seriously other than her saying oh it’s a teenage thing because I know it’s not. Mental illness runs in my family but I don’t want to use that as an excuse, I just want to be able to talk about me without being treated like a child and being taken seriously."

1128,What’s the best way to get help?,"I (16F) think I may be suffering from Body dysmorphia and BPD, Ive already been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

I feel so so lost right now I have absolutely no one to talk to I just want to fucking die I hate myself so much, I need a therapist so bad but I don’t know how to get one. I tried to tell my mum before that I was suicidal, I told her that some days I really don’t want to be alive and she just told me it’s all in my head and I’m lazy, my mother is amazing don’t get me wrong but I wish she understood my situation more. I can’t leave my house and I hate the thought of return to school and all I want to do right now is die.

I need a therapist so bad, I had a school councillor before but I find it so hard to open up to people, Everyday she would ask me how I am and I physically couldn’t say anything more that ‘I’m good thanks’ and smile even when I wanted to slit my throat. 

I just don’t know what to do, I genuinely have nothing and no one to talk to, and I don’t think I’ll be able to get a therapist. I just want to die so bad right now :("
1129,Why does telling someone how you feel have to be so hard?,"I read somewhere that loneliness is a result of one’s inability to communicate how they feel. Even such simple things, like telling a friend I wanna see them again feels like such a big deal to me because I’m afraid of putting myself out there and being vulnerable. 

It’s like I’m afraid the person will hold my feelings in the palm of their hand and crush it even though realistically they wouldn’t (knowing them). 

I’m having some conflict in regards to telling someone how I feel. Like it honestly isn’t a big deal but to me it’s huge. This shit takes courage and I guess I’m here to just vent. I don’t wanna constantly be thinking of what if’s, like they say if you want something you should go for it? Right?"
1130,Ah yes good parenting,"My mum:*shouting at me*
Me:*on verge of tears*
Mum:what are you gonna cry for?
Me who got very little to no emotional support/help when I was younger:boi"
1131,why do i suck at talking to therapists?,it’s like when i walk into their office i become a wall. i don’t know how to talk about my problems without thinking i sound pathetic and self centered. i want to be taken seriously and i want to be respected by these professionals but i feel like if i actually say what’s on my mind i wouldn’t be able to stop crying. i just give the quickest answer and never stop to think of something of substance that will actually help me get better.  i also feel like i don’t want to disappoint psychiatrists and say that the meds they prescribe aren’t working. after a year of trying to find the right ones i gave up and settled for medicine that kinda worked at making me less depressed but gave me such bad bladder incompetence i’d piss myself in public on the reg or wake up to my partner saying i peed the bed. i just feel so hopeless
1132,I don’t know what to tell my therapist.,"Okay so I’m not the person who recently posted about this but I was coming onto reddit to ask for a bit of help in the same category as they are so yea. I am a 16 year old female who has been in and out of therapy for a few years. I have self-harmed in the past which lead me to getting therapy. In my life the ever present feeling of anxiety has nearly always been there and the dark blanket that is depression followed suit after my fathers passing. However up until recently those have been the only indicators of mental illness in me so far.

In the past few weeks my anxiety has begun to morph into paranoia, severe paranoia. I cannot sleep without a light on anymore because I feel like the shadows created by my cable boxes are people watching me. I’m pretty sure I’ve also begun to experience auditory and visual hallucinations as well which is getting increasingly more scary as they drive me into panic attacks.

I just started seeing a new therapist who isn’t technically a therapist but more like an assistant or whatever. I had my virtual intake appointment tuesday and this upcoming tuesday is an appointment. 

My family has a history of mental illness so I feel like she will take me a bit more seriously when I tell her my symptoms but I don’t know how to go about informing her... The paranoia has been driving me insane and it’s becoming so much harder to fall asleep when I feel like invisible eyes are watching me. It also doesn’t help that any shadow I see nearly gives me a panic attack. 

How do I go about informing her of my symptoms? I feel lost in what I should do and writing this is getting my mind off the sounds i’m hearing but I know that won’t last long..."
1133,"I want to give up, I'm diagnosed with something terrible.","3 months ago, I was diagnosed with a lung infection. This happened during the time that I gave up on my work because of personal reasons. I was already very tired and broken to give up the work that I dedicated a lot of time to and then it felt I got a second punch from life when I started feeling weird pain in my chest.   


After worrying about it for a week, I went to the doctor and it's only when I looked for a second doctor appointment that they realized what was going on in my lungs. I got an infection at quite possibly the worst time possible. It's not covid-19 but it's so devastating.   


Everyday, I don't know what I'm living for. I went from wondering what I'll be doing in the next 20 years to wondering if I'll get to see tomorrow. I feel like there's no reason to fight on. I feel like if it's bound to happen, then maybe I'm better off ending it now. A quick and painless death. I feel hopeless. 2020 is taking down multiple people in my life. And I feel like now, it's coming after me."
1134,Struggling with work situation,[removed]
1135,The only person who ever loved me doesn’t love me anymore,"This is not necessarily intended to be read. I have no one to vent to and I need to before I kill myself. 

Recently my boyfriend has just completely been distant, we usually text daily and try to call everyday. We haven’t called in about 2 weeks now, I don’t want to be clingy. It’s apparently because of badly timed schedules, after weeks of having my schedule finally fixed, (as someone who really struggles to fall asleep) going to sleep at 11, I decided I’d stay up, I just want to talk to him, he’s the only person who loves me. I made it really obvious I’m awake, ive talked in GCs that we are in together etc. I was hoping he would ask to call.. I didn’t want to ask because everytime I’ve asked recently he’s just decided to game instead, or said yes then just not called. He hasn’t asked, instead he’s talking to his female friend. Before we were together he told me, and I quote ‘she’s prettier, funnier, older, smarter and better.’ It was half jokingly but I could sense there was some truth behind it- well because it is true. I’m ugly and stupid. Well I ignored it as best I could all this time we’ve been together but now I’m torn. I messed up my perfect sleeping schedule to be rejected again, and for the better, prettier, smarter girl. I can’t take this, he doesn’t love me anymore. I can’t even bring it up to him or I’ll be clingy or obsessive. And it’s not like I can tell him he’s the only person who loves me and without him i’d kill myself, that’s just wrong. I’m so lonely right now, a long time ago I admitted I cry myself to sleep to him and he swore he would always help me when I can’t sleep. Now I have to cry at 2:56am to myself, and vent on reddit because I seriously have no one left. I hate myself so much. I wish I just wasn’t so ugly, I’m so disgusting to look at no wonder he started hating me. He’s been making more and more fat jokes recently too.. I’m not fat but I’m not skinny enough, my body is disgusting, I have no shape. I just wish I was better so people would love me."
1136,Doing DBT right now but the pleasant events schedule just seems... terrible,"As anybody who is familiar with dbt knows, one of the tasks is to make sure you do at least a few ""pleasant events"" every day, and be mindful of how they are nice and positive parts of your life. 

Here's the problem: I look at the big list of examples, and everything looks boring, stupid, uninteresting, or would make me feel worse. Nothing really gives me any pleasure anymore. All these so called pleasant events just blend into the background of meaninglessness. I feel like I'm failing DBT. If it matters, I'm in the program for severe, treatment resistant depression. 

Anybody else encountered this issue before?"
1137,I am getting crazy...,"I spent a lot of time in China... and I hated it... the communists... I am Taiwanese btw and they kept saying that I am them when I am clearly not them... I hate the language... I avoid places or events which the language is spoken so that leads me to a hermit’s life in China... it is almost the same in Taiwan but I feel free because China banned almost everything... fb, YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram, Reddit,discord... my life... so they are all brainwashed by Baidu.com

By the way, I went to an international school so English is my first language, (um, I do everything with it) I could not write Chinese until I was 10yrs old and even now... I can’t pronounce some words like the natives could but the rest is completely like a native. 

My family lives in China because they have a kindergarten there... right now  my dad and I are in Taiwan now because in January we headed off to Thailand cuz we hated the winter and then our tourist visa expired so we went back to Taiwan. (China required a quarantine at that time and our flight got cancelled twice) 

Every time when I am in China I just turn my vpn on, watch YouTube or download and binge watch my fav Latin-American tv shows on NF and avoid any conversation. Just that my grandma lives downstairs and she speaks Chinese so I must turn the volume on...and when we have a conversation I must cut it short because I hate the language... even when dreaming about living in a Chinese speaking environment could just leave me shivering...so that’s why I am writing this... 

I can’t find a therapist to talk to because my situation is very weird... so I will just post it here..."
1138,Some late night sad thoughts,"Fuck, I feel depressed. I have these two people inside of my head. The one that thinks and the one that feels. The one thst thinks is, and has been for the last few months, trying to keep me busy. Busy with workouts, fun, books, work, pet, literally anything that can hold my attention and keeps me away from looking inside of me. Inside of my head and what I'm feeling. I going from A to B to C, constantly trying to escape the awkward conversations in my mind, that I am lonely, that I miss so and so, that I am jealous, or that I have envy, or that I'm unfulfilled, etc, etc...


This isn't even about a person in particular, unless that person is me. Am  I always going to plod miserably from one relationship to the next, feeling awful up until I meet someone amazing, and then I will of course load that relationship with all the negativity that I've carried, and which keeps growing because that stuff builds up, and eventually the relationship will break. Thus, I'll find myself back into the hamster wheel, chasing and feeling miserable until the cycle takes its course infinite times. 


I have tried in so many ways to centre my life. To feel purpose on its own. I have gotten my dream job. Worked hard for it, and gotten it, despite the fact that I distracted by all this shit. I have focused on becoming fit and overcoming some long time body shame that I had. I have focused on friends, reconnecting, bonding, getting out of my comfort zone, meeting new people. I have focused on cultivating hobbies. I read six books this year. I've started to learn a new language, I've mediated for a while. I cut down on drink, and drugs happened sporadically and never out of expected controlled times. Meaning, Monday mornings I forced myself to be back at it, at my home office no matter what had happened. 


I have in so many ways tried to get a hold of my life, soothe my feelings, and tried to make myself feel at ease in my own skin, and yet I still feel shit. After so many months nursing my sadness; sadness from being broken up with, sadness from rejection, sadness from the lost intimacy and the hopes and dreams; after so many months, I really thought I would have respite from it all. I thought my thinking brain would turn to my feeling brain and say, look you're in better shape now, let's let you be part of the conversation again. 


But no, whenever thinking brain looks, feeling brain is feeling rubbish.. And it makes thinking brain mad, because ""why on earth would you be sad!? What right do you even have? After so many months... After doing all these things... After all the great things going for you... Why do you even feel like that? How dare you... Fuck out of here and don't come back until you've sorted your shit out."" and the thing is that it will probably never be sorted. I will go from one relationship to the other, carrying this shit over, and feeling rubbish in between. I am sick of it. "
1139,I keep forgetting what my problem is.,"The problem is simple. I have all these ideas of how I want to live, but all of them are forgetting that the root cause of my misery is that my life fundamentally sucks because I lack the basic things that make life bearable. Family I feel close to and comfortable with? Nope. A partner? Nope. A job that puts me in a competence hierarchy and give me a place in the world and something to work at/for? Nope. Literally any friends at all? Nada. 

Luckily I’m not on drugs. If I took drugs or alcohol, I probably would have died a long time ago. 

The problem is that my life sucks. 

I’m not one of those people who has everything in their life in order and they still hate themselves and want to die. I’m just someone who’s life sucks. 

But I don’t know how to get myself to fix it. Obviously I can’t afford to keep suffering. I only have one life and I need to put it together or else I will go to the great nothing I came from before I was born. 

However, I am currently more afraid of trying to live than no living. The reason is simple: the unknown is scarier than the known. I know exactly where I will end up if I do nothing. I will be miserable beyond belief, and will probably fall so far into the pits of despair that I will actually take my life. But I don’t fear death. I know exactly what death is like. It is just like how it was before you were born.

What I fear is getting a job. What I fear is making friendship. What I fear is falling in love. Because I don’t know these things.

Misery is comforting because it is the most familiar thing in my 22 years of suffering.

I think I am completely insane at this point."
1140,Who do you go to when you’re having a mental breakdown?,Not much to say but what do you do when you have a bad anxiety attack? It’s like I have this fear but I don’t want to admit it. Some kind of enhanced awareness. I hate the attention and I try to hide it but it’s too hard. I don’t even like going outside anymore. I just want to be alone where no one can be around. I don’t feel comfortable being around people. I feel like I can’t live functionally in society. I have a terrible minset. It’s hard for me to ask for help. I can’t even help myself at times.
1141,Traumatized by being a cheater,"I'm not expecting sympathy or anything because I'm the bad guy in this story, I just don't know how to cope with what I did.

It's been 2 years since I cheated on my boyfriend. He was my highschool sweetheart, &amp; we'd been together for about 2 years. I went to college &amp; met a nice older guy in 1 of my classes, &amp; we hit it off. I told my boyfriend I wanted to ""take a break"" because I was ""too busy with college right now"", then started hooking up with my classmate. I wasn't interested in dating him, I just wanted a ""friend with benefits"", but the classmate thought we were in a relationship now. When classes ended, I broke up with him because ""I have depression and need to work on myself"". Then, I got back together with my ex. I told him the entire real truth beforehand, and he just... forgave me. instantly. he was so sweet and understanding. which made me feel even worse.

we broke up a few months later but are still great friends. i haven't spoken to or seen the classmate since. but i'm constantly haunted by the entire experience. at the time, i was 19 &amp; thought i was a badass adult for having casual sex with an older guy. but now, i feel sick. i feel sick for lying, most of all, &amp; i lied to everyone. i see my classmate's face everywhere, i'm constantly reminded of him &amp; of what i did. i will NEVER reach out to him to apologize because i'm honestly too terrified and would throw up if i ever actually heard from him again. i'm sickened to my core at who i was &amp; how i acted, and I NEVER FACED ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR IT. NOBODY WAS MAD AT ME, EXCEPT FOR MYSELF. how can i get closure, if i'm the only one who still can't let it go? if everyone else has already moved on?"
1142,How to live with an adult sister with severe OCD. LONG RANT but this is just ruining my life. Someone help :(,"I made a whole list in my notes but its so long no one would read it so let me narrow it down to the basics: 

rules she has for me/family PRE-corona i need to mention this all has been going on for YEARS:

-no pooping in bathroom more than once a day
- no shaving with baby oil even though regular shaving cream irritates my legs EVEN if i clean the whole shower afterward (today i shaved with her stupid shaving cream and she screamed over a single leg hair i kid you not i looked it was 1 leg hair like???) 
- parents have to shower immediately after hugging her or she harasses them bc she’s “dirty” and now theyre “dirty” even though she showers twice a day sometimes 3 times 
- if i go to a public place or even get in my car (dont even use a public bathroom) i can’t use toilet until after i shower even if i showered that day already 
- shes notorious for washing her clothes or drying them then leavinf them in for hours and refuses to move them and then if anyone in family tries to move it because we need to do laundry too will throw tantrum and rewash everything 
- goes in my room and takes brand new UNUSED washed towels and rewashes them because the dresser i put them on is “dirty” (i now hide towels but ahe usuallt will tear apart my whole room to find them so its pointless)
- i said how about i have 2-3 towels for me and just wash them myself and keep them in my room( we literally have so many body towels from over the years that my PARENTS bought) she said absolutely not.. i said i can take the towel colors you dont like. still said no
- she spends an hour - an hour and 15 minutes in shower 2-3 times a day ive timed it just for the heck of it 


what makes no sense: she had no issue kissing or having sex with her boyfriend and has even drank after him out of same cup. he is very unsanitary compared to the average human being based off what she told us. eventually she “broke up with him” we all suspect her ocd was overbearing because she spent the night there a few times a week and we believe she must have been trying to control his life and telling him how to do his laundry, how to clean, harassing him the way she does me and the rest of family. 

Idk what to do she won’t move out and if she does she’ll end up back home because no one would be able to last a week even 2 days with her nonsense. and I’m too broke to move myself I’m not even 20 yet. I told her she really needs to see a psychiatrist because she is overbearing and quite frankly annoying and this isnt normal. Parents said same thing. She ignored me and them and said she is “normal”. My parents wont push further because she doesn’t listen to reason. I get being sanitary I do and with corona now TOTALLY but its just like every time I come home I am bombarded with how I am cleaning things “wrong” and just is a complete control freak needs everything perfect 24/7. Got a 7 paragraph text today about how i can’t be pooping in bathroom more than once a day. It caused me such bad anxiety over time, I was throwing up every day for over a year and had no idea why no doctor could figure it out..finally went on anxiety meds and now i dont throw up at all. I can blame my puking on her this is the only thing that gives me anxiety shes just a handful. (with that i wasnt allowed to throw up in the bathroom I had to puke in a bucket in my own room) 

I literally want to die like shes never gonna leave, my parents will never make her and by the way she CAN financially afford it to live on her own if she wanted... and i financially can’t i owe a lot of medical bills (i did math its gonna take me years before i can move out)  from all these doctors ive seen about my own throwing up issue thank god its fixed but now I know she was the sole cause of my severe anxiety and daily vomiting. I feel trapped in my own home I try to be home as little as possible but every time I come home I have to mentally prepare myself for the harassment. I lock my door blare my music but then am spammed over text. If i decide to leave door unlocked she bangs until i answer it and after a few minutes will use HER FOOT to open my door (ew what the heck!) becquse she doesnt wanna dirty her hand touching the handle. 

constantly asks me to open drawers or cabinets or doors in house because they are too dirty to touch.. 
i could go on and on but you get the jist. 

what do i do? :("

I have a hard time answering questions honestly. I'm currently on medication for depression and anxiety but I can't seem to tell my doctor and partner the depths I'm in. Most of the time, especially on medical questionnaires and interviews, I can provide answers enough to keep concern but keep me out of what I perceive as trouble.

I lie about moods, drinking and cannabis use. I do feel better since starting on venlaflaxine, but I still hate being around people. Almost all of the time I feel the need the need to numb myself before or after dealing with other humans.

I realise that mental illness is not my fault, but it is my responsibility. I'm not sure where my responsibilities end and when I should be asking for more help. Its been a long time since I've seriously considered self harm, but I do say ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I wish I was dead"" at least once a day."
1146,Starving myself as self punishment.,"I guess I never realised this could be considered bad in terms of my mental health but I’ve realised how this period of self-isolation (4 months alone) I’ve been using starvation as a tactic to punish myself for anything and everything I feel guilty about. I feel like a prisoner in self isolation but yet I feel terrible about feeling that way because there are people literally fighting for their lives out there. I’m still allowed to leave the house for necessities and it’s not like I’m forced to stay inside 24/7 but I feel morally obligated not to leave at all. I feel guilty for the few times I messed up and left the house not wearing a mask. I feel guilty I haven’t been motivated enough to put much effort into my work. And worst of all, I feel guilty about even feeling terrible about this whole pandemic situation because I’m one of the lucky ones. 

All of this has led me to use starvation as a way to punish myself, to justify my feelings. To make me feel as though I’m just a little bit more worthy of having these feelings. I’ve lost 7kg in the last 4 months and I haven’t been this light since I was 14. I believe I’m now underweight or close to it and this change in my body has only added to the lost of my sense of myself. I placed a lot of my self-identity in my hair and clothes and body and now that I’ve lost so much of it, I feel guilty that I’ve done this. And then I feel guilty about feeling guilty because I’m not the one dying from the virus and it just continues to go into a never ending cycle. 

I don’t know how to break out of this."
1147,Can someone please help me identify how i’m feeling?,"This is hard to explain but I’ll add an example that happened today. I borrowed my dads car to drive and see some friends and hit it on the curb by accident scraping it and damaging the tire a little bit. It wasn’t so bad but I cried driving home because I felt guilty and stupid and a failure. He trusted me and I scraped his car. Then I was thinking about how one day he won’t be around which made me cry more. 

Then I thought about the times I had a short temper with him or got easily annoyed which made me continue to cry. I got home and showed him the car and he said it was okay and not to cry but ive just been in a depressive state for the rest of the day and i’m scared that because im embarrassing and a failure my friends probably don’t even like me. 

All because of a scraped car

Similar things happen like sometimes i’ll remember how I was rude to my sister once 8 years ago and I’ll want to cry because I feel horrible even though we have a normal relationship

1150,Effexor 150mg..scared to be on it m27,"have been on 75mg for 8 weeks with no improvement and a little bit of sleep disturbances and slight anorgasmia. My psychiatrist bumped me up to 150mg and now it is extremely hard to have an orgasm. 

Has anyone had this side effect diminish over time? Also, my psychiatrist said he has rarely ever had someone stay on only 75mg especially if they have anxiety issues. I have anxiety and depression about equally. What dosage are you all on? Thanks!"
1151,Think I need to deal with past trauma. Would I probably be best seeking therapy?,"My trauma is much less serious than a lot of the trauma other people have suffered from, but now that I've stopped taking drugs I realise that I've still not exactly dealt with it very well.

I'm a 22 year old male, and from the ages of 14 through to 16 I was in an on/off relationship with a girl that was emotionally abusive, and sometimes physically abusive. She'd had her fair share of trauma that dated back to the early years of her childhood so I really do feel for her. She really struggled to deal with it and I think that lead to her taking it all out on me.

She was my first love and for years (even through the abuse) I thought I'd found 'the one'. It wasn't until I was about 18 that I'd given up on the idea that she was the girl of my dreams.

We were totally obsessed with each other and nothing was more important to us than the love we shared. Typical teenager stuff I guess. We were extremely happy with each other until about 8 months into our relationship. I'd never been so happy in all my life, but suddenly she turned extremely cold towards me and I couldn't figure out why. One minute she'd be extremely loving and the next she'd be absolutely brutal in the way she treated me. I'd wrack my brain all the time trying to figure out what I was doing wrong but it only made me even more confused. She was later diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but this wasn't until after our relationship.

When our relationship turned sour I hit an extremely low point where I was severely depressed and self harming quite often. The only person I'd turn to about any of it was her, but whenever she saw the cuts on my arm or I'd open up to her about being depressed, she'd tell me I need to man up and that I'll never be a man. I was 14 years old and she was putting me down on an almost daily basis for not being a man. It got the a point where I'd tell her I loved her and she'd tell me to man up and quit being so pathetic. She called me pathetic whenever she took her anger out on me which was almost every day.

She used to absolutely adore it when I'd tell her I love her, but now she'd begun putting me down for it. She used to tell me all the time about how much she needed me and how she'd always love me, but now she was telling me she can't be with me anymore and that I disgusted her. It was like she'd go into a blind rage where she was someone completely unrecognisable, and then she'd be the most loving girl I'd ever met.

She'd break up with me and tell me it was so she could go out and sleep with other guys (these other guys turned out to be some of my closest friends), and then a day or two later she'd come back to me telling me about everything she'd done and how she needed me always and I was the only 'man' she truly wanted. It was a constant cycle for about a year and I was so in love with her that I'd take her back every single time. I ended up severely insecure and more depressed than I've ever been. I've never been so depressed still to this day. I kept a lot of my depression to myself and would rarely tell her how much it was affecting me, but whenever I couldn't handle it anymore and I'd open up to her or she'd find cuts on my body - she'd just tell me I need to be a man and that I disgusted her. I'd start crying over it and she'd unleash her rage and tell me she's gonna go fuck my friend and send me videos of it. She'd cheat on me so often that it turned me extremely insecure and I ended up a really jealous guy but my low self esteem became something that'd she'd use against me on an almost daily basis.

We'd be texting and she'd suddenly go ""btw I'm sexting Joe, just thought I'd tell you"". This was while we were dating. I hate the term 'simp' but that's literally what I was at that point in time cause I stuck by her through it all. She used to love when I wrote her little love letters and sneak them in her jacket pocket for her to find later, but now she'd find them and tell me to man up or she'll leave me. I'd always beg her to stay but she'd leave me for a day or two, then come back to me breaking her heart about how she'll always love me and she'd always need me.

At one point I told her I'd stopped self harming, which I had, but one day she threatened to leave me and I gave in and cut my wrist. Later that day she came to my house to work things out with me so I put on a long sleeve shirt to hide my cuts. Things ended up going really well and we were in the middle of a loving moment when she noticed the new cuts on my wrist. She totally flipped out again and told me she was leaving me for not being man enough and for breaking my word about never self harming again. She'd push me to the point of breaking down on an almost daily basis and she'd tell me she can't cope with it. At the age of 22 I still don't feel like a man. It's embarrassing but I feel like less of a man than everyone around me. Even people that are younger than I am that look up to me in some way.

One time she broke up with me, and the next night I went to a party at my friends house, got absolutely wasted and hooked up with two girls. I was fucking devastated when I sobered up because I really did still love her. The day after the party I went to her house cause she really wanted to take me back. I didn't tell her about the two girls from the night before, but she found out the next day at school. She hooked me a few times in front of all of my friends, and I was just breaking down about how sorry I was but everyone that heard about what I'd done turned against me. Pretty much every single friend I had suddenly hated me. I never told anyone about the months of abuse she'd been putting me through because I didn't realise I was being abused and I didn't wanna run my mouth about her around the school, but my reputation totally fell apart and not a single friend stood by me.

I was so in love with her that I didn't even realise she was abusive until I was about 18 years old. This was a couple years after our final break up. There were times where she'd hook me in the jaw cause she couldn't handle her anger issues, and she even threw me down her stairs one time when I was 15.

Just 3 or 4 days after our final break up I tried LSD for the first time. The day after that I tried coke and another upper called mephedrone for the first time. This set me off on a drug phase that didn't end until a month ago, and the first year or two of it all was one big crazy mental breakdown where I was absolutely losing it. I'm definitely more sane now but I was in my own world for a couple of years and it freaked the fucked out of my family and everyone that knew me.

I was riddled with guilt, depression and anxiety for years and still to this day I've hardly moved on to the next step in life. I've just stewed in the mess ever since and it's embarrassing.

I left school due to depression and I'd ended up trying to kill myself twice with overdoses at 15/16 and put myself in the hospital both times. I was self harming a lot and spending most of my time in my room taking drugs which totally fried my mind. I'd lost all of my friends within a couple weeks of the break up and even the relationship with my family completely changed. Life was nothing like it was before. I was taking uppers a few times a week from 15 through til I turned 17, and I ended up addicted to opiate painkillers and sold most of my belongings. I'd spend months at a time without a single day of sobriety taking on average 35 painkillers in 24 hours. Even spending weeks on morphine at times. I quit the opiates at the start of this year after overdosing a couple times by mistake, and I was smoking weed every day without fail from 16 til just last month.

I desperately wanted to stop taking drugs for about 4 or 5 years because they were making me extremely socially anxious and I'd lost an insane amount of weight to the point I was only 87 lbs. I was constantly in debt to different people I didn't wanna be in debt to. The anxiety only made my low self esteem so much worse which was the worst part of it all. I embarrassed myself on a daily basis with how difficult it was to think straight and form a simple sentence because my mental clarity was so bad. It ruined my relationship with everyone cause I was always hiding away in my room.

I've been in the same spot in life since I was 15 and I'm now 22. 7 years and I've still not found a full time job. I've just fucked around wasting my life and now that I've stopped taking drugs 38 days ago, I've been drinking for the last 30 days even though I'm beyond sick and tired of not being sober. I hardly even like drinking. My friend smoked heroin in front of me a few nights back so I asked him if I could try some but he said no.

I was happy for about a week when I stopped taking drugs, but I ended up with more mental clarity than I've had since I was 15. This is a great thing and I'd been desperately trying to find mental clarity for years, but I also realised that still to this day I've not dealt with the insecurities and self esteem issues that I ended up with when I was with my ex girlfriend. For years now, whenever I leave the house to go see friends of mine I've needed to take drugs or drink, and I can't seem to get past that. If I don't take something I just end up really socially anxious about being around people. I used to be so outgoing and cheery around my friends up until I was 15/16 and I've never been the same way since. I'm still avoiding people any chance I get unless I'm on something or I've had a drink. I've wanted to get sober for years now but there are so many things that trigger me when it comes to being around anyone and it's so easy to just give in.

I know this post sounds incredibly whiney, but I'm definitely stronger than I was when I was younger. I very rarely stop to dwell on my issues, but the reason I'm posting here is that the last week or so I've realised how much my past relationship still has a huge effect on me and the way I live my life. I got over my ex from years ago when I was 18 or so, but I guess I'm just not quite over the trauma of the past. It's been about 8 years and I thought I'd done a great job, but I stopped taking drugs and realised it was the drugs that kept me held together.

When I was 19 I ended up in a new relationship which lasted 2 years. Everything was great for the first year. Not a single argument! Suddenly everything came crashing down again and my insecurities that I'd suppressed a few years before it came back in a big way and it ended up being a strain on our relationship. We broke up about a year ago now and for 6 months I was hitting the drink and drugs every day which is exactly what happened when I was 16 and I broke up with my first ex. Just didn't last as long this time, thankfully.


Basically, I'm wondering if there'd be much of a point in starting therapy. I used to see a therapist on and off for a couple years when I was 15/16, but I didn't find it very helpful at all. They actually focused more on making a diet plan for me than anything else because I was taking drugs a lot at the time and they didn't wanna focus much on treating my mental health until I was 3 months sober. I kinda see what they were getting at, but 3 months sober at that point in time sounded impossible.

I'm sorry for the long post. I typed it all up in about an hour so it may come across pretty rushed. It all sounds a bit scattered but it'd be interesting to hear your thoughts if you'd like to share them.

Cheers folks."
1152,How do I admit to my therapist that I have suicide idealizations (but wouldn’t attempt it) without worrying about being committed?,"I want to be 100% honest and I know I need to be, but I’ve seen while visiting a family member how terrible state mental health facilities are! The one near me literally has one chair in a big room by the window and all day people take turns sitting in the window chair, like it’s a real horror movie. Regardless, I’m not a danger to myself or others but I do have regularly occurring suicidal idealizations. Can I trust my therapist?"
1153,Psychiatric hospital experience?,"Hi, I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety and depression. I exercise, eat well, have weekly appointments with a psychologist, take my prescribed medicines. Despite this it’s been worsening for a long time now. I feel helpless, I feel like a bad person for not being better, I don’t know what to do. The only thing I haven’t done is be treated inpatient. I have no idea what it’s like or if it’s worked for anyone. Reading about some people’s experiences would be helpful or would at least get my mind off of things. Thank you in advance :)"

1156,22 and need to vent/get input from someone,"Hey all,

So I've been dealing with a lot of mental turmoil lately and just need someone to sort of help conceptualize the way I'm feeling and maybe give a few tips or some stories of relation if possible. 

Basically, I am 22 and have never had an intimate relationship in my life (nor have I even kissed or hugged someone of the opposite sex outside of my mother). Now before I am misjudged, I do not in any way shape or form consider myself an incel or blame any of my perils on women. My problem is that from a young age I've been pretty much disconnected from the opposite sex. Growing up in elementary school I was very nerdy and considered ""weird"", while also not being mature enough for any real relationship obviously. Then come middle and high school when things like that were a bit more normalized I was around 230 pounds at 5'5"" and didn't even really hit puberty until the end of high school, which caused enormously low self-esteem. Despite the lack of connection with females in high school I had a very solid friend group and was able to make some great achievements both grade-wise and in Vo-Tech. Towards the end of high school, I got addicted to smoking pot and cigs which caused me to become extra reclusive towards most people including my own friend group.  I started college shortly after graduating and became pretty depressed throughout. I continued smoking pot daily including before class and somehow managed to maintain respect from my peers as well as finish with a decent GPA, however, I completely missed out on the social/networking aspect due to always ducking lunch meetups or after class study sessions to smoke pot or go home and play games. It's worth noting that my major was male-dominated as well so my root problem never really got close to being fixed.  

Towards the end of college, I began working at a retail store, I was at that point around 5'9"" and 145 pounds due to pretty much starving myself throughout college from stress/sadness. While it was a bad way to lose weight that job was the first time I ever received any female attention in my life and I didn't know how to handle it at all. I remember pretty much blowing an opportunity with 3 different girls, one adored me but I was super annoyed by her (probably because I only cared about cigs and weed), another planned to play Xbox with me one night but I went out to smoke pot with friends instead and got ghosted, and the third I started texting but came off as desperate due to the sheer excitement of finally being able to text a woman.  After graduating I quit that job by just not showing up anymore and got a new job within my field which was totally male-dominated. 

From 2019-2020 I was at this job and promised myself that I would start dating within the year. Due to my job, I relied mainly on Tinder/OkCupid which I think led everything further downhill. As many here can probably relate, performance on Tinder feels like a direct mirror of your own attractiveness and I failed horribly. I would get matches fairly often but just wouldn't know what to say at all and would constantly get tied up in my own mind on what to say. If I wasn't getting matches I'd be super obsessive over my pictures/bio to the point that I don't feel comfortable with a single picture I have or a single bio anymore. I would say over the year I matched with roughly 60 women, 30 of which were bots, and the other 30 I either said something completely stupid or never got a reply off the start. Once COVID hit I lost my job (super small company) and have been on unemployment and considering a degree switch since. 

To keep this somewhat short, this whole cycle continued all the way up until now but is being exacerbated even more due to COVID. I realize that as of right now my only option is online dating but I am not comfortable with a single thing relating to my own profiles. I will post pictures and a bio and within 2 hours look back at it and think ""you look ugly this is stupid"" and close the account. On the flip side, I've at least quit pot and nicotine a few months ago and have found a new love in lifting weights which I've consistently done for the better part of a year now. It just feels like I'm in a cycle where I do not feel complete due to the fact that I have never had a relationship and virtually every single one of my friends has or currently is in one, but I also realize that this incompleteness is massively hindering my ability to date and is probably giving off a huge vibe of desperation to nearly any woman I meet in real life. The past few nights I've been going into severely neurotic episodes at night and figured tonight I'd just spill everything out on here and see if anyone can relate or help me in any way. I am willing to clarify anything within this writeup if needed and greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through this."
1157,"Your ability (or lack thereof) to manage life tasks can be a huge indicator of your state of mental health, and signs you need to seek help.","I posted this in r/pro life tips and it got deleted. You guys might already know this, but here’s a (hopefully) helpful reminder to check in on yourself:

It’s easy to forget to check in on yourself. Huge indicators that you may be headed for a breakdown can be seemingly small things like: messy apartment/room/house, the state of your personal relationships (are you talking to/being honest with other people?), your financial situation (overspending, not paying bills), feeling a lack of empathy for other people, not keeping up with basic hygiene, losing your appetite, etc. 

These have been indicators for me that something was seriously wrong. Hopefully this helps someone who may not know how to recognize the signs. If you step back and realize things aren’t going well, it’s a great chance to reach out to your support group, contact a therapist, or even check yourself in to a mental health facility."
1158,I feel like I can't be enough for my parents,"I'm part of a family of 4, my parents, my sister, and me. For the last couple of months I've had moments where I feel like utter garbageo. My sister is studying in college in a medical field and my parents brag a lot about her. Here I am, a highschooler wanting to go into computer science, president of my school's computer science honor society, part of my school's robotics team, leader and founder of my school's Music Composition Club yet I never hear my parents brag about me. My sister grew up as the almost perfect A student, and while she had her problems, my parents knew and helped her with her stress. 
My parents have never really shares my main interests like music and robotics. I've shown my parents some music I've made before and their main response was ""why not make some Hindi music"", I enjoy making synth music significantly more and don't enjoy making Hindi music. I no longer show my parents my music because they just shrug it off, they don't call my other family members about how I made an album and how nice it is, but they'll go off on how my sister is doing in college. I'm working on a major project rn and I'm excited about it but they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even understand it. I have also tried showing them stuff relating to robotics, but they're not too ""wow'd"" mainly because they don't understand the thing I'm showing them or they don't really care much about it. 
The biggest thing nagging at me has been how ""proud"" they are of me. The last time I've ever heard any of my parents say they're proud of me was during a robotics competition in which we won an award. This was back on freshman year, I'm a senior now.
Thank you for listening/reading what I have to vent. I just really needed to vent this out somewhere where my o don't worry my family and friends too much."

1160,im 14 and i already wanna kms :/,"kinda scared to post this cause of the title.

i have never self harmed, physically at least. I'm not abused by anyone. Not bullied, i mean not by anyone else. Just me. 

Before you say ""You have a future ahead of you!"" I don't. Lack of motivation to do literally beneficial for myself is kind of a bitch. Yes I tried to better myself, and immediately failed. 

I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it, plus my mom would be sad. 

I'm also too much of a pussy to get any help irl, or to post this on my actual account. I lied to a counselor two times about what i wanna do.

I sit on my ass on my computer and phone all day, and during the quarantine it's for 16 - 21 hours a day when I should have been doing school work online. I talk to no one unless it's at school. My phone is always dry. ik discord friends would like to help but im too much of a pussy to tell them. 

tl;dr I do nothing all day and I mentally abuse myself because of it. And i'm not gonna tell anyone that cause im a pussy.

just wanted to spit that out somewhere even if it's no where. 

No, I don't want to talk about it. If you try ill either just not respond or just say no. 

Thanks for listening tho"
1161,I feel as if I am more than one person,[removed]
1162,Very bad nightmare. Idk what it means,"It's a long post and somewhat disturbing

First of all. I'm 21 years old and male and from the uk

I live in a hostel where I'm pretty comfy. The staff are helpful even though I don't accept it most the time. I'm working with someone to help me figure out what I want to do with my life and help me towards that goal. I'm genuinely happy here and I'm grateful to be here. Got here about 6 months ago.

Before I was here I lived with my mother. I've lived with her pretty much my entire life and I feel like I've lost out on those first 20 years. Ik it's something I'll never get back and I've done a lot of things I regret and they still haunt me to this day.

I usually get put down when I'm honest with myself but idc right now. My mother is absolutely awful. Not just to me but as a person. She's lazy, entitled, pretentious, arrogant and she's been nothing but awful to me. I'm not trying to shift blame here, I know what I've done and I'm sorry for it but every problem I've had can be traced back to her in some way.

Just to list some of the things she's done to me. She's attacked me with various objects, spat at me, threatened to kill me, threatened me with her crackhead bf's, made fun of me, manipulated me when I was younger, broke my belongings, forced me to sell my belongings, made fake accusations against me (telling people that I taped her, beat her, stole from her, that I'm a paedophile. I'm not any of those things nor have I done them). Also, I'm not 100 percent on this but I think she's let people sexually assault me. 

I haven't really opened up to anyone about this because i feel like I'll break down. It's so much just to lay on someone.

Anyways. Nearly at the nightmare.
A while back, my mother had spent the last of her money on weed. We had no food or anything so I had to ask my sister for money. It's a little bit which I was very grateful for and I could make it last me ages but my mother wanted a McDonald's. She's a child and she eats literally nothing but McDonald's. Anyways I tried to tell her that we only had a tiny bit of money and that I had to eat too. She wasn't having it and she was doing her usual ""it's McDonald's or nothing"" routine. I had enough and just went to the shop and got a load of food. She begrudgingly ate it all the while screeching at me at the top of her lungs. After she was done she threw the plate at my door. This really upset me and I got a bit angry so I go into her room and say ""wtf you doing"" and all that, I called her some names too and I push this small lamp on the floor.

 It was really petty but I didn't know how to handle the emotions I was feeling at the time. I was angry and I wanted to hit her but I know I'm a better person than that (I've never struck her btw). Anyways I walk out and she chases me and starts punching me in the back of the head and scratching me. I start pushing her away from me but she kept coming back and eventually started pulling my hair and punching me so I push her to the floor and pin her wrists to the floor until she stops fighting. I let her go and she walks into her room calling me all these names and it was the same as usual after that. Ringing people telling them I beat her and sexually assaulted her.

That was the end of that pretty much. Now the actually nightmare. I'm basically replying this event in my head up until I restrain her on the floor. She gets her wrist loose and takes a swing for me. Then I grab her wrist with both my hands and I bite a huge chunk out of it. The wound is in great detail. I can see all the bones in her wrist and it's bleeding like crazy. 

I woke straight up after that which was about 9pm (I was having a nap) it's 4 am now and I've felt so uneasy. I'm disgusted at the dream and it turns my stomach thinking about it. I'm freaking out because I don't know what it means or why I thought of that. I've never even seen the inside of a wrist and it was so vivid I can't forget it.

I'm not a violent person. I don't hit people or get into fights. I don't take drugs and I occasionally drink. I'm not on any meds or anything. If you're still reading this then thank you for taking the time out of your day."

If someone ignores your accomplishments or makes you feel guilty for talking about your problems and asking for help, just ignore them because I can assure you that you deserve so MUCH better.

1164,My mom treats my younger brother better than me,"For the last 4 years I’d my life my mom has treated my brother better than me. I have been tested for autism and they said I didn’t have autism. Yet she continues to tell people I’m “special needs” or “autistic” people such as my school, family friends and even strangers. She doesn’t let me drive and didn’t let me get a job for a year bc she thinks i have perception issues and I’ve been told by doctors my bipolar which has been regulated for a decade doesn’t effect my driving yet she continues to not let me drink yet let my 16 year old brother drink (I’m 18.5) and she claims it’s because of my medicine yet she takes medicine for seizures and drinks a lot. What do I do? I’m stuck here another year for 12+ and I’m constantly being treated like shit."

1166,Myths about mental health,"What are some of the common myths about why people don’t seek out mental health support? 

A few I can think of right away:

- Therapy is for crazy people, and I’m not crazy 
- I’m too busy/don’t have the time in my schedule 
- it’s too expensive/no resources 

Any more tokens of wisdom? if you could add why the myths are not true would be even better! I’m Just curious and have been thinking about this in relation to some of my loved ones... hoping this will help them ❤️ thanks in advance !"
1167,Feeling Lonely and Sad,[removed]
1168,I’ve never really understood how people are able to suppress their thoughts &amp; memories,"I went through a lot of traumatic events during my childhood and I’ve never really forgotten about the really bad ones. However, I have some friends that will tell me that they cannot remember anything from their own childhood because of the things they faced. It sort of confuses me? Because the things I went through have stuck with me ever since it happened, it’s like it has become part of my life. I just want to know how one is able to repress these types of things? Because of how different it is for me. As I said before my mind has become so fixated on the bad things that have happened that my whole life revolves around the very few that have stuck out to me. There’s not a day I don’t ponder back on it and just get angry at myself"
1169,Am I understanding this right? The only way to not be lonely is to get into a relationship?,"Basically, I don't have a ton of friends and my best friend spends 95% of her time with her boyfriend. Even during quarantine I would see her maybe once a week because all the other time was set aside for her boyfriend. I get it, honeymoon phases or whatever, having a bf is super fun and feels great, etc. But I'm just so lonely. I know it's inappropriate to expect my friend to hangout with me more when she's doing what makes her happy, but I just don't know what to do.. am I putting too much of my own happiness into my friendship? Should I be able to not care if my friend can't hangout as much as I would like? My mom has alluded that this is normal and that maybe I should get a boyfriend. But if this is normal, does that mean that everybody on earth just doesn't hangout with friends very much once they have a partner? I've been trying to work on myself and not let my value be determined by having a bf or not, but now that almost seems futile because what's the point if everybody else is doing it? idk. Does that even make sense? 

Do I just need to make more friends? I don't have a very large support system and my family isn't part of it, so I don't have a ton of people to hangout with during the week /:."
1170,"PTSD (not war related nor the millennial version of “trauma,” but very real)","*MH trigger warning* (also this will be spotty, as mine are usually spotty)
It’s like a dream over takes my vision; a memory that isn’t my own, but is from my own perspective. The same song is playing in the background, but I’m two years back. I’m on the floor, surrounded by my own blood and a knife that belonged to my old roommate. 

I remember more this time

I yell at an old friend, that I now remember that I’ve called. I remember now how the blood i wiped off the door got on there. I remember stumbling over to unlock the chain for them. I remember yelling at them to not take a photo because I knew I couldn’t handle remembering it all. They made me throw up and threw me in the tub to find all of the places I’d hurt myself (they used to be a firefighter and had a bit of training). 

x

I’m in the shower the next morning, looking at my arm, objectively seeing the skin cells and the fat cells. Instead of being concerned, my brain covered this up by appreciating the human anatomy course I had taken before I had transferred universities...before I let two different psychiatrists misdiagnose my grief as depression and put me on a dangerous dose of an antidepressant. 

x

I’ve been four different places for a short few seconds, remembering how I broke glass, used nail clippers, over drank, or just did something stupid to try and escape the pain I was in. The pain I knew I shouldn’t be in. The pain my brain justifiably shouldn’t be feeling. 

I remember it all as if it’s my first time experiencing it. 

I slowly become nauseous and want to disappear from sheer embarrassment from what I put my friends through. 

x

There’s a reason why antidepressants has a black box warning on them. I share my experience to encourage other young adults to ask for a brain scan before they’re in a situation I was and now am in. 

These scars should not be my own. These scars are not me and they will not define me. My brain was developed enough to not do something like this, but I failed myself to not fight the health system in the US until it was too late (I was hospitalized bc of these meds, and it took my parents coming to yell at a social worker to prevent a second hospitalization and get me off the medication). 

Take care of yourselves. 

With love x"

1174,How to be happy and not lonely without a partner?,"I'm in the process of learning that once you're an adult, people just don't have that much time for friends anymore. I have one good friend and she's in a relationship and only wants to hangout about once a week, and so I'm very lonely on the days that we don't see each other. Is this just how life is? If you're not in a relationship, you're just lonely? Is that how it is for everyone or am I just doing something wrong? Do you learn to not be lonely when you're alone all the time?

I feel like I'm having growing pains. Is this normal?  Is there something else I should be doing? I have poor mental health in general but it just seems so bleak to me... I feel like my only chance at happiness is getting a boyfriend and I've been trying really hard recently to not let my happiness/worth be determined by if a man wants me or not. I think it's important to learn to be happy alone but it's like a slap in the face realizing no one close to me shares that ideal. 

I don't know. I just don't know how to be happy, especially not when I'm so lonely. Everything just seems so pointless."
1175,Haven’t Felt Like Doing Anything,Since this Pandemic happened I haven’t felt like doing anything such as going outside and hanging out with my family.

Is this happening to anyone else or is it just me?

1177,Struggling being a single parent,"Okay so bare with me bc I've never really spoke about any of this and it feels easier to do to strangers on the Internet. I'm 20, and a single dad. When he was born, the relationship was in extremely dire circumstances and for the good of my son, a month after he was born I broke up with her, as I couldn't stand to let him witness any of it. After a couple months of never knowing when or how I was gonna see my baby, I ended up in a really bad state. At this point his mother attempted suicide twice, and I ended up taking sole custody of him, and I've had him since October of last year. Way too many people seem to adamantly believe that only women end up in this situation, and it really isn't true. Currently, my son is doing incredibly well but I'm subsiding my own problems and needs in place of his, and I've no idea on how to start rectifying this. I genuinely feel like I've been put on pause and the pure isolation of being in my situation, and having no one I know who can comprehend the kinds of emotion I've had to deal with is slowly eating away at me. I'm not even particularly sure what I aim to achieve by posting this, it'd just be nice to hear what people think and whether people can relate to what I'm dealing with.

1178,How do I manage my anger?,"I've been stuck at home for 100+ days, and I've got a bad case of cabin fever. I can manage most of the other symptoms but my anger is really hard to manage.

1180,Sleep Procrastination is slowly killing me.,"Hi, since college days I've been struggling on my habit of binge internet everyday and it get worse on weekends. During workdays days I managed to get around 6-7 hours of sleep but on weekday sometimes I only got 5 hrs of sleep, sometimes if I'm lucky I get around 8 hours of sleep, btw I live in noisy neighborhood almost everyday construction noise are always persistent, loud edm music, hill song etc, noise mostly starts at 7am. Catching up sleep on weekends is a struggle as well.

 I tend to have a habit of binging on Netflix, memes, socmed and games even on workdays, but it gets worse when its nearing end of the workday. I dunno I tend to act like a teenager when it comes to my sleeping habit, I have not so consistent sleep schedule on weekdays I tried to get at least some 6-7 hours of sleep, I tried to sleep before 1am but anxiety always get me awake at night, thinking about work, awkward conversation, past mistakes, existential dread, self loathe. Then on weekends I struggle to follow that not so ideal sleep schedule but I end my binging on same hobbies around 2 or 3 am worst 4 am, hence fucking up my bad sleep schedule more. I tried to use apps to manage my sleep schedule/anxiety but every time I finished a course example 1 month better sleep course I tend to spiral out of control again, I tried to journal everyday but I stopped, maybe because I was in stressful week at work, to forget the struggles at work I binge on same hobbies, it's been a week now since my last journal entry. 

My sleeping pattern/habits is now affecting everything from work, to family, even friends, takes noticing I've become irrational, irritable, out of focus, snub etc, worse are poor decisions at work partly brought by the lack of sleep. Also my dark humor has intensified maybe a coping mechanism to my failures. Also I struggle to learn my attention span is now of a goldfish. What's worse is that I have to learn new things almost everyday at work, working at it where learning new things, trainings are a must to keep up with technology, I hardly learn something.

 I cringe on the quality of work I did, I felt like I'm the bad apple in the office, the weakest link, the slowest to learn or the one who couldn't follow instructions or do decent report/presenting. On health I'm now hypertensive, easily forgetting (I sometimes joke to friends that dementia has set in)

I felt dumber everyday as days passed by having this shitty sleep habit. I even struggle getting to post this on this subreddit, I dunno I feel so anxious getting help. 

Btw thanks for your time reading my cry for help"
1181,What is going on with me,"I experience the physical symptoms of emotion like crying, but inside I feel nothing. Like if I get yelled at I’ll cry, but feel nothing inside and question whether or not I’m feeling anything because I’m experiencing the physical symptom of emotion"
1182,Why is everything turning weird?,"I’ve been on house arrest for a year and clean from drugs for some time and I can’t remember each day that goes by I forget everything, if I ate earlier, what day it is, if I took my meds idk if I been doubling the dose cause it’s so fucked. Now I feel like there’s a strange force and every second it skips past my life and the past year zoomed by. Nothing looks how it should and talking to people feels like I’m hiding things again and it’s so much anxiety. :( why? All of the sudden it getting so much worse I can’t do anything it all feels so wrong it was never like this. It’s like is it June or July? Or April even though I told myself it is July a million times why can’t I remember anything that happened a second ago?"

1185,"This is my AMA, I want people who are curious to feel free to ask questions from someone who has experience.",
1186,This is more of stuff I need to just say that I can’t to the people around me.,"I’m with a amazing girl. But she only wants to say what I’m doing wrong and blames me for everything. She helped me through a lot and lately we’ve been so divided. I deal with a lot of anger but I’ve never shown any aggression towards her, I have it in me to hold it back from her but I’m scared that one day I will snap and not be able to control myself as it has happened many times. I don’t wanna fight anyone as I’m a passive person but I’ve been in so many fights and my friends people I see as family because I have no family they are scared to make me mad and I feel like there only there because there scared of me. My girlfriend isn’t scared of me but she pushes me constantly and I’m having such a hard time figuring out why. Today I almost hurt my best friend because her and him were just getting to comfortable around each other we were all drinking but I don’t drink so even sober I noticed and it took all I had not to just erupt. I know this is a lot of random stuff but putting it out makes things just a little easier as I have no one to vent to."

1189,I don’t know if I should give up my friends.,"I met them in a group around May. I’ve been with them for around 1-2 months now and it’s just tiring. New people are constantly coming into the group and this one person, I just can’t tolerate them because they’re always pissing everyone off. I just wanna go, but I feel like I’ve known them for a while, even if it was only 1-2 months. But every time I go to the group chat, something is wrong. Someone is trying to kill themselves or a argument is going down. It’s so frustrating. I try to reason with them, talk to them about how they’re beautiful. But they keep saying “No.” At this rate, I’m about to start saying “Yeah, I guess you are.” It’s just so frustrating. And I just ended whole group full of friendships a few months ago because of the same reason. More of the person lying, and then that leaded me to break off multiple friendships due to that one person. I’m still recovering from that. I’m not as attached to this group as my last one, but I’m really debating if I should leave. I don’t know if sounds selfish either, or if I sound inconsiderate."
1190,I’m in a bad place but for some reason I am heavily against people knowing,"I am in my early teens, and I’ve been having some problems with my mental health. I don’t know whats wrong with me, and it’s been really confusing and bad for a while. But the thought of my parents brothers or friends knowing is terrible to me. And I don’t know why. I can talk to my school counselor, but she always calls my mom. I talk to my therapist but  she’ll tell my my parents if there is something big wrong with me. And besides that talking about it is really hard. I just freeze up. 

I need a way to explain my feelings and get help, but I don’t want to almost. My parents are not doing anything to me, but I often find myself wanting to run away, to escape. I have brothers, and I share my room with one of them and I hate it. But I don’t know why. I don’t like hanging out with them, or being alone. I don’t know what’s happening and I feel like I can’t tell anybody IRL. Because nothing they ever do is helpful. It’s just trying to talk about it (which I can’t do) and bringing up what I think started it (although it might have started before) which makes everything worse. I want to be helped but if I do have some sort of mental illness (we talked about depression and stuff in school and I’m exhibiting many signs) I want to be left alone. I don’t want things to be different, I want the help without the conversations with my parents, but I can’t have that. 

And another thing. Every time I see a meme about teenage girls self diagnosing themselves with mental illness I feel like I’m making this all up. Like it’s fake because that’s just a teenage gril thing. And then it’s always “period” “your PMSing” even when I know I’m not because my period ended a week before.

I hate sharing a room. I hate being forced to hang out with my family. I hate everything and I don’t know why. My life is great. Two really bad things have happened to me specifically recently, and even before the coronavirus I’ve been really sad, even though there are countless ways this could be worse. And every bodies always saying “stop wining about your quarantine so and so has it worse” as if I. And have feelings too just because others have worse lives. 

Help. I don’t know what’s happening"
1191,I am finally doing good,"Eating properly, 1 month free of self harm, stable mental health, and finally beginning to accept myself. I am so happy and I love life for once. Haven't thought of suicide for weeks. Life can be good sometimes. :)"
1192,Panic attack just before happy news,"My lovely panic attack started today just before we got to my partner's parents house, where we were meant to be having brunch with them, his three brothers and wives/children. While I get along with his family, I am very wary of his two younger (twin)brothers, who are self-satisfied, rude, and obnoxious. They tend to expect things to go their way basically all the time. I'm not the only one to think this either. 
Anyway, in the start it was a mild attack, but then as his brother greeted us by tapping his watch (we were cooking bacon and eggs for everyone) I lost my head and had a go at him. Needless to say, I was judging myself heavily for that and it made me more anxious. 
While I was cooking, I became incredibly anxious, and could barely talk to anyone, or look at anyone because I was on the verge of years the whole time. Which was great, just as one of the younger brothers and wife announced they were having another baby. I knew this was coming, because they never organise family get togethers unless they have some other reason. But while it's a very joyous moment, I couldn't muster the false happiness that I should be feeling for them (middle of a panic attack, I'm also sick of everything they say and do being about babies, and also, my partner and I are putting off children for a little while, which makes me sad). I couldn't deal with this news and while I managed to hold it together, I also felt like a fraud with a very fake congratulations. 
I had to keep it together for another almost two hours before I could go home and fall apart. I just want to keep crying and my mind is going in circles and I can't deal with my thoughts and I don't want to keep judging myself, but wanted to vent it. 
It's so hard sometimes not to believe you're a bad person for something so small. I feel like everyone noticed my behaviour and I feel so ashamed. I'm usually much more mindful, even when I'm a little anxious, but it was just so out of my control today. I know it's temporary, but bloody hell, my brain is its own entity sometimes, and it's scary."
1193,Downwards.,"Every day I disappoint myself and others in new ways. My depression worsens despite me taking my medication and every I just keep talking myself about how to commit suicide in the most efficient way. I have come to rationalize suicide for my situation. I know I am a coward but looking at life from different angles make the decision I want to make worth it. I just want this to end, my loneliness, my failures, being forgotten by family and 'friends'. Death is a cruel but fair mistress."
1194,How to manage physical reactions to anxiety/stress &amp; how to deal with relationship/confrontation related anxiety?,"Basically, for me I’m usually quite a calm person and not too much stresses me besides - relationships and confrontation. When any kind of argument or big issue erupts between me and someone I care about friends/family/significant other I just get this extremely anxious, stressed and panicked reaction which is so uncharacteristic of my usual self. It’s only ever things regarding relationships that brings me this stress and I know it’s way more of an extreme reaction then it should be and I’m not sure why or how to progress from here. Every time a situation like I describe occurs I begin to shake so hard it’s like I’m convulsing and I try to get warm as possible but nothing stops it, my heart feels like it’s going to break out of my rib cage, my body feels like it’s buzzing and like I’m going to hyperventilate and I get so sweaty. After a while I start to feel sick to my stomach and always end up getting morning sickness the next day. I end up sitting over the toilet purely because I stressed myself out so much it takes such a toll on my body. I’m wondering if anyone else suffers this kind of relationship/confrontation triggered anxiety? the idea that I’m hurting someone I love or that a relationship I have with someone could potentially end/be damaged (even when it’s not even a huge deal or is actually the other persons fault), it just sends me into a state of panic. Not really sure where to go from here because it’s gotten to the point where it’s causing me so much stress and exhaustion from my overthinking and anxiousness that I just want to work towards a solution. If anyone has experience with this or knows ways that may help to reduce my stress or deal physical symptoms that would be great :)"
1195,I can't stop thinking that everyone I know is dead,"Recently I've been feeling very worried, and I felt like I'm running out of time.

I keep thinking that everyone I love will die soon, that i'll never see them again. I'm christian but It's hard to truly believe that I'll be able to see everyone again.

Perhaps I'm the one that will die, and I'm mourning for the ones I love.

Everyday if someone isn't with me or is not in the room I will start feeling sad and begin to mourn for them even though I know they're fine and they are not dead.

Maybe I'm really clingy and soft hearted, but it feels so real, like they're gone gone. That I will never see them again. I cry. 
I cry at night worrying about people I care about. 
I'm so scared, I feel like everyone will die soon, that something terrible is about to happen. 

Something like a tragedy, like I'll die or someone(s) will die very, very soon. 

I'm constantly worried, I'm scared, I'm really scared, I feel like everyone will vanish. I'm sorry. 
Everyone is dead.. soon.. And I feel like it is all my fault that they will die soon. I'm not ready, I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared."
1196,Social Media makes me so anxious,"During the first wave of COVID, I took a break and deactivated all my social media accounts because I had a gut feeling I would be better without it. It made me feel really anxious all the time beneath the surface. For some reason, I feel really uncomfortable seeing what’s going on with others and seeing pictures of them.

I recently wanted to start pursuing twitch streaming with the support of my friends but I knew I would need to market and outreach through my social media’s so I redownloaded and reactivated. 

I scrolled through my Instagram feed for an hour or so and I feel so unstable. I feel like I am unhinged and I just have so much discomfort I want to scream. I feel like crying and shaking and never leaving my bed again. I don’t understand why it disturbs me this much. I don’t know if I’m using social media as a scape goat for my anxiousness or it’s the cause. 

Does anyone else also feel this way? Does anyone have insight?"
1197,I have a friend that’s suicidal,"I’m 13 years old, I have a friend who’s self harming and she doesn’t really care about anything that much anymore. We still talk a bit but we can only talk online. Her self harming has become an addiction and I want things the way they used to be when we were really chill with each other and we vibed. Her mom doesn’t understand her mental health and I don’t think she knows that her daughter is self harming. I haven’t told anyone else about this, but one of my other friends knows about it. I haven’t told my parents about my friend because then they’ll think my friend is crazy and plus, I can’t go to her and help her because of the coronavirus and other things. What can I do?"
1198,My wife just had a mental breakdown,[removed]
1199,Venting,"Sorry if I had any grammar problems mistakes, I'm bad at English.

I've been feeling this way for like 3 years now, but even now I'm still unsure if I'm just lying for attention and I still hate myself for it.


I've manipulated multiple people in the past and I even accept that I can be toxic sometimes. I just lie in my vents to act as if I'm in a crisis to make them worry about me. I feel so relieved knowing that someone cares about me even though I was always lying. I hate it so much but it's almost like no one realizes my feelings unless I purposely search for care.


I'm an artist myself and often gets compliments on my works, just recently I noticed how much I actually hated compliments and how it has blinded me from all the flaws. It was at that moment I started hating everything I did, never really expressed my disgust for myself in public for a while, here I am again.


I feel so weirdly attached to people who are considered manipulative, not because they manipulated me but because I can emphasize with them in a way. I actually enjoy it when people harass and critique my whole being. I don't even know why. I once interacted with someone with HPD and they randomly vanished all of a sudden and I still can't get over it because of how attached I was.


Despite how devastated I sound in my vents, I often am still like a normal person on the outside, I have some friends, I enjoy chatting with them. Don't even know which is fake and which is real in my feelings anymore. I feel like I'm exaggerating everything when at the same time I'm so sad, desperate for reassurement. I want to die, but I'm terrified of what will happen if I fail. I really just want something that can explain what is wrong with me, it's so tiring and I can't bear living without thinking about how others think about me. "
1200,i forgot people that were important to me overnight,"i woke up two days ago, and went to check my phone like i do every morning, but when i looked at my recent contacts, i saw somebody i swear i never talked to before. i looked at our previous messages and it was apparently an ex boyfriend where we broke the day before i lost my memory. i asked them who they were, we talked, and he got freaked out when i didn’t know who he was. he showed me photos of us together that i really don’t remember AT ALL and then told me to text another friend that i had no idea who he was referring to. i texted my friend and he was also shocked that i didnt remember anything about him. apparently we were really close. looking at photos triggered an emotion but not really any memories coming back. i’m not sure what happened like is it a physical thing? or is it a mental thing? and what should i do about it?"
1201,(20F) weird thoughts regarding suicide that I’ve never heard of people having before?,"Honestly, like many people on here, I’ve just been having a very hard time lately. I can’t shake the feeling that everything I hold close to my heart is being ripped away one by one. I was facing some anxiety and depression before coronavirus was even a thing, feeling pretty hopeless and all but my boyfriend was really supportive and reminded me I’m not broken and helped me find a therapist through our school. My life literally seemed perfect on paper like loving family, great school, good GPA, awesome relationship, financially stable, but I was still so sad and I couldn’t help it.

And then once corona hit and I had to move back home and my boyfriend and I became long distance it’s like everything external started to go downhill too. My pet of 10 years passed away, my dad lost his job, my boyfriend broke up with me, and now it seems like you name it, everything I start looking forward to gets screwed up somehow. 

My parents are really worried for me and make me send them pictures of me eating to prove that I ate since I’ve lost a ton of weight, and they witnessed one of my panic attacks just last week, but I’ve been having them for a while. My boyfriend and I ended well at first but I was really sad because I loved him so much and he wasn’t sad at all... and I just got so unexplainably mad at him for that. I feel like my depression ruined our relationship because I would have episodes and try to talk to him about all the ways my brain was sabotaging me and he just couldn’t understand and had to leave. And that’s a sucky sucky feeling because he was one of the only people who was really supporting me, and when I got angry I went off on him and I feel like I ruined that friendship as well and he’s just going to think I’m crazy.

Lately I’ve had weird thoughts around suicide. Mostly this: I feel like my entire problem for all my life has been this obsessive need to please other people. And for that reason I literally could not kill myself. I couldn’t stand bringing pain to my family like that, and I couldn’t stand people thinking I was selfish that I had everything so perfect and still couldn’t push through life, and I’ve grown up religious so obviously suicide has some bad stigma around it there. And even though it might seem like a good thing that I can’t kill myself, it almost makes me feel more helpless. Because if I knew I could just end things and life could have no more struggles then at least i have that control over my life, but instead it’s like I’m letting everyone else control it and physically cannot take my life into my own hands, not to mention that now it seems like that easy out isn’t possible and I’m going to HAVE to do life the hard way. Just feels very hopeless. 

I know that’s probably a bad thought to have and I’ve been trying to find a therapist around my home but since I’m working 40 hours a week and now my dad lost his job and we can’t afford anything expensive, it seems so impossible. 

Idk, it just sucks that I have these thoughts because I feel like depression will be so much baggage in whatever relationship I have from now on since it already made this very supportive guy that I loved so so much run away. And even though there shouldn’t be, there’s just such a stigma behind mental health problems and I’m afraid no one’s gonna wanna marry “depressed girl who has to post her suicidal thoughts on reddit because she doesn’t have anyone else who will understand” 

I’m sorry, there’s really no TLDR for this except that everything I love seems to be slipping away and I feel very hopeless but that’s everyone rn anyway. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
1202,I don't know how to celebrate a special occasion,"No matter what I achieve, I always feel like I failed myself and fell short of my ridiculously high standards that I've convinced myself is reasonable. It's like being in an abusive relationship with myself.

I recently landed a job. More of a long-term internship(co-op) for the next 6 months. I'm in grad school full time but I'll be working for the next semester instead of going to classes. 

Many of my classmates were struggling to land internships even pre-COVID, including me. Come COVID, most of them gave up applying because every company was sending them the ""We've cancelled our internship program due to COVID"" email. The point is, on paper, it's supposed to be a ""good"" accomplishment that I landed this job given how competitive the environment is. However, me being me, I've told myself that I shouldn't have gotten the job, that this wasn't a difficult interview and that I was just lucky, that I should have gotten something better. That I don't deserve it. 

I want to now try and con myself into believing that I do deserve this job, and I want to do it by celebrating. Having not been happy in a very long time, I don't know how to treat myself. I thought I'd buy a bottle of whiskey to enjoy, but then I'm not a big drinker. I've gotten drunk with my friends in the past, but in those occasions I enjoyed the company and not the actual drink itself. I don't even like whiskey that much. 

Do you have any idea on how I should find something that makes me happy?"
1203,My ex from 7+ years ago still haunts my nightmares,"I do not still love or have any romantic feelings towards this person and haven't for a long time. I am in a much healthier relationship with someone I love for over two years now. I do not miss my toxic ex and I don't think about them at all during my everyday life.......but they must still be bothering me on some subconscious level since I have frequent nightmares about them.

Is this healthy? Will these dreams ever go away? Have any if you had similar experiences and found anything that worked for you?"
1204,Forgive Yourself,"Forgive yourself, for every wrong decision you took.

Let the sunshine wash away your regret. 

Let your heart beats calm down for the angst you feel against your soul.

Let the valleys in your mind make you feel heavenly. 

To heal you must forgive your own self, the very existence of it; mentally and physically, for all the mistakes committed. 

We all have made mistakes and have regrets. Now, it’s time to forgive yourself. Keep it in the past and focus on the beautiful future you have."
1205,Weird things happening in my brain,"Hi, so I'm going to attempt to explain what I feel sometimes, it's really weird.

Randomly, it feels like someone is pouring a cold liquid on my brain. This liquid is either a rush/wash of hormones/chemicals or electrical sparks. Sometimes the wash occurs and nothing else happens. Lately I've been getting this but like terror/fear is suddenly in liquid form. I'm not scared, like I'll be loading the dishwasher and suddenly my thoughts have a weird terrified aura around them (eg 'this plate goes here, I need to put cups in next' will be a normal thought but it suddenly feels dark and terrifying but also it isn't.) When this happens I'm still totally functional, rational, and it's a bit like I can feel thoughts change auras in a singular part of my brain while the rest of my brain is normal. 
Also, sometimes when this rush of whatever over my brain happens, it feels like a horror movie soundtrack. I literally hear the scary suspense-building sound!! 

When I was little sometimes I would feel like I was super tiny/ant sized in a ginormous space, then immediately random body parts would get bigger until I was giant. I also had the thoughts that felt weird too and something like tv static/tinnatus/THX movie company logo sound feels as well. I thought this situation was just imagination but this weird state of mind has returned! 

Analogy: thoughts have a font. Normally, the font is idk Calibri. Randomly, the font changes to Chiller. Nothing happened to the words, it's now just in a different font! 

Anyways it's not anxiety or panic attacks. It's definitely isolated to the brain. I don't know if I described it perfectly because it's so difficult to explain but yeah that's my weird stuff"
1206,Reliving traumatic memories,[removed]
1207,Horrible tendency of rage.,"Internally i am ashamed to have accept that something is up with me, and now i genuinely don't know what to do. Due to a bad childhood i've felt quite powerless all my life. So naturally, i went into the world of fighting games to feel powerful. It never worked though. What started off as silly salt turned into self harm, i would punch myself if i wasn't able to do something right, mostly in the face or thigh, i would begin to strangle my neck to get anger out, maybe yell, but mostly this rage kept growing. So i tried to stop playing to calm down and joined social medias to try and become a better person since none of us n really go outside too much atm. What turned into simple fun became more anger and even more self harm, this is when i began to use sharp objects to stab things like a desk or planks of wood, and if i were to just shut up and stop, i know i'd go crazy because i'll have to accept in life that i am powerless and can't do anything to change. Suicide has been on my mind a lot recently. Everything i've always wanted to do, i can't, or can't afford to do it. I do not know what i can do to help myself atm, i am 13 and a male."
1208,Im concerned about my mom's weird behaviour against my dad,"Every morning i would wake up to my mom screaming insults (i dont know if to call it a scream, because mostly it sounds just like a zombie, but sometimes her voice goes up) against my dad. But she is alone. In her room. She keeps repeating the same stuff (f*ck you, go to hell, die).

This shit has been going on since when i was 8 or something, sometimes it never happens but it started again in these days. Its really annoying and when i was small sometimes i would cry about it but now that im older i can bear with it (im 15 now) but still, i want to have a good sleep."
1209,I feel like I’m sinking,"So here’s a little backstory on me:
I’m a 16 year old guy. I’m pretty introverted (like 60-70% introverted), I’ve had pretty bad anxiety my entire life (socially and generally). I also have depression. I’m pretty sure I have ADHD and OCD as well. It’s hard for me to make friends, but even harder for me to keep the ones I make. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’m interested in things that a lot of people aren’t exactly interested in (activism and filmmaking, for example). I come from a close family, but a lot of the time I feel like an outsider. I also feel self conscious about my body, my personality, and pretty much everything about myself a lot of the time.

So here’s my problem: I feel like I’m sinking, as you can read from the title. I feel like things will never be good for me. I feel like I’ll always have feelings of strongly disliking myself. I feel like I’ll never have long-lasting, strong friendships, or a girlfriend. I, a lot of the time, feel like nobody likes me and that people are only nice to me out of pity. I feel like nobody values what I have to say. There’s definitely more to all of this, but that’s everything that I have off the top of my head without making this post too lengthy. I, as you can obviously tell, need advice on how to feel better.

By the way, I do have a therapist for those who are wondering. I’ve been seeing him for about 3 years."
1210,Effected by the death of Reckful,"Since the death of Reckful I have been watching alot of his content and I don't even know why I didn't actually know about him until he died which is a massive shame as I feel we are quite similar and I would of loved to speak to him. anyway considering I have never met, watched or spoke to him I can't help but feel loss to the point of tears last night after seeing his twitch channel was showing old content of him. 

Some of you may know parts of my story including that I have been medicated for the last 2 yrs but have had depression and anxiety including suicidal thoughts since early teens and the same age as Reckful so maybe it is the similar aspects of our lives which are drawing me to him but if this is effecting me like this it must be effecting many of you.

1211,Can anxiety cause asthma?,"For the second time this year, i struggled breathe for 15 minutes. During those 15 minutes, my chest felt tight, i hyperventilated which caused me to wheeze, my heart rate went nuts, my throat felt like it closed up, I couldn’t stop crying, and i had the feeling of pins and needles in my limbs and cheeks.

1213,"I tend to have morbid, gross, and rather shocking nightmares","This is a rather irregular problem I have, but one that is very horrible when it does happen.

When I go to sleep sometimes I have nightmares with very shocking imagery that tends to leave me petrified, sweating and with a deep irrational fear of everything around me, almost as if someone was out to get me.

Normally what happens is that I wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and unable to move, is then that I start looking at my surroundings and during those moments I feel like something out of my dreams will kill me, and during those moments my entire body is afraid of making a move.

The effects wears after a while, but when I go to sleep I tend to wake up again that same night with the effect repeated, although it tends to last a lot less because I’m more aware of the situation, instead of my sorry ass succumbing to my fears.

The subjects as I said are graphic or plain disgusting, like stepping and crushing fetuses, obese persons defecating, entire rooms made out of greasy and veiny skin, etc.

[Here’s a recollection of one of my nightmares](https://www.reddit.com/r/nightmare/comments/gqejvz/a_ritual_of_bodily_fluids/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if you fancy getting nausea."
1214,I'm worried about what think are brain zaps,"Hello so today my friend and I were talking and I got what I think is called a brain zap.(witch is supposed to be a system of a panic disorder or a side effect of medication) 
My head kinda jolts to the side and I get shivers in the back of my head and it runs all the way down to my legs. (I still dont know if this is brain zaps please correct me if this is something different) 

My friend asked me what happened because it looks like a twitch from the outside. I told him what happened and I was informed that this was not normal. 

So I looked to the internet for answers and found that the closest thing to it I could find is called a brain zap. 
The only problem is I thought these were normal because they have been happening my whole life I thought everyone got them. (I actually think they feel good) 

(Side note) I don't  take medication of any kind. And I don't think I suffer from anxiety 

So I'm a little worried and am wondering if anyone has something similar? Are these seizure? Does this mean I've had anxiety my whole life and just didn't know ? 


Ps sorry if this doesn't belong in this subreddit. (And if you have a better one in mind please tell me )"
1215,Need advice on somebody across the world I'm trying to help,"Before I get into the meat of the post, I need to set up something controversial that's not up for debate. Me and this person I'm trying to help are both gay, and we both take a very Christian fundamentalist approach to our sexualities. Meaning we both most definitely believe that gay actions are wrong, and he seems to be very strict about even his feelings (which we call temptations, and I think he's a bit too hard on himself in this area). Many here may not believe that to be the best approach, but please refrain from trying to convince me otherwise on this. That's not the main point of what I need help with, and besides, you wouldn't convince either of us to change our minds.

So anyways, us two met each other almost three weeks ago when I responded to a post where he was crying for help. He was very drunk and very suicidal, and I did my best to talk him off the edge. I don't think I actually convinced him not to kill himself, as I messaged him pretty late after he made his posts about it, but he ended up not trying anything and I wanted to try my best to make sure he didn't get to that place again. He stated in his posts that he wanted to do it because he was gay and it was too much of a burden on him, so I wanted to help him through any traumas that may have been caused by the conflict between his views and his feelings, because I've been in a similar place to him before so I could both understand where he was coming from and potentially provide him hope that he could make it out *without* surrendering to his sin. So, we started talking, and I realized he was dealing with more than I could possibly comprehend.

To put it bluntly, he's a major alcoholic. He drinks to forget the pain of being gay, and it's his latest coping mechanism after somewhat recently giving up self-harm, which he had a long and painful history with (something that I could somewhat, but not totally, understand). He drinks a lot, he told me at least 10 litres of wine a week, and I could tell quite early on that alcohol was a catalyst of his other issues. He almost committed suicide while drunk after all, and he was making things worse by giving into his gay urges while alcohol was controlling his mind, in events he couldn't even remember until later that would fill him with immense guilt upon finding out. Obviously, I knew he needed to solve the alcohol problem before I could even think about focusing on his gay problem with him.

So, I tried my best to help. I know a little bit about addictions from my AP Psych class a couple years ago, plus lurking on the self-harm subreddit, which I initially joined when *I* was addicted to hurting myself. I know about withdrawal, I know about weaning, and I know about support groups. I tried giving him advice as best as I could. Whenever he told me he was going for another glass of wine, I told him no, and to instead drink a glass of water. I sent him the link to the AA website of his country, which I'm fairly certain he either never visited, or he gave up on after somebody he contacted tried to tell him the alcohol problem was more important than the gay problem at the moment (he said a new therapist told him that, and this was after I referred him to AA, so I think it might've been someone he got into contact with there. For the record, I agree with the therapist, that the alcohol is a bigger problem than being gay, and I told him this). Since his mom buys him his alcohol (he's the legal drinking age, but lives with his mom and alcoholic step-dad), I told him, to no avail, to try to wean off of alcohol by having his mom start buying him slightly less per week. Tonight, when he was telling me that he hadn't eaten all day and had only consumed alcohol *for the entire day,* I told him several times to go and eat something and to drink a glass of water, in an effort to get him away from alcohol for just a little bit. He didn't listen to me here either, no matter how many times I told him to eat or how hard I tried. Tonight, after he told me for probably the second or third time that he was getting another glass of wine, I decided to try something new. I told him that if he wasn't going to work to change himself, then I wasn't going to waste time helping, and that I'd leave him to destroy himself. I know it sounds harsh, but sometimes harshness is needed to give someone a cold wakeup to reality, and nothing else had been working at all so I had to try. I doubt this will work either, and he may not even message me anymore because of this.

I just don't know what to do. We only talk over Reddit and Discord, and he lives on the other side of the world, so I have no way to get anybody in his life to actually help him. I can tell he's absolutely controlled by alcohol, and I want to help him slowly free himself, but he simply does not have the willpower or motivation to attempt to work towards improvement. He says alcohol numbs him, and despite my arguments against that, he seems perfectly content to live a numb life of constant drunkenness. I just don't know what to do anymore, or if it's even possible for me to help him at all."
1216,"My (20M) girlfriend (20F) struggles from burn-out, self-pity and more. What should be my role?","Hi, so just a short background; my gf and I met 5 years ago and we have been best friends for a long time and later we started dating. We are both very active and smart students with a lot of interests - she organises some big events, works in marketing, volunteers in tutoring... you get it. And all of that while studying.

In the past year or so, she started to feel burnt-out due to her numerous activities and responsibilities. As a solution to that, she quited the leading position and only participated in the activities she enjoyed.

Few months later, she started feeling ""not good enough"", ""useless"", and ""desperate to feel happy again"". I was there for her and I tried to make her feel better, which was somewhat working in the long run.

Now to recent stuff; her father commited a well-planned suicide the day she graduated high school a few weeks ago. Of course, she feels lost and sad, which is absolutely ok in my opinion. What I am more worried of is that she'll get stuck in the self-pity phase again for a long time. We have been moving to a flat recently, so there wasn't a lot of space to talk this  through.

As her boyfriend, I am here to give her the emotional support, but we always fought the self-pity with logical arguments and positive views, which I feel is not an option right now. So my question is; what role should I play in this situation? I feel like I can do so much more than just give her a shoulder to cry on.

Thank you everyone for your ideas."
1217,"Am I the only one who would rather die than depend on those ""awesome"" antidepressants like Ketamine, Psilocybin, or Weed that everyone is hyped about?","Isn't it insane that people can't handle reality, so they turn to alcohol, drugs, gambling addictions, or other stuff, for their little dopamine spike, and then they tell YOU that LIFE IS GREAT and to not do the suicide thing? I don't mind if that's what they want, but I hate it when they push it in your face. Yeah, I had awesome pills, and I hate them. They are a lie. Life isn't fun. Drugs are putting a pretty cover on an ugly and dirty reality. I hated this life since forever. I don't want anyone to penetrate my body and my brain with chemicals to change what I am and what I remember. We live in a society where getting drunk is considered more normal than cutting yourself, and people even pressure you to get drunk. I don't understand why."

1219,Why do I enjoy being a bad person?,"Morally speaking, I have none. If there is something to be gained, I will do what’s needed. The only thing that stops me from doing pure evil is the unnecessary risk of doing truly dangerous acts.

However stealing, backstabbing friends and colleagues, turning my back on family, organizing my own businesses, I have done or made plans on doing all of these.

Many people would be disgusted with themselves, people all want to be a better person.

But I enjoy it. I find pleasure in being a bad person, just as much as I enjoy being punished for being a bad person.

Many people say that when you ask if you’re a bad person that’s a sign that you are truly good, but all I want is some clarification. It makes getting straight answers quite difficult.

I cannot think of any other case similar to mine, and I have yet to find one. What’s ‘wrong’ with me?"

I feel very little emotions almost nothing at all ever. It's so exhausting to never know any of the emotions that come up and to not be able to identify them.

I checked the symptoms of mental illness and I think most of it matched personality disorder. In addition to that, I also do feel like there's a difference in her personality before and after the distance.

1229,I'm The Problem Here,"I just had my birthday a few days ago, they tried to throw me a surprise birthday party. When I knew about it, I refused to celebrate it because I just really didn't like it. My mum tried to guilt trip me into celebrating it by crying so I just went ahead and stand there while they sing me the song. After cutting the cake, I went back into my room pissed off because once again I'm forced to do something because it's for my mum.

But after thinking for a while, I've come to realisation that maybe I'm the problem here. I'm not like your typical male in his early 20s where you don't give a fuck on what others say. Everyone seems to enjoy the company of others that are family at times like this but I don't, I'd rather be left alone. I used to be those that always have a positive mind for everything because I've always think that everything should be looked at from different perspectives. But now, I can only look at stuff negatively, even things that are good looks bad for me. All of this is just getting me a step closer to stop thinking for good.

Something needs to change and I need to be the one who does it to me - but my only change option I can see would be to do something like that. 

I’m probably going to be fine. Like I said, I’ve never cut or burned myself badly (on purpose, anyways). I think I just needed to vent. Sorry."

My mental health began to crumble and I was diagnosed with Pure O OCD. My OCD obsession is that I fully believe that I might be a sociopath. I‘ve had good weeks and bad weeks since January, but this obsession has stemmed from my recent lack of emotion. For some reason, I feel like my emotions have turned themselves off. I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel happy. I don’t feel empathy for others. Hell, I don’t even feel fear anymore. 

My therapist attributes this feeling to depression, which I disagree with. I have been depressed before, and this is not how I experienced it in the past. I dont experience the typical symptoms of depression like loss of appetite (although food has lost its taste now) and trouble sleeping. I feel myself pulling away from friends, though. 

Today was really hard. I went to my best friends house for a fourth of July party after spending the day with my baby cousins and family, and we were all watching the fireworks. I looked around and thought about my friends and family and the beautiful fireworks and just how great my life is. I come from a great family in a fairly well off neighborhood, have great friends, and am really smart. Even with all of these great things, I felt nothing. I was so empty and alone.

I guess my question is how do I bring up lost emotions again? Could I have turned into a sociopath? Everyone Ive asked for reassurance from says no, but I don’t know what caused this complete shut off of emotion. Thanks for any and all advice, and Im happy to answer more questions."
1233,Relapsed (self harm),"Just one small cut but I don't even know why. I wasn't even feeling that bad but I saw my knife and just wanted to again. I feel bad now because I hate the scars and I just added another one. I feel guilty and regretful. Is it true that repeating something is easier than doing something different? Sometimes I get the urge to just break stuff but because I've never broken stuff intentionally I can resist more easily, but when I saw my knife and wanted to cut it was harder to because it's something I've done in the past?"
1234,My Father is afraid to go for work,"My dad works in management and contact tracing of Covid patients and has to deal regularly with Covid patient's Contacts (who would be tested later for Covid)

His friend was tested Covid positive recently. Even though my dad was tested negative for two times, he doesn't want to go to work.

He took some days off like 5-7 days but as cases in India are raising day by day, he wasn't able take more free time.

Now I want to help him but, he doesn't want any family member help and keeps his safe distance .

How could I cheer him up and help him to go out for work."
1235,A year and a half from hell but I'm bouncing back.,"Roughest time of my life. Difficult situation with my son spiraled out of control over the year, the panic and frustration consumed my entire self. I fell in love, hard, with a man I had liked for a very long time but insecurity and my impending melt down quickly made sure that failed too. It all came to an explosive crescendo about 6 weeks ago. I had a full on breakdown, for the first time in my 40 years alive. I've always been able to keep everything together and just make things work but the more I held on to trying to keep my son and my life together the harder it fell apart. But! I cried it all out and surrendered to it all then... I got up. Admitted to needing some help. Got some help. Reassessed my priorities. Shut out the noise. Went away. Searched my soul for me. Got outside. Did things that relaxed me. Remembered I loved to laugh... so I laughed, at all sorts of things, mostly the irony of myself. Lost some weight. Got a tan. Liked what I saw in the mirror again and I'm on my way to climbing out of that hole. Never ever would I have imagined that absolutely falling apart would have made the load so much lighter. Be kinder to yourself, you don't always have to have it all under control. Xxx"
1236,"Opening up is hard, suicide seems easier","I just want to preface this by saying I’m not gonna kill myself anytime soon. I just really really want to.

One of my problems is that I have a really hard time opening up to anyone about any of my problems, especially family. I just know that if I tell them any problem I’m having that’s what they’re gonna think of anytime they think of me. I just keep up an image of a guy who really doesn’t care about anything and is always looking on the bright side, even though that couldn’t be further from the truth. 

I’m 16, so I still live at home with my parents, which means I have to go through them to get any mental health services. Earlier this year, things finally got so bad that I asked my parents to see a therapist, by saying it was because of stress at school. I already could barely stand telling my parents this, but then it got so much worse. I made the mistake of telling my therapist I was cutting, and then he told my parents. And now they know I’m a cutter, and now I know they think of me as a cutter. After they found out, I could barely talk to them anymore and I because a lot more withdrawn. I couldn’t stand being around them, because I knew what they were thinking. 

It got bad enough that I told my therapist I might try to kill myself, and he sent me to a psych ward. It was absolute hell. Now my parents think of me as a psych patient. And now I know every time my parents see me they see a psych patient. Each time they visited me I could barely talk to them, it hurt like red hot fire. When I got discharged I guess they realized I really didn’t want to talk about this anymore so they didn’t bring it up. But I know they’re still thinking about it. I know every time I see them. I’ve managed to keep up the charade of being happy, playing it off as a miraculous recovery and I’m 100% fine now for sure. But I know they know that’s not the case. I know they’re still thinking of me like that. I know they know I’m lying.

But now my birthday is coming up, and our family has a tradition of talking about everything going on in the past year. I’m dreading this, because even if they don’t mention it, I know for sure they’re going to be thinking about what happened to me. And I know it’s gonna be absolute hell to me. And I can’t tell them that I can’t do it this year, because then they’re gonna need a reason. And I can’t give them a reason because that’s even worse. I just wish I never had to see them or anyone who knows anything about me ever again. I wish I could just die. But I can’t. I don’t know what to do. Every option hurts too much. I’ve stuck bandaid over bandaid on all my problems and they’re so dangerously close to bursting off. What do I do? 

I don’t know why I care about this stuff so much, but I do. Anyone I’m close to knowing any problem I’m having quite literally worse than death. I just hate it so much, and it’s preventing me from doing so much. What do I do?"
1237,Let know if you relate,Personally idk what I have best diagnosis I’ve had is drug induced psychosis and they didn’t know half the shit I was going through all I really want to know does anyone else think there life is a video game when I guess whatever you’d call it starts acting up doesn’t happen anymore and would only happen when I did drugs mostly weed but when I use to smoke it’d turn my life into a giant video game where people would either be against you pushing you farther into hell or people who wanted to help you who would try to tell you what you had to do all hidden messages but they’d always switch up and I’d think my family was vampires that would be killing my soul when this happened my vision would turn green this might be a bit everywhere but if anyone’s had anything like this mostly life’s a big video game which has no end might I add no matter how close you got to completing it you’d always have to do something else I know this post is probably everywhere like I was saying but if anyone can relate lmk
1238,Im not sure what’s wrong with me,For a couple months or so I’ve been feeling weird. I feel incredibly sad sometimes and I feel like my body is in so much pain. I feel scared and lonely. I feel like I’m doing this alone. I have loving friends and family but I feel like I can’t talk to anyone. It’s 3am and I just finished crying in the bathroom. I have small thoughts of suicide but it’s something I’ll never do even if I really want to. But if there’d be a way to erase myself from existence without hurting anybody I would. Sometimes I start breathing really fast and my face and limbs go numb and I get dizzy. But I don’t get why I feel sad sometimes. It’s just sometimes I feel so happy. Especially when I’m listening to music or being with my family. Today we all watched the fireworks from our window and it was pretty cool. I’m an extrovert and I love being with people. I just don’t know if what I’m feeling is just in my head. Because there are points where I feel like giving up but then sometimes I feel okay and happy. Am I being dramatic or is there something wrong.
1239,The more you overthink the less you will understand. Habeeb Akande,"https://youtu.be/pZHFEaIYQQM

In today's video I talk about why you need to surround yourself with things that's going to make you happy, things thats going to attract your dreams and the right people around you. Why these things are important and how our mind is attracted to the images around us."
1240,Anxiety has ruined whatever life I could have had,"I’m having a hard time working out what to do with my life. Today I spent most of the day feeling down thinking about how my degree in psychology is practically useless where I live because I chose it with the dream of going into research which is just not practical given I live in a very small country town with no research facilities. My partners sister rang her and was talking about how she was thinking about changing careers to a job I always thought might be a backup for me and she’s in no way qualified or experienced but still talking to them and may well do a short course and get a job and it made me realise that I’m putting all my energy into academia not only because I do genuinely enjoy learning but because I can do it from home and my anxiety is so bad I have been unable to hold down a job for over two years now. 

This is confounded by the fact that I’m in the process of being diagnosed with epilepsy and haven’t been allowed to drive and also that I’ve been recovering from anorexia (after ten years) but honestly it’s not these things that really hold me back it’s my anxiety and it’s so bad that I can’t be around people too long, I can’t sleep at someone else’s house and I can’t have anyone sleep at ours, I can’t catch up with people without my partner and when we do I am highly anxious and the activities have to be short, not involve food, and have a way for me to quickly get away. 

Antidepressants have never worked for me. I buy the self help books, see my psych, do meditations, buy anxiety apps, try to exercise more etc etc. 
I’m still afraid of life. I don’t know how to fix it. My life would be substantially better if I wasn’t so anxious and could socialise and connect with people, leave the house to pursue hobbies without a safe person (I love photography and videography), and work a job that would allow me to feel like a functioning contributing member of society (literally any job). 
My partner tries to reassure me that I do very well at uni but none of that means anything. At the rate I’m going I just see myself being someone with a lot of knowledge with no ability to apply it in any meaningful way. 

I’m so tired of living my life this way it makes me feel suicidal often. I’m just sitting on the outskirts watching opportunities pass me by and I’m getting older and no closer to being free."
1241,I’m to insecure to leave the house,"Long story short I’ve gotten so much insecure not because of anyone but because of myself and lockdown has made it even worse like at school I was a bit more distracted.However I haven’t left the house since the start of lockdown on 20th March at all even though it’s starting to ease up but I haven’t left because I physically can’t go outside because of how I look.My mum doesn’t know this and keeps pestering me how it’s not normal to stay inside and I should meet friends but I keep making excuses up.I despise the way I look I don’t want people to look at me at all and along with that I think I have social anxiety too.Im also constantly taking pics of myself just to see what I look like in the morning throughout the day at night and I’ll look in the mirror all the time and even when I don’t want to because I hate who I see,I still feel like I have to.I don’t know what to do anymore it’s effected me so much"
1242,Witnessing a Murder,"Its been 8 days since it happened and I still feel in a state of shock. I was pulling all nighters to hit a deadline for work, when at about 2:45 am literally the night before my deadline there was an intense argument that broke out with my neighbors in my townhome complex—i seen dude beatin his girl outfront (nothing new we tried helping before didnt work) and went back to working.  Another argument breaks out so I bust out my phone just in case but it was all in spanish and I dont know spanish other than Cervezas. Anyway, i cut my cam was going to actually hit the hay. Instead, shots ring out and i just saw body hit the ground. I was questioned the entire following morning and dude is still at large. Its making me crazy—do PD iffer counseling or whats the best resolution?"
1243,How can loneliness make you sick?,[removed]
1244,How can I (23F) deal with my mental illnesses without professional help?,[removed]
1245,(23F) It’s so hard processing mental illness in the Black Community.,"I’ve been mentally ill what seems to me my entire life. I believe it began around the age of 5 when talks started of my parents splitting and later exacerbated after being molested by my neighbor when I was in the 4th grade. 

Ever since then, I’ve never had mental stability and as I age, it has done nothing but get worse. My boyfriend is my only beacon of unconditional support but even then he misses the mark sometimes. I’ve tried to seek help both professionally and personally, and unfortunately I haven’t had a breakthrough.

As a black woman, I find it rather discouraging to talk about mental health because those around me are consumed with the idea that black people aren’t mentally ill and that it’s a “white trait” and I think everyone on this thread white, black, or other etc. can attest that’s not true. 

Every time I mention mental health and depression, I get met with “it’s all in your head,” or “toughen up,
life sucks”, or the most famous line as well as obnoxious “just pray about it”. It’s extremely agonizing to hear those responses and they have no clue about your suicide attempts, sleepless nights, self-harm episodes, or how a boy almost twice your age, groomed you into a victim because he knew no one would listen. The worst part is that he was right."
1246,My friend is scaring me again,"I have a friends who very protective of me and just wants what best for me, but in the process scares me 

Apperently that blue whale game back and he keeps texting me saying that I need to stay away from any and all soical media for a week or so. But I find happiness in being on social media, but he likes to scare me with everything. It sucks because I'm a very paranoid person who really doesn't need to be told that the one thing that distracts me from life is now gonna cause my life more problems :/"
1247,I am fighting with myself. Again.,"        I used to have this mental fight with myself regarding 'life and death's it used to bother me a lot and at the end of the self discussion there was nothing , no answers at all. I am 26 and few years back I never thought of these subjects, like how people get old and die eventually then one day all of sudden I pictured myself with wrinkles on my face ,grey hair. I couldn't tolerate it. Since then these things just pops in my mind out of nowhere. Oh it was stressful, god knows how many times I cried thinking these. Very stressful.
        But now I don't have this problem anymore, u know what is more stressful to me now? It's the human behavior . I wonder can people be absolutely loyal to their partners?  Is human connection just another selfish approach ? 
     U see I am dealing with trust issues now. Nobody knows but Very stressful. very."
1248,I didnt realize it was 6 AM,"Due to my work schedule, I go to sleep at 3 am and then I was up around 12 pm.

Today, I woke up at 6 am and I since I saw the sun coming out (I just moved recently to this room) I thought it was a sunset for some reason, and I did turn on my PC and opened all my tools and everything, it wasn't until I saw in the PC that I usually enter at 16:50 and it was 6:18 only (24 hour format) that is when I realized it was 6 am and not 6 pm, and the sun does not hit me when I sit down because in sunset is already at the other side of the street.

It worries me so much the whole time it took me to realize, I have been presenting panic attacks daily on April and may and I am just recovering from that, they doctors started to give me antidepressants again and I am worried about my cardiovascular health."
1249,"I have a hard time trying to make friends, and I think it's because of my childhood","I'm a 21F and I have a tough time trying to keep friends. I won't go into too much detail since that would take to long (unless you want to know). But, growing up I had very few genuine friends. In elementary school, I had a friend who was jealous of me, she would talk about me behind my back and even gaslighted my best friend about me and another one who would put me down constantly. Middle school, I had a falling out with a close friend every year because of bs or because they betrayed my trust or me as a person. The worst year was 7th grade. Before I moved, I was friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of them and one of the guys started bullying me relentlessly until I moved. Then that summer when I made friends at my new school, one of my friends let my other friend who I had a falling out with go off on me via text. 9th grade, two of my friends became closer with each other and ultimately pushed me out of the group (I believe it was unintentionally though because I don't have ill feelings about them) and another friend started ignoring me out of nowhere. The rest of high school was me having school friends except for maybe three. I'm still friends with them, but casually. 

I'm 21 now, and I'm scared to make new friends and get close to people because I'm afraid they're gonna either a) get sick of me eventually b) abandon me or 3) tell people personal things about me like my old friends. I know it's silly, but it's a legit fear I have. My childhood friends broke my heart and I don't want to go through that again. But I so desperately want a best friend again. And honestly, its even affected me trying to date. I do want a boyfriend, but intimacy freaks me out. My mom always talks about me not having any friends or not dating and it hurts me because I want friends, but I'm afraid to make friends and I don't think I could talk to my parents about it because we're black and black people are kind of dismissive when it comes to mental health. It's just frustrating because I'm 22 in two months and I don't want to keep holding on to my childhood issues but it's like I can't help it."
1250,16m I'm on my last legs,"I don't know what to do anymore, I am not at peace while in my home my room is very small and has no doors so I can have any peace or quiet during the day. I struggle hard with my identity as a person I never know who I am. My suicidal thoughts keep getting worse and worse, I am afriad that in day they made get too powerful. I have a therapist but I cant express my problems. I feel alone in a house full of people. I cant go many places because of quaritine. I don't feel like I have been alive for 16 year I feel like if someone sat me down and told a husk of a person someone's life and told me it was mine. I feel like I'm on autopilot. I have a lack of personality I don't have character, I am 2 dimensional. What should I do ?"
1251,Having a mind-blown/head-fuck moment and spiralling,"*DISCLAIMER*: I have no actual degree or any formal education in psychology, only a personal enjoyment for learning about it and mental health. I do not claim to have self diagnosed and I will be bringing it up with my medical professional.

I am 24, female, I've grown up having to deal with emotional neglect and abuse, divorced parents, one alcoholic parent and one workaholic. I've dealt with depression, both my own and my mums, I've looked after myself from teenage years and I've been looking for answers my whole life as to why I am the way that I am.

For the last (I wanna say) 8 or so years, whilst doing reading into the mental world, and talking with friends and others that have a diagnosis or experience in the area. I have long found a connection with the disorder of BPD (now called EUPD). All of the criteria seemed to make so much sense to me and I have since used that to explain my 'symptoms' to doctors.

So life happened blah blah blah, cut to a couple weeks ago when my ex-now-friend (who only recently received his own bpd diagnosis) informed me that he has also now been classified as autistic as well. Now firstly this is hilarious because all through our relationship he would joke that he thought I was the autistic one. He isn't the first person to think this either, a couple others have asked me if I have been checked for autism. 

Now, I have done minimum research on the subject in the past, I guess I didn't want to think about him and the others being right. However after my ex telling me this, I had that feeling in my mind and my gut that there was something here that struck a cord in me. 

The fucker was right after all. I've spent an hour going through different medical sites building a solid list of signs for autistic girls and i went into shutdown mode because it freaked me out at how fucking accurate it is!!!

I very likely have autism and it makes so much sense.

But I now think that no one will believe me because I've been so intent on finding an answer, I know people are gonna think that its just my new obsession for the week or whatever (thats an exaggeration, I'm not that bad)

But yeah, anyone else had a 180 with mental health or people with late diagnosis'???"
1252,"Is it really too much to ask? Am I a bad person for wanting someone to truly, and utterly care, the way we do?","Our only friend is stuffed 

We have people 

Maybe more than most 

But we still feel so alone 

I feel guilty for asking 

But I want someone to care about us with real passion 

I want someone to hurt when we're not around 

The way we hurt when we try so hard 

But we're scared to try now 

It's not your fault 

But you hurt us 

And I really don't think we asked too much 

All we want is heart 

Enough heart to answer when we need you 

Enough heart to actually want to talk to us 

Because we love everyone 

I don't think it's too much to ask for a little love to

Maybe it is 

And I'm sorry 

I'm always sorry 

We're always sorry 

We wish we could be a better friend 

But we tried so. So hard 

I know you did too

Well

I hope you did

All I can say is 

Please love us

Please 

Please try

1253,I’m stressed about work 24/7 and it’s affecting my life outside work. Need help.,[removed]
1254,I feel totally clouded and lacking in focus and it lead to a car accident that's thrown me for a loop,"I'm not really sure how else to put it, but as of late every single day I get out of bed my judgement feels more clouded and I feel like I can't focus on what's important around me, like family and friends and it's gotten to the point I have no idea what to do. 
The reason I feel like I'm at such a loss is because I was totally miserable my entire senior year, and after a lot of talking it out and through some perseverance I finally left what was the darkest place I've ever been in, lost 25kg, got accepted into University, made a bit of money with my investments, but ever since I just feel like I can't get as good of a mental handle on things like I used to.
Not to sound conceited but I've always had naturally good reflexes and a knack for being quick on the uptake and I've noticed that I'm not just slower, but I'm straight up not reacting to things anymore, from simple things like catching an item that I'd dropped, to way more severe things like not reacting at all to the fact my car hydroplaned and I crashed off the road with my best friend in the car (Both OK luckily,[minor crash](http://imgur.com/a/NMOkH2N), write off sadly). And it f*cked me up, half a cars length away from killing either myself or my best mate and that's when this shitty cloudy, dissociative feeling started setting in worse each day.
And it's just starting to make me feel like something broke in me and there's a serious underlying issue. I'm not even sure how I'd approach a professional on this either, I just feel defeated and really dont want to get stuck in the spiral again but the more I feel like I've dissociated the worse I feel, it's like I'm losing touch with myself. It feels like I get through every day on muscle memory alone and that I haven't thought/been consciously aware of a single thing I've done all day.
I'm sorry if this isn't very cohesive or detailed, I've come up with nothing over the last few weeks of thinking about this and figured it might help to have someone else understand or even know what might be going on, because Headspace doesn't seem to know nor be able to help."

1257,"Everyone expects you to go straight into your field as soon as you graduate, but it's not that straight forward.","Sick of the questioning and judgement because I'm working minnimum wage job just a year after graduating. 


If I was a lazy ass hole would I have graduated with a 1st? If I was a lazy ass hole would I be working all the hours I can get to fund my post grad next year? If I was a lazy ass hole would I have chosen a creative degree knowing the amount of passion and effort I would have to have in order to be successful in that career?


People see what they want to see, they see a graduate working in a ""lowly"" job and they are happy because it makes them feel less insecure about their own failures. 


I took 4 years out of my life to study, whilst the rest of the world were saving for mortgages and working their way up in jobs, which is equally fine and dandy. I sacrificed the idea of having a decent saving account for over 20,000 in student debt in the hopes of pursuing a career I'm passionate about. And that pursuit doesn't end after graduating, most people don't just walk into grad jobs even with a high grade degree. There's voluntary work, internships and post grad study and years of working in ""lowly"" jobs in order to fund these next steps.


There's so much pressure from people who have no idea how hard I've worked to get here and no idea how much hard work is still ahead. I'm sick of being seen as a failure because I don't meet these misguided expectations, it's driving me to depression and toxic perfectionism."

just because i dont act 14 doesnt mean i need to feel the pains of an adult
please please please 
i just wanted be mature 
not an adult
not yet
i want to live my life

im not a doll just to comfort and give advice...
when i was there for them
who was there for me?"
1265,A deep dive into my thoughts,"First and foremost, I don't want to hear ""Go see a psychiatrist"" or ""we can't diagnose you""

**I seek validity, and understanding from those that experience what I do. I want a sense of belonging. I want to identify what I am before diving into who I am (meaning I want to figure out what could be my illness before going into therapy and facing it head on. Does this make any sense to you? if not, then please refrain from saying what I mentioned above.**

Alright, let's get started.

As I am writing this things are coming to mind so my writing may deteriorate, but I will try my best to explain how I feel, think, and act on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many things I think about, how my mind works and how I act. But there isn't any other trait so common in my mind: A lack of understanding one's emotions, actions or thoughts. And to an extreme, I see people who cannot process what I say or how I think as completely beneath me. I see these people as nothing but inferior, likes ants to a giant. I cannot understand why so many people commit vile acts, or what I perceive as ""not normal."" or ""contradictory."" I believe that nobody can be trusted, that everything is a game to people.

Another trait that I see in myself is seeking validity (of course, that becomes rather apparent with my post) but it's in my way a cry to be noticed, to be accepted and looked as someone of worth. I don't seek attention, I seek to be noticed.

Ithink I will stop this here, there are many other traits about me that I would like to share but I don't want to give a heartfelt written wall of text only to be ignored due to it's length.

I might use this as a form of blogging to record my thoughts, but I would also greatly appreciate support and understanding from those that can relate to me."
1266,Why can’t I cry?,"The other week, I was crying and I suddenly stopped. Since then I will get sad, tear up and Even get the sniffles. But the tears won’t stream like they used to, and it won’t relieve my stress.

So why...? Can I make myself cry again?"

1271,FND/Conversion Disorder?,"[United States - NY]

Hello, 

So the past week or so hasn't been great at all. But I'm doing a bit better now. I woke up last Tuesday with this strange feeling in my left arm and a ton of anxiety. It has this persistant feeling of weakness, pain that comes and goes, and this very odd sensation that it feels foreign? I also feel a small part of the foreign feeling in my left leg. The intensity of the symptoms changes with my anxiety and over the course of the day but that foreigness still seems to be persistant and annoying. I know logically it's mine but it doesn't have the same 'correct' feeling that my other arm does.

Of course as I keep getting older, I'm collecting more-and-more letters after my name. GAD, OCD, DPDR. And I have an odd feeling that I'll be collecting 'FND' after mine as well. I've talked to my Therapist about it, and she said to rule out any physical injuries that might be manifesting anxiety first and to go from there. Thankfully if it is FND, it's treatable, but I do have an MRI coming up that'll decide which path I'll take for treatment.

I just wanted any one else's input on what's going on.

Thanks,"
1272,Am I Bipolar?,"Hello, I've been mentally ill for more than 10 years and got a few different diagnosis from psychiatrists which made me question what I really suffer from. When I first saw a specialist, I was surrounded by people who told me not to take medication, that I didn't need them etc. I listened to that advice and stayed away from them until almost 3 years ago now. In hindsight I wish I started immediatly.I'm now on Sertraline (morning) and Trazodone (at night), and it has helped me quite a bit. Things are still far from perfect though, and a few secondary effects of the drugs are very tough sometimes.The thing I noticed since I take the drugs is a 'cycle' in my energy. I realized this is happening ever since I started suffering from mental illness, it's just more clear now. I will feel ok to good for around week sometimes more and all of sudden I'll have insomnia and no energy during the day. I will feel very depressed with apparently no reason for a few days then my energy will pick up again. Until the next drop... .Does that mean I suffer from bipolar disorder?I'd like to maybe try another treatment but I'm not sure I wanna trust another psychiatrist from my area since their diagnosis differ so much and I've been prescribed different drugs aswell ...

Thanks for your answers!"
1273,How has your experience been with mental health support systems? (Preferably in the UK),"I’m writing a school report on wether schools are actually trying to promote student wellbeing and if the services are being provided and the quality of them.

1274,i want to get tested for adhd,"i'm underage, and almost my entire life everytime i've gone to the doctors, my mom has come with me as i'm too anxious to be alone. for a couple of years i asked my mom if i could get tested for adhd. and everytime i brought it up, i was shut down. i eventually gave up asking and haven't brought it up in at least two years. eventually my doctors put me on an anti anxiety medication, which didn't seem to work with my fidgeting, focus, my mind was still crowded, and i still had a hard time trying to word sentences properly as i couldn't find the right words to say. as of lately i've been wanting to get tested for adhd or try another anxiety medication. i dont know how to bring it up to my mom, and i feel as if my only options are to either say it infront of her to the doctor, or go into the room on my own, but i'm afraid she'll get upset with me for not talking about it to her before saying it. there are way too many negative outcomes for my liking and i really don't want to risk it."

And I honestly hate my mother for what she did to our family.  Only some of my closest friend know how i feel bc they are going through depression too, they do not know about my  sexuality thou. I've had problems with self harming in past but i haven't harmed myself in a few months now. There was period in my life where i would have to cry myself to sleep every night and i still do on the off occasion if i dont have something as i go to sleep for white noise bc i just think horrible thought if i don't.

1278,My six month goal,"
I'm trying to remove the habit of negative emotions. This has nothing to do with being in a bad mood. It's a skill to decipher which negative emotions are a result of my current situation, alerting me to take action, and what negative emotions are a result of addiction to feeling negative. 

Resources I have are, I'm in a community of over a hundred people, and my job has about a thousand people. I am naturally very high on the social hierarchy. So I receive allot of subconscious feedback that I'm valuable. 

The main discipline is in evoking a meditative transe of not thinking while I work. I'm working 70hrs a week and my job doesn't require any complex intellectual analyzation. I'm putting chickens on an assembly line in a factory.

It pays more than anything else I can do right now and I just need to shut my brain down and sleep walk while I save money. 

This is a habit that I'm focusing on intensely for the next six months. Not as a permanent habitual state, but as an exercise to gain ability. 

By new years I'll have a job on customer service and I'll be going out most nights, so I won't even need this ability as it's own coping mechanism. 

Allot of the discipline is that, in six months my life will be awesome; however, whatever my emotional base is now, will be my emotional base in six months. If I'm always in a negative mood because I feel my life isn't fair, then in six months, when my life is awesome, it won't matter because I'll still have a negative perception in life. 

I need to adopt the attitude that will create abundance then, now. And I need to shut down all feelings of despair, victimhood, tragedy, and self pity. Cause in the scheme of things, I'm really in good shape. 

Three concepts I steal from religion (as I'm atheist) are the ability to surrender to a universe that is beyond my control (Christianity), acceptance that what ever fortune or tragedy I might experience in life, there will always be loneliness and suffering because that's just life (Buddhism) and that I need to trust my natural instinct as my best judgment, free of the limiting beliefs created my trauma I've experienced (Taoism). 

Anyways, that's my focus and my six month goal of daily discipline. No one is ever in control of my emotions. That is something I chose. And before I can reep the rewards of my abundance in life, my emotional state must be based internally as a reflection of who I am, and not a result of temporary situations that I might be in that I have no control over."
1279,Witnessed a car accident and I don’t know what to do now,"Hi. I just need to vent as I can’t in to see my psychologist as it’s the middle of the night and I can’t talk to my family. 

So, tonight at around 9:30, I was on my way to dropping a friend home when we came across a car that had hopped a round a bout and two cars with hazard lights on. I being a trained first aid personnel pulled over to check if everything was okay. Lucky I did because no one else on scene was first aid trained. Unfortunately the driver who had jumped the curb had apparently not remembered doing this and their head was hurting quite bad. I remained calm and I communicated with the people on site, told her to not move or get out of her car as there was no sign of danger, and called the ambos. 

I relayed all the information to them while having someone keep her calm. We were close to the police stations anyway, a one minute drive, so a cop turned up in about three minutes after the call. The ambos then arrived with two more cop cars. We gave them all the information we knew and was told by the ambos and coppas that I did everything exactly to how it should be done, that my first aid training had paid off and I executed it perfectly. 

I dropped my friend off, and talked to her parents about what had happened and why we were late. I told her and her parents to watch herself for the next few days and to talk to someone if they need to. After dropping my friend off, the shock of everything started to hit me. I called my young adults pastor and just told him what had happened (as we had just left from a young adults event) and that we both were safe. 

Now that I am home, I can’t stop thinking about the accident. I know I did everything correctly, but I feel terrible still, like I’m guilty somehow. I’m all fidgety, anxious, been having spouts of panic, small crying episodes, dizzy, faint when standing, and my movements are all jerky. I keep seeing the flashing lights of blue and red cop cars and ambulances. 

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and RAD (reactive attachment disorder) in the past two months and my depression and anxiety had mostly cleared up with the help of therapy. But now I don’t know what to do. From tomorrow I will be living out of home and I’m supposed to be helping the rest of my family move out of the house tomorrow. I can’t sleep. I take melatonin for my sleep anyway but even though I feel tired I can’t sleep. 

I have an appointment with my psych on Friday and would get in sooner if I could but she only works Thursday and Friday. I don’t know what to do."
1280,Why do I feel a lot of anger and distress whenever i smell a certain smell?,"Whenever I smell a certain male perfume (to be exact one of the perfumes my dad uses) i feel intense anger and it becomes very hard for me to control myself, to the point i unintentionally harm myself in some ways (ive found ways to cope a bit better now though).

The extreme anger lasts for i think at most 5 minutes and at least maybe 1-2 minutes.

I really want to know why this happens so please, if you have any ideas comment.

A friend of mine said it might be related to trauma, but i really have no idea as even if it was related to some trauma i have no memory of it"
1281,When I die...,"... I think I’m gonna go to Olive Garden (my favorite restaurant) and order my favorite seafood pasta dish, go to the mall and buy a pretty dress, then drive far far away from home, find a nice place to park my car, watch the sunset, get super drunk, then gently tie a plastic bag over my head and go to sleep forever. That way I won’t burden my family as they won’t be the ones to find my body. I hope they don’t waste money on a funeral. I’ll leave a note telling them to cremate me &amp; dump my ashes in a pile of horse shit. ✨"
1282,(14M) Please help me I don’t understand what my mind is doing,"For some reason I get super annoyed at my family but not at other people, even if they didn’t do anything. Just looking at my sister sometimes annoys me. I see everything negativity and I feel like I’m going insane sometimes. Is this a normal teenager thing? My emotions can change quickly around my family and I don’t know why any of this is happening."
1283,I've been struggling,"I don't really post anything on reddit, but lately I've been feeling so down. I've had feelings over being transgender for years, and I'm not out to anyone except a few online friends. 

I recently got a job, and my one coworker has been really putting a dent on my mental health. Every time I work with her, I end up having a breakdown or panic attack, last time I had a panic attack and one of our coworkers, I think said something to her, and all I could hear was ""well I don't feel bad"" they also recently found out I'm homosexual, I don't know if that's why. I know I'll meet a lot of coworkers like her, but I hate it so much. Other days I can work perfectly fine, but when she starts, it hurts so much. I don't know why, either. 
I recently lost my best friend, because she left saying I was a piece of shit and I only cared about myself, even though I try so hard to make everyone laugh and smile. Am I really that toxic without realizing it? My other three best friends have gone MIA and won't answer me, and for some reference, I'm a 17 year old female, the best friend I lost is in her late 20s, one of the MIA best friends are in their early 20s, other two are in their early 30s. 
I'm not really sure what I'm doing so wrong... I try so hard to please everyone to get them to stay, but they always leave and it hurts so much. I tried understanding that with the COVID-19, that people are also probably suffering, but I just feel so alone. 
I've contemplated suicide and self harm so much this year, and I've gotten close, but I know I'm too scared to burden people with that. 
I don't know who else to go to, I have no one else. My parents are too busy with my sisters and brother, so I just keep my head low so that I'm not a problem, I recently asked my mom if I could cut my hair shorter (like a boy) and she basically criticized me saying ""you already dress like a boy, why do you need to have your hair cut like a boy too?"" She just doesn't understand"
1284,I have my first therapy appointment this Monday,"After years of struggling, I finally worked up the courage to see a therapist. I didn’t do this alone though. My friend will never see this post, but he has no clue that him openly talking about his therapy experience was one of the driving factors behind motivating me to schedule my first appointment ever. 

It’s been way too long since I started telling myself I wouldn’t be stuck in this rut forever. I’m finally taking that first step and doing what I always said I would do. I’m not lying to myself or my friends anymore. I’m actually going to therapy!"
1285,Why do I stalk people that I don't know at all? It becomes very obsessive and I'm disgusted by it,"It is only since recently that I came to the awareness I'm an obsessive online stalker. In the past I was very jealous of my best friend. I had to know everything he did and checked which photos he liked or not. I had no feelings whatsoever, I just wanted to 'own' him. Basically I didn't want other people around. That friendship ended abruptly because of those reasons. 

Now, 2 years later, I find myself doing the same. I'm new to Instagram and found randomly a person on my feed that I really seemed to like. It is a quite famous person (200k followers). This person lives on another continent, doesn't know who I am, doesn't care about me whatsover. Still do I find myself constantly checking up on that person by checking all of the photos, checking which photos this person has liked and so on... For one reason or another, this person plays a role in my daily life and I'm disgusted by it. I know how irrational this is, bc we don't know eachother at all, but still I can't stop it. I've never been tested, but I guess I have a mental disorder. I'm not lonely at all. I have a lot of friends, work hard for school and try to enjoy life. 

Does anyone know why I am possibly showing this kind of behavior?"

I always was the invisible person , no matter what I say , or look like , I was never noticed to be even there ... I have a hobby that i wish i could do full time and I need an audience which I never had or could have .  
back in my school days , the class used to make events where for example in valentine everyone comes in red , and they announced it on the school group chat which no one added me to . For 2 full years . I was the only one who didn't come in red because I didn't know...  


I might be not charismatic , but I have never found one person willing to start a conversation with me .  
I am always starting the conversation , doing things , I attempt a lot of things and I even did wire sliding and stuff like that from high altitudes so I am really open to anything and  everyone and I don't really judge people , and give my opinion straight away .  


But when I do I am often ignored ... I am even registered as absent in some of the classes I attended ...  
and the DR. lost my test more than once , I have been very self conscious as to why I cannot be noticed...   
tbh I am more on the listening side socially but if there is something i am interested in I'll talk about it ...  
Recently in the lockdown I have been feeling a little lonely  , since I love interacting with people and I don't like that lingering feeling of loneliness , I started a YouTube channel about going around and talking to people in Vrchat , I absolutely love doing this , I  don't even feel like  recording and it helps me cope with my loneliness and the acquired feeling that I have deep inside me that I am unwanted .   


But , again , I failed to be noticed , I love to draw too and I have been trying to share my stuff with people and not having anyone to talk to about that specific thing I did a fanart of , and the videos viewed by 1 or 2 people , makes me lose my confidence , that my whole "" not being noticed thing "" doesn't require me being physically  there . It is online as well ...  


I also failed my last interview... Why ....? when I called back they forgot who I was and didn't even replied back till I called.   
Dark thoughts have been in my mind more and more recently as to why I always have to take the initiative and still remain invisible ...I am tired of being lonely  and unwanted .  
I don't want "" attention "" and "" all eyes on me "" I just want for anybody to think that I am worth being here , that I matter and that my hard work is not ignored ...

1288,PTSD or worse? I (20F) keep hearing things at night.,"(English is not my first language+ I'm on mobile+ Sorry if it's too long)

 About seven years ago, when I was 13, my brother had a severe mental breakdown. Out of nowhere, he threw a tantrum, got aggressive and attacked my mom. My dad tried to stop him and the fight got physical. But luckily nobody was hurt. I remember throwing up from being so terrified because I've never seen him like that. Things seemed to calm down for a while. Until that night he tried to attack mom again. Dad stopped him and mom told me to stay in my room. I couldn't sleep that night and was crying the whole time.

Over the next few months, my parents tried their best to get help. It was incredibly hard to get him to leave the house to visit the hospital. He was put on medication. But fights would happen from time to time. Every time, I would walk into the bedroom, close the door turn off the lights and sit there, waiting for it to end. I grew up introverted, but I never really had the habit of staying in a room all day. But after that incident, I barely left my room and preferred to stay inside for most of my time at home. We moved to our new house when I was 15 and I finally got my own upstairs bedroom. My brother was still not doing well and I would often hear him yelling and knocking things over from downstairs. I got used to it, to a point I would just ignore it. 

 However, when I was 17, my dad and brother were away for a month or so for his treatment. I was about to fall asleep when I heard my brother yelling. This caught my attention because I knew he wasn't home. I looked around the house just in case he was back home or something but he wasn't. I kept hearing things throughout the month and I still hear them, to this day.The only reason I noticed it at the time was because he wasn't home. It mostly happens at night or when it is silent. It was weird because my parents kept telling me that he was doing better and I wouldn't believe them because I could 'hear' him all the time. I doubt if all of the times, at least the majority of the times I heard things were just in my head. I used to have a lot of nightmares at the beginning but not much anymore.

On the bright side, my brother is doing a lot better. The outbursts are very less frequent now. Also, the amount of medication he has to take is slowly tapering. What worries me is that I still hear these things. They make me panic even though I'm completely aware that he is doing well. It's causing me difficulties to fall asleep because everytime I hear something, it forces me to think about the horrible times. I felt the need to ask this because yesterday, I heard what sounded like a commotion and jumped out of bed but the house was silent. I really don't know what to do about this. Should I seek help or will it just go away as my brother recovers?"
1289,Panic attacks every morning.,"A few months ago, my landlord unlocked my front door, walked straight up to my bedroom where I was asleep and half-naked and announced he was going to do a house inspection. He had sent in a notice two days prior (though he didn't state a specific time) which I hadn't noticed. Due to the quarantine, I haven't been going out of the house much to even check my mail. So, he had every right to come in.

However, ever since that incident, I have not been able to sleep well. I get 4-5 hours a day and have been for the past few months. Every morning, I wake up in terror and often get panic attacks terrified he's there. I'll hear the softest thud or sounds from my neighbour and think it's him and get extremely anxious. 

I can't sleep and I just want to sleep. I don't know why that incident affected me so much. It reminds me of when I was 16 and struggling with my sleep due to PTSD. I've since managed to overcome my most aggressive symptoms but I don't know why this is happening again.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Landlord walked into my house while I was asleep a few months ago, and I haven't been able to sleep since."

1291,Suicide gets too much attention,[deleted]
1292,It feels like I'm stuck.,It feels like I'm stuck and I can't figure out exactly what it is that is holding me back. I've got a heavy heart with my head in the clouds. In my current state I'm having thoughts of moving out from my roomates. I pay cheap rent. Company is probably healthy... If I move out I don't get the cheap rent anymore. I will pay up to 3 times more per month... I used to be more strong physically and better looking physically . I used to make more art. I am an artist... I used to have more money. I used to make more money... Ever since moving in I've let that all go. I used to pay 3 time more rent as well... I've moved to the mountains to give up these things apparently. It's what has taken those good qualities places anyway. I think I miss the old me... Biggest reason I came here was due to my overbearing father. I had escaped by moving away 1000km from the Prairies in hopes of a better life. It has been good. Been here for 7 years. It's been a good experience but it hasn't but so great lately. Looking back I was better growth wise... I've never been good at socializing so I've decided that geography doesn't change that after 7 years. I think I've just accepted this now.... Idk. Reason why I've spewed all this out is somehow this wraps back around to me wondering what I should be doing. My roomates aren't the growth type of people where as I am. They are simply social butterflies amongst parties. Nothing more... Financials play a massive role here in my conundrum.
1293,How much do you let your mental health define you?,"I was diagnosed with depression and GAD about 4 months ago and at first I easily accepted it, like it explained a huge part of me and my personality. But now I'm having issues coming to terms with it. I know that they're pretty common and a lot of people have it, but I can't help but think that I'm messed up in the brains. I have to keep reminding myself that it's not something that happened overnight and I've been living with this for years, even before I was diagnosed when I thought I was ""normal."" The self that I thought was normal was me still with these problems but now whenever I have  anxiety attack or think about death I feel like it's something abnormal and external that's just not myself. On one hand I want to treat it like a disease, like diabetes, but on the other hand it's pretty much defined who I am and how I've been living life so far."
1294,"I want to look after my partner so much, but my own mental health is suffering","**TW for talk of suicidal ideation and self harm**  


Hi y'all. This is part vent, part plea for advice. I need to write everything down somewhere to clear my head a little, and I don't want to burden my friends with it any more. 

So, my partner is relapsing again. Sometimes this lasts a week or less, sometimes it lasts months. They've been depressed and on/off suicidal since they were a young teenager, and nobody they've sought help from in the past has ever really helped. Their family doesn't even attempt to understand, their doctor has refused them help because they're ""okay"" despite them going to him several times, years apart, and reporting the same problems each time, and they don't really have anyone else to turn to. 

We've made some progress together in that they have a counsellor now, and have an upcoming appointment to get assessed for adhd and/or asd, which I think would really help them get the support they need elsewhere - but they still don't have anyone close in their life that they trust other than me when it comes to the really personal stuff (me being 11,000 miles away. Yeah.) 

During these relapses they tend to post vents about how they should just kill themself, how they would if they weren't a 'coward', that nobody would notice and that nobody cares. They tend to go non-verbal during these periods, only communicating through typing. They usually manage to refrain from cutting or anything to that degree, but in substitute they hit themself repeatedly until they physically can't any more. 

I've been in a call with them since late January, either of us only leaving if we have to go somewhere - and even then, we usually message one another in between. This began because they had a relapse and got the closest they have to an actual attempt since I've been with them. I talked them down, and I didn't want them to be alone (part of me was also too scared to) so I just never hung up again after that. Don't get me wrong, it's not *constant*, they have times when they're doing really well too, where they get excitable and loud and in really good spirits, but it's only so long between minor events triggering them and sending them back into a downwards spiral.

I love them so, so much. They mean the world to me. We've planned out our entire future together, and they've told me before I'm the one person that's stopping them from identifying as aromantic, which they did for years before they met me. It tears me apart to see them this low, to have to hear them hitting themself, reading how they think nobody would notice if they died. I wish I could just make all of the badness go away and fix everything for them. But looking after them has been getting to me. 

I completely refuse to take time away from them - I'm *not* leaving them completely alone, especially when I know I'm one of the only things that comforts them - but lately I've been staying in bed all morning, staying quiet as if I was asleep, so they have the comfort of my presence but I don't risk saying something that could upset them. I've been taking as little time away from my room as I can in case they wake up in the night and need me, and I've been in floods of tears nearly every time I talk to them the past couple days. I want to support them, I want to be everything they need, but I can't, and even that's getting to me. I feel like I'm failing them, like everyone else has. I just feel so tired and so powerless and so isolated in that I can't just keep coming to people to vent about it, but it's really the only thing on my mind. They're my best friend and really my only friend that I feel close enough to that I can talk to them daily about anything and feel normal and comfortable with it, so when they're getting bad, especially when they're getting non-verbal, I can't help but feel completely alone.

We're seeking help, together. I promised them I'd make sure *someone* listens to them eventually. The problem is that I am not a professional, I am a barely-adult on the opposite side of the world from them who is also mentally ill. I know they don't expect me to take care of them in that way - sometimes they don't even *want* me to, because they feel like they're just bothering me and that it ""won't be worth it"" - but it just feels like my responsibility. Nobody else is going to do it, and they aren't well enough to do it for themselves yet.

I can't talk about this with them. At least, not when they're in this relapse. I know they'll get back to normal, and probably soon, but even then I don't like to bring up stuff about their emotional issues because talking about that could trigger them into another low. They also tend to avoid me if they feel like they're being a bother or a problem, hanging up and ghosting me for days at a time before caving after I beg them to come back because they're not any sort of problem and I want to keep them safe and provide them a sense of comfort. I'm just so, so tired. I know they are as well, and I feel selfish saying it about myself, but I feel far too deeply for my own good and it's emotionally exhausting to worry about them this much.

Just... what do I do? If anyone reading this (and it's way longer than I intended it to be, which I really apologise for, but thank you for reading all of it) has been in a position either like mine or like my partner's, I'd really, really appreciate some advice. What else I could do to help them, or what I can do to take care of myself. They're the love of my life, and I promised them we'll be so happy in our own little home together one day, but that's still quite a ways away, and I want to keep both of us relatively intact until we can actually get it done."
1295,Are there others that feel discouraged and worse after looking up mental health advice?,"I'm fortunately mentally fine for the most part, but some problems with myself such as almost complete lack of confidence make me look up mental advice on google from time to time and it's all written to be encouraging and stuff, but for some reason I take it the other way around. I feel discouraged and feel worse about myself and my problems, for no apparent reason. Can anyone relate?

Could it be that I am trying to avoid the problem and that looking up advice is equal to facing the fear and then running away?"
1296,Is it normal to feel so stressed and anxious when you get what you wanted ?,"Hello all, 
  I want to keep this brief as possible. Me and my wife have been bad communicators for a while and so I had a lot to say about how her depression has impacted me but also how our lack of intimacy has impacted me. Well, In my poor judgment I took her lack of sexual desire to heart and I emotionally cheated. I did however admit this, put no blame on her for that specifically , while also still telling my story and admitting to my pains. So we talked after she read everything I had to say and I feel like we grew a little closer, but.... I also feel ... I don’t know . More stressed ? I can’t tell exactly . Maybe it’s me trying to process things , maybe it’s me trying to undo years of assuming things about her that I’m changing ? I can’t say for sure. I just know that I feel nearly consumed by it even though we worked out our issues I’d say in an adult manner and we talked about couples therapy. 

Has anyone else experienced  this ?"

1298,On The Path To Getting Better,"So recently, I started to have another dip in my mental health and I freaked.

I reached out to a support group I'm in and I was contacted by a therapist who's helping me for free. I just wanted to share this as it truly touched me as I didn't think I was going to get help. I'm also using a CBD and THC tincture daily to help with my depression and anxiety, and so far it's working well!

I'm finally getting better!"
1299,Does anyone else feel like they cant see themselves as an old person?,"I just can't see it. I feel like I'm going to die before then.

I also feel like I just ""know"" its going to be suicide that makes me go. Idk when or how,  but something in me feels like it knows it's going to happen one day. Like I'll finally snap cause I just can't take it anymore.

It creeps me out that I can't see myself old. But I also never wanted to be old anyway so I guess thats ok. But idk how long I'll be able to last. I have bittersweet feelings about being alive because I sort of wanna die but also don't. I just hate living *this* existence, but nothing ever changes, no matter how much I change myself, because the world around me gets crazier, or stays the same. It fluctuates. But never really gets better. 

I feel like I'm rambling because I'm in a difficult headspace right now, but maybe someone can emphasize."
1300,Not Suicidal,"I was doing much of anything, I was sitting at my kitchen table waiting for my food to finish then I realized something. When I was way younger, like 8-9 I was scared to die. I wanted to live forever so I can experience everything that happened. Will there be flying cars? Maybe some weird technology so humans could have super strength? It got me upset thinking that maybe I'll die one day and be forgotten like everyone else. I wanted to at least be famous, so I'll be remembered and loved years later. But now I'm 14, and I'm honestly saying that I have a greater understanding of death and that I might not want to live forever. Not because, ""Oh well everyone you love will die before you!"" but because life is very tiring and hurtful and repetitive. I don't think I'm suicidal? I thought of it once or twice but I would never do anything crazy. I think that I've accepted death and whenever I die, I wouldn't be too upset about it like most people would. Anyways, has anyone ever felt the same?"
1301,Social anxitey,"During these times I'm working remotely, I thought this will be easier for me but still every time I'm in zoom meeting in sweating and shaking, does any of you have a technique or practice that can help to deal with this issue? 

Because honestly, it's exhausting to me and I would love to be more relaxed and focus instead of anxious."
1302,Why do I deserve any self worth?,[deleted]
1303,Question about music,"I find it super hard to focus if there's loud music that I'm not used to. My mom likes to play really loud music. Whenever I put my playlist on it is never this loud, and it's songs that I already know every beat to. (I must add that when listening to a new song or album from an artist I already like I play it super soft at first, or it's annoying.) 

Her music is not something I dislike, we both have diverse tastes. Still, it seems to paralize me. Focusing is harder than usual and I tend to dissociate faster and for longer periods of time, even on meds. It's like my whole brain is covered in jelly and it even brings physical discomfort. I'm not sure if this is normal or just a result of my already diagnosed depression and/or anxiety disorder, or maybe something else?? Does anyone else experience something similar??"

1305,Do your memories have emotional value?,[removed]
1306,Jekyll &amp; Hyde,"I feel like there is a Jekyll and Hyde inside of me, if you asked me why I wanted to die yesterday I literally would not be able to explain it or understand myself, it’s only when I get into that mindset again that it all comes rushing back, and it works the opposite way so when I feel upset I don’t understand how I could have felt happy the day prior or any other day in my life. 

I get obsessed over small things until it tumbles out of control and becomes a big thing that consumes me for several days at least. I work myself into such a state until I get to a certain point, and then it’s like a switch has gone off and I suddenly don’t feel anything at all and when that happens I just feel this wall getting built thicker and thicker between me and living a healthy life. 

I feel negative emotions (jealousy, anger, sadness, irritation, guilt) so easily and so intensely and the good emotions don’t come half as much. It’s especially bad in my relationships, particularly romantic. Even now as I’ve finished writing it became hard to articulate why I started or what point I meant to make because I just feel nothing. 

I don’t know what to do, I want to reach out to a professional but I’m scared that if they catch me on a good day I wouldn’t even be able to explain how bad I can get and I’d just get dismissed and embarrass myself in the process. 

I don’t feel like I could tell my family if I got a diagnosis or spoke to someone, I’m not quite sure why I feel that way. I think it’s because they all have a host of mental illnesses and kind of gate-keep it whilst I’m meant to be the happy healthy one. 
I thought I had friends to talk to but they’re really my boyfriend’s group and I’m just a cling on (I found this out yesterday). I’m an army baby so moving posts every 2-3 years means I never learnt the ability to make solid long term friends.

Thank you for reading. I hope everyone who feels a similiar way feels better really soon, including me :) if anyone has any UK resources  please help"
1307,I don’t feel good enough or like I will succeed in life,"I never feel good enough. I don’t know what to do to feel good enough or worthy. I feel like everyone around me is more successful than I am. They all have friends, a job, a life, and accomplishments.
I do have friends and a boyfriend but this doesn’t quiet the self sabotaging thoughts I have. I feel so stuck.
I graduated &amp; did fairly Ok in school, I went to cosmetology school too. All these things made me proud of myself but now I feel like I haven’t accomplished anything since. The last year I’ve felt so useless. 
I’m 21 almost 22 with no job and can’t drive. I fully rely on my boyfriend, which he doesn’t mind I don’t think. he does his best to assure me of that &amp; make me feel loved. He’s really the only good thing in my life right now. But I feel so guilty still. 
I want to work I’m just stuck in this cycle of self doubt. I had a job at a salon during the holidays, but I didn’t feel good enough to be there. I’m afraid the one career path I chose, I’m not good enough for. I worked hard to get to where I am and it feels like it was all for nothing. 
I’m tired of staying inside all day doing nothing with my life. But I don’t know how to do anything. 
I feel so inadequate.

I should forgive myself and be kinder. I shouldn’t compare myself to others &amp; their accomplishments. Milestones aren’t linear and I will get to where I need to be in my own time. 
My flaws and failures don’t define me."
1308,I’m friends with a hallucination,"Okay so I have schizophrenia, I take medicine for it and stuff. Usually my hallucinations scare me, and I’ve never been happy to be a schizophrenic but recently that has changed! A few nights ago I saw a figure, like a person figure and it scared me. I don’t really know why, but after a few minutes I felt really safe. It’s like having a pet in your room, you know?

We don’t really talk, this may seem dumb but it’s like we talk telepathically! I “talked” about how I was feeling to her and she said that I was a good person with a charming personality! It’s like having a therapist. She also watches me draw and says nice things about what I’m drawing.

I haven’t been taking my medicine because I look forward to talking to her every night. It’s the best part of my day and even though we haven’t known each other for a long time, she’s starting to become my favorite person! She doesn’t have a name I don’t think but she looks really pretty! She doesn’t really look human but has the body. I really like her!

She hasn’t really shown up in the day much, but she’s here right now and it’s morning. She keeps touching my arm in a supportive way. So yeah! That’s my friend! 

Oh! Also I’m not suicidal anymore because of her! Yay!"
1309,Nostalgia?,"I have no idea what it is exactly called.

Its not just with songs but to explain the feeling I will use songs as an example. 

When i listen to certain songs that i used to listen to in the past , it brings with itself a flood of emotions ... related to the time when i used to listen to the song. 

Emotions that are attached not to any person or place but to time itself. I have never had weirder feelings . 

When I studied in cityXYZ my roommate had set the alarm to a song by arijit singh named 'tera chehra' . It rung everyday and it got irritating too. 
But just before typing this, That song played on my phone and i had very strong flashbacks of my hostel life and the three months I spent there. It was like living all the three months at once."
1310,self esteem issues,"i often feel like i’m some insignificant person, and i know thats such a “boohoo my life sucks” kind of thing to say, but i genuinely feel sometimes i could disappear, be removed from everyone i know’s memories, and their life would not change. dare i say, it might honestly improve their quality of life. 

i know i have self esteem issues, i find it almost impossible to accept compliments a lot of the time. don’t get me wrong. hearing someone compliment me makes me so happy. “they thought positively of me. f* yeah.” but in my heart and head i sincerely can’t accept the compliment. i don’t believe what they say at all. “thank you”s are easy for me to accept. it means i did something that made the other person happy. i’m ok with that. 

even if my close friend tells me i’m a good person, i laugh it off. i say “nah”. one of my close friends told me she actually looked up to me and i was really surprised. not even like pleasantly, i was just “what? lol why?” kind of. even when my bf told me i was cute, some part of me said, “he’s just saying that because he’s with you. don’t even think that he means 1% of what he just said”. 

it even affects my work too, in hindsight, now that i think about it. i really want to ask for a raise, but why should my boss grant me that? it’s not like my work is amazing or anything. she doesn’t owe me shit. 

is there something severely wrong with me? does anybody else feel this way?"
1311,Anyone have extreme death anxiety?,[deleted]
1312,My relationship is stressing me out,"So I have a lot of mental health issues that I am trying to work on, and I have had a boyfriend for the past year and few months. He is wonderful and pretty supportive but he does not know or understand mental illness one bit and he doesn’t really understand how to take care of me or deal with me . 

I get really overwhelmed and stressed out when I hang out with him because I feel like I have to entertain him, be fun to be around, cook him dinner (something amazing of course), watch tv shows that I may not necessarily feel like watching , etc .. things that probably sound petty but I get really bad decision anxiety so I prefer to just be alone and stick to my routine.

I know he loves me a lot and isn’t trying to hurt me or stress me out.. but idk how to tell him that he is. And it’s not even his fault ... I just want to be alone. I’m scared to tell him I need space because I don’t want to hurt his feelings."
1313,A cry for help but I don't have much left to cry with.,"I'm 22, since I was 17 I've worked with 8 counsellors/therapists, I only enjoyed working with one of them. After 16 weeks (16 hours) I was discharged, the company told me I'd have to get a new diagnosis to reapply and then would have to wait months and after that there would be a tiny chance I'd be able to work with the same therapist again. This was around a year ago, I haven't received any treatment since.

I don't even know what to say anymore, since my girlfriend left (almost 2 years ago), I've had nothing to live for. I was very mentally ill when I was with her, I can't imagine what I put her through, but she gave me a reason to get better, I was doing it for us. I don't really know how to do things for me. 

I've been suicidal since I was around 12, I first tried when I was 16. My life has been full of betrayal, infidelity, deception. Mum cheated on dad and both my girlfriends cheated on me. Once dad was single he would ALWAYS have \~7 girlfriends, none of which knew about eachother. 

I've spent the last 4 years living in a big city but I couldn't take being alone anymore, so I'm back with my mum, temporarily. But if anything, I feel worse. Now I have people around, and still I feel completely trapped in my own mind. 

Everytime I think about the next step I think about how useless doctors have been in the past, I need to REALLY know what's wrong with me. At different times I've been diagnosed with: Depression, bipolar disorder, GAD, SAD, OCD, anorexia and CPTSD, all within the past 3 years. I don't even know what I'm trying to make better, there's just no way there's that much shit wrong with me. I have some fucking deep rooted issues and the task of finding someone that genuinely wants to make that better is too much for me now, I've been letdown too many times, I'm afraid the next time will be the end. 

I have no friends I see in real life, because I have no personality. My personality has become a collection of my various possible mental illnesses and the various things I've learned about how to treat them, I just have nothing to offer. No passion, no desire, I definitely would NOT want to be friends with me, I'm not a bad guy, I'm just fucking boring. The things I really love are video games, maths and psychology/helping other people, but they're fading really quickly.

Byron (Reckful) gave me really a lot of inspiration and hope, I could relate a lot to him. The way he was trapped in his own mind, his requirement for constant reassurance, his unquenchable desire to be around people he loves all the time. His path to recovery lit a real fire in me, it made me really determined to also get better, to be in a place where I was healthy enough to acquire those people I love and that love me back, to live a life where I have a purpose, to not perform the unthinkable act.

And now, after hearing the way Byron's friends spoke about him, how all they could really do is delay his death, how there was nothing they could do to stop it, how they all knew but knowing was worthless. I'm struggling to see another path for my life, I almost feel empowered, I feel no pain writing this because I want nothing more than to leave this plane of existence, to join Byron is his Everland.

I'm really fucking suffering from a huge amount of suicide ideation, I don't even feel sad, I just feel like it's already over. I'm not exaggerating when I say the only thing stopping me is my parents and my couple of friends, because I know these people really fucking love me and I don't want them to go through what Byron's friends are going through. 

I really need some sort of divine fucking intervention because I'mma fucking die. And even if my life is worthless I know my death will be fucking tragic for the people whose lives I am a part of. 

Please do not link me helpline numbers, they are all objectively dogshit help resources for me. I want to go to A&amp;E again, but I'm not emotional enough for them to take me seriously, I'm dead inside. Last time I don't think they would've taken me seriously if I didn't have fresh cuts everywhere. I'm not really sure where to take myself anymore, my mum doesn't understand mental health and my dad is very far away, and has dealt with far too much of my shit for far too long. 

Stay strong, one day the world will deal with your mental illness better than you ever thought possible. I love you all."

1317,Why does it seem like I keep thinking myself back into depression?,"I don’t know if that makes sense or is a common symptom with people with depression, but it seems like I can’t get away from depression, because I have a hard time letting go of the feeling. 

After I had a really bad episode of sleep insomnia a year ago, it seems like my depression continues to return. For me, depression just came out of no where. I mean, I have always had functioning anxiety, but that’s about it.

When I feel my depression getting better, I am reminded of the depression and how it made me feel, which throws me back into my depression. My ruminating doesn’t help either.

I also do not have typical feelings that comes along with depression. I don’t feel hopeless or like a failure. I just feel sad and like I can’t sleep. I also think of suicide, but I think that is more an instructive thought due to my anxiety, instead of an action I see myself actually following through with."

Is doing things for me wrong? Why is it so hard? Is it a dream worth going after? I don't know what to do or how to handle it. Does anyone else feel this way??"
1319,Is this narcissism? Another ex lover story,"Was this Narcissism? Another ex lover story.

Long story alert 🚨 

Around 5 years ago I met my now ex boyfriend. We met through an app, and our relationship bloomed very quickly. He was charming, charismatic, made me feel important and wanted. I was young, around 23, and within a month or two I was in love. He was attentive, made me feel like I was important to him. He would consistently check in with me when we were apart, we would spend every moment we could together, and started planning a more concrete future together. After a long period of this amazing relationship, he quickly went cold and eventually broke up with me because it was “getting too serious” and “he couldn’t be in a relationship” because he wanted to go to law school away and couldn’t be tied down. I was crushed and confused. Became depressed, ect. Eventually I moved on and started dating again but he was always in the back of my mind and nobody made me feel like him. 

A few months passed and he contacted me, saying he made a mistake and wanted to try again. I was so excited, young and dumb and quickly jumped on the offer, thinking that now things would be right. 

We met up after work, where he greeted me with a picnic along the river. We had a magical evening, watched the sun set, had wonderful conversation and ended up going home and spending the night together. Nothing sexual happened, as I wanted to take it slow. He ended up spending the entire weekend with me. I recently moved into an apartment and didn’t have it fully furnished, so he took me to buy furniture and purchased it for me. I thought this must be a sign he really cared and wanted to invest in me, ect. Two weeks later he went cold again and said he couldn’t be in a relationship. I was crushed, again. 

Four years and a new apartment later, after no contact due to me blocking him on every social media/dating/possible contact point-my phone was stolen from me. I got a new phone, downloaded new apps and bam. He finds me and strikes up conversation. When I saw this contact, I was sick to my stomach and ready to throw up. 

He contacts me saying that he couldn’t believe that he found me, that he wanted to make amends. He invited me for coffee, to talk, my first reaction was to reject, but after much convincing, I met up with him. He was charming, told me that he’s changed, that he always loved me and thought about me. That he wanted to be with me, and build a life together. I was initially very closed off and callous to his words, but after 4 weekly walks along the river and after answering all my tough questions, I caved in and decided I wanted to be with him. After all, I never stopped loving him. And he seemed to feel the same way. 

The first 11 months of us being together were normally great. Amazing times together, traveling, sparks, very strong sexual attraction and understanding of each other. We met each other’s families. I grew to love his family and my family grew to love him. He said he wanted to marry me, have children together, grow old together. At this point we were spending almost every night together. On a trip to San Francisco, he fake proposed to me three times in Muir Woods, thinking each time was funnier and funnier, seeing my reaction. 

Then hell broke loose. The criticism of everything I did, the constant belittlement, the degradation followed by resolution and affirmation that he “wasn’t going anywhere ever” and that we could work through all problems. This would repeat itself almost weekly. One memorable event was as follows: I was doing his laundry late in the evening after he had gone to bed. I decided to wash his underwear and socks, since they were dirty and he didn’t bring another pair. Since it was late, I forgot to put them into the dryer after they had finished and I went to bed. The next morning, frantically, I jumped out of bed remembering they hadn’t been dried and threw them into the dryer and jumped in the shower. After about 10 mins, they were mainly dry and he had woken up, and immediately noticed they were not 100% dried and took huge issue with this. He became cold, told me he couldn’t rely on me, ect. I offered a pair of my underwear and socks (were both men, btw) but he refused. We went to work and I was torn apart all day, scared and also very upset as I thought the situation was out of control. I called him at lunch where I apologized and demanded he apologize for telling me what he did and for making me feel belittled. He would not, became silent and withheld any real contact or apology/affirmation. This happened on many occasions and eventually got worse. On some occasion, he called me the “lowest of the low.” Then we’d work it out, or at least move beyond.

My dog, who I loved dearly, passed away. While crying and morning her loss, he became physically and visibly aroused. This happened any time I cried.

On our anniversary he sent me bouquets of flowers to work for three days in a row. For our anniversary, I planned a night out for us to commemorate. Nothing crazy, dinner and a movie downtown. He expressed distaste for everything. I chose the movie, he didn’t like it. I chose the restaurant, a highly rated French restaurant, he didn’t like it. He told me he wasn’t excited for our year together and was more excited about his “Friend anniversary” with one of his friends. I felt crushed but ignored it. More belittlement followed. 

It got to a point where I demanded we go to therapy together. We went once before he discredited the therapist, saying he didn’t have a “therapy license” hanging on the wall of the office so it must not be legit. I then demanded we both see separate therapists. 

More belittlement happened. More make ups happened, rinse/repeat. This went on for 3 months, before we reached the breaking point. I loved him, couldn’t imagine life without him, but was completely broken. 

I decided I wanted space, and decided we would meet once weekly to try and sort this out. I was never apologized to, cried harder than I ever did in my life, and begged to get reasoning for all of this from him. He was mainly cold and not understanding, but at one point, through tears muttered “there’s something wrong”, referring to himself. 

Not long after, we called it quits. I had no more to give and felt as if I lost all dignity and self worth. Was crushed by losing him. Depressed for months. Now, 10 months later, I’m better but not completely healed. I never want him back, but the scar is still there and fading slowly. 

Does this sound like Narcissistic Personality Disorder or something else? I appreciate all input, thank you."
1320,Making up people to cope??,"Hi! Id like to refer to myself as Misery, and Ive been having this question for quite a while now. So basically, when I think of myself, its not just „me“ theres 3 other people, they kinda influence my mood/behavior I guess? I seemed to have made them up a while ago. I don’t remember when. They kinda just started existing at some point and I went „aight so that exists now“ lol. Uh, its one girl and two boys. One of the boys is really mean towards me. He looks similar to me and seems to think emotions are a waste of time. That I should go numb, harm myself and starve. The others HATE him. They are kinda comfort characters I guess? I know I made them up but now I can’t seem to stop thinking about them. They have distinct personalities and when I see certain things I „react“ like I am one of them. I frequently talk to them in dreams too. I draw them. Have conversations with them in my head (although imagined, they cant talk.) BUT I did hear their voices before. Whenever I get too stressed I start hearing voices and there are 3 distinct ones, one girl and two boys. Im fairly sure its them. Has anyone else made up characters and they kinda just co exist with you now? That you know how they feel/react and that they seem to influence your behavior? I don’t think they are real tho. Idk haah."
1321,My emetophobia has been so bad lately.,"Sorry for this being so long, but I would appreciate it if you read it through.

I have a very bad fear of vomit. I get panic attacks every time I see/hear someone throw up, or when someone around me is sick, or just hearing ""I don't feel good"".  I'm also super scared of me vomiting, getting extreme anxiety when my stomach and/or head hurts. 

I've had this phobia since I was in second grade, when a kid threw up in class. That was the first time I experienced anxiety. Fast forward to sixth grade, I vomited in my house. I remember EVERYTHING from that day. The date (april 7th, 2017), what I played, what book I read, what I ate at school, what I saw on tv, what underwear I had, what I felt before throwing up, etc. I can tell you the whole day without missing any details.

Since the lockdown started my stomach started to hurt every day (not so bad, but enough to make me cry of fear somedays). I found out I have irritable bowel syndrome so I started to avoid dairy and spicy foods, but the pain is still there. I tell my parents, but they don't understand that this is a phobia I can't control. They tell me ""no one likes being sick"" ""why are you scared?"" ""just don't throw up"". (this sounds so edgy omg) They have no idea of the things I feel every day, but not because they are bad parents, but because they just don't understand. 

I've gone to a psychologist for two years (I stopped going since December I don't know why) and to a psychiatrist for depression issues (I don't have depression anymore. Yay!). But when I went to the psychiatrist a week ago she diagnosed me with anxiety. I described her my fear but she doesn't treat phobias. I looked up therapists in my city that do (the psychologist I used to go to also didn't treat phobias) and I found one that seemed to be very good.

But I was so afraid of telling my parents about her, so I just told them I wanted to go back to my old psychologist and they agreed. Maybe she could tell me about phobia therapists. 

Thank you for reading, any advice would be very much appreciated."

I haven't really ever been with someone, and I am talking to this one guy and I really like him and I guess he likes me too, and I keep worrying about messing things up with him.
I don't want to mess up.
I have anxiety, and I don't know what but everything happening around is just making it worse, I get too worried.
My thoughts keep piling up, and my head feels heavy
A few days ago, I was so happy, I felt like I could do anything and everything was normal for a while, but this keeps happening.
I get these heart palpitations, the fluttering feeling, and howmuchever I want to talk to someone, I don't think I can, most of the times because the people tend to say they're listening but they don't, and also because I don't want to anymore.
I have been to therapy and I stopped it.
I want to get on this by myself, I just want to feel normal again.
I don't want to feel this low.
Can y'all recommend me some methods which can help in any way?

1325,My best friends soon to be ex will have to return to her abusive family,"Hello

I know this might not sound like a problem that i should get my hands on at all, or even where i should post this, but i was  having an anxiety attack prior to writing this, , but time is ticking. But i have emotionally connected to this girl and i can't let her to go back to her family. The details (I will refer to my friend as R, and her mom as M): My best friend started to date this girl from a different town (it ain't that far). Everything was fine and dandy he didn't really notice anything wrong with her, only that her delivery is a bit cold or may sound very passive aggressive, i most certainly noticed and just thought that she is just a bit rude. But as it turns out as many things it stems from her home, family and surroundings. Apparently, her mom is a full blown alcoholic and i say this without a shadow of a doubt a full blown sociopath. No i'm not saying this because it would make my story more dramatic, she bullseyes every single tick when i looked up the key factors to recognize a sociopath. I went to her home once, and me and her boyfriend were bombarded with rude remarks and i didn't fully understand was this some sort of joke i'm not in on yet, but when i started to notice the way she talked with R, full of curse words, calling her a bitch, slut basically any horrible thing you can say to your offspring. It was a really horrible expirience, but then i got some more details. Apparently M does not work anywhere, she survives off R and her sisters disability checks, constantly verbally abuses her (And i'm not sure but i think she told her boyfriend that she was physically abused by her aswell). M really hates R boyfriend, because he is not rich and doesn't buy her alcohol (R had an ex that was a drug dealer and was good friends with M, used to buy her alcohol and drink together. On topic of that M does not hide the fact that she incredibly cares only about herself, and even tried to convince R to get back with her ex even tho he was a complete fuckhead who didn't leave R alone and kept calling her for months after they broke up. Obviously because she will have someone to buy her alcohol.) I heard enough to understand that M is a sociopath, there are no social norms for her, she shows no remorse nor empathy, is fueled by only her own needs, does not think of consequences ( very obviously) is really aggressive (not physically but verbally: Shouts on R all the time when we were there, even angrily answering to our non important questions). I think i established that this is pretty f\*\*ked up, and i wouldn't believe it if i wasn't there. Anyways R is riddled with health complications, i think is autistic, but she is such a sweet girl, innocent and naive and not that bright. And my friend just admitted that he doesn't love her, and well it's because he felt like she would be a burden to him. I was quick to correct him that really he has the option to just end it, but he is really thinking only about himself, and well he admitted that the feelings have faded (not to bash on my friend, but i hate that so much) This weekend R was with her boyfriend at his place with his family and she seems to be shunned by his family for being riddled with complications and not ""bright"", but very politely as i understood ( that influenced his view about the whole thing for sure.)  So he is planning to tell her how he is feeling today or tomorrow, and because he has a job and that's not his property but his parents, he is gonna drive her home, while being in denial that she just hyperbolizes her problems for pity, but i'm sure this is serious and that's her best way of crying for help that she does not want to go back there. Ok, so i'm really heartbroken by this very very badly and i want do to whatever it takes to save her from that. because i live with my parents currently, i cannot decide anything and i don't work anywhere (yet.) i was planning to rent an flat and just live for as much as i could, i do have some money under my belt, but i'm not sure if i could secure my financial stability in upcoming months.

I'm really at a loss here, and i just need some ideas to help me either cope with this or to save her from bullshit.

P.s :  This is in Lithuania so any eastern european people would understand how difficult this could be. 

Thanks in advance. I will provide as much info i can in the comments"

1340,Is it okay to seek mental health services if you aren't suicidal or having panic attacks?,"Hello. I (F26) want to set up an appointment with a therapist or counselor. I have gone to one in the past: first in undergrad due to panic attacks and stress, then in grad school due to stress revolving around my relationship, job, and school. However, when I went in grad school, I had some negative experiences with my service that make me question going again. 

Specifically, when I tried to make an appointment, I wad denied and told I did not meet the criteria for their services and to instead get help through a breathing technique app or a career coach. These do not help me. So, I petitioned several times and was able to start meeting with the psychiatrist. I found the sessions helpful, a great release of pressure and stress. But then one session he told me that there are patients who ""actually really need"" this service compared to me, suggesting that my situation wasn't that serious. I started feeling guilty for going- that I was wasting his time and others' time. In our last session, he told me he didn't know how to help me. I felt like our sessions were so helpful, I could finally get things off my chest and talk through my problems, but it seems that he saw no benefit in it. I felt real hopeless from that session and stopped going.

I haven't had a session since February, but I still feel overwhlemed and burdened to the point of exhaustion. I don't have panic attacks, self harm, or think about suicide. I just have no one to talk to, so I bottle up all this chaos until it breaks me. It makes me sick to my stomach or gives me headaches and once made me pass out. Stress is so high and constant that it is my normal.

Is it bad of me to seek mental health services if my situation isn't serious or life-threatening?

Is it bad of me to use mental health services as a space to talk rather than to get treatment (e.g. learn about breathing techniques)?

Does my situation warrant/justify going to mental health services?"

Anyway, i used to be a really talking kind of person, when i was younger i would spend hours talking about everything and i never ran out of subjects. Well that changed when i got to 13 and since then i've been getting quieter and quieter to the point where even someone asked my parents if i had any kind of illness because it didn't seem normal how little i speak. I can only have a large conversation with my parents or my childhood friend who knows me since my 12 yrs. I also stutter a bit when i'm with unknown people or school companions. Is this just normal shyness or something else?

However, I have noticed that whenever there is a disagreement I am far more scared about it than I should be. In this group when we disagree, I hardly ever want to know what the other person is saying, and I am shit scared that what i just said is not misinterpreted. 

I label my jokes as ""jokes"" so that they are not misinterpreted. (for which i get told that i should not do that because apparently labelling the jokes kills the jokke)

But there have been instances in the past where my jokes were misinterpreted. I just wanna avoid that. 

I have some rather liberal opinions and when i voice them apparently I am being too woke or copying my ideas from twitter or reddit. 

I get accused of being too condescending often.

anyway things got out of hand. this guy and me were saying things to each other and both of us were joking. So in the middle of that he assumed that i wasnt joking about something i said and reacted rather violently.

I outwardly showed these emotions by venting to my sister and not being very nice to the people around me.

However, my sister is now going through the same thing. I am very worried about her because that was the hardest time of my life and I at least had my sister. However, she is not very expressive about what  she is feeling so I am worried this will eat her up and really hurt her. She has shut everyone in the family out and I am always trying to reach out to her because I know she is being left alone with her thoughts too much but every time I do we end up in a fight.

i want to hospitalize myself im so scared i feel so pathetic and fake though like who actually gives a fuck about a dumb fucking bitch who had a fight

but that’s not it that’s what broke my back that’s what sent me down this hole i am bleeding i am looking for pills i am desperate to not feel like this i have been drinking all day and will soon leave to get more

i feel so pathetically fake like my problems are so insignificant but i just want to kill myself. i want to go to the hospital so i don’t have to worry about what im going to do. so i don’t have to starve myself to feel anything. because i don’t have anyone here except him, i am hundreds of miles from home and family and have nothing here except him

Now, many of you can think that this behaviour of overthinking or thoughts only occurs with the people i love, but that’s not true. 
Just imagine I’ve heard about something about you and (though I don’t know you that well) very  next moment I’ll think or a thought will come to my mind that s/he’s gonna die or something bad is gonna happen(which doesn’t happen).

At first, I thought all of thoughts were the result of watching thriller or action movies, since I watch a lot of movies. But I’ve started watching light hearted comedy/rom-coms, but same situation. Same thing i did for music, listening to calming music, nature’s sound etc etc.

I’ve tried medication, meditation. I’m even on a pill that i take 2 everyday(since Jan’20) to reduce hypertension. But seems not working at all. Everyone tells me to chill, but i just can’t, I can’t get those negative thoughts out of my head. I’m tired of thinking negative things all day long, i just want this to end.

1353,I need advice and help understanding what’s wrong with me. (Potentially long),"Hey,

I’m a teenager, and I have a couple of problems.


So, first things first. Me and my mother don’t have a good relationship. We clash and she very, VERY obviously favours my younger sibling to me. She vents all of her stress into me and in return, this has started to take a toll on me. It’s not extreme abuse or anything, it’s just terrible wording and the constant complaining/nagging at me for minimalistic things, getting mad at me for making a glass of water but not my sister (even though she never asked for one), telling me I cannot be stressed and other things that I personally find quite harmful. I don’t even see her as a mother figure anymore, I feel much safer and much more comfortable around my grandmother. As far as I’m concerned? She’s my mother. 

Over the past year or so I think I’ve been getting worse. I very obviously have a stress issue (which my family denies by telling me I have nothing to be stressed about aka “get over it), the smallest things irritate me. I have breakdowns where I’ll sit and sob, particularly after my mother has gotten stressed/mad at me, but quickly get over them within 10 minutes or so. I struggle to sleep and I have what I can only describe as social anxiety (that might not be it but that’s the best way I can describe it). I’m extremely forgetful, I move backwards and forwards from my mothers place and my grandmothers and I keep leaving behind small things like chargers or wires (for my Xbox). This is another thing my mother gets stressed at me over and tells me that it’s my fault and I have to deal with it, despite my grandmother offering to bring it, she lives less than 5 minutes away. I also struggle to find motivation to get out of bed, do school work, ect. I also struggle to concentrate on multiple things and can only really focus on 2 things at once when I’m playing video games/listening to music (quite honestly the only escapes I have). 

I think I need help. A therapist or even a person at school to speak to. But as I’ve said before, I have what can only be described as social anxiety and I break down when trying to talk about any of this. I’ve also had a bad experience with therapists in the past (TW: slight self harm) related to me scratching my arms when I was frustrated which has lead to me not trusting them. I also can’t really talk about my actual feelings to my grandmother or mother, they’ve told me I can’t feel stress before and I’m afraid they’d either exaggerate it or simply push it aside. 

I’m struggling, and I’m only quite young. I don’t want this to get worse but I don’t want help. What do I do? And is there a name to what I’m currently experiencing (regarding my forgetfulness, stress and breakdowns)?


Thank you so so much for your help."

1356,Coming to an end,"At the beginning of my last session with my therapist, she informed me that she was leaving the profession at the end of August.

Needles to say this news took me by surprise.

I began seeing her almost a year ago.

In my previous post I gave a short account of the events that shaped my life. (See ""Boy Interrupted"".)

When I asked her what her plans were she was rather non-committal in her response.

This I understand.

This news is going to take time to process.

Here was a change in the status quo.

For the major portion of our session we explored my feelings on the news she had presented me with.

The ongoing discussion of multiple major traumas in my life along with my gut feeling of desiring to return to the unit to visit/walk through, after forty-five years. 

The unit at first was terrifying, yet soon enough I fell under it's spell.

A place where for the first time in my life I was able to breath.

After nine months of sanity, I was thrust back into a world that hadn't changed even thou I had.

Back to a family that came to visit me only twice during my stay and never once came to a family oriented therapy session.

Back to a school where my attackers had spread the “He's a faggot” rumor, only to be ostracized by the other students. 

No follow up program was offered or initiated.

Once again I was on my own, still trying to put the pieces of my life together.

I launched into that digression as a segue into my thoughts and questions. 

 As is true with any client therapist relationship there is a long period of gaining trust in your therapist and the willingness to open ones heart and mind.

The willingness to allow yourself to be vulnerable in the face of another.

How long does it take to know you are in a safe place?

At this time I am in the midst of an important juncture.

I have begun to see the tragedy my life has been.

While uncovering the suppressed/repressed parts of my memory that lay untouched for years.

While there is never a good time for a client to be faced with the reality that their therapy is to be put on hold or even canceled.

It is for me occurring at a time when I am beginning to see hope somewhere in the future. 

Are those hopes to be ignored, by the person I trusted to help see me through to the end?

We have not yet spoken of alternatives, that will come in future sessions.

It may well be that a “fresh pair of ears” will create new opportunities for discovery.

I for one am not looking forward to beginning anew with another person.

I had made great strides forward over the last year and had hoped for a long term relationship with my present therapist. 


Alas this is not fated to be.

Has anyone else feel like they have been abandoned by their therapist?

1357,I'm scared of getting old,"I'm currently 14 and I am obsessed with how I look. I love to do dramatic makeup and fun outfits and the thought of aging is terrifying to me. The thought of having wrinkles makes me so scared. The thought of not being able to wear fun makeup and outfits is scary. What if im 50 and I want to wear a cute outfit but my boss pulls me for a meeting and says its inappropriate? I don't want to get old. I want to stay young forever. I would rather die at 35 or 40 than get old and have wrinkles, the thought of looking older than 20 or 30 makes me so scared"
1358,I need help please read,"I can't do this anymore, I'm struggling with self harm and I'm depressed. I'm trying to find a job and it's going no where and I can't be alone I don't feel safe with myself. My friends don't really care and I just need to stay with someone I can't be alone idk what to do anymore. My province barely has any resources for mental health and gets getting worse and worse. Can someone help."
1359,Why I do always expect hostility from everything?,"I'm 22M, living with my mom, and this thing really makes my life harder.

When a person don't respond to me in 5 seconds, I automatically assume that they are intentionally ignoring me. When someone is looking at me for too long, I automatically assume that they are thinking I look bad. When I see an internet post, I often automatically except comments to be aggressive and negative, often even imagining the examples. Whe when I post or comment myself, I'm always being very afraid to read responses, to the point that I don't read them for hours, or sometimes even days.

And the worst part is how this poisons my interactions with my mom. When she talks loudly in another room, I automatically assume that she is yelling at me. I very often treat things she says to me (even the innocent ones) as personal accusations of me doing something wrong. And when she is nocking my room's door (or even when she is not, and it's done by the wind), my first thoughts is that she is angry and going to yell at me.

What's wrong with me? Why even right now, while writing this, I'm afraid of this post being deleted, as ""trolling""? Why I'm such a terrible person, that I threat everyone as my enemy (including **my own mom!**)?"
1360,DID &amp; OSDD youtube channel dedicated to ending stigma for systems everywhere," This is Kai, a Co-Host in an OSDD-1B system. The Ember System. 

 We decided to kick off the channel with whatever was of interest to us at the time: a peek behind the curtains. (Plus I have been SUPER anxious about  videoing so I just needed a launching point)  I'll be posting bi-weekly. Let me know if you have any video suggestions in the comments!:)  

Topics in Kai's video: The complexity of consciousness, be-ing, time, and even a little quantum mechanics theory! 

Topics in Kyle's Video: Dissociative Identity Disorder and Otherwise Specified Dissociative Disorder

These will lead to future videos on everything from studies of various Zen and Yogic traditions, philosophy and phenomenology, applications and inspiration for self-improvement/self-actualization/enlightenment. (These are usually more in the realm of Stone's interest - Stone is an alternate 'state' or 'part' in our Otherwise Specified Dissociative Dissorders - 1 B system) 

 We will also be sharing videos on polyvagal theory, structural dynamics, the fragmentary nature of the self, and how to start a path to working with head mates to create a flowing system of life that can realize the vast potential we each hold inherently.   

So, have any questions? Anything Confusing? Any topics you'd like to have elaborated on? Not sure what OSDD means and how it relates to DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)? Can a person with multiple parts work on enlightenment work even when not integrated and not pursuing integration? 

Or if ya just wanna say hi, leave a comment and I'll get back asap. Let me know. I love each of you, truly. I hope you are holding up through this crisis. Can't wait to chat:)

1361,Can you rid yourself of self hatred?,"Hello. So I've spent the past 4 years battling mental health issues including depression and anxiety. Now, I'm doing a lot better. I've learned to cope with a lot of my symptoms, but the core of my problems is still left untapped. I just hate myself. No matter how much self compassion I have, no matter how much care I give myself, at the end of the day, I hate myself. My self hatred feels like a solid wall at the core of my existence and like it's part of me. All of my life's decisions now are based on self hatred. I make decisions because I believe that I'm stupid or ugly or undeserving. I know that's wrong, and I try to fix that, but it still feels like I'm only learning how to cope with my self hatred. I cannot seem to tackle it and break it down.

I want this to stop but I don't even know where to start. I have been to therapy but we never got to the core of my problems and then I stopped being able to afford it due to the pandemic. I just don't know how to proceed on my own at this point. How can I break down such a big part of me and rebuild something better? I don't want it to take another 4 years. Does anyone have any advice?"
1362,I feel like I'm losing hope.,"I've had a full blown breakdown before and been sectioned from it. I never want to go back to that dark af place again. I hurt myself but also everyone around me in that time. 

But I'm a decade into life restricting body dysmorphia and my therapist that I've seen since 2015 has told me she can't help me anymore and is leaving. I feel scared and alone. I always had a hunch I couldn't be helped with the big issues and this confirms it. I can't take living like this much more. I do feel happy sometimes but I don't think I've felt true happiness and contentment in years."
1363,Am I a sociopath?,[removed]
1364,[TRIGGER WARNING] My parents rejected a girl I dated long ago because she had dangerous temperament issues. I'm starting to find myself developing similar issues while in quarantine.,"So about five years ago, I dated this girl who I met online (which honestly hurt the situation from the start). She had some mental health issues that I will keep vague simply to respect her own privacy. To keep it simple, she had temperament issues that were so severe that my parents basically split us up and cut me off from her without me saying goodbye. They thought she was a psychopath and after a while I thought so too. To this day I've been taught to reject and hate people with those issues. They're bad news. Since then, my life got worse but eventually got better. In the past year and a half, I've fallen in love with my best friend. I honestly think she is the one. I've also warmed up to old and new friends and my social problems have (mostly) faded to the background. I learned how to love others and love myself and my family saw a new happier side of me that they never saw before. My life felt like it was finally going for a future I could see.  


Then COVID-19 happened, then the quarantine happened. The worst of myself came out. I was so fed up with the stupidity of the situation that I started threatening people on the internet, telling some to kill themselves, promoting violent action against and wishing death upon people who don't act responsible in this crisis, which even included some members of my own family (though I never confronted them directly).  


As you can see, I've already crossed a line. Not even the girl I dated in the past has done/would do that.  


I can see myself getting  more and more uncontrollable during the quarantine at the fear and the anger at the world for not being able to get the situation right. Other things just add onto it like police brutality, racism, conspiracy theories, climate change denial, anti-vaxxers, and so on.  


I don't know what's happening to me and I'm so afraid to get help because I don't want to be locked up or rejected by my friends and family because of what is happening in my head, but I also want to protect them and myself from what could happen if I keep going down this path. Today, I stared at a ceiling fan for a good hour debating whether or not to hang myself, which I haven't thought seriously about in a long time. Obviously I got control of myself because I'm here now asking for help. I'm so scared to get help because I feel like the world is going to reject me for my problems. I've gained so much in the past year and a half that I don't want to lose, but I also want to protect the ones I love from the person I might become. I already reject myself. I don't want to become a bad or dangerous person, but I just don't know how to fight this. What do I do?

So because of coronavirus I got a chance to admit in a new college but it will be a better one no doubt (not as good as IIT)but I am sure people will judge me because it is not worth repeating one year.

I've thought of killing myself multiple times, but the good part of my brain always manages to make me realise there's still stuff to look forward to. And I know I need help, but I don't know how to ask for help, especially when my parents would brush it off. I don't want to die, I just want it to stop."
1372,at what point do mental health struggles become normal?,"Hi,

With the increasing openness and destigmatization surrounding mental health, I have a question.

As a kid, I knew very few people with mental health issues, but now that I'm a little older, I think I know more people with than without. Within the last two years, suddenly 7/10 of my friends were diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or both, and it made me wonder: 

*If everyone (or such a huge number of people) has depression, then when does it become normal? Does it ever become just a normal thing that people go through, that isn't a ""condition""? (in the case of depression and anxiety, i don't know many other disorders, illnesses, etc, that are as common)*

The thought of pills have always been something that I feared and tried to avoid because I've known too many people who have OD'd (purposefully and accidentally).

So, if mental health struggles like depression and anxiety are becoming normal, do we still need to medicate people (who aren't a harm to themselves or others)?

I know that mental health isn't black and white, and one remedy may work for one person and not another. But I was wondering if we could ever normalize depression and anxiety (in non-extreme cases) and not have it classified as a disorder since it seems like more and more people are being diagnosed."

He thinks I might be bi polar and I have personally know for a while but just kept sweeping it under the rug. I have been told I should speak to my GP about it but the idea is causing me stress because honestly im scared of my dad finding out. He doesn't have the best opinion of mental due his mother being locked in a mental hospital and getting electro shock treatment back ( this way before I was born like 1980s I think) which lead to her having a heart attack.

1376,What are the best alternatives to CBT for anxiety and panic attacks?,[removed]
1377,"For people who dissociate, what's the best way to react?","When you start dissociating, if someone is with you, what's the best reaction they can have? Like, to help you and make you feel safe? When you dissociate, do you need something to help you stop or is it better to just wait?

1378,What defines self harm?,"My friend shared a post that I happened to be kind of offended by. I felt it was misinformation about what exactly self harm is. I'm someone who used to cut myself, and punch myself till I was yellow; I was offended that these things could be considered equal to what I experienced. 

The post said: 

""Self-harm is more than inflicting pain on the physical body. It is also harming yourself emotionally, mentally, or spiritually""

This part I could agree with. However the image listed these behaviors as self harm: 


""This is self harm:
-pretending 

-sharing with people who can't support you

-not asking for what you need

-judging yourself harshly

-being inauthentic 

-thinking negatively about yourself

-preoccupying yourself with other people's lives 

-expecting things to be perfect

-Allowing fear to stop you

-choosing to remain silent

-complaining about changing what you can control""


I disagree with this. From my experience, a lot of these are behaviors I've developed too. Ive been told its a side effect or a defense mechanism the brain developed to cope with my life long emotional neglect. These things can be associated with trauma. 

However, in my honest opinion, self-harm is intentional. I chose to cut myself (for whatever dark reasons). These behaviors dont come about just because you want to. Theyre subconscious. Theyre things that take work to fix.

Theyre just not self harm in my book, but something different. 

My big fear is that people will start saying they ""self harm "" just because they experience a few of these behaviors.  Sure it warrents you to seek therapy, but its not the same as intentionally inflicting pain on your body.

Thoughts?"
1379,(17M) I feel as if I have 2 sperate personalities,"Recently I (17M) have been feeling down, and this is because I don't really know who I am anymore. I used to know what made me happy in life and I had goals that I would aim towards.

But now I don't know, the motivation I had isn't there anymore with the exception of occasional bursts that disappear as fast as they arrive

I want to be able to sit down and talk through my feelings, even if just to myself. But doing that feels impossible because I immediately get overwhelmed with emotions. As if just thinking about who I am results in my mind defending itself by scaring me into distracting myself and when I confronted those feelings recently they made me scared to go to sleep.

I don't know what to do, as I haven't had anything like this before but I have had these emotions for a few months now and probably started 2 years ago and have slowly grown

What I want to do is become motivated again into aiming toward goals but I don't even have goals anymore, not ones that feel in reach anyway

Recently I have also been feeling as if I am constantly battling two sides of myself. One side is happy and feels like it's without a care, and the other one is one that just wants to ruin myself, whether it be telling other people about my emotions or contemplating self harm. When really that is something I could never do and flinch at the idea and hope that remains

Or the other day someone was doing something very mundane and only slightly irritating without them noticing them doing it and I wanted to scream at them so much so that I refused to even comment on the irritation"
1380,I think I have PTSD but it's not diagnosed.,"So pretty much what happened was a lot. It started in November 2019, I couldn't eat, and would throw up a lot, still don't know what was up with that, it went on until April 2020, it's just kinda been shrugged off as anxiety. It got really bad in January, I was down 12 pounds from already severely underweight and in and out of the hospital almost constantly. This caused me to have 59 attendence strikes 2nd semester, for a triple honors class kid going into concert season, it was really bad with low grades and missing work. But all of that was minute compared to February. 

On one of the last days in January my now ex asked me to meet him somewhere and I did, no big deal, we're dating, probably a pop date or something. Long story short I got raped. Or at least I think I did? He wanted to do sex and I did not. I told him no but he kept saying ""come on, don't you love me?"" ""Don't you trust me?"" And pushing me back against this one wall in the dugout we were in until I just kind of nodded. It wasn't vaginal penetration cause he simply couldn't find it, but it was anal and it hurt like a bitch. There was no pleasure and I wanted to stop after it first started but he said no, that we would be fine, that we were too far in to stop and that I should relax and enjoy it. I didn't even moan, there was simply no feeling. I just kinda let my mind go blank, like retreating into my head or go afk but in real life. I wish I had struggled more, but I didn't which is why I don't think it was rape, but on the other hand I was pressured into consent and when I tried to take it back I was denied. Either way it was statutory, he was a week past his 16th (age of consent in my state) and I was a week from my 15th, so still 14. 

A few hours after that a friend died of cancer, she was 16, her birthday was in April. A few hours after her one of my friends grandpa also passed away, all of my extended family lives pretty far away so he was like my grandpa as said friend was my ""cousin"" and most people assumed we were actually siblings. Three blows within 24 hours. As mentioned, my birthday was the next week, it was spent at both funerals. The following week was Valentine's day, supposed to be our 6 month. He broke up with me on February 12, and was dating one of my friends within the week. 

Right after I had gone through the shock of two deaths, the illness was getting way worse, I was at my lowest weight - 84. NOT healthy for a 5'4 15f. I genuinely felt I was going to die, if not throwing up, then chronic migraines and worrying fevers. Anyway, fast forward to February-July. Almost everytime I sleep I see one of the three events and wake up sweating and crying when it's really cold in my room and I sleep with no blankets. 

Whenever me and my boyfriend are talking and he makes a sexual innuendo as even a joke I get really bad flashbacks to that one night and other events like when he'd grope me on the bus when I'd tell him stop he'd just tell me to shush or cover my mouth. I know I was more of just a number to him, but it was nice to have some attention as my relationship prior to that was extremely physically abusive and I have lots of pictures of bruises from that one, and he also would sexually assault me, though I'd fight back and he'd threaten my little sister or smack me so I'd stop which is why I think I didn't fight the guy after him either. So yeah, the flashbacks can send me through whirls of sadness, anger, etc. And get triggered by sounds, scents, etc. Like they make it hard to breathe or move or anything and it's like I have to relive it every time and I just want it to stop. I just want everything to stop.

It feels a little better to kind of vent it all out though some of my friends say I should be over it by now. But I'm still not sure if it is PTSD or if it's normal or anything. Idk, answers or general support are much appreciated but definitely not required, I just need to be heard for once, I've felt for so long like my voice falls on deaf ears. Also, sorry this post is such a mess."
1381,Need help with my severe anxiety please :),"Hi,

So basically, I have always suffered with severe sickness due to my anxiety. Since primary school, I've had this problem where I am physically sick if I get anxious enough. If this was something that only happened in certain situations, I could maybe cope with it, but it literally effects everything in my day to day life. I am now 22, and since being old enough to drink, I have found that alcohol completely erases my sickness feeling, and makes it a lot easier to deal with. 
Obviously I am aware that using alcohol is not the answer, and I understand how harmful it can be if I were to use it a lot. But my question is, what is it that makes alcohol give me confidence and removes my sickness? I have read up about Dopamine but am still not certain about it. I was just wondering if there is a medication that works in a similar way to how alcohol works but without the negative effects or even just the drunkeness as I don't even need to be drunk for my anxiety to practically disappear. Surely, there must be something that can help me as my life is very difficult to deal with, especially as I've been trying everything I can to help for the last 12 years of my life and I really don't want to become dependant on alcohol. 

I hope this post is clear enough for anyone to understand my issue, but if it isn't, I am happy to answer any other questions that anybody has as I am desperate for help.

I really appreciate anyone that has any ideas or suggestions to help me out.

Thank you very much :)"

It’s been going on since Friday and it’s Sunday already but I haven’t worked up the courage to tell my parents about it and actually GO. I also keep making excuses like, “Oh I have an appointment tomorrow”, or “Oh, I was supposed to meet a friend today”. I don’t know how to tell my parents because they care so much about me and it would absolutely break their heart to hear about it. They keep trying to cheer me up and buy me presents and spend time with me, and I don’t wanna make it seem like I don’t appreciate it, cause I love them more than ever.

1386,Does the pain ever end,"A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and ADHD.  I am on multiple medications to help as well I have spent many years in therapy. I look to the outside world as a success I'm only 19, but already working In a big real estate agency and have plans to buy my first property in a couple of months.  The truth is in the inside I am completely broken.  The only times I am happy is when I drink or am at the gym I constantly feel lonely and feel like my world is imploding on me. I feel like I will never find someone who loves me and that this constant pain that I feel inside me will never end. My doctor has prescribed my Xanax for when I have extreme mood swings and panic attacks, but I usually just drink instead.  There is a constant pain and hole inside of me and I just want to know if this pain will ever end or is the rest of my life going to be like this."
1387,NEED ADVICE PLS! a Depressed love one doesn't want to talk to me,"There's this person I met on the internet 3 months ago, we instantly clicked or get along. We used to talk everyday, until last month when he admitted to me that he has been depressed.

He was thanking me for being there for him, and talking to me was making him feel better. Before he told me he is depressed, our online relationship grew deeper. He keeps telling me that he loves me and I really love him too. 
(not a romantic kind of love, but I'm willing to take it to the next level)

Since last month he has been distant, he said he doesn't want to talk to anyone and he said he was having mood swings. His friend/housemate already locked him up in his room like a prisoner because he might to something that will harm him, or  he would kill himself. (BTW, They are expatriates studying in this country.)

I'm becoming more worried because he is not fully open about his situation he doesn't want me to come see him. It's been more than 2 weeks Now he's not replying to but only reading my messages. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not a Mental Health expert, What should be the right thing to say for someone like him going through this serious depression. He said he doesn't want to even talk to his family, he doesn't know what he's living for, and that no one cares or could help him. 

I am here willing to fight with his battle. I'm here for him to help him heal. I just want to be there for him. But he doesn't want to talk to me. I told him that I'm not giving up on him. I feel that he is really in a dark place. And I'm hurting too. I wish I could just take away his pain."

We ordered Chinese food at 10:00 at night and had a peaceful evening. I am struggling with self-harm impulses at the moment. I might just be PMSing...I wish my period would fuck off already. I am 49 and ready to end that part of my life--the childbearing part, that is.

I feel like I am afraid of fun, getting close to people, and disappointing others. I judge people based on the fact that they are selfish because they choose fun over what's right. And, that is my justification for not having as much fun in my life; doing what's right versus what seems desirable. It makes me quite awkward when I do try and be ""fun.""

At the age of 9 after having virgin thing my school bus was burned. Someone saved from the fire as i was unconscious. When i became conscious someone grab me out of the school bus. My arm was burned. I went to several clinics or doctors to heal my burn. Then the whole year i was in pain. No cure for my burn was diagnosed. I was bullied in school. I was been separated from my friends in school. I was so quiet. In the age of 15, i was undergone a surgery that took one month. My grandmother diedin these years. When i was 17, my teacher sexually harassed me. I tried to tell my mother. She didn't listen to me. I tolerated him for a month because he used to touch my front top part. My brain ability to memorize was gone. I was spending my life like a dead person. Whenever i had exam, i cried everytime every subject every grade. Then i went to undergrad, my teachers make me so sick that i use to cry, they make my journey of University miserable.  I cried and cried and cried. After doing my graduate, i burst with sadness i cried so much no one was able to stop me. I heard voices and vfb oices and cry. They gave me meds. Every 3 months i used to burst with tears and crying. All becausecof voices. I go for our holy mosque. I went to spiritual people.  No one helped me but criticize me like everything that is happening to me is my fault. Then i came to US after one year i again burst with tears. This time i was not resting but walking n walking. My sis took me to a lady she made me cry. My own relatives made me cry. My own sis never see me with smile. My own mother made me cry. Hence there was no one in this world that hasn't made me cry. Who should i blame. I want to be people friends but not letting them know about my life journey. Its not easy for me it was never easier for me to choose happiness. You tell me do i have a right to be happy or not."

Some time ago it wasnt as bad as its now. I dont exactly know where the root cause is, but I feel like its partly thanks to my parents who didnt force me to socialize when I was a child (it was of course my choice too tough) and now Im scared of talking to other people. So far my only friends were those from school, who are now leaving me in the dust (I havent told them anything about my mental state so far, Im basically wearing a mask in public, but I still dont feel confident). Its also important to say Im scared of talking to them too, so thats basically killing even those friendships. Recently I have tried out Discord, but even there im too scared to start a conversation or even say a single word. I feel anxious even when Im just simply sending text messages over there, or somewhere else (even right now). Overall Im definetly way too self conscious about myself, I usually think of things like: am I funny,  am I annoying, do I look bad right now, do I have a bad expression and stupid things like that, it might sound fucking ridiculous to a normal person, but I get stressed over those things, think of the worst outcome and finally I doubt myself like Im some kind of weirdo that shouldnt be interacting with people. I think I might have grown a social phobia inside of me thats gonna make me even sadder and probably lead to depression (I might already suffer from it). So Im asking you people of reddit to please help me, give me advice on how to force my fucking being into a conversation with strangers without being scared, because thats the only solution I can think of.

I deeply thank to anyone responding."

1399,Ever feel like you'd be better off not having friends?,"I don't know how to explain this one... Just that sometimes I'm tired of dealing with other people. Even though at the end of the day, most my friends are well-meaning people who I can talk with really well, I don't know how to confront them when they say something hurtful to me. I end up just laughing it off not to make the situation uncomfortable and then keep on ruminating on it for days until it's too late to say something about it. Because of that, I feel like sometimes these friendships cause me more frustration than joy. It's like I'm in constant fights with people without them even being aware of it. 
Idk, sometimes I just feel like cutting everybody off."
1400,[F17] A fear of being misdiagnosed.,"Hi! Thank you for taking the time to read my confusion and jumbled thoughts. 

I’m 17, I’ve never had therapy or even spoken to anyone with an MD about any sort of mental health issue. Let me explain: I’ve had horrible anxiety since I was 4, so I felt that there was never a need to express that fact to a doctor/therapist. I knew I have anxiety disorder, there was no question about it. 

So- as I get older, I see myself questioning if that’s the only problem I have more and more. I see myself being happy less, lack of motivation, paranoia, etc. But that part is a discussion with me and a therapist, and now the fear is being misdiagnosed for things I don’t have. 

I got close to making an appointment, even got my mom who is otherwise very “mental issues don’t exist” to even be up to pay for it. 

I just don’t want to get a list of diagnoses, be pushed on medication and called a lost cause. 

Any tips to help that fear or telltale signs of a bad therapist?"

It could be a lot of things. Me and my mom got into a big fight yesterday but it was resolved. 

My sister had to leave for a bit because my grandparents came back and she works in healthcare so I only see her here and there.

I was working out for a couple weeks but got lazy the past couple days and have been struggling to get back into a routine.

My sleep schedule is messed up - I’m up til 6am some days which is frustrating to me sometimes. Especially because when friends want to hang out it’s earlier in the morning so I feel sleep deprived.

1408,Can’t major in what I want to major in but still want to stay at the university for safety...sound like a good idea?,"Finished my second year at uni. I struggled so much mentally and my grades suffered because of it. Computer Science at my uni is somewhat competitive so now I can’t major in it. It’s crushing. Devastating. I GUESS I could got to a different school and major in CS there but...

Even though I struggled at college I was still there for 2 years and I’ve become attached to the school in a way. Also it’s in a different city from my parents so that’s a massive bonus. No other school in my state catches my attention and out of state would be too expensive. 

So should I stay at my current uni knowing that I’ll have to major in something that I don’t like as much as CS for the feeling of safety? My heart says yes but I’m still not completely sure.

Thanks.

1411,My life revolves about being in relationships and it’s making me anxious and depressed,"Please someone else tell me they feel this way...

I was always happy throughout school but when college started I suddenly became obsessed with having a boyfriend. In my mind I would only be completely happy when I had a boyfriend. The problem is when these attempts of relationships fell through I’d become fully depressed. I remember I went on like 3 dates with a guy, started dreaming about him being my boyfriend and when he rejected me I cried for like 3 months. 

At uni I eventually got a boyfriend but he was nasty. The relationship was making me unhappy but I was so desperate to stay in a relationship I just stayed in it. I also became really anxious all the time. He eventually ended it and I legit wanted to kill myself even though I was miserable anyway.

I eventually got over it but now I’m sad about being single again. It’s so annoying but I don’t know how to stop the thoughts consuming me! It’s embarrassing to tell anyone. Does anyone else feel the same or have any ideas how I can stop?"

I know this sounds like a corona topic, but its actually not, just something that has been festering for a long time. I understand, from personal experience, that social interaction for humans is very important, but it's something I've always struggled with. I've never had many friends and never for very long. I have had intermittent social interactions here and there, mostly things where ""everyone was invited"" you know family birthdays, church activities (where everyone is over 60 anyway) etc, but I havent been out with my own actual friends since sometime in, I think 2009, no I didnt miss a 1. At 34, I've also never been on a 1 on 1 date, and not for lack of asking. My work is fine, I like the work and it keeps me busy. I go to the gym. I've pretty much given up on ever having any friends again much less a girlfriend even less get married but as a normal human thats trying to be honest with himself, I still really want those kinds of social/emotional/romantic relationship. How can I make this more mentally/psychologically sustainable when it seems reasonably certain those relationships are pretty much a pipe dream?"

1422,I want to take a mental health break from my relationship.,"tw: self harm

I have been having a hard time mentally lately. I suffer from depression but recently it's been getting worse... I've been feeling like I want to hurt myself, and while I think I won't actually do it, my thoughts and feelings are becoming more and more overwhelming. I love my boyfriend with all my heart, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I don't find our relationship to be hard, or work, but right now I feel like it's one more thing I have to ""deal"" with, and I always feel like I'm being a shitty girlfriend because I can't find the energy to message him, or be intimate, or other things. He never gets mad or upset about this, it's more so me being hard on myself. 

Part of me thinks that I should be able to focus on myself while still having him in my life and letting him support me (emotionally), but another part of me wants to just check myself into a hospital and not think about anything else except for myself. Is that selfish? How do I go about telling someone how much I love them, but I need some time to fix myself and feel like myself again?"

1425,What are some associations/organizations that can help people with little to no income to get access to therapy?,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since the age of eight. I remember how, from one day to another, with seemingly no explanation, I started being scared of sleeping at night, I was especially scared of silence. I borrowed a FM radio from my parents and would fall asleep listening to a French comedy channel so as to keep my mind from having dark/scary thoughts. Today, I am 27, and my anxiety and depression grew to where it paralyses me and makes me unable to achieve anything. Even the smallest task feels like climbing a mountain. I quit my job because I would start crying in the middle of my shifts or hide because my stomach would hurt from anxiety. I only feel good for a couple minutes a day and it's often mixed with a feeling of melancholy.  I have a dream of having a musical career, I have been working towards this goal for 12 years and yet have nothing to show for it. I tried meditating, exercising, I took supplements, made sure to eat healthy, sleep on schedule... I am so tired of always feeling like I am dragging my body behind me wherever I want to go and making my family worry for me. I am terrified of continuing to live like this...

Inside of me, I still believe that there has to be a way to get out of this. Despite just how hopeless it can feel at times, I've not lost my optimism yet. But I also realized that I cannot do this alone. 

I finally made peace with the idea of seeking help but I cannot afford it. Do you know of any organizations/associations that are helping people who can not afford to get help by providing them with therapy &amp; or other? To be honest, I am not quite sure to know what I am hoping for, but I am willing to try anything...

Thank you in advance to all of you reading this. Thank you so much. I hope you have a beautiful day.

1426,Can new relationships trigger a depressive episode?,"Thanks to anyone who reads this, I'm just going to write out what's going on and maybe someone out there can relate and advise. 

I'm a 20 year old gay male and I have never had a relationship before but I have had plenty of bad experiences in that field. Nothing horrible/tangibly abusive, but stuff that's definitely fucked with my emotions. In general I just get invested in people way too quickly and end up getting hurt because of it (I recognize that's my issue). 

I met a guy back in March that I've been talking to through all this COVID stuff, FaceTiming and all, and we decided to meet up about 3 weeks ago because we decided we really liked each other. We've been spending a lot of time together and I've been having a lot of fun and two days ago we decided that we are boyfriends. So why have I been so damn sad since then?

The anxiety actually started about a week earlier for me and I thought maybe putting a label on our relationship would help. And it did - for a few hours, maybe, until I fell right back down the hole. I never experience depressive symptoms when I am single and I have moderate (manageable) anxiety - what I am feeling right now is so much worse. 

It's hard for me to point to ANYTHING as a reason, because this guy is literally a dream for me and I've had 0 negative experiences with him. His home situation is chaotic/intense and I tend to worry a lot about that but that doesn't really explain the deep, deep sadness I've been experiencing. Literally everything about my actual time with this guy is perfect, but whenever we aren't together I'm just feeling extreme anxiety and sadness.

Has anyone ever gone through anything similar? Like I said, this is all VERY recent, so I recognize it's  possible that it could just get better with time. For the time being, though, the feeling is a bit unbearable. Thanks if anyone can help and share their experience."

1429,What should I do?,[deleted]
1430,My childhood has made it hard for me to make friends,"I'm a 21F and I have a tough time trying to keep friends. I won't go into too much detail since that would take to long (unless you want to know). But, growing up I had very few genuine friends. In elementary school, I had a friend who was jealous of me, she would talk about me behind my back and even gaslighted my best friend about me and another one who would put me down constantly. Middle school, I had a falling out with a close friend every year because of bs or because they betrayed my trust or me as a person. The worst year was 7th grade. Before I moved, I was friends with a group of boys and I started dating one of them and one of the guys started bullying me relentlessly until I moved. Then that summer when I made friends at my new school, one of my friends let my other friend who I had a falling out with go off on me via text. 9th grade, two of my friends became closer with each other and ultimately pushed me out of the group (I believe it was unintentionally though because I don't have ill feelings about them) and another friend started ignoring me out of nowhere. The rest of high school was me having school friends except for maybe three. I'm still friends with them, but casually. 

I'm 21 now, and I'm scared to make new friends and get close to people because I'm afraid they're gonna either a) get sick of me eventually b) abandon me or 3) tell people personal things about me like my old friends. I know it's silly, but it's a legit fear I have. My childhood friends broke my heart and I don't want to go through that again. But I so desperately want a best friend again. And honestly, its even affected me trying to date. I do want a boyfriend, but intimacy freaks me out. My mom always talks about me not having any friends or not dating and it hurts me because I want friends, but I'm afraid to make friends.It's just frustrating because I'm 22 in two months and I don't want to keep holding on to my childhood issues but it's like I can't help it."
1431,How to be optimistic?,"After much regret, disappointment, and betrayed hopes, I became pessimistic. I often worry and think too much about what will happen. Even as I type this post.

""What if this happens ?? What if that happens ??"". In the end I was afraid to do things or make decision.

I realized that this mindset hindering my life progress and weighed on my mind. Makes me feel inferior, insecure, and not confident.

But for me, being optimistic is like gambling, risking the choices I choose while I don't know what will happen. And from my experience, it often ends in disappointment, even if I try my best, as much as I can.

I want to feel optimistic and see how my life will be turn out to be, at least to ease my mind.

1432,Overcoming depression-induced dissociation. Tips and tricks?,"Hello!
Two or so years ago, I emerged from a decade-long depression (around ages 11-21). As you might imagine, this has had a motley of effects on my emotional development. The most persistent of these is dissociation. It's a problem that started gradually after I had been so unbearably unhappy for so many years. 



It's been difficult for me to find other people who have dissociation caused by chronic depression. This is something that I'm really focused on fixing, as I can't fully enjoy my life as not-depressed person. I've had a few suggestions, but I'm looking for more. It would also be great to hear from somebody else who has experienced this. 



What I have found most useful is meditating on my depression and getting a feel for my emotional boundaries again. I think that I'm currently afraid to fully inhabit my mind because I am terrified of it and don't trust myself. It's a practice that I never would have come up with by myself however. So I'm just looking for more insight. 



NOTE: mindfulness practices tend to not help me very much. I get hyper-focused and start to overthink things (how was this glass made? What is it made out of? blah blah blah)"
1433,I think someone I care about committed suicide and I feel responsible,A while ago I ended a long distance relationship with a girl because I felt we weren’t working well together. There were no hard feelings on my end but she was upset. I waited a week or so before I reached out to check on her and she seemed ok. Recently I was having a really hard time with depression and suicidal thoughts. I reached out to her to ask for some support but she quickly turned my attention to her. Stating she had been fighting back suicidal thoughts for weeks now. I tried to calm her but things only escalated. The last texts read “I’m just going to go” and “done with life”. She hasn’t seen or replied to anything I’ve sent since. I feel like I am responsible. Maybe if I said something different? Maybe if I didn’t say anything? Maybe if I waited just a little longer on the relationship? I don’t know what to do or how to react. I feel paralyzed.
1434,didn’t realize how bad my trauma was (19f),"tw: abuse, sexual assault, substance use

bit of a vent sesh as well, my apologies. there’s a lot going on in my head as i type this. 

a little context: i grew up in an abusive/neglectful home. father being the abuser, mother being the neglectful one. my father is now out of the picture (thank god) but i still live w my mom. i didn’t realize my home life wasn’t ideal until about 15. things my father should’ve gotten arrested for i thought everyone experienced until my friends at the time told me otherwise. my whole life i’ve made light of the situation, i’ve never really felt affected by my childhood, just thought it made me more independent, which is a valuable skill, so why be upset over something i’m not dealing with anymore and made me stronger?

because i was a kid. i didn’t need strength i needed safety. and i’ve only come to that realization recently. only over the past month or so has it set in what i’ve really experienced and how awful it was. and i draw connections from my problematic habits now (such as allowing myself to be used by men because i want to help them, or more generally putting people before myself to an extreme).

all the time i make jokes about daddy issues. it’s funny because i’m functional. i’ve been told i’m “doing surprisingly well” for someone who’s gone through what i have. and i’m inclined to agree. until i realize that, again, i’m not living as people are supposed to. it makes me furious my dad has this effect on my life. i don’t care about him, so why am i still hurting? but the same thing happens with my other forms of trauma as well.

i make jokes. i don’t even notice when it happens sometimes. watching people overdose, having someone try to kill you, rape, etc. are all trauma. all of these i’ve experienced. and i never think it’s a big deal til i’m pulling at my hair, sweating, sobbing, and punching my bed at 4 in the morning. that’s when i think i need therapy. til i stop about an hour or two later, go to bed, and forget about it. these episodes come about every couple days. sometimes they’re less severe (sudden tears and silent sobbing for a couple minutes, not feeling and wiping the tears away for a couple minutes, repeat for an hour). i don’t like that i don’t know my own emotions, and i don’t know how to handle them. my only coping mechanisms are unhealthy and self destructive, and that was with stuff that bothered me less than this. i’m a little scared i could do some real damage to myself if i let my emotions get the best of me and can’t find a healthy way to handle this on a daily basis.

tl;dr: grew up with and have experienced so much trauma it didn’t feel like trauma, now it’s hitting me sort of all at once. any advice as to how to manage these strong emotions w a 19 year delay would be appreciated."
1435,Anxiety/ panic attacks?,"A lot has been going on for me in the past month and I'm not sure what's causing these episodes.

I freaked and ran to my room to get my phone when I woke up on the floor with the same thing happening. Still freaking out I got up and went to my bed and passed out again! I got my phone and ran downstairs while Calli g for an ambulance. Roommates were downstairs so we went outside and I laid on the porch waiting. After the ambulance showed up I ended having another episode. The Dr did a cat scan on my head and chest as well as a blood test, urine test, and akg. Nothing. I've been to the er twice already because I've also been having these anxiety attacks when my heart would race to where it felt like it would jump out my chest. I've been getting palpitations. Slight pains in my left arm, upper middle abdomen, below my right rib cage, and also under my left shoulder blade. My left arm will also sometimes go numb with my hands and feet breaking out in cold sweat. All around a scary experience but idk what it is, I've tried meditation and stuff but nothing seems to help.

So to start everything off I'm just going to note down everything that I think could be the cause for these attacks.

About 2 months ago my house was broken into in the middle of the night while I was alone and it was a scare. After it happened I didn't think much of it but I've been extra paranoid and just stressed about it.

In the past couple months I've lost 60 lbs by starving myself and running 2 miles plus an hour of strength training for about 3-5 times a week. When I say I starved myself it was more like a meal or 2 a day consisting of like half a chicken breast and some veggies. Sometimes I'd eat a bit more and sometimes not at all. 

I recently lost my job and got convicted from my place all of a sudden because of something a friend of mine did that I encouraged. (Bad reviews and stuff) which caused me a lot of stress and anxiety. I've just been stuck in a cycle of depression. I'm currently trying to find another job and place while paying off bills and I have to be out by the 16th."

1440,I constantly feel worthless,"(I’m 19f) Like every single thought that runs through my head is like “am I good enough?” “Is she/he/they better than me?” “Am I untalented or talented?” “Am I pretty or ugly?” “Is my body ok or not ok?” “Why am I so untalented and not special?” “Why is everyone else so accomplished?” “Why don’t I have any motivation to do anything?” “why am I not good at anything” “why do I have no friends and why does no one like me?” 

This is constantly going through my head 24/7. I constantly look in the mirror because I’m scared I might be ugly and I have to constantly check. I have zero energy to do anything. I’m failing my summer classes. I don’t shower. I don’t clean my room. I just Mope Around all day and worry about my self. This makes it even worse. It makes me feel even more worthless. I have the lowest self esteem and I’m obsessed about what other people think of me. All day long I think about the guy I’m practically in love with who has a girlfriend and think about why he has her and not me and why she deserves to have him and why I don’t and then I just come to the conclusion that it’s because I’m just worthless. Because of my anxiety, insecurity, shyness, lack of motivation, etc. etc. this is why I don’t have the things I want. I did it to myself. I’m abnormal. My mom feeds this mindset and calls me names and makes it so much worse and just when I think I’m doing better she brings up my lack of social life and lack of everything for that matter and I spiral again.

How do I get out of this mindset? Please help me break it."
1441,"I hate that no matter how hard you work to get your mental health under control, mental illness doesn’t just go away. It’s a constant struggle.","It’s so cool that after 2 years of hard work in therapy and working on myself, I’ve been able to develop the tools I need to navigate everyday life. I don’t have anxiety anymore, I’m typically not depressed, and I’m doing such a good job navigating life. However, certain events in life set me off and I’m forced to face the reality that I do have a mental illness. 

Example: I got into an argument with my brother last weekend when I was visiting my parents. I erupted into a severe panic attack, my first one in ages, and I fell into a deep depression for days, and had an alcohol relapse. My parents had to come to my house and drag me out of bed. I was hysterical. I hadn’t cleaned my house in days. I hadn’t slept. Work was unbearable. I couldn’t focus on basic tasks. 

I’m so proud of all of the progress I’ve made and that I’ve learned to navigate every day life and get out of bed in the morning, which is something I struggled with for such a long time. I’ve come such a long way and that’s great, but it’s so scary when one seemingly minor event reminds me that I do have anxiety and depression. What hurts is that I manage it so well that I forget I have it. That’s what makes the episodes of strong uncontrollable emotion so hurtful to me. I never see it coming because I forget that part of me exists. 

Then, I inevitably have to spend a week or two focusing extra hard on mindfulness, exercise, checking in with my therapist, and managing my diet to make sure that I can recover properly. Because once I’m down, getting back up is work. I have intense flashbacks of whatever caused me stress, I don’t sleep well, and I can’t stop replaying the events in my head. 

Coming back is nice, but at the same time I hate the glaring reminder that navigating life is a bit tougher for me. I wish that weren’t the case. My family is always very concerned for me and I never understand why. But, the more i see my pattern develop, I understand why they worry. It’s because no matter how long I keep it together, they inevitably have to come scrape me off the floor at least twice a year. It sucks that I put that burden on my parents."
1442,"I'm living the worst moment of my entire life, and I still want to die","I feel like I have no right to complain or to be sad at all...

I made a mistake that changed everything, and I got hurt by others as well, which is fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or nervous, I get told that pretty much I don't have any right to complain, and that I should ignore what everyone else says and just focus on myself.

Four months of isolation thanks to the pandemic didn't help either.

I realized that I made a mistake by taking 100% of the blame... I have at most 50% of it, as they were people who hurt me when I didn't do anything to deserve it.

Aside from a few people, I'm alone, and when I say alone, I mean the type of crippling loneliness that burns you with frostbite from the inside.

I awake to an empty What's App most of the time, I deactivated my Facebook account because I was tired of being left in seen again and again, and I don't really use social media to talk to others anymore aside of Reddit.

These days I've been feeling terrible, I ended up shivering from an anxiety attack at Friday, I get cold feet a lot, sometimes my stomach hurts or I overeat to calm down, it takes me in between 30-60 minutes to get asleep, I can't focus to study or do homework properly now that I'm back in class and so on...

And if life is focused on ""utility"", rather than honor or respect... Then I ended up being a tool for many people, and once I fulfilled my purpouse, they discarded me.

I will have to do months or years of therapy, just to become somewhat functional... Only to ignore what everyone else says or thinks, and just focus 100% on myself, while waiting for some miracle to happen.

Some people are strong enough to live on their own, to not need friends and just be happy with themselves, which is perfectly fine. But I'm not one of those people, nor I could become like that even if I tried...

In a nutshell, people can hurt me, betray me, manipulate me, use me and then discard me, treat me like garbage or just with pure indifference, and that's perfectly fine.

But, when I start feeling depressed or bad, because it's just too much, I'm the one who's wrong, I'm the one who should ignore everyone else, be positive, accept my circumstances and keep shut about it.

I'm mostly alone and isolated, my support structure is very, very small, they'll probably give us more and more homework and group projects at online classes (which make me very nervous to think about)... I feel like I want to snap.

There's no mercy, forgiveness or compassion for me... Just indifference, pain and loneliness...

I don't know what else to do... If I don't make therapy work it'll be useless, my stomach can't handle most pills and so on...

I guess I wasn't meant to be happy... Once I messed everything up, I have to accept that I'll surely have a broken, lonely and empty future...

I feel like I will eventually end up taking my life, because I keep losing and losing, and life keeps telling that I have no right to complain, and that there's no turning back from the past...

I don't know how much I will be able to last like this, I don't want to hurt my family or remaining friends, but the pain keeps growing day after day..."
1443,do u ever feel things but you can’t really feel it,"Like I always know I feel something, but I just don’t do anything about it to actually feel it... idk if I don’t know how, or I don’t let myself, or I just can’t, but I can never cry when I know I need it or discuss with people in my life the hurt and I feel like I have this pit in my stomach and I want so bad to just scream and cry and let things out bc theres a lot going on in my life that I won’t go into that I feel like I never deal with. I’ve had issues with self harm and I’ve been clean for a few months, it could be part of the issue. I used to just cut when I needed to feel it but I can’t now because I’m being watched closely. Idk, idk if anyone will see this and I’ll probably regret it in the morning lol"
1444,A hard take on hospitalization...,"So, it feels that, at this point in time, society is pretty anti-psychiatry. I think a lot of people resent it and feel that it caused a lot of stress and anxiety for them. It as well for me caused me quite a bit of trauma and I do think a lot of the staff are unqualified and dehumanizing, if not downright dangerous. But I guess I was thankful to be taken out of society for awhile, and plopped into a little microcosm of life without work or internet.

The first thing you’ll notice is how boys and men act without access to porn. They are so much nicer and easier to relate to. I appreciate them more. As a radical feminist, I find them easier to deal with and more palatable and I actually feel that I can relate to them on some level.

It’s just nice not having anything to worry about... no phone to check, no email. Just left alone with your thoughts for hours on end. And that sounds horrible, but actually it gave me a massive advantage because I would just sit and think and think. And they can’t keep you there FOREVER. Maybe like one or two weeks at a time? It’s a time out.

I don’t know... I think a lot of people thought that were disheartening me or hampering me from getting where I need to be, but I used that time to my advantage.

And to wrap this up, I guess I’d say, if you end up in a hospital, just embrace it. Don’t end up there again. But, yeah, just talk to people and learn as much as you can. You’ll find all sorts of oddballs and miscreants in there with their two cents on reality. Things aren’t always as clear cut as they seem..."
1445,Out of nowhere graphic thoughts that i cannot control.,"The last couple of weeks it feels like my brain started working completely differently. I imagine these very graphic or eery scenes in my head and i can't control it, it also happens when im awake and i feel like it has a connection to my already bad nightmares. Good example i can give is recently i started thinking about my stepdad decomposing in his grave 3 years after his death, and im very much a visual thinker and imagine things fast, but i do it so involuntarily that its really becoming hard, it feels like i just want to filter my whole brain. Does anyone else have this problem or at least know what this could be?

A small edit: watching horror movies or anything that can have something ""shocking"" happen in them easily triggers these thoughts. I love horror films, they never triggered me. I dont know what to do."
1446,Happiest Memories and Gratitude,"I’m working on expressing gratitude. This is something that I have struggled with since forever. My brain pretty much focuses on what we did wrong/don’t have/could’ve done, etc. Anyway, I was given the prompt “What is your happiest memory?” And for the life of me cannot think of one. I’ve been doing a lot of trauma work as well recently so those memories are at the forefront at the moment. I guess I just want to know if anyone has any advice or tips on how to express gratitude and how I can work those “happy memories” up to the surface."
1447,Think I might have CPTSD. How would I go about getting a diagnosis?,"Warning: some talk of self harm, drug use, abuse, and suicide.


I'm really not quick to say that I think I have a particular mental health diagnosis because I know I'm not qualified to diagnose myself. There have been times where I've felt extreme depression on a daily basis for months on end, the same with social anxiety and depersonalization, but I'll always rationalise it as possibly just being a chemical imbalance or something like that as opposed to jumping at the gun and saying ""I have depression/anxiety etc.."".

That being said, I strongly identify with a lot of the things that I've read about CPTSD.

I'm still completely open to the fact that I might not have it, and I'd never self-diagnose myself with any medical condition, but I'd really like to seek some help to deal with some trauma that I experienced 8 years ago when I was 14 years old, through to the age of 16. I might end up with a diagnosis, but I'm totally aware that I might not. Like I said I wouldn't want to jump the gun on something so serious.

I was in an abusive relationship for a couple years. Mostly psychological/emotional but often times physical too. No matter how much my ex would break me down, I stayed with her for a couple years beyond the point where I was broken. I hate to sound whiney and dramatic but I guess that's one of the risks you need to take when it comes to being open about that kinda thing.

I'll spare most of the details of exactly what happened for now unless someone asks me to explain what happened further. I wouldn't exactly have a problem talking about it but this post is more to do with finding help for the way the trauma of the past still affects me.

During the relationship I was self harming quite often due to how abusive the girl was. I didn't admit to her or anyone else that the way she was treating me was leading me to self harm, but she would tell me I'll never be a man for self harming, and she'd always scream at me for it and talk about how awful it was for her to be with someone that isn't man enough to deal with his problems. She'd call me pathetic on an almost daily basis for telling her I love her and for being sensitive at times, and she'd threaten to leave me all the time - telling me she's gonna go and fuck my friends. She actually cheated on me with about 5 or 6 of the people I was really close to at the time and not a single friend stood by me by the end of the relationship. I was madly in love so I'd never argue back and I never once thought about leaving her for the almost two years that she was abusive towards me.

After the break up at the age of 15/16 I was still self harming on and off until I was 17/18, although I was using drugs as a form of self harm on some level for years after I'd stopped cutting. I put myself in the hospital twice with overdoses, and almost never made it back home the second time. I basically went on a self sabotage spree which I'm still trying to get past.

I went through a complete personality change and it didn't take long until I was addicted to drugs, which is something I only managed to put to an end last month. I was smoking weed on a daily basis from 15/16 until last month but I was addicted to uppers from 15 til 17, and then I put down the uppers and discovered downers when I was 16/17. The ones that really got me were stuff like valium and gabapentin, but the main ones were opiates such as dihydrocodeine, tramadol and morphine. This got seriously out of hand until I was taking 35+ pills in 24 hours, weighed only 87lbs and had sold most of my belongings. I'd disassociate myself whenever I was with people and this is something I still do to this day, although it can be pretty difficult to recognise it at this point.

I'd been feeling extreme anxiety and depression from the age of 14 which the uppers and weed made even worse over time, so the opiates took all of that away for me and helped me to be around people instead of completely avoiding everyone and staying in my room the majority of the time. I finally stopped taking drugs about 40 days ago, but I've been drinking in my room for the last 30 days cause I'm still used to the crutch which helps me to function a bit better. Especially whenever I'm around people. I don't even like drinking but I suppose it makes me feel a little more comfortable within myself.

I've hardly scratched the surface here, but basically the abuse changed me in a huge way and turned me completely neurotic. I'm not as weak as I was before but I still see how much the past has had an effect on the way that I am to this day. I feel like a 14 year old child trapped in a 22 year olds body. My self esteem is still extremely low when I'm around people and I'm constantly caught up in my thoughts.

I still struggle to actually look at myself as a man and I've never had a job which doesn't help. I've been riddled with anxiety and I've just repressed all of the things I should've dealt with a long time ago. I just stopped functioning at the age of 14/15 and I've felt totally immobilised ever since.



I'm wondering how to go about getting some help for the trauma from my past. I wouldn't wanna just show up to a therapist and ask for help with what I think might be some form of traumatic stress disorder, but I really do think it's highly possible that that's what I'm dealing with.

It didn't hit me until last week or something like that cause I'd spent so long repressing how I felt and just tried to carry on without sinking too deep into it all. That being said I should've dealt with my issues a long time ago and I think I would've ended up being able to move on a bit more by now. I'm not hung up on the relationship from my past, but I definitely see how the trauma still affects me to this day.

Would it be best keeping my cards close to my chest when I seek therapy, or should I tell them I'm thinking I might have CPTSD? I really do identify with so many of the things I've read about it, but I want them to take me seriously and I'm worried that they'd think I've pretty much made my mind up already rather than having an open mind about it. Dunno if I'm looking into it too much hahah!

Cheers in advance for any input folks :)"
1448,Struggling to meet new people because depression,"Hi all,
 This is my first post ever on reddit, and I was hesitating to make this since a long time ago.
A few weeks ago I broke up with my 5 years girlfriend and I fell into depression, I had a suicidal attempt, fortunately nothing happened but then I realized how much lonely I am and how hard it is to get better when you don't have a strong network of support.
 I  always have been a very shy person and it's very difficult for me to meet new people, but I believe posting this will be a good start.
So it would be great if you could give me a chance to talk about anything, I believe it would be very helpful meeting new people to pass this hard phase."
1449,Stoned and alone.,"I've been so sad lately. I'm basically down to one friend and I feel like I can't talk to them about anything. I'm feeling like I have no outlet anymore, anyone want to lend an ear?"
1450,Depression and disassociation,"I’ve lived with social anxiety and major depressive disorder my entire life. And only now have I been able to get a hold of my life. The problem is, or my question is, is disassociation a part of depression? I’ve created this world in my mind that I have lived in for years. It’s fake and I know it’s fake but I love it there and I wish it were real sometimes. It has honestly kept me alive during some of my worst depressive episodes. And these imaginary friends I created in this world have been the only ones I could ever be true with. for awhile I was able to escape this world and live in reality, but sometimes it keeps coming back to me. A lot of the times I don’t even mean to go into this world, I just space out and poof I’m there. My body goes numb, limp, I’m just not physically there. 
I don’t get what this is?
Is this normal? Is this just a symptom of depression?"
1451,i’m not sure what’s wrong with me?,"i hope i’m on the right sub. i’ve been thinking that i may have some type of anxiety or ocd but i’m not sure.it’s hard for me to explain my thoughts/behaviors. they might seem kinda small or weird but it’s just little things. like currently, i’m extremely upset because i need to go to the post office to mail something asap, and i’m not sure whether my dad will let me go tomorrow. it’s hard to think of any good examples right now but like if i’m almost out of a product such as sunscreen, a skincare product, etc i usually have my mom drop everything to take me to the store to buy more immediately because my brain starts going oh no what if you run out, what are you gonna do then, your life will be over. i swear i’m not being materialistic or bratty, i just NEED everything to go the way i plan it in my head or else i get really sad and unable to focus on anything else. everything needs to be running perfectly at all times. 

i also get stressed or upset over things like if all my friends aren’t talking i start thinking about what if the friend group falls apart, literally if we don’t talk for like a couple days. if i feel like my mom is mad at me because i didn’t do chores, or spent too much money on something i get upset because i need her to not be mad at me. i’m also constantly checking on my dad and if he’s mad i get mad and sometimes start crying (i had an extremely rough childhood with my dad and am emotionally scarred from him so it could be tied to that but i just get anxious when his mood is off). and when i say i get upset, it’s not normal type of upset. it’s like crippling. i’ll sit on my bed or pace around, not able to do anything else and sometimes even start crying until the “problem” is solved. i think i just can’t stand uncertainty. i need to know if and when something will happen, how it will happen, etc. 

i also talk to myself constantly. literally 24/7 and i look crazy. it’s like i’m having a conversation with a person that i know, currently or from my past. any random person who i’m thinking of subconsciously and i’m making up scenarios and taking to them like they’re actually in front of me. 

i’m extremely self doubting. even if i know something already or have read it multiple times, i’ll get really nervous and be like what if thats wrong, what if i wasn’t paying attention and read it wrong, what if i’m doing it wrong, etc 

i want to die 24/7. anytime there’s a small problem or inconvenience my mind immediately goes to suicide or just dying. like in movies where there’s a huge problem i don’t understand why the person doesn’t just kill themselves if it’s that bad. i’ll never understand how someone can be happy to be alive. 

i’m so sensitive to everything. once in school, i was playing around and hitting my friend and she yelled at me (she wasn’t seriously mad) and i literally just started crying in the middle of math class 

i also have dermatophagia which is an obsessive compulsive RELATED condition where the person bites and peels the skin from their fingers, cheeks, lips etc until it bleeds and you just can’t stop. it gets a lot worse when i’m stressed about something. my fingers are completely shredded and i’m so insecure i can’t even write in school if someone’s sitting next to me. the inside of my cheeks are so destroyed that it physically hurts to eat spicy food 

i’ve also suspected before that i had a mild case of tourette’s because i have random fits where i touch my face again and again, or sometimes i’ll jerk/move my neck in a certain direction repeatedly. if i itch myself i stroke that area with my hand 15-20 times afterward. if i touch something i have to touch it with my other hand. i also constantly do these strange movements with my nose, kinda like twitching but it’s more like scrunching my nose up and stretching it downwards. it used to be worse, like i would develop fine lines from doing it so much. i might be overreacting but i know tourette’s can be genetic, and my sister used to have all the symptoms when she was younger and still has some of them. 

i know this is long and might not make sense, and i’m not asking for a diagnosis, but literally any advice or input is welcome. if something isn’t making sense or theres any questions i’d be glad to elaborate. and once again, so sorry if i’m in the wrong sub. basically, does it sound like something’s wrong, or am i just weird because at times i really don’t feel normal."
1452,"I feel pathetic that I’m not achieving my goals, but I’m too scared to try. Suffering from loss of identity and not knowing how to feel better.","Hi all,

I’m near the end of high school in Australia and I’m finding myself in a difficult place. Until a year ago, I was doing very well in school and I expected to do very well last year and this year, but I didn’t. The problems I’ve faced include:
- Perfectionism resulting in procrastination due to inability for every assignment to be perfect
- Executive dysfunction (this has always been a problem but I’ve reached the point where the work is difficult enough that this impacts my grades)
- Emotionally abusive household
- Burnout

I try my hardest despite these but I’ve repeatedly failed and others have berated me for it, making me feel I don’t deserve to exist. But not only am I scared of failure, I’m also scared of success. I don’t like being praised or otherwise knowing that I’m doing well from others (grades, money, etc.) because it makes me feel like I’m being moulded and manipulated into what someone else wants me to be - not *who I am.*

I don’t want to be a drone, but I don’t to be a failure. I don’t want to freeload, but I don’t want to work. I don’t want to be pathetic, but I don’t want to be successful. I don’t want to be traumatised, but I don’t want to heal because I don’t know what I feel and think besides all of the negative thoughts.

But, I don’t know what I *do* want, either. I’ve recently come to the realisation that all my dreams and aspirations are really just my interpretation of what I think others expect of me and I never really wanted to do any of it. Still, I don’t have something I want to do besides all this. I’m not even one of those kids who has the wild daydream fantasy of playing video games for a living - I can’t imagine a single thing that I *want* to do.

About the only thing I think I want is to move out of home to escape my condescending parents, and that’s about it. I have no additional plans besides working a job that I haven’t decided on and finding a close friend to heal with.

**How do I learn to look inwards and discover who I am; who I want to be; what my identity is?** I don’t know who I am and I don’t know who I want to be. I can’t even describe or know my interests, my goals (besides that immediate one), my personality, or even my *gender* and I don’t know how I will discover them. All I see when I look inwards is a pathetic, hurt wreck, but I know that that’s not me - that’s my trauma.

Also, **how can I decide that success is a good thing and get over my fear of it, including my fear of being successful at healing?** Yes I am scared of success, but I know that I’ll be happier once I’m not because if I aspire to be successful, I’ll have more money or more spare time or more happiness or whatever it is that I discover that I want. I’m even scared of being successful at overcoming my trauma, and the dilemma between healing and not healing has kept me awake at night.

I just want the pain to be over. I didn’t ask for any of this."
1453,I would like to be a bacteria,"should I be ashamed or something?my room is such a mess,I didn't change my bed clothes,I didn't tidy up my room,I didn't brush my teeth 🗿 What can I do If I don't really want to do all this stuff..........Don't judge me.

1454,not finding things I used to like fun anymore unless with another person,"I know this is most likely normal and nothing’s wrong but this has been a bother for a while now and it wasn’t always like this, I don’t think... 

Basically to explain a bit better of the title, I used to play video game’s a lot and could play by myself and have fun. Since quarantine started I lost interest in playing games and only had fun when playing with my brother. He has since moved out and I no longer have much fun playing video games. I play sometimes with friends but once they leave I can’t play games on my
own I just feel empty.

More information about me that maybe could help explain. (for a few year’s now i’ve been like this) I’m quick to anger, dwell a lot on the past, have difficulty doing things in public unless I know people who are there (feel awkward to go to a shop without a friend) I think a bit too much, I don’t like to show people my sadness, I think I’m manipulative and really don’t want to be, no one really knows me as I don’t let people see the true me, even when i’m sad I can make people laugh and smile on with my day.

oh also a fun little thing that happened recently was my dog died :( this hasn’t added any of these emotions just a bit more crying. i really don’t know why i said a fun little thing i just do when i’m talking about something sad.

(my relationship with my family is not the best though) And I find it difficult to trust people after a 5 year long abusive relationship with constant cheating and lies.

Things started to look up when I got into university and received an offer for a PhD position and I got my own place and I met someone who I thought was the love of my life. And now everything has started to fall apart.

In the space of a few months my health started to deteriorate, covid happened and I caught it and was even more sick for ages, my mum has been horrible to me, I feel like I'm letting my dad down because I physically cannot continue with a job he got me (due to health issues), my partner told me he never cared for me to begin with and made me feel like the worst person alive but I still love him more than I can describe (we are sort of seeing each other again but in an ""it's complicated"" way), I can't sleep for multiple days at a time, my relationship with my friends are deteriorating, it feels like the community I'm in and am most comfortable around no longer want me there, and I have no one to talk to anymore. 

I just feel so alone. I feel like I'm not good enough for anything and I can't seem to do anything right. I feel like no one can stand to be around me for longer than a couple of hours. I just want to lock myself away and never have to see another person again. I'm so self conscious I cant even go to the shop without a full face of makeup because I just feel so ugly and horrible.

I'm sorry if this was a long post or it's not allowed on here. I just needed to get this off my chest."

1459,If you could help,I stumbled upon this video from another reddit post thanks to u/tastelessryan and I watched it. He is a man in his 50s and has been dealing with MDD. He has tried different institutions and medicine which didn't seem to help him. From what I can say he most probably lives alone. In the video he is clearly In so much pain and admits that he is very nervous about making the video but is toll going with it which I think is very brave. His voice almost starts shaking in the end like he is going to have a breakdown or cry. I don't have any knowledge on how I could help him medically. If you could please give him your tips or suggestion as all I can give him is my support. Here [is the video](https://youtu.be/Das1onKAa3g) . Please guys spare some time and watch the short video 🙏🙏🙏.
1460,Anyone else feel debilitating regret over stupid things?,"Long story short I looked ugly at my wedding. It was mainly my hair but there were a lot of other issues. This was 3 years ago and I’m embarrassed to admit that it still haunts me. I’m ashamed to be ashamed of it. I’m ashamed I care and I’m ashamed it’s ruined so many otherwise great moments. I know logically it DOES NOT MATTER. It is superficial and dumb. I love my husband and I’m grateful for so many things in my life. I’ve been diagnosed with OCD before and I know this obsession is part of it. I’ve been to many, many therapy sessions. Yet, here I am. Anyone else have stupid shit they have struggled to let go of?? Any tips for moving on and focusing on what actually matters?"
1461,Everything is good. . .,"23 (M) with two kids. So I went to a therapist because I've been having these weird rushes of emotion that, to me, were new. I'm pretty sure it's just empathy or something nothing crazy but I've been trying to get healthy this year (Dropped 20 pounds and quit my video game addiction) so I wanted to do a check on mental health. 

Now my therapist is questionable, she doesn't actually seem like she wants to talk about anything, to give an example I tried to talk about my relationship with my mom and how my fear about her dying unhappy was something that bothered me. Her response was that my mom's happiness was out of my control and that all I could do is say what I had to say. I mean she's not wrong but the common theme seems to be that she acknowledges the fact that I have an issue and gives me a solution but doesn't give the road to that solution or at least help me find it. 

I mentioned abuse I had as a child, she didn't ask me anything about that, kinda just glossed that one over. I also talked about an event that literally mentally broke me and had me stuck in my house for 3 years and I'm pretty sure I have a PTSD like problems from it and she basically just shot that down after asking me two questions about the event and saying I've already processed everything and because it doesn't Majorly affect my life NOW that it's all in the past. Which could be valid but one question she didn't ask me was if I was put into a similar situation or in the vicinity of certain characters would it negatively affect me and the answer is hell yes it would. I'd have a panic attack or my fight or flight would instantly kick in even if I wasn't in danger. Also I feel like any event that makes someone so scared to go outside that they don't leave their house for three years and drop out of highschool may have some lasting affects. . you know? 

All of this in two sessions and I didn't just dump all of this on her. It was half way through the second session that she basically said that I didn't need any more help and that's when I started talking about my past (we only discussed current events until that point).  Also something to note is she's paid by my job, so not out of my pocket. I basically was distracted for two days because I was trying to accept what she told me but it was hard because it FEELS so untrue. My girlfriend also started therapy and she had a way difference experience than me, lol seems like her therapist wanted to do her job."
1462,I can’t feel empathy or happiness for my friends anymore,"(TW) Long story short, I’ve had a lot of trauma happen between the ages of 12-18 that I’ve never dealt with. I’m 22 now and at the lowest I’ve been since my first attempt when I was 14. I live alone and think about overdosing at least 3 times a week. The only reason I haven’t is because my hamster relies on me and I don’t want to inconvenience anyone I work with (which I guess sounds stupid but whatever). 

The past few months I’ve felt my self-esteem hit absolute rock-bottom. I’ve always thought I was fat and ugly and had too many mental health issues to ever feel good about myself but recently I was also diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder that’s caused me to lose a lot of hair. Because of this, I feel worse than ever and find myself constantly comparing myself to my friends (which I know is just me projecting and a reflection of myself and NOT THEM). But it’s gotten so bad that I can’t feel happy for them or feel empathy and it’s getting out of control. I feel like the smallest things set me off and I just don’t know what to do anymore."

1464,My first time at the mental hospital/ my experience,"Why I went.....

So last week Wednesday I was extremely overwhelmed and impulsively decided that I wanted to commit suicide. I took 3 bottles of my prescription meds consisting with about 40-50 pills. 

Going to the ER.....

After a few hours my heart rate went over the roof! It was beating out of my chest! I was so dizzy and nauseous. I couldn't walk without falling because my vision was wierd. Then for some (I'm not sure if I regret this) reason I re-thought my decision and told my therapist what I did. She then called my mom who took me to the ER.

At the ER.......

At the ER they took my phone and I was on suicide watch. They administered something through IV and hooked me up to a bunch of monitors. They did and EKG and the results were all fucked up, my heart was suuuuper fast and very abnormal. After 5-6 hours of monitoring another EKG rone showed that my heart was improving so they took me on an ambulance to the mental hospital.

1st time at the mental hospital...

I had to go through alot of questioning and this was hard as I was falling in and out of sleep because of side effects. They then did a skin assessment were I was only in underwear and they checked my body. After that they gave me scrubs (I didnt have clothes yet) and we proceeded with moving into my room etc...

The other patients there....

(10/10)I LOVE THE OTHER GIRLS THERE!!! my first night I was bawling my eyes out and they all comforted me! I felt so close to them because of we related and how genuine they were. These girls are honestly better than my real ""friends"".

The staff....

Techs=some were nice, others were bitches(7/10)
Nurses=I hated all of them, they were only there for money(0/10)
Therepists= meh.(9/10)
Doctor=loved her (8/10)

Things i didnt expect...

SO MANY DAMN RESTRICTIONS AND RULES!!
Crappy soap and shampoo because of restricted ingredients. Terrible toothbrushes. Bathrooms had no doors but the curtains could've atleast closed properly. Mean ass nurses. Nasty technitions. Staff didnt really care. Girls cant share info(we did anyway).
Wake up at 7, sleep at 9. Hospital socks. Fake grass and a lot more!

Thank you for listening to my Ted talk&lt;3"

1466,Why am I afraid of getting my hair cut?,I have a fear of getting my haircut professionally I always feel awkward. So I just got done cutting my own hair and it looks like shit. I'm too depressed and in a bad state to fix it so sometimes I just leave it like that for months because I simply don't care enough or have enough energy to fix it. I have severe social anxiety and I guess it's a good thing I don't care about perfection because having fucked up shitily cut hair doesn't bother me that much. I don't know why I do this since I worry about my appearance so much.
1467,Trusting my boyfriend with my mental health,"I started dating my boyfriend for 4 months and he still doesn't know a lot about my mental health. He has seen me cry randomly a few times and knows a bit about how I feel and think. However, I'm having trouble being vulnerable to him and accepting that he is one of my support systems. When I'm with him and I'm sad, he will comfort me and talk it out but when he's not there, I don't tell him anything. He has his own life and I feel like I don't want to interrupt his day by letting him know about what I'm going through. I know he loves me and will be there for me but I don't want to be a burden on him. I'm scared he'll leave me because I'm 'too much' or 'too depressed'. While I only have depression, I dated someone with bpd and I know how it feels to have a partner that is a lot."

People talk about ASD like it only affects children or can only be discovered in children."

1471,My 50 year old uncle has down-syndrome and has been going through some really troubling issues that are very uncharacteristic and incredibly concerning. Please help me.,"(First paragraph is context) My Uncle David was not supposed to live past his 5th birthday and has proved that wrong by being a beautiful and amazing influence in my family's life for over 50 years. He was born to my grandmother, his birth father left before the end of the pregnancy and his entire side of the family wanted nothing to do with my grandmother and her downs child. He has obviously created a lot of issues and obstacles in her life but she eventually found a man that would accept David for who he is rather than what he has. I digress, David has like I said; created a lot of obstacles but was a loving big brother to his siblings including my mother; along with all of his nieces and nephews. This stands out to me more than most because I grew up with him being around and being the first grandchild I was given a lot more attention by the family than the predecessors. I live him almost as much as he loves me and that is why I feel obligated to help as much as possible even if I can't schedule doctor's appointments. 

Roughly 2 years ago, David moved out of my grandparent house and began living with my mother. Things were normal as they could be and everything seemed well. My grandfather has taken a job 2 hours away and they could not take David with them, my mother volunteered to take care of her big brother while they were away. 

My grandparents returned home after my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through all the treatment and she is now a survivor and cancer free. They performed multiple surgeries and she was bandaged and bedded at home for some time. Everyone decided that David needed to stay at my mom's house longer until my grandmother fully recovered due to David being very sensitive when he is aware that his family members are ""hurt"" or ""sick."" He usually becomes overwhelmingly concerned and upset especially when his mother is sick; so it is safe to say that was a good call.

The issues began maybe 3 months ago. My mother ran into a mouse problem in her house while David was staying there. They mice were quickly exterminated and it was not an issue. I moved out of my mother's house as did my step-brother. Maybe a week before I left, David began having sleeping issues. He would stay awake all night even without any distractions. He would lay or sit in his bed throughout the night and then get up when everyone finally awoke for the morning. He would then be very drowsy and tired throughout the day and even falling asleep at dinner and outside. He would get maybe 2 hours of sleep throughout the day with 20 minute intervals of dozing off. 

This seems all quite standard, he just has sleeping issues. This is were things get disturbing, David began talking about seeing mice. He would describe them like a six year old would describe a nightmare about rats. He says they have bitten him, hit him, squeaked at him, and just generally distracted him from sleeping. This was assumed to be an excuse for him not sleeping as he often makes immature excused for a lot of his behavior. However after some time we all realized that his in genuinely seeing mice and he isn't lying about it. He would point in a dark corner and say ""there's a mouse"" after investigating and discovering there is no mouse he would accept is and laugh. 

We cleaned out his entire bedroom, moved furniture and moved him into a different room, to no avail. David would talk about seeing a mouse or some mice in various locations where he sleeps. He was scared of them and David is very hard to scare. He loves horror and is never scared by anything other than real danger. His voice shakes and he tries his best to explain his terror. 

Everyone decided it was time for him to come home, he needed to be back in his parents house and maybe he would be able to sleep and stop seeing mice. I have been staying with them and helping keep an eye on him. Everything seemed fine for maybe a week. He went to the doctor, they gave him some sleeping medicine and he slept well for maybe 5 nights. Now, he is back to being unable to sleep, he takes his pills and he still just sits and lays there. He whispers to me and says, ""there's a mouse under the bed."" I tell him there is no mouse, I look under the bed I confirm there is no mouse and he is alright, an hour later he is back at it. Yesterday, he came outside where I was swimming and brings me his shoe and says there is a mouse inside of it. I turn it over, sake it, put my hand inside, beat it on the wall, and say ""no mouse in here."" He accepted it and walked off with a smile. Maybe 10 minutes later, I see him investigating the shoe, looking down the sole, shaking ti, beating it out, doing everything I did except putting his hand inside. He was handling the shoe in a way you would expect someone to handle a shoe if there was a mouse inside, expecting it to fall out. 

Me and my family are at a dead confusion, my grandparents are little help as there are old and tend to have the ""shake it off"" mentality. With Covid, it is hard to get an appointment. I have thought of ideas including buying snake food mice and killing them in front of him to maybe shake this. We thought that bringing him home would take care of it. He is getting drained by this endevour and it is making him incredibly depressed. 

I need help, please."
1472,My brain is very strange,"Hi there, uhm i think i am bipolar and i have a pretty bad mental health?I am 18 and 3 years ago i got my last girlfriend, i cried and i was sad until this spring and now i was finally prepared to get a girlfriend, done, here i am, i love her so much but then bam, you click your fingers and i am so unclear of me, i just turn sad and that love from me dissapears i just regret it, thinking about that and why the f**k my brain does this just makes me love her again, those are very rare, i have many mood swings, i am sad most of the time and when i am happy i enjoy the moment the fullest because i know the sad mood will comeback very very very soon, those don't bother me much, i am in a neutral happy state most of the time but in some days, i just feel sad or neutral, i don't have many friends but sadly all of them are telling me that in am a good friend but all of them left me, i don't know what this possibly be...anyways, i need some advice/support cuz i don't think this is normal"
1473,what to do when it gets bad again,"
I’m bipolar type 2 and I have PTSD from sexual assault. I’ve been on lithium and seroquel for almost six months now.l with consistent therapy. I had a really bad episode in March of this year where I attempted suicide and had to go to the hospital. I haven’t been that low for awhile until this last week. 

I’m feeling so helpless again. I feel sick because I feel everything coming back. I found my suicide letters from the last attempt and I don’t want to have to rewrite them but there’s this overwhelming feeling that it’s inevitable. I don’t want to kill myself, I just don’t want to be here anymore. 

I don’t have anyone I can confide in, my parents say they’ll help but the moment I start getting bad again they ignore it. My friends have their own issues to deal with and I can’t scare them like that again. I don’t know what to do"
1474,Thank you strangers on the internet that go out of their way to help other strangers.,"It’s nearing midnight and I can’t sleep because I’m struggling to get my thoughts and anxiety in check. Even though I haven’t interacted with this community before, just being able to read the supportive comments and the kind interactions between complete strangers makes me cry. I’ve been feeling lonely for a while now and this pandemic situation plus the nighttime just makes everything worse but I find comfort here. 

I’ve been struggling with getting over mistakes I did in the past, been thinking about my mortality a lot, and I just overall feel that I’m inside a dream of sorts. Relationships have wilted and I don’t talk to many people anymore. To be honest I’ve never had any best friend or any relationship that felt deep enough. I struggle to find help and the one time I tried to tell someone about this, they just called it lame. Well, either way I really thank y’all for listening to others and helping them in any way, shape or form, no matter how big or small. Thanks!"
1475,Scared about my diagnosis,"I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, general anxiety, and society anxiety two years ago and I haven't had a new diagnosis since. However, I found that my mental health has been getting worse and it's affecting my relationship with the people around me. Aside from the random crying, body dysmorphia thinking, anxiety, and sensitive moods, my biggest problem is feeling like I have no purpose or not sure what I'm suppose to do. 

While Covid has affected everyone, I believe it allowed me to deal with my mental health without any distractions like school, work, or friends. By allowing myself to face what's going on, I'm getting scared about what I'm facing. I don't understand why I cry randomly all the time even if everything is fine and i'm having fun. I truly don't get why I would feel like the world is ending and I need to do something drastic to 'get back at people'. When i'm feeling sensitive and an issue comes up, I would feel the feelings a lot despite knowing i'm being sensitive and illogical for being upset. Last week, I almost broke off my friendship with my best friend of 10 years because I didn't feel 'right' with her and same with my boyfriend. Sometimes I just want to be alone and disappear and after crying for 10 minutes, I feel like everything is normal again and I'm fine and not mentally ill. I don't know what I have and I'm scared to find out."
1476,(15M) Been lonely and sad,"It’s always hard for me in the summer because I never get close to anyone or get any messages from friends and it makes me feel like no one will actually ever like me except my family and it’s just because they have to. I pretend to like the things other kids like and talk like them and pretend to like the things they do. I do this so im not left completely alone. Im never myself and I feel like if people knew Im kinda a nerd and I feel happy when I do good in school and I love anime and manga and seeing people smile and thank me after I help them. It’s been like this for years but in gradeschool I had a friend who was like me and he got me through those difficult years where people made fun of us. But now we barely talk and went to different high schools. He was my safety net, I could be myself and everyone would hate me but I would always have him and the safety net below that was my family but now without him I just feel like im close to the bottom in the family net just existing. I started to think earlier “what if this is it” what if it’s just me and I’ll never meet anyone like me. What if im doomed to be alone and only liked by people who don’t know the real me and people who have to say they like me. That thought made me cry. Maybe it’s just summer or quarantine getting to me but I feel like im just existing. Im gonna make an effort to make friends I care about and who care about me. It’s the same situation with girls, I just feel like im changing myself to what they want and making myself miserable, I haven’t liked a girlfriend I’ve had since I was a 6th - 8th grader. Anyway thanks for reading I feel a little better just writing this out and maybe I’ll feel good when I transfer schools and have a new set of people. I don’t want to be alone in this world"

1478,I have no idea what happened,"About halfway through May this year, I saw a demon.  It was during a live mass on a Sunday (i’m catholic).  I know it didn’t actually happen, but it felt real, and it was terrifying.  During that, I felt a brief urge to attack everyone else in the room (my immediate family), but I didn’t do anything but sit mostly quietly.  During that whole thing, there was some part of me that knew that it was all in my head, but a totally different part of my mind was begging for mercy simultaneously.  I am a 15 year old autistic female.  I never used drugs before, so I know that can’t be the cause of it.  This whole situation still confuses me.  Also, lately I’ve felt on edge, because it feels like something else is coming soon.  Regular life also just feels a bit duller (maybe it’s just the whole quarantine thing, but who knows?).  Maybe its because i saw part of a nother world and this isnt enough anymore?  Idk.  Nothing makes sense.  Sorry for the crappy writing.  English is my first and so far only language, but I’m not much of a talker and i never was.  Honestly I don’t expect anyone to see this post, and I guess i hope it stays hidden because i have no idea how i would answer any questions people ask.  Likw i said, i was never talkative.  Sometimes i imagine myself with one single wing like an angel (on my right side). Don’t get me wrong though, i don’t think im a good person by any stretch of the word.  I know i am cruel and sometimes manipulative, but that part of me always takes over.  Theres something about fire that draws me to it.  I was sitting around a fire pit a few days ago, and i couldn’t stop myself from inching closer.  The heat didnt matter, the fire was calling me closer.  I almost wanted to feel my skin melt.  Not really though, but sort of.  Sometimes i think mushrooms are growing under my skin on my arms.  It itches and i think it will burst out of me like one of those insect killing mushrooms you see in nature documentaries.  I feel scared a lot of the time.  Maybe scared isnt the right word.  Anxious maybe?  Nervous, tingling, terrified calm fear of something that is nothing and nowhere.  When i try to type that out, it feels like english is my second language, and untranslatable wtf brain stuff is my first.  Something I say a lot in my mind is “Death to [my real name]”.  I imagine it like how a bigot would say “Death to [insert marginalized group here]”, with all the hate attached.  I have no idea why I do that.  I don’t think of my self as marginalized.  I imagine myself saying it as directed at myself, telling myself i should die.  I am not suicidal, but I still say it in my head.  It’s getting late, or early I guess (1:00 am), so good night/morning i guess.  I hope nobody finds this.  If youre reading this, you probably think ive fuckin lost it.  Honestly, im just talking.  If this gets removed for being not serious, that’s perfectly fine, i can take my mindless screaming elsewhere.  Some part of me wants help though.  Sorry this is so long, i just cant stop typing.  I feel like i have so much to say, even though its all pointless and stupid and maybe fake or real fake its fake.  Yeah im too tired to post on reddit.  Cant wait to come to my senses later this morning and regret everything.  Actual good night! (Or morning or maybe afternoon, depending where you are).  Bye!"
1479,Why do I feel detached from almost everything going on?,"I’m not depressed. I just realized I actually have not been living in the moment in the past 2 years.

I just can’t get myself to feel the same emotions I ever felt."
1480,im wasting my life on shows and sweets. any advice is greatly appreciated.,"hellos!

**Here's the back story:**

Whenever I need to do my homework  (or other things I value as important such as prayer as I'm religious), the first thing I want to do is watch youtube or sitcoms and once I start, I can't stop. Also, whenever I watch shows I feel the need to binge eat sweets and I can eat several hundred grams worth of sugar in one sitting until I feel sick but I just feel like continuing anyway because it feels satisfying.

I also have a habit of eating meals and watching shows (and once I start I cannot stop) because I have nothing else to do and no one to talk to while I'm eating. I just feel really lonely and bored all day

I feel really empty whenever I don't watch shows and it seems to be the only thing that can make me  feel a little better about myself. I don't have any close friends who I see on a regular basis and my relationship with my family is not really good so I feel really lonely a lot of times. Also I'm not coping with my studies because I'm so behind I don't know where to start.

Right now shows are the only thing that can make me feel a little happy (although I feel way worse after that). I feel that when I watch shows I enter their world and I don't feel so lonely, empty and meaningless anymore.

I feel terrible about myself every day for how much time I've wasted and will still waste and I feel so guilty whenever I waste a little time . I feel empty sad and lonely almost all the time and it feels so suffocating. I feel like I'm addicted to shows and sugary foods but I'm not sure what to do; I have had trouble going cold turkey  (cannot concentrate, keep on thinking of shows, feel so empty) so I tried regulating my watching to maybe an hour a day but it isn't working as if it is a school day, I feel guilty for wasting that hour and most of the times I have trouble stopping at that one hour anyway.

This is also not the first time I've struggled with this, I had problems with binging since I recovered from anorexia several years ago and I've been going cold turkey on shows last time successfully but almost every year the I'll start watching one show (maybe exposed to the show by peers or family once I start on the first show, because I've abstained from it for so long, I snap and binge on the shows that day and it continues) and  I becoming addicted again. (relapsed many times) I want to cut off this bad habit totally (binging on shows and food) but I don't know how.

**Here's my questions**

1. Is there a specific duration I should go cold turkey before I start watching a little? or do you have any other tips on how to overcome addiction
2. tips on how to make things easier and how to deal with the guilt I feel for every minute I waste? I come from a family who is very concerned about time saving and whenever I do things too slowly or waste time I get ticked off.

I tried other stuff like reading books but I also get hooked on them and cannot stop.

3) any tips on how to fill the void in my life? I feel empty all the time.

4 ) any tips on how to better handle stress? I come from a very stressful asian country and the amount of work and difficulty of work given is really high.

5) (not directly related but I thought I'd ask anyway ) I wanna self improve myself (socially, emotionally and character wise ) but I find it hard to find the balance between improving myself and driving myself crazy obsessing on how to improve until im perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
1481,How do I ask for help? I'm absolutely terrified,"  I have a lot of physical and mental health problems and for most of my life I've had thoughts of hurting myself and I know that I do need help but I'm terrified of what admitting how I feel openly would mean. I want to tell my mother she's nice and understanding but I feel. So awful imagining bringing to her attention the pain I'm in and that I think I need help or I might do something and I just want to run away and hide forever


  It's making me really nervous even writing this to strangers I just feel so embarrassed and weak and shameful Ifeel so guilty for asking for help and saying how I feel here. Thank you for reading I'm sorry if this is very common or conceited or annoying to anyone I don't mean to cause any problems"
1482,Happy?,"Hey just finished wanted to know/get advice if other people feel like this and what to do. It’s a little long and the questions at the end.
I’m M22, gay
I have depression and anxiety, used to be suicidal, to the point where my GP when I was seeing him, was talking to my sister about getting me institutionalised and help(I had given him permission to talk to her on my behalf as I couldn’t speak to him at the beginning). Tried some medications.

I used to have full daydreams about how I would die and how the world reacts around me. ( Everyday I thought about it, what it felt like) but I would do this as a comfort thing ? Weird I know, I also create other worlds to escape too.
My anxiety used to make me feel as if I couldn’t breathe and I wouldn’t sometimes leave my house, couldn’t go shopping, I don’t even have friends except for one(he’s the best human ever and I would want him over 100 friends) and don’t have many hobbies/activities. Used to have panic attacks and put myslelf in spirals
I used to have internalised homophobia, was proud and happy for everyone else in the LGBTQ just not myself.
I was like this for years. Some periods lighter others darker, when I was 19/20 was when it hit the lowest and I almost did it, I had tried 1 time through out high school but this was the first time it truly hit home and I realised I wanted to live and that I almost succeeded, that was when I truly decided to get help.
I’ve worked on these things and don’t think about suicide every day and have been getting better control on anxiety and depression.
My relationship with my sister and her family has improved, and I feel ashamed of how I treated them when I was in that dark place, I like how we’re getting close again.
My relationship with my friend has also improved, I need to work on some points with both relationships I have with them still and myself but it’s improving
I feel like getting healthier again
Started the gym and gotten a PT to help.
Brush and shower every day now, 
Trying diets and different foods to start getting into a regular and healthy eating habits
I feel like I have made strides.

Sometimes I slip up and don’t realise until like after a week or two and work on it again

Now sorry this is so long but wanted a slight background (there’s more I can add but it’s already so long) so here’s the question
How long until I feel happy normally/continuous 

Some days feel good but that’s in the it feels normal and not like the bad time. But still absent of joy/happiness
I get out and my friend/sister can go for lunch or a day trip and during some of those moments I feel happy, that burst of joy/energy. But then it can turn still.
Do most people feel numb/low emotions, energy and Feed off those jumps of energy to be happy or what.
TBH I’m not sure exactly what I’m asking, I’m just not feeling what I think “normal happy” is."
1483,I don’t know what different emotions feel like,"I experience emotions, and I know the difference between a pleasant and unpleasant emotion, but I can never name them. I can’t name them because, while we have all these names for different emotions, how am I supposed to know what each one feels like? I’ve never felt someone else’s “sad,” so how do I know if “sad” is really what I’m feeling? I guess emotions are that subjective. Is there a universal experience for each emotion?

Another thing is that my emotions seem too complex to put into a little box. Too abstract. 

It’s really fucking me up. I’m really struggling right now and when I go to professionals to reach out and say I’m struggling, they ask me what I’m experiencing. All I can say is that I feel “bad.” Obviously that’s super vague and not helpful, but I genuinely don’t know how I feel. I can’t get help because professionals are telling me I’m just being difficult, or they don’t take me seriously to begin with.

I’m trying to pay attention to the way my body feels but so far every unpleasant feeling, even though they’re different, feel the same in my body. My heart feels heavy and my hands tingle.

Right now I feel “bad.” I feel uncomfortable. Restless. No energy. Like I want to go on a run but also lay in bed forever. I want to tear my hair out. I can’t get work done. I’m snapping at people easily. I don’t think I’m depressed, but again, how am I supposed to know what depression feels like?

Apparently the above isn’t a specific enough description for mental health professionals."
1484,Therapy,"Hey whoever’s reading this. My dad suggested that I get a therapist. But everyone he looked at, that insurance pays for, require the parents to also talk to the therapist. Is that normal? I really don’t think so. If I get therapy, I want it to have nothing to do with my parents, since they’re a big reason for a few of my mental health problems. (for context: i’m still in high school) I already have a friend who has a therapist, but I think it would be kinda disrespectful to pry abt something that’s rlly personal."
1485,Getting through depression blog,"This might help or might not. 

[getting through depression](https://www.beeseapod.com/blogs/2020/7/4/getting-through-depression)"
1486,Is this a “rut” or am I growing depressed?,"Hi all. I [19F] have been struggling my mental health significantly for the last two months or so.  I’m not sure if this is a “rut” that I’ll grow out of with time, or if I’m starting to wander into the area of being somewhat depressed. Here’s some specific examples of where I’m struggling; 


first, I consider myself to be super healthy and active, but recently I’ve been struggling with the motivation to eat healthy and work out. I’ve gained 5 pounds over the last three weeks or so.    Or I’ll have a super healthy day and drink super heavily at night just so I can feel a little bit fun/joyful. 


Next, my boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 3 years and suddenly I feel like I’d rather spend time alone and sleep rather than see him. I’ve also been having a super short fuse with him lately; any clinginess or immaturity I’ll handle rather harshly. My sexual drive has also been at an all time low and I’ve found that I’d rather just do the job myself than have my boyfriend help.


Lastly, I want to be alone. I just want to spend time by myself, go throughout my day independently, and maybe have a conversation with my family at some point. Other than that, I don’t want to have coffee dates with friends anymore. Even snapchatting my friends back has grown to feel like more of a chore. 


Bottom line, I just feel tired and distant. I have no urge to interact with other people and I hate the way this makes me feel. If it were up to me, I’d spend my day sleeping and watching tv. This isn’t like me, I don’t know what I need to change or how I can pick myself up and start to enjoy life a little bit more. Usually I love summers, but now all I can think of is going back to college and spending time away and by myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
1487,Schizophrenia?,"I'm 17 and I think I might have schizophrenia. I was exposed to pornography at age 7 because my brother told me to watch. I don't even know how to explain how the disturbing things I saw affected me. I've always had trouble with paranoia and delusions. I've even hallucinated a handful of times. My symptoms stem from fear. For example, I won't choose something certain at the store to buy because if I get a feeling it has negative attachment to it I won't buy. I just get this unexplainable feeling that if I choose that certain item something terrible will happen. I've convinced myself that I molested my family members which I definitely did not ever do. I'm adopted and I've been in foster care before but I was too young to remember it. My parents seem to push my depressive behavior aside and my mom has said hurtful things to me before like she wish she never adopted me once. I know she didn't mean it, but still when someone says something like that to you, especially your mom, that stuff fucking hurts.

This particular thing my dad said disturbed me. He said something about my chest.. yes my boobs and it made me uncomfortable. I don't know if he was joking but like who says that to their kid? I know he's not weird like that but ever since then I've just been paranoid around him. Ive looked up stuff like my ""confessions"" on the internet, from when I had convinced myself I molested a family member. (I DID NOT DO THIS BY THE WAY) and I don't know what to do. 

I've been made fun of for being a ""masculine"" female and I been called a dyke faggot and lesbian, even though I'm not entirely sure I even identify as female. This has made me suicidal and just have a lot of internalized homophobia, since I am attracted to females. I'm not saying being gay is a bad thing at all.
I've also been in a online sexual relationship with older men when I was 13 who were emotionally abusive and manipulated me into doing and saying sexual things.

So I've been considering suicide. I just wanna die. I don't know what to do anymore. I really don't know, I'm too embarrassed to even tell anyone about it, how am I going to explain any of this?"
1488,Just wonderinggggg,If some one were to commit suicide in a painless way what’s the easiest?  It’s for a project ....
1489,Are these early signs of a mental illness?,Hey everyone to start im 17 and going to be 18 in august and my mom is diagnosed with anxiety just to put that there but anyways i noticed that ive been more and more in my own head and i have random moments where im doing something completely normal then randomly i get numb and dont really feel in control and my bodies just doing whatever im doing and my mind feels disconnected. I also always feel like im not safe when im out that someone could easily take my life with a knife or gun it doesnt scare me but it makes me always have my guard up. Another example is when im just casually playing my playstation im constantly looking behind me incase anyones there.

1492,"Feeling like something you did was a different version of you, does anyone know what this is called?",[removed]
1493,Dissociation? Anxiety? I don't know..,"Honestly, I'm not too sure what this post is but I just know something's wrong. I feel really fake and like I look like other people. But I know I'm me and I don't know if it's dissociating or if it's anxiety that's causing me to feel unreal. Recently from time to time I feel like I'm dreaming and like there's a pressure pushing me down,  like the floor is caving in beneath me. But I'm just standing there. If I move it feels like I'm kind of heavy and the floor/room seems to rock. Especially if I'm showering it seems this  may happen I don't know what it is."
1494,I guess you can say that I'm getting better,"Obligatory on mobile, sorry

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, from what I have been told by a psychiatrist years ago I understand it's probably genetic (I have not looked further into it so apologies if its actually impossible, but there is a pattern running up my maternal line). There was a period of time in school (from ages ~12-18) where I was suicidal, but lazy. I wanted to die, I just didnt want to go through with the effort. I tried strangling myself, overdosing on my psych medication, I held a knife to my wrists, but I just couldn't do it. Maybe I was afraid of doing it myself, afraid it would hurt, or just afraid of it while simultaneously wanting it. I dont know.

I've been out of high school for a few years now and began college after a period of self exploration, and I guess you can say that I'm doing better. If I wasn't afraid of death before, I can safely tell you that I am now. I am truly afraid of death, and its keeping me awake at night. I cry and get anxious and sad because I know theres nothing I can do about it. I love my parents, but there will always be a small part of me that hates them because they created me knowing I would die some day, that it would hang over me until it inevitably happened, and that I would lose a lot of people I hold dear to the very thing I am afraid of along the way. I want to stop driving a car/going on the road  (and a lot more things) because I know one accident could end it all. I dont stop doing these things, because I know my life would be more miserable without them.

 I'm angry and frustrated that no matter what I do, how hard I work, I will die no matter what. I could live the best life or the worst, it's all going to end either way. One of my greater fears is getting some sort of brain degenerative disease (which also runs in the family, so it is a possibility), to lose my dignity and my memories and me. Part of me hopes for it, so that I wouldnt have to know that I would be in the process of dying. 

I have mostly stepped out of the wanting to die stage in my life (hopefully for good) and now I have crippling anxiety and anger following me around. Every once in a while I have a split second thought that I should just get it over with so that I dont have to deal with it anymore, but I never act on it nor do I want to. Even if I did, I would have a panic attack before I could even do anything.  I have a lot of things I value in life to go so soon. I know I need to go back to therapy, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading."
1495,I feel like Suicide.,"Hi, I am Justin. I am from Australia. I have just hated life for about 1 year now and Coronavirus isn't making it much better. But I live in the ACT and am trying to make more friends and socialize more but it just isn't working, I am always by myself and alone. At school, I am always alone and disliked and Bullied. I really don't This has been going on for a while now and will a Lot of bad things happening to me (There is a lot more but those are the main things)  I just don't feel life is worth it anymore."
1496,is it normal for me to miss being in a mental hospital?,[removed]
1497,I don't want to be noticed on my birthday,"Hi, sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this. I usually feel awkward on my birthdays and when people congratulate, but that feeling have been fading these past years. This year however, I feel like I just want to be alone or just to not be noticed and people treating me differently only because is my birthday. I didn't congratulated one of my best friend this year so I feel that I don't deserve to be congratulated by her or any of my other friends. I also don't want my grandma to call me (she always does) because I haven't call her not even once since the whole virus situation started, I care about her but I don't know... I just feel i don't deserve to be special for my birthday specially this year. I was thinking to go to my best friend's house but she hasn't talked to me in some time, I always talk to her first so I don't feel so sure. Anyways, anyone else feels this similar?? I have other reasons but this is too long already. Just a disclaimer I consider I'm in a considerably good place mentally, that's just the thing that's been bugging me recently. Thanks for reading &lt;33"
1498,I'm having fantasies of killing a cunt!,"I want to fucking kill a cunt. 

If you make fun of disabled people I wanna fucking kill you like Paul Stine (1939-12-18/1969-10-11). 

Don't let me find you fucking with an autistic individual or your fucking dead!! 

If you hurt Autistic people I will fucking hurt you back**.

Don't underestimate the power of physco fucks like me!!"
1499,Why am I losing interest and lacking feeling?,"Hello, I created this post here as I can’t think of a better way to describe my situation. Over the last two or three years I have started to lose interest and enjoyment in all of my favorite hobbies and I have stopped feeling emotions in the amount I used to. I currently am 15 years old and I began experiencing issues when I was 12. At this time it was minor thinks just life becoming tedious and me viewing old hobbies now as chores but it’s progressed and continued on... I used to love waking up in the morning and playing saxophone, browsing Reddit, watching anime, drinking pop, watching comedies but now I do nothing. I feel no encouragement to do anything and as a result I have stopped doing many of my old hobbies, including seeing friends. I usually don’t leave my house other than for school for weeks to months on end and have little contact with people who aren’t my relatives. I used to be very social and outgoing and now I just want to sit in my room all day until it becomes tomorrow. Now as to lack of emotion it just sort of happened, jokes became less funny, I lost feeling attraction towards the opposite sex, I’m(almost) never happy nor sad just in a constant state of living.

What I am looking for here is insight as to what my problem may be for people who have been in this state before and what I can do to get out of it and improve my feeling and interest. Thank you."
1500,how do i talk to a counsellor?,"i am going insane. i have tried to find information online about what sort of things to say, or what i shouldnt say, or how to say things orderly so they can understand it.

because of covid, and my school being shut right now, i cant talk to my guidance teacher yet, but as soon as im back, im going to talk to them.

right now im going to talk to a counsellor on childline (a support website which i think is only in the uk or scotland, where you can message a counsellor) and i dont know what to say.

i have tried to find things online that tell me what to do, and the only thing ive found is that i should try to write it all down. i tried to write down all the things i want to say, and now ive just got an incoherent mess of a word doc.

my question, i guess, is how should i tell the counsellor things, what things should i not tell them, how i should say things, how to order things so they make sense, stuff like that.

this is the third time ive rewrote this, so im just gonna post it. im sorry if its a mess, or if ive wasted your time by making you read this."
1501,My thoughts are getting worse. Please help me,"I made this post a while ago. I dont want to explain this again, so here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hihvg5/please_help_me_im_scared/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

These thoughts were getting better at first. I took this person's advice in the comment of my post because I started getting similar thoughts during the day. It was working at first, but lately I can't seem to distract myself. Everybody around me is talking about death and politics and controversial stuff. I try to ignore it but its so often that I can't distract myself. My thoughts went from ""what happens when we die?"" to picturing myself and others getting hurt/killed in the ways I hear about from the adults around me. I don't have anybody in my state to talk to and I feel bad about talking to my online friends about this because its the only time I talk to them or the only time theyll answer. I know they said I can talk to them about that if I need to, but I feel like I'm using them or annoying them or something. What can I do to make this all better?

I post on this subreddit a lot. I'm sorry"
1502,Why do I do this?,"I frequently find myself imagining scenarios that upset me, for no reason.
A few nights ago I kept myself awake for hours just running through what I would do should I be assaulted.

When I was younger I even got into some trouble for this when expressing that I had had extensive and detailed imaginings of what I would do if I was suddenly diagnosed with cancer or a brain tumor.

Is this normal?
I'm assuming it is and people just don't talk about it, but it would bring me some comfort to know where it stems from and if others deal with it too."
1503,Bupropion SR vs XL?,"I am a 33 year old cis white gay male. I have suffered from pretty low-grade depression for the past 15 years. I have never had a formal psychiatric exam or diagnosis, but I fit the description of atypical depression perfectly. During these stay-at-home orders, I’ve had a lot of time to reflect, and I have completely revolutionized my lifestyle, from how I eat to getting more sleep to starting a realistic fitness routine. The results have been dramatic and I feel the best I’ve felt in literally 15 years. 

After talking with my general practitioner, we decided that because of my history of having periods of improvement followed by depressive relapses, now would be a good time to start an antidepressant regimen. We decided bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin) would match well with my symptoms and desired outcomes.

Between bupropion XL vs SR, is there any particular reason why a doctor might prescribe one over the other? I know XL is the newer one, so one might assume it is the ‘better’ one, but I can’t believe it’s that simple if both XL and SR can still be prescribed today. Does SR fit certain circumstances better than XL?"
1504,I just don't know,At first I thought it was a phase you know. I just thought I would grow out of being sad all the time. Most teenagers feel like they are depressed right? Or so I was told and now here I am 5 years later feeling the same way. I don't know what it is but none the less it hurts. I can't explain it but I just want it to stop. I would give anything for it just to stop. I don't even know how to ask for help and then its like what if people think I am faking. What if I am? What if this is normal? I just don't know. Its not like I had a terrible life. So why do I just feel so down all the time. Why can't I even look at myself without wanting to punch my own face. Also here I am at midnight just wide awake because it just won't go away. I have to get up in 5 hours to go to duty. I feel so awful even talking about it. Like I don't deserve to feel sad or angry for anything. I don't know. I just don't.
1505,Breaking down,"I’m breaking down right now and I don’t know what to do.. things are bothering me and I don’t really have a distraction and I can’t bear them. I’m completely alone  with no one there, no one who wants to help because of how I am.. I’ve been crying on and off for almost 3 hours now.. I hate this so much. Why did all this have to happen, I just want to be happy again but it doesn’t matter because it would require a miracle for me to be.. I just want to scream until I can’t anymore.. I’m just going to be alone forever until I die.. Why did I have to be abandoned.. I loved them, I love them.. I probably look crazy and I’ll probably regret posting this.. but everything is killing me and driving me mad right now and I don’t know what to do."

1508,Video games are my form of escapism,"I play video games to escape the fact that I’ll never amount to shit. I figure if my characters get to go on adventures, be stable enough for relationships, and save the world then it’ll fill that hole in my life. Well, today a community I’m a part of decided to host a talent show, and my illusion began to crack. I have no talents. I have nothing. I have no hobbies, nothing I enjoy, nothing I’m good at. I tried to find something, I really did. But there’s just nothing."
1509,"I suspect I'm depressed, please advise?","Hey Reddit. 

I just don't know anymore if I'm just a lazy piece of shit or if there's something wrong with my mind. I remember days when I would be so energetic and excited to get things done and to finish tasks. Now everything feels like it consumes way too much energy and I don't want to do anything but stay in bed. 

I never have clean laundry, I shower like once in 3 days, I never have clean utensils so it feels like such a huge mountain to cook even something simple, I never have the slightest motivation to do anything productive and it's seriously fucking with my academic career, I don't have the energy to do hobbies I loved and was excited about, I don't have it in me to reply to texts or emails, I just don't know what to do. I don't wanna be someone that self diagnoses anything but I may also suffer from executive dysfunction. 

I talk to a therapist every week and I've expressed some of this to her (though my dumbass self always tones things down while talking to anyone) and she wants to address the root cause emotion of these barriers but I just don't feel anything about them. I just don't have the energy and everything feels too exhausting. 

Sorry if this was all very rambly, I don't really have anywhere else to turn. I guess the questions I'm asking are is this suspicion something I should bring up with my therapist? If so, how do I ask her without seeming like I'm making a mountain out of molehill or self diagnosing off the internet? 

Thank you so much to anyone that read this far. I really appreciate it."
1510,What to do when you see someone clearly struggling with their mental health but refuse to get help?,"Hi there. I have a friend that’s so great, but has dealt with a lot of trauma. They’ve even made a lot of mistakes. And they blame themselves completely for all of it. My friend is not open to therapy and counseling whatsoever but I can see that they’re struggling and need to do something to help themselves. There’s so much to unpack here that I don’t think that I can help him beyond a certain point. He’s always encouraged me to seek help but refuses to do so themselves. How do I get my friend to see that therapy and counseling are not bad things and that they can benefit from it?"
1511,Is my depression worsening?,"I think I've had depression for some time now (haven't been diagnosed, I haven't talked to people about it) it goes up and down but lately it's been the longest I've felt empty, bored, unmotivated, suicidal etc. I used to force myself to hide my feelings and scars but now I just don't care anymore, I don't care what happens to me anymore, I could lose all my friends and I couldn't care, I could become homeless and I couldn't care, my family could disown me and I couldn't care. Of course I care if something bad happens to them but if it only affects me, I just don't care. I don't have anyone else to talk too but I just want to know if this is getting to the final stages or not."
1512,Comparing Myself to Others,"Hello friends!

I know I'm not the only one who has the bad habit of comparing myself to others, especially friends I wish to emulate. I also know that this is not healthy. What I'm wondering is if anyone has any coping mechanisms for when it gets really bad? I go through bad bouts of comparing myself to others and it really leaves me just feeling awful and numb.

I guess I'm also hoping to find people who just...kind of get what I'm going through. And how sometimes it can feel like, because you compare yourself to others so much, you start to feel like a dull copy.

Thank you for your time and thoughts."

1514,Panic attacks,"I have been dealing with a lot of panic attacks for the last 4 years. I really don’t know what to do every time I suddenly have a panic attack. My mom doesn’t know about it. Lately, I’ve been overthinking a lot so I try my best to distract myself. I can’t sleep easily at night because I’ve been overthinking too much and I’ve been having random panic attacks. I really want to get better and I’m tired dealing with it. I don’t know what to say to my mom about this. I’m too scared but I wanna get help."
1515,"When you don't feel like doing anything, how do you have fun?","I get so frustrated about never having anything to look forward to, but when I try to plan something fun on my days off with my bf, I think ""Ugh I have to do x y and z to get ready for that and then a and b afterwards and it's just too much.""  And then I'm grumpy all day and tend to deflect blame onto him that we never make plans or do anything fun.  I'm also nervous that if we do make plans to do something, they'll get cancelled or we won't get along during the thing.  I often self sabotage and procrastinate or we get into an argument before the thing and then it doesn't happen.  I'm panicking now and might not be making much sense... thanks for reading if you kept up and if you have any feedback, I'll take it."
1516,"Mental health is not a quirk and it isn't romantic, beautiful nor glamorous 🤕","I hate how some people think that having a mental illness is a trait or its somehow trendy. I also absolutely hate it when people throw around words loosely like ""depressed"", ""I'm so OCD, I need to arrange my pencils in a certain order"" ,"" I didnt eat this morning, I think I have anorexia"". It actually hurts coz it's so much harder to deal with when u actually suffer from it and u know the pain. 

Mental health used to be such a taboo topic. No one even discussed it a few years ago and now u see people joking around about it and romanticizing it. I joke around about suicide and depression coz I feel like I can cope better but when unnecessarily made, it pisses me off. 

I remember in our psychology class the teacher would always poke fun at the kids who were sleeping and srsly ask them if they have autism which doesn't even remotely make sense but everyone starts laughing as if it's funny, it just feels weird coz I'm actually on the spectrum or my own teacher would tell ppl to go hang themselves and she would have straight serious face. Her teaching was excellent but she made fucking be ""jokes"" that she apparently thought were funny. 

I had a friend who wasnt depressed or suicidal or anything. But one day she noticed my self harm scars and told me that they looked cool and beautiful like wat..... and the next day she made self harm scars in designs like drawing carved lightly on her skin and went around the school showing it off. I honestly didnt know what to think of this imao. 

I remember when 13 reasons why came out I fucking loved the show. It was the only show that I had come across which actively talked about mental health and I was so excited and ofcourse i wasnt gonna listen to warning pfft. The show was rly good. It was my favourite at the time. But I remember crying after every episode and cutting after every episode and attempted suicide after the show, ended up in the ICU came back to life obviously. This was obviously not because of the show, I had already been diagnosed with severe depression along with a few other mental illnesses. However, now I feel the show did glorify suicide for eg:by showing hannah reacting to the people mourning after her death. Like when u die, ur gonna be gone. U won't know that people will fucking miss u. But I love how it openly talked about mental health issues but it was still romanticizing suicide in a way. 

People need to realize that mental health is the same as  physical health and it's about time ppl look at both mental and physical health equally. 

Sorry I'm not a good writer and I might have said some stuff that doesn't make sense or is illogical. I didnt write everything I feel coz Idk how to put them in writing but this is all I could get out and I feel like this topic is very important"
1517,I MADE MY OWN HALLUCINATION FRIEND ANNOYED AND SHE LEFT ME!!!,"WHAT THE HECK HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN??? Gosh! Am I really that unbearable??? I made my own hallucination leave! I wrote about her today and was really happy about it! I thought we were close! Like she was sent to make me feel better or something, but I made her go away and now I really freaking hate myself...

I vented to my mom about my self esteem today, she would just say “uh-huh” and wouldn’t look up from her phone. I have been waiting for my hallucination to come so I could tell her about it but I guess I complain too much! Or maybe I just overreact to everything? Or maybe it’s because I literally won’t change? Maybe it’s because I’m clingy? Or selfish? I don’t know! There’s a lot to not like about me! So yeah, she left.

So now I want my life to end. I don’t want to feel better! I realize that I probably make everyone miserable considering that everyone either tunes me out or just straight up leaves me! Gosh I just really wish God could kill me, I don’t have enough courage to actually do anything. But at this point, I think I could do it.

Sorry I complain too much. I’m sorry. I just wish things would stop."

1519,Depression and Anxiety Risks,"My sister, 8 years older than me, has had depression and anxiety for a while, but for the past while it’s pretty much been non existent. Yesterday something happened (family disagreed with her about a board game and she has been “depressed” since”), and I doubt anything would happen, but do people with depression and anxiety hurt others, especially family? I’m sort uninformed about mental health."
1520,i need help diagnosing myself with a syndrome/issue,"for the longest time that i could remember i have these moments when i’m like showering or just thinking at night or just daydreaming and i think of scenarios where i get hurt and/or plan out my death...

like i put a tonnnn of thought into all of them

one, for example, is at a football game (I’m a cheerleader) and i’m stunting on the sidelines for cheer but our flyer falls on me and i get a concussion and a broken nose and then i get driven off the field by an ambulance and i have to get surgery and miss a but of school for the concussion.

one of my friends said it might be connected with anxiety/depression because i think of ways that i could die but i think it’s deeper than that"
1521,Could the combination of these meds be dangerous?,"Bupropion 150 mg
Fluoxetine 40 mg
Lithium 300 mg
Atomoxetine 40 mg

I am asking because sometimes i just feel so bad physically."
1522,Disassociation? Body dysmorphia? Or just plain old depression? (Long),"To sum up, for as long as I can remember I've felt like an alien in my own skin. A grotesque monster like Frankenstein or a side show freak. I do not recognize myself if I look in the mirror and it is hard for me to feel attacted to my own limbs and other body parts. If I'm sitting in a group I feel like a shadow creeping in on normal humans. On my own I question if my body functions in a way that is human or if I'm some how completely wrong and poorly replicating it.

I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and PTSD but never deeply divulged the extent of my feelings or lack of towards my body to any health worker. More and more recently I have felt that I am living without actually having an active role in my life. 

Idk why I'm posting this just that I need to get the thoughts out. I'm 21 almost 22 and feel as if I've not actually lived a life but just performing tasks that are expected of me. Worse is that my ""alien"" feelings are becoming confirmed in my mind as I get older. I've never had a relationship or even a mutual liking towards someone. I don't have close friendships or family members. At school I'm unnoticeable and unremarkable.This was unchanged by covid and while everyone around me finds it hard being alone its been my default. I've tried to change the social relationships around me and improve on my outside physical vessel but it never seems to work. 

I've concluded I've failed at being human. And although I've resisted suicidal thoughts as much as possible it's becoming easier imagining that if I'm dead it leaves space and resources to someone that is actually human. And my death is for the betterment of those around me to eliminate and reallocate the resources extended to my body. So at this point the only thing stopping me from ending it is not having the energy or willpower. So I guess rn I'm just gonna keep my body going like an old broken down vehicle that only runs some of the time and never quite right. 

I don't mean to sound overly whiney and like I'm seeking compliments or to be pacified. I'm just not in a position to talk to anyone regarding this. Thanks for reading if you have and well this was really my way of constructing my thoughts rationally. Or as rationally as my brain is allowing atm."
1523,I feel like I’m losing my mind,"I don’t even know where to begin. I have spent many, many years trying to work out how to just live like a functional person. I’m 20 now and living with my boyfriend and from the outside all is well, I have two cats and live with someone I love, my family is relatively sane for the most part and while I don’t have more than one or two friends they’re lovely and I love them. The problem is, all of it feels fake. 

I feel like I’m on an entirely separate plane of existence from everyone else. I’m constantly on edge and, when I’m not in a massive depressive slump that renders me nearly immobile for days, I’m uptight, anxious and constantly stressed. I’ve been getting treatment for anxiety and depression for years now but it all feels like a dead end. Every time I tell my family I’m depressed their only advice is to ask for a new medication. I’m fucking sick of meds. I’ve been on countless meds since I was 12 for one thing or another and I hate them. The ones I’m on right now make me vomit if I don’t eat a full meal before taking them. 

I only ever have about as much energy as it takes to get from my bed to the bathroom every day, let alone work and eat and do functional people things, but no one seems to take me seriously. It’s always “man that sucks” or “I feel that” or “have you been taking your meds?”. I get no help from anyone that actually means anything. I feel like I’m screaming into a void and no one is actually paying attention. I feel so incredibly alone. 

I’ve never really had suicidal tendencies because I am terrified of death, but the idea of taking off in my car and never coming back gets more appealing by the day. I’ve even daydreamed of going to sleep and just not waking up. Not dying, just not waking up. Never having to deal with any of this ever again. 

Before anyone asks, yes I’ve seen a therapist. I’ve been seeing one for about 5 years now but considering the current state of the world and my extreme discomfort around phone calls, I don’t really see it as much of a viable resource right now. I’m just lost, empty and don’t want to do this anymore. Everything is too much work. Getting better is too much work."
1524,How do I tell my parents I want to see a psychiatrist?,hhhhhelp I don’t know what to do
1525,Post-corona depression?,"Remember when everyone was depressed and anxious during lockdown? I was the opposite. I worked out daily, ate mostly yoghurt, fruit and salads, walked my dog daily (5-10km). I missed my friends, sure, but we chatted daily on messenger or called each other when we were really lonely. Overall, I was a happy person. Now that things are almost back to normal, I feel terrible. I have less time for myself because I go to work now, I tried socializing, but all it has caused was stress. It got so bad that I uninstalled messenger and only talk to three people now (outside of the people that I just can't avoid, like family and coworkers). I stopped working out, instead of walking my dog we play fetch in the backyard. I eat like shit again, I already gained some weight. I feel anxious when I think about talking to my friends again. Is someone else experiencing this? I feel like I'm the only one, everyone seems happy that things are back to normal again..."
1526,why do i feel guilty?,"Hello, so recently i've finally had the courage to let go of one of the most toxic people in my life because i will start seeing a psychiatrist yet i cant help but feel guilty when i know i have BARELY done anything wrong in comparison to the long-term pain i've gone through. I would site the things on my phone that i have done that might've hurt the toxic person and its eating me alive. and the fact that these problems are misunderstandings and yet the toxic person won't admit to it, the guilt is eating me alive. I've asked someone for their opinion on this list and she said I have barely done anything. This problem is eating me alive and i dont know what to do. It's making how i feel worse about myself"
1527,oh well,"this is the fifth doctor asking me the same damn questions even after reading my file. the fourth doctor told me he'll see me this week so i won't have to repeat my life story again and again which must be tiring for me BUT nah i got a different doctor.

i understand they have postings and rounds but i don't wanna start with the same questions every damn time. i mean i just want to be fixed. fuck.

and the psychiatrist? she's the only constant but she's either absent or late damn it. she's the only one who knows what questions to ask and which button to push to get me to talk honestly. i wanted to talk to her today but because things are not horrible or worrying lately, the doctor consulted the psychiatrist personally.  if only the psychiatrist did have a conversation with me, she'll pick up on things the doctors fail to notice.

thank you to all the doctors though. at least i'm not turned down or ignored. even the nurses here have been greeting me like i'm their friend.

i really wish i got to talk to the psychiatrist though ahhhhhh fuck."
1528,just confused and trying to figure out what’s wrong with me.,"the way i’ve always described it in my head is me having 2 sides. 

it’s like one side of me is always disagreeing with myself or telling me a different opinion. the original part of me will have this opinion and the other side is like “well what about this? try looking at it this way instead” which ends up me in not being able to ever make my mind up. 


for example, sometimes ill agree with a post i see on twitter and then i’ll be like no i disagree now. i’m always trying to pick things apart to find how i actually feel which ends up in me feeling like everything’s a mess.

my sister told me i don’t like to adapt to people (specifically in friendships). my friend disagreed on something i said and i didn’t want to change how i reacted which lead my sister to saying that. she advised me to try saying things differently but in my mind my response to that is, i don’t want to change the way i am for someone else so they don’t take offense because i’m just a blunt person. maybe this is just some type of trauma thing but it’s annoying for me cause it’s like i’m always in the wrong when i just stick with the way i think and don’t want to change it.

i find myself to be insensitive because i sometimes don’t understand certain situations or can’t fully comprehend it because i’m not the person in that situation.

but like i said at first i feel like i can never make up my mind and i feel super 2 sided which makes it hard for me to identify myself or with myself.


i just want to say i’m in no way trying to diagnose myself with any type of disorder i’m just genuinely confused with my feelings and seeing if anyone has an idea. just asking for recommendations on what it could be and not a diagnosis.

one thing on google i relate to is dissociative identity disorder but ofc i don’t want to diagnose myself, there’s so many disorders out there anyways. hopefully someone can give their opinion sorry this post is a mess :("
1529,My mental health and trauma is making me fight unhealthy attachments with my child,"My daughter is a year and two months. I love her to death. She is my everything in this entire world. I could lose everything else, but as long as I have her, I'll be fine.

A little to explain...

I was homeless when I found out I was pregnant with her. I am an abuse victim from both my childhood and my adulthood. I have childhood Dissociative PTSD with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and Depression that worsened with my Ex. I had just been kicked out by my grandmother. My abusive father gave me up to her after years of mental, physical and S-xual abuse as a minor. When I was kicked out due to my grandmother not liking my friends and my severe mental breakdown. I couldn't work, go to school and I could barely leave the house due to my dissociation. She forced me to go back to work too soon with the threat of kicking me out, which caused me to lose my job. I started getting better but still wasn't working as often as they would like me too. So, they pushed all of my bills and $500 of rent on me to force me to start working more.

 I decided to get away and go on a 4 day vacation with someone they never met. While I was gone my grandmother had to be hospitalized for high blood pressure and I couldn't get back into town. When I returned I was told I was never allowed back. The house, everything was locked, even the garage. She thought I was with my friends from school that she didn't like. So, I was kicked out. 

I ended up moving in with someone who turned out to resemble my father. Controlling, manipulative, abusive. Just a terrible human being. I couldn't work, leave the house. He worked offshore for two weeks at a time. I would be alone for two weeks having to ration out my food. The one time I left without his permission while he was there, he forced me back inside and forced himself on me while screaming in my face how terrible of a human being I was. My daughter was sadly conceived through a day of force.

I ended up leaving him and went homeless, only to find out I was pregnant three days in. I planned on aborting but was denied twice due to my poor mental health. My ex told me that he did not want this child to live, but didn't want anything bad to happen to me. Under any circumstances. He didn't want her to live. Therefore. He was gone. He doesn't know that she is alive. Her name. Where she is. His name isn't on her birth certificate. No one on his family knows she is alive.

I moved in with my mother who I hadn't lived with in years after two weeks of homelessness. I went to file a restraining order but since it was past a months time, they couldn't do anything.

I had an angry pregnancy where I didn't want to feel her move, see her photos, talk about her. When she was born, I had to learn to separate her from my abuse. Learning that it wasn't her fault. I worked hard on learning to bond and love her. 

Yet, now. I seem to depend on her. I feel like we have been through so much together. Even though she wasn't born and didn't have to experience it. I feel very protective over her. To the point I'm willing to end any and all relationships that may get cross. I feel bad, but I scold my boyfriend (Who I met at 5-6 months pregnant) if he gets too frustrated with her. I feel bad because I told him that if it comes down to her or him, it will be her everytime. If I have a bad PTSD night, She is in bed with me and just looking at her makes me feel like I can breathe.

My daughter gets very clingy with me as well, but I know that is just a toddler thing. I go through days where I just need to be able to see her. It makes it hard to work and do normal things. As I speak she is laying next to me in bed where I can watch her tiny sleeping face. I get nightmares and I need her. I have trouble sleeping and I need her. I'm having a bad day and I need her. I'm upset and I need her.

I just feel like there is something connected so deeply in my past trauma with the two of us. That we survived together. We made it out alive together. We want each other... Yet, at the same time, I know that it's just me. It's just my brain trying to attach itself to something so I feel less alone, scared and traumatised. That I attached myself to her so I feel like I'm not alone in my trauma. That I'm sharing it with someone and we are making it through together... But it was me. Not her. I did. And it makes me feel so alone. I try so hard not to cry in front of her. My father did that to me while he slit his wrists. I remember how terrible it felt. I do my hardest not too... But it just gets to be so hard sometimes. I don't know how to set healthy boundaries with her. She isn't my therapist. She isn't a coping doll. She's a human being and she shouldn't be forced to be my comfort item.

 How do I move past this?"

1532,Hearing a voice in the back of my head,"Let me just start off by saying, I'm not trying to diagnose myself. My main goal here is to find something to look into, so that maybe I can learn more and bring it up with a psychiatrist when the time comes. I'm not faking anything, or trying to get attention. In fact, I'm trying to avoid it. That's why I'm using a throwaway. This post is also a bit unorganized,  I hope you can forgive me for that.

For the past couple of years, I've been hearing this person in the back of my head. Never anything harmful, quite the opposite actually. Telling me to care for myself,  or clean something up, things like that. I never paid any mind to it, thinking it was just my own thoughts (even if it didn't sound like me), but things have changed. For the past seven months or so, I've been living under more stress than before, and that's saying a lot. And this person...? Entity...? has been appearing more and more.
it only shows up when im either insanely stressed, or neglecting myself, or some situation like that. She has different speaking patterns from me (I have a more casual way of speaking, she tends to go for a more gentle tone, calling me dear and darling and shit like that), and uses 'you' and 'our' statements when referring to me or us.
 And I'm able to have conversations with her sometimes. The other day, after nearly having a total breakdown, she came out to try and calm me down. When i had, I was able to find out a couple of things about her through asking.

-She cannot control our body (she called it our body).
-She uses she/her pronouns (I use he/him).
-She desperately tried to comfort me when I started tearing up. I'm assuming she doesn't like people crying.

But she didn't say anything when I asked her ""what are you?"". I don't even think she knows. 
The conversation made me actually start thinking 'this might actually be more than just my own thoughts'. She felt real. She spoke to me like any person would, and I was able to talk to her just like I would a normal person.
She even apologized. She said she was sorry for not coming out on the night I tried to kill myself (a week or two ago). 

Naturally my first thought was Dissociative Identity Disorder,  but almost none of the symptoms line up. I have a bad memory,  but I don't dissociate to my knowledge, and I've only been hearing her for about 4 years (I'm currently 18) when all the people I've met who have DID have had their alters since early childhood. And, well, she straight up told me she can't take over. 

I'm not neccesarily worried; after all, she's there basically to take care of me when I won't care for myself, and she's a huge comfort. I'm just curious.  I want to know more about her, and what caused her to appear. I'm more than happy to provide more details if it's necessary!"
1533,I(19f) think my mom has mental health issues and I don't know if this is normal or not.,"My mom has always had some sort of mental health issues, at least I think. She sometimes even jokes about her having some “psycho-like” behaviors and thoughts.

I remember there was this one day when she got really mad at my younger brother, literally broke his bed with a metal stick, and tried jumping off our apartment with my brother. We lived on the 19th floor. If I wasn’t in the house literally trying my ass off to get her off the window, I’m afraid to write what would have happened that day. She literally tried to kill herself, and my brother together. For real. My brother was probably 7 years old or so. And I was 11. What scared me the most was that she was almost a different person when that happened. I still vividly remember; her face that day, what she said, how she acted, what she did. They were nothing close to what she was normally.

But luckily, that day was it. I don’t particularly remember any more “abnormal” incidents after that. But maybe that was because I went to a boarding school since I was 13. And I’m studying abroad for college, so I only come home twice a year.

And recently, by that I mean a couple year or so, I’ve been noticing some weird behaviors from my mom, strangely resembling that day long ago when she tried to kill herself in front of me. I’ve barely seen her cry, not until recently. Recently she sometimes calls me crying, saying she doesn’t know the point of her living anymore, nothing gives her joy, my dad and my brother looking down on her, etc. I admit, my dad and my brother are not the most caring and charming people, and obviously my brother, now almost 16, is in the middle of puberty, and can be mean and aggressive sometimes. And my mom takes these actions to extreme, excessively seriously and sensitively, thinking they’re looking down on her, they treat her like she doesn’t exist, nobody needs/wants her anymore, etc.

Obviously there are good days and bad days. But even on the good days, she looks somewhat depressed and it gives me mad anxiety. She says stuff like I don’t mind dying rn, my life doesn’t have any meaning anymore, idk what I’m living for everyday, etc. 

Recently I came back home for summer break and as I directly see the situation, I think it’s worse than I expected. Last week my dad complained to my mom a little, and my mom took it to her heart and didn’t eat, locked her room door, cried, was depressed for a couple days, and said stuff like I’m gonna kill myself tonight in front of you. It really felt like she meant it, and honestly I’m scared everyday. This weekend I had a little argument with my mom since I came home a little after my curfew (yes I still have curfews lol) like 40minutes. I was never got hit by my parents no matter what, in my entire life. That day she slapped me. Threw stuff at me Multiple times. Her face, her tone, was exactly same as that day, when she was mad at my brother and tried to jump off. I don’t think she was mad at me because I was late. I think it’s because I didn’t really reply to her message, and came home late. She said stuff like you’re also looking down on me like nothing, treating me like shit, etc. and said some really bad curse words to me that I cannot even say it myself. She’s really not someone like this.

My mom is really, really smart and has mad musical talent as well. She used to work as a banker - had higher salary than my dad actually - and used to play as a main guitarist in a band as well. But she had to quit her job and live as a housewife ever since my brother was born, and because our family moved countries quite a bit, she had to eventually quit all the band activities she was doing as well. Now especially with COVID, she doesn’t go out anywhere, doesn’t have anyone to meet. I have suggested her to go to gym, do bands again, etc. but she’s also very worried about COVID and would rather stay home. I honestly feel so guilty as much as I feel concerned about her. Would she has been different if she didn’t have to quit her job because of me? I feel extremely guilty when I see other women my mom’s age still working in a high position. I feel like I took her career away and put her into depression, anger issues, all mental illness like this.

As someone who is at least somewhat educated about mental health therapy and consultation stuff, I really think my mom has issues and needs help. I have talked to my dad and he also knows she’s not normal, but he’s very against the idea of therapy and seeing psychiatrist. I mean, I understand; he was never educated on this and he probably thinks mental health issues are some crazy illness. My mom has become really frugal, which I really hate, ever since she quit her job. I don’t know how she would feel about putting her money into those definitely not cheap mental health therapies.

Anyways this morning I wrote a long message to my mom, telling her I’m sorry, and I’m worried. This is the first time ever that me, or anyone, telling her that I think she has mental health issues and recommended therapy. I really didn’t want to come out as rude or convey any nuance that she’s sick or anything. It has been a few hours and I’ll be back home in a couple hours (I’m interning rn) and she hasn’t replied me yet. I’m afraid she would’ve found it offensive, rude, or going out of my way or smith. I was just genuinely worried, both about her and also me and my other family members as her depression and anger often gets on us. I really don’t know if I did the right thing and feeling super paranoid rn :( Is my mom normal but am I just going out of my way?"
1534,I don't know what to do.,"I went through a lot of problems in the past and still going through shit in present, the main problem is I never talk or discuss my feelings with anyone cuz no one is ever there for me I always keep everything inside which feels too much lately I'm at the point that I don't understand myself anymore I feel so lost I wanna fix it but no one would help me, I'm stuck in my head with all the thoughts and I just don't know how to handle them, my family doesn't believe in mental illness so I have to fix myself by myself which is hard and it's putting a big pressure on me especially as a teenager, I feel pathetic for not being able to change myself but I truly tried for years I tried to do it alone but it just got worse and it's affecting me in a very bad way I just wanna feel peace in my head."
1535,Am I mentally ill for almost wanting to be mentally ill?,"I have depression, often anxiety and sometimes paranoia. I am writing this post because I feel like I have a mental illness, part of me is convinced and part of me says dont be so silly. I am conflicted because a part of me feels like I want or need a diagnosis, but maybe a more rational side of me says that wanting to have a diagnosis is messed up. Part of me wants to be ill, which is a horrible thing to feel about anyone let alone yourself. Following on from this thought process I feel like if I want to be ill then that is an illness in itself. Since reading about bpd, I fit 7 or 8 of the 9 criteria and maybe that would be an accurate diagnosis, although there havent been many times in the past where I have made ""frantic efforts to avoid abandonment"" because I am outwardly high-functioning and think more than I act in those situations. I do have some bad memories from early childhood of getting lost and separated from my family (whom I am now emotionally detached from because I hate their personalities). I could probably believe that i fit many criteria for lots of conditions but at this point i dont know if i just want them to apply or they really do. As you can tell I am extremely conflicted and I would love to hear thoughts and advice. Cheers :)"
1536,the balance of staying informed but protecting your mental health,"I am an empathetic person. I care about social and political issues and the people being affected. I have been like this all my life. But recently especially(because of the current state of the world and the political climate) I have been exposed to a lot of information, news, events, things said/done by celebs etc about issues on literally every possible topic. I see the problems, the bad, and the things I find disgusting and horrible but get sucked in. Several people in my life have asked me why I care and get involved in things that don’t directly affect me. Well for example, im not black, but physically cannot ignore the injustices they face. I care and advocate for black people and the racism towards them disgusts me. And the events that have been happening recently I can’t seem to stay away and just “not care” like others in my life because “im not involved”. But in general, stuff like this takes a toll on me so much that I feel like it takes up a lot of my day and mind. The thing is I want to be informed and educated. However, I feel guilty, lazy, careless, and privileged to ignore all the things that are happening. I get angry and emotional and depressed and sad and anxious and basically all of the above. And I feel like every time i scroll on anything like twitter ig snap or see news articles and videos, I just continuously see the horrible things going on and can’t not look into it. I find out all the things happening and then it stays on my mind. My mom told me that I shouldn’t care so much and to just ignore it because I can’t do anything anyways and there’s no point. but I feel bad bc of reasons mentioned above and also i feel like being informed, sharing info, finding petitions, and donation pages to send money to do help people a lot and do make change. So my question is, how do I stay informed and educated without being sucked in and making it all have a negative effect on my mental health. How do I also calmly discuss topics that are sensitive and controversial without getting mad sad or emotional especially when there are actually certain people out there that have disgusting views and morals that when hearing from I want to throw them into a brick wall lol.  I need advice because I don’t know what to do and how to do it :/ thx :)"
1537,My schizophrenic sister needs help and the system has failed,My sister is schizoaffective and is going through a major manic episode.

She’s threading self harm and violence against my parents my girlfriend and myself. These things she’s posted online.

Sorry for the super long post, I'm just at a complete loss of what to do.

I've never been known to be the kind of person to stand up for myself. If being complacent meant keeping another person happy, then I'd have no problem doing so.

However, I'm sitting in bed at 3 A.M. completely angry and frustrated because I've let people walk over me for too long.

My big issue at the moment is that I'm currently living with my grandma and she brought a guy into the house. My parents had moved out of the house and I stayed behind while my friend moved in. This was an arrangement I was happy with. Both my friend and I would pay rent to my mom each month and we would both live in the house. Then one day, my mom told me my grandma was moving in because she was breaking up with her current boyfriend and had nowhere else to stay. I wasn't too bothered by it at the time. She kept to herself and never really intruded around the house.

Not too long after she moved in, my friend was evicted for not paying rent which left my grandma and I. Because he was gone and my grandma kept to herself, the house started to feel like my own. I managed to pull myself out of a depression and began making the house my own. I would cook, spend time in the living room which I had personally furnished. I felt comfortable in what was essentially my own home.

Then around the same time, I feel like my grandma felt the same way. She began decorating. Placing photos on desks which I was using for my own stuff. Placing questionable figurines and art around the house (a notable one being that of a small indian man which scares me just about every night because it looks so realistic.) The decorating wouldn't have been such an issue had it not been so intrusive. I had made the living room to my personal liking (considering the fact I never used the living room even when my family lived here). She also began cooking questionable meals that were either barely cooked, made with completely crazy ingredients (such as a burrito with bologna, ketchup, and mashed potatoes), or were murdered with salt. Because she was always cooking, I lost my own desire to cook and just began getting takeout every day; something that she essentially makes fun of me for.

I could put almost all of this aside and live peacefully with her (and I did) until a few weeks ago when I came home to a car that I had never seen before. I assumed it might be one of my cousin's cars who frequently makes visits. It was also very late so I didn't think too much of it. I was in the living room the next morning and a man I had never seen before comes walking in with my grandma behind him. She introduces him and says that he's her new boyfriend. Again, I let it slide. She probably met him a little while back and best case scenario, she can move in with him or it'll be a small relationship and I'll never see him again.

Then one day, I came home and one of my dogs was tied up, one was in a cage essentially crying for me, and when I walked into the house, I discovered the entire living room carpet was gone and all the furniture was rearranged. I asked my grandma about it and she said that her boyfriend wanted to get rid of the carpet to replace it with new carpet and that she was afraid that the dogs would run away (which they won't considering they never have).

To wrap up my issues, I am actually extremely angry that this man I've never met before is essentially moving himself in and making changes to a house I just now started to become comfortable in. I wanted to talk to my mom about it tomorrow because she's the one who owns the house but I know the conversation will not go in my favor. She'll probably just tell me that it's best if I moved out which is an awful idea. I have such a connection to this house because as a kid, we were moving around so much. The longest house I had lived in prior to this one was no more than 4 years. Finally, now that I have a house that I feel is my own, it's being completely intruded on. And I wouldn't be able to afford my own place considering my job pays like crap (I could leave that job but that's a whole can of worms and another essay long as to why I haven't left). And I can't rightfully leave that job because it's owned locally and the boss relies on me so heavily that leaving would ruin our admittedly good relationship and possibly make his business harder to run.

In short, I feel like a house I've just learned to love is being intruded on and there's very little I can do about it besides make myself seem like a bad person in my grandma's eyes.

I have no idea what to do. I feel like I have no control over my own life. And if I do attempt to take control, I'm an asshole. I'm trapped.

Unfortunately, this is just the basis of my issues at the moment and it feels like it's boiling over badly. I've fallen back into my depression, have been drinking a lot, and am just generally angry and exhausted all the time. If I don't make some kind of change, I'm afraid I might just snap."
1544,Would life be more normal if I hadn't made friends?,"I have come to realize that maybe if I had kept to myself and had no friends, I wouldn't have a lot of my major trauma that have now. Or if I picked happier friends and didn't wanna try to help everyone.

Every day I live with the memories of their last days and some even their last moments and it's so overwhelming. I always joke about my trauma to my current friends and they all just laugh with pity. I know I can't express how I actually feel without turning into a mess, and everyone I know doesn't want that side of me. They want funny depressed side of me, they want (L) they don't want (LN), (LN) depressed and unstable, all she does is laugh hysterically till she's crying and shaking, sometimes screaming into her arms. We want (L) who smiles and jokes about how she witnessed her best friends die horrible deaths, they want to hear a joke about something they hope they never fucken experience, but because I have they want jokes and not real emotions towards the subject. I can cry while laughing and making jokes but as soon as (LN) comes over and the jokes stop and the true feelings come out they don't like me no more. They don't want sad me , they want their favorite version of me. They want broken but funny, not scattered and unstable. Do people understand this?"
1545,Why I am becoming more and more aggressive and violent?,"Lately, I have been feeling more anger inside me and I am having more violent thoughts and becoming more angry about things and life. Why is this happening? Since, I don't know what to do, I decide to hurt myself to relief the anger. I'm becoming more anxious and stressed. What can be causing this? I don't really like it at all, it's literally everyday. I'm becoming more rude, too. Thank you for reading this and for your time!! :)"

1548,Grief and pre-consisted depression.,"Hello, i recently lost my mother 10th of april. And for obvious reasons it has worsen my pre-conditioned anxiety and depression. I have never had suicidal thoughts, with the reason being i would not want to inflict that pain on my mother. Now that reason is gone and im in a constant depressed state and having to deal with all the funeral and admistrational work i keep having mental breakdowns and usually at evenings suicidal thought, plans, good bye letter(how to word it) not written. I am the youngest of 5 left with all responsibility and it is slowly tearing me apart and im not sure i will come out of this alive. I have talked to my therapist, doctor etc, and they want me to be put in an institution but i have insisted not to untill all work surrounding my mother is done. Anyone else here that have gone through similar situation? This is the first time im having to deal with the loss of a loved one. My support system (friends, psychiatrist etc) is great but still not enough. And to flare things up i have manic periods when i just do foolish things in the moment and thats what frightens me, that i will act in a manic episode and actually do some harm to myself."
1549,please help me.,"i cant feel any emotions anymore , i basically just sleep all day because of my lack of energy to do anything, i can’t even talk to anyone because i have zero energy. this feeling has been here for years and i dont know what to do and i just want to vent on here because i have no one to turn to or tell"
1550,What’s wrong with me?,"Context: 17F, 18 in a month, living in the US. Going to university in September.

I feel like somethings wrong with me. One of the main reasons is how I react to stress or frustration. When I get frustrated, I tend to harm myself (thankfully not by cutting, I can resist that urge) by punching myself in the face or back of the head repeatedly. If I’m around others I pull my hair. Something about that releases frustration for me, and I never leave visible bruises so I don’t really see a problem with it. Then I cry like a baby afterward and it’s embarrassing, even though I’m alone 90% of the time when I get like that. After the breakdown I either get a rush of adrenaline or feel drained and empty. 

Another thing is the way I socialise. I can’t tell when I’ve said something offensive or rude until the person gets mad and stops talking to me. And even then I have to ask what I said wrong. I also stutter a lot, have to repeat myself, and backtrack to make sure what I said made sense. I tend to obsess over fictional universes (Steven Universe is a huge obsession right now, going on 8 months) and annoy my friends because that’s literally all I talk about, especially if they have no clue what it is. Social events are hell for me because fandoms are the only way I can connect with people, so if it’s an event with mainly adults or little kids, I feel alone and awkward. 

I flinch at loud noises, sudden movements, and slight touches despite having never been hit or abused in any way. I’ve searched every memory from the time I was a little kid and can’t remember a single time I was hit maliciously (fights with my brother don’t count because we never went for each other’s faces).

Physically I use my hands as a nervous habit a lot. Years ago I realised that when I walk, my arms hang like everyone else’s but felt wrong, so now I constantly play with my hands. Cracking knuckles, moving my fingers around, snapping, and even digging my nails into my skin are my main nervous habits. If I’m really stressed or anxious I bite my fingers.

There’s a lot more but this is already pretty long and incoherent, so I’ll spare you guys the trouble. But from this post, does it sound like something’s wrong and I should find a therapist? Or am I overthinking this entirely and I’m normal?"
1551,I don't feel like trying anymore,"I'm 30 m I've Been on meds for more than 4-5 , I've known that I have depression and social anxiety for about 8 years. Right now I'm at a point that I am on a relative stable state, but it feels like that's it I won't accomplish anything that I wanted when I was younger. 

I wanted to persue a career in the arts, not exactly fine arts but more into de videogame industry. I think that I had promise but one of the most important things that I failed at was at ""networking"" the thing is that at the time I didn't even knew that I messing everything up I just felt axious and just didn't want to be in social situations.

Well as I got older and I started to figure how the world works and also started to think a little bit more clearer I realized that I had lost my opportunity to do the thing that I wanted.

Now I feel that I'm just here waiting for something to happen ,I don't feel motivated to do anything else I don't see the point I don't feel motivated,, then I just feel that if I try again I'm just going to fail again. 

As I've grown older it has become harder to stay focus ,I've always had difficulty staying on task but I feel like now even more

I do not know what am I going to do or if  gonna do anything at all, the times that I have tried to do something ,anything and don't finish it for any reason I just feel like like crap and that im gonna relapse bad, I sometimes do 

Well I guess that's it, thanks for reading, and any input will be greatly appreciated"
1552,Am i a sociopath/psychopath,"
I’m the black sheep of my family. While they are all happy I’m quiet and reserved. I thoroughly enjoy gaslighting my friends and love seeing them confused. I am fascinated with the brutality of nature. I’m a sexual deviant and have occasional rape fantasies. I pretend to get along with people and care about them. I think about violence a lot. I hate myself and I cry a lot of nights thinking about the eternal nothingness of death. I think I’m smarter than I actually am. I am in reality very average or subpar in most ways and so I cheat/steal/lie if I can get away with it and it benefits me. I see the world as a very cruel and unfair place. I have gambling addiction, video game addiction, almost no discipline when it comes to anything I don’t like e.g. gym, healthy food, uni assignments. I’m weak and selfish. I’m probably racist and sexist. I have no real friends that I see. Did I miss anything? 

Don’t know what I’m doing posting this but if anyone relates to my situation HMU maybe? Lol. Or don’t, because we will probably just end up in jail"

1555,Anguished over last year breakdown,"Hello. I'd like to apologize for any spelling mistakes, English is not my first language. 

I've been on antidepressants for about six years or so by now, I'm 29yo, working at a good law firm in my country and have a great bf. One year ago though, I sort of stopped taking my meds. First I'd just forget, then I would just think ""another pill missed won't matter"" and somehow one day I realized I hadn't been taking my meds in over a month. 

At the same time there were a couple life changes that stressed me out and I guess without the meds I wasn't feeling quite right already, so long story short, on July 10th last year I had to suddenly leave the office because I started panicking and couldn't keep it together anymore. I managed to get to the nearest hospital and got sent to the psychiatric ER, as I couldn't calm down and was harming my arms with all the anxious scratching. I was given some tranquilizers and my bf picked me up after a few hours, I was so shaken I couldn't think. 

I got medical leave from work for the next two months and had to move in back with my parents, since my bf worked all day and I needed to be accompanied as much as possible. It took weeks to get back on my meds and feel like I could handle simple things like walking my dog again or think about the next day without having full blown panic attacks. 

By September I was already doing way better and I got back to work. Now it's been a year and I have been feeling OK again but the anniversary of my breakdown is coming closer and I can't help but feel uneasy about it. I'm scared about it happening again eventhough I'm taking my meds and everything. I just can't stop the anxiety."
1556,How do I find Support Services for a Friend Based in the U.S?,"So I'm Australian and I have a friend who I am worried about and I don't know how to help. She is suffering from severe depression and is a single mother with a very young, autistic son.   
I'm fairly confident she is not in immediate danger/ suicidal but she's definitely in a hole and she doesn't have any friends outside of myself. I think the biggest part is the isolation and she really struggles to make new friends despite being one of the most kind-hearted people I've ever met.  


She doesn't have money to spend on expensive therapy but I think it might be what is required. I'd be more than willing to pay for good service if anyone has one they highly recommend. I'm really out of my depth with some of the questions she asks my opinion on. Shes had a very traumatic childhood with a history of abuse.  Here in Australia we have support lines you can call but Id really like to know what options are available in the U.S? Also if you know of any platforms or mediums that are Covid friendly and good for making new friends Id love to hear about them."
1557,I'm disappointed with my parents.,"My cousin wants to build a fence for my parents.

I'm paying for it and was going to pay someone to build it or build it myself but my cousin is insisting on building it for free for them ( I will pay him i will insist) 

My cousin has mental health issues definitly OCD and maybe others that I don't know of he did try and stab my dad with a screwdriver once when he was a teenager hes in his 40s now... due to the OCD he's taking a very long time measuring things going around in circles for hours and my parents keep pulling faces and making comments and I found it incredibly rude one of which I think he overheard because I did and I was stood right next to him.

So after he left I told them how rude they were and its nasty and if they are letting him build it then they should be nice to him and not be rude and if they can't manage that then they should just say no.

I fount it extremely disappointing and I let them know that. I have bipolar disorder and my sister anxiety. My brother died of a heart attack due to drug abuse but I am pretty sure he also had bipolar and was self medicating. Ive been discriminated against for my mental illness plenty of times as has my sister.

So my parents shocked me and offended me that they could behave like that. 

I'm currently staying with them during the pandemic because I lost my job i don't need to stay here I have plenty of savings and rental income from a houde but there's currently tenanrs in it so can't live there. im staying so my parents have the extra money, I'm paying them rent and I've given them thousands so they can decorate and get new fences and furniture etc to prepare them for retirement. My dad is retired my mother lost her job 2 years before retirement.

But I think I might move out now. They also make disparaging comments about foreigners despite the fact I've lived in 5 countries and faced discrimination for  being foreign and know what it feels like, they know it offends me but they still do it, they also make disparaging comments about LGBT people and I'm gay ( after I came out they stopped doing that about gay men specifically but continue about everyone else) 

Is it wrong of me to push my values onto my parents ? I mean i can't make them into nicer less bigoted people should i even try  or am I the one in the wrong trying to make them treat others better? 

They're not bad people just bigoted."
1558,How do I help my friend with anorexia in his relapse?,
1559,Do I need help or just time away?,"My partner and I have been together for almost two years and have recently given birth to our first child together. We started loving together three months into our relationship. 

Early in our relationship, he would message other girls about wanting to meet up but not actually going through with it. He did them mostly because of boredom and it was a habit for him to message so many girls on a daily while he was single. He also met up with a girl who he had a thing with while I was overseas. He assured me nothing happened between them. She was having issues and she was also in a long distance relationship. 

I understand that none of them are excuses for what he actually did but I’ve chosen to forgive him and to work things out. We both agreed that this is it for us. 

My thing is though, since the birth of our daughter, doubts keep popping up, all the words he messaged those other girls replay in my head. I had a poor self image of myself before meeting him and worked on myself during our relationship and loved “me” now, I’m finding myself comparing and becoming self conscious about how I look. Everything I thought I had buried has sprung up. As well as the stuff that happened before I met him, but these issues are mainly to do with him. He’s honestly done so much better, he’s worked on the stuff we’ve talked about and he hasn’t done it since. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who to see. We’ve both spoken about these, but nothing has seemed to help me. And it’s getting worse. Do I need space away from him? If I get space, what do I do to occupy my mind ... to fix myself. I don’t want to spring this onto him again. I want to be a healthier (mentally and spiritually) partner and mother."
1560,Never tired,Not sure if this is a good place to post this sorry but lately i have been staying up for around 20 hours or so at a time and only end up sleeping out of concern for my physical health and then i sleep for 6-8 hours and repeat and im not sure why or what to do about it or if i even should do anything about it
1561,My boyfriend suddenly started having psychosis so I drove him to his family interstate but now the borders are closing tomorrow due to COVID-19 and I don’t know if I should travel there to be with him?,"It was a normal weekend when my boyfriend started having signs of psychosis. By day 3 of this, he started having delusions and was barely able to walk. I live in VIC and my boyfriend’s whole family live in NSW. I met them at the border so my boyfriend could go home with them and be taken care of by his mum who is a psychologist and his siblings. 

Then it was announced the borders between states are being closed tomorrow at midnight. My boyfriend woke me up last night before we left and said ‘come with me’ and I’m scared I won’t be able to visit but also scared of going there and not being able to get back home. I’ve been crying all day. I have some extended family in Sydney but don’t know them well. I don’t know his family very well and have never met his mum so am daunted by going there potentially for months, although they invited me there to stay.

My sister thinks I should stay here and look after myself while he gets cared for by his family. Thoughts? I have a psychologist appointment tomorrow at 11am but am scared of missing that midnight deadline if I want to leave, I don’t want to abandon him and am heartbroken by him wondering where I am. But I’d be all alone there struggling with this heartbreak with a family I don’t know with no way home for an unknown amount of time 😢"
1562,"Please read, please.","I have reached a point in my life where I have gained awareness of the trauma I have suppressed all my life. I just need someone to read this and tell me that what I have experienced is not normal, that my pain is deserved and that my suffering is not made up. 

I grew up poor but happy, up until I was 7. After that I have really blocked out all memories so can only attempt to piece together what happened. When I was 7 my mum moved abroad to try and earn money so we could buy an apartment. As soon as she left, I stopped seeing my dad much. I have vague memories of seeing him asleep in the morning but my brother (6 years my elder) and I had to care for ourselves. I don’t recall ever having food for us, I think I learnt to fry eggs to get by. On Fridays after school I would travel, by myself at the age of 7, an hour by public transport to my grandma. My grandma told me that I used to be hysterical most nights begging for my mum and dad. I don’t really think I understood what was going on in the background. 

At about the age of 8, I found a picture of another woman in my dads wallets, which had replaced my picture and I think I figured what was happening. 

I am aware that one winter me and my brother became completely abandoned by my dad. The country I am from, the weather can get to about -20 and I recall my grandmother picking us up one night and from then on I lived with my grandma for the next year. I recall always struggling without my parents, I remember feeling sadness but I don’t think I quite grasped the reality that I had been abandoned. 
 
My mum had no clue of any of this while she was abroad as everyone hid it from her. Once she found out she made the decision to bring me to England with her. I was 9 at the time and really wasn’t told anything, I was just tossed around and everyone assumed I was fine. I moved to England but this was only facilitated by my mums new boyfriend who was an abusive alcoholic. I lived in one room with my mum and her boyfriend and there was maybe another 6 other strangers that lived with us. I was left by myself majority of days and that’s about all I remember. 

Between 9-15 we moved maybe 6 times, each time with my mum her boyfriend and about six other people. I never really ever had a safe space as a child. I saw my brother violently beat up our neighbour, my brother be beat up by my mums boyfriend, my mum be beat up by her boyfriend. Constant abuse, constant drinking. I was called every word in the book every day, I mean I was called a bitch, worthless, stupid blah blah blah from the age of 9 by my mums boyfriends. No one ever really cared for my education, I never had birthday gifts, never had Christmas presents. I never went on holidays. I never even had someone come to parents evening with me. I just remember always being afraid, I didn’t know what action would set my mums boyfriend off and so I just tried to get by as unnoticed as possible. 

I was also always in some ways abused by my brother. I understand siblings fight but hes always made it very clear he hates the fact I exist and was born. When I was 5-13 (remember he’s 6 years older than me) he would often strangle me against the wall with a knife to my throat. He would beat me by kicking me on the floor, to my head and stomach. He would spit at me and so on and so on. I was always covered in bruises and I have always known that he truly and honestly does not love me. At the age of 19 he beat me up really badly whilst he was on a drunken rage. I tried to push him out of my room and got the absolute crap beaten out of me, I know I passed out at some point but since then I’ve never really been able to recover. That was the day I really thought I was about to die and I lost something within me. My mums boyfriend and my mum asked me to leave the house for a week and I stayed with my friend. 

I returned home and the abuse from my brother intensified. I would always have panic attacks going home and just became a shell. I was at university at the time and I really began struggling. Everyday I was emotionally attacked by my brother, if I came back from the library he would scream at me for being a little lying rat that no library is open that late. That I’m out fucking around. That I think I’m better than everyone else. That I am a piece of shit. That I am stupid and worthless. Just anything you could say to a person, I heard it. 

A breaking point came when I got messages that when I come home my brother is going to put me in the back of the trunk, drive me to a forest, tie me up and kill me. My mums boyfriend, who wasn’t anymore living with us (after beating my mum), let me sleep on his kitchen sofa and I spent 3 months sleeping in a kitchen. I had no privacy, there was 4 other people in the house who all used the kitchen. At this point I took my first overdose. Then many more. I’m still alive. 

I’ve left out the rape and the bulling at school as this would go on forever.

I am 23 now, I never finished university as after my suicide attempts I was asked to take time off. I have fallen into an unhealthy relationship. I would consider myself an addict. I have student debt with no degree. I  struggle to get past everyday. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality, social and generalised anxiety and ocd. I struggle to get out of bed everyday

I know others have had it worse, but for me I live in constant pain. I feel so much pain, so much pain it debilitates me."
1563,"I [M-25] Can't Feel Loss, And When I Do Lose Someone, or Something All Memory of Them Disappears.","Howdy! It occurred to me the other day, like a hazed flight of thought, that our family had a cat pass away recently. I thought about it for a moment and was like, ""Didn't we? I don't know...I can't remember."" But it felt correct to assume that one of our cats did die recently. And I thought about it for a couple more minutes and it was like, ""Yeah...that's right. Just barely, I remember it, but what was its name? Was it male, or female? Why does it seem important to remember?"" I sat there pondering for maybe ten to fifteen minutes. I thought about the cats we still had and the ones that had died in years past, and I just couldn't remember. This mysterious cat didn't seem to exist. Then after a while it all came back. The cat's name was Buggy (yes, a bizarre name for a cat). She was a female, and we had to put her down just last month due to her health severely declining. And she was my cat. ""Oh, it happened again."", I thought. 

Let me explain. My mom passed away this last Dec. just a few weeks before Christmas. It was the first time that something was able to punch a hole in my typically blunt emotions. What I mean by blunt is that I never have extremes in my emotions. They just kind of stay on a plateau, but usually stay on a positive scale emotionally-speaking rather than negative. I never get angry, just sort of irritated. I never feel sorrow, just mild discomfort. I'm never truly excited, just content. I'm never really frightened, just somewhat concerned (if even that). Anyway, I was able to come out of that state for just a couple days after she died before the grief stopped affecting me. It only resurfaced at the funeral, only to disappear from then on. Just a week ago, I realized that I haven't had a single thought of her for all of these months. I haven't missed her once during the past seven months and I haven't felt anything either within that time -- no grief from her loss. People say I'm strong, but that's how I've always been. I've had companions, grandparents, and other extended family pass away from when I was a child and through my teen years (I'm 25 presently). I never felt anything when they died. I was fully aware of what was happening, but it didn't effect me. I just attended their funerals and went on with life. 

That's sort of what bothers me from time to time. About 95% of the time, I could care less about the state I'm constantly in. It's these 5% intervals that I find myself faintly concerned about this state and contemplating why I'm like this. ""Why can't I remember? Why can't I feel?"", I ponder. 

The longest time there's been a memory gap was for more than a decade. My childhood was totally closed off from my memories until four years ago (at age 21). In 2016 they started coming back. Skeptical, I did some fact-checking with family (particularly my mom) and they were all real. The memories that returned weren't of anything that serious, but once as many resurfaced as were going to, I realized all memories surrounding a single person remained out of reach. A few years before 2016 my family was on vacation. We were at a restaurant having lunch. My mom and dad were going back and forth in conversation, talking about ""the good old days"", or something along those lines. I wasn't really listening. Suddenly, my mom asked me something related to their conversation about a girl named Shauna. ""Who?"", I said. My parents were shocked. ""You don't remember her? She was your best friend years ago. You two were inseparable."" Nope, I didn't remember. I was interested though, so when I got back from vacation I looked her up on social media. I found her, contacted her, and we began talking. To her, she was catching up with a friend. For me, I was just talking to a stranger trying figure out how we ""knew"" each other. Maybe, about two years after we got in touch, I had the opportunity to visit her (she had moved out of state). While we visited I hoped that something about being in her presence would remind me of how I knew her from the past, but I couldn't recall anything. She was still just a really friendly person that I met online after vacation. Nothing more. So, fast-forward to 2016 when my memories returned -- suddenly I could remember birthday parties, gatherings, etc. (more than that, but for the sake of what I'm talking about I'm shortening the list). I remembered friends that were there, but never Shauna, even though after talking to my mom about them she told me that she was there. We went through VHS recordings and I saw first-hand that yes, in fact she was. I even remembered driving past The Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, which I found out after talking with mom was on our way to visit her. Probably one of the strangest memories that I had was getting inside of a real race car that was sitting in the middle of this outdoors-themed store. I talked with family, and they told me that the race car was in a Bass Pro Shop we had visited while we were visiting Shauna's family. Apparently, from what they said, she and I got were in the car together, but I don't remember anyone else's presence there with me. To me, I could almost say I was alone. It's like my memories are a photo album

Apparently, from what I was told, I loved her. That's kind of interesting to think about. I can't remember ever loving anyone genuinely. From talking with my mom, at the end of our last trip to visit her (when I was still a kid) I had a different reaction to her and I parting ways than I usually did. I was always sad, but I guess I was always reassured by the hope of seeing her again, so I never reacted all that bad, but on this particular day I had an emotional reaction that my mom described as though ""I knew I was never going to see her again"". Although there weren't any plans to stop visiting, in the next year my mom became pregnant with my sister, and from the caring for a new baby to other conditions that got in the way, we never did go back to see her again. We lost total contact with two years, after which she disappeared from my memories altogether. I still can't remember anything about her. After memories of my childhood returned (with the exception of Shauna) in 2016, I realized that it was after she had disappeared from my memories that I stopped feeling emotional connection with others. For a while as a kid, I tried to be everyone's friend, but not feeling any form of connection inside never made long-lasting friendships. People came and went, and that was that. 

I became shy for a while and had trouble interacting with people, but eventually I came out it. Instead I became apathetic toward relationships (friendships, as well as anything more). The only relationships I had were with my immediate family, as well as some of my cousins that I always saw. In addition to this, my overall personality changed. I'm not going to go into any great detail about what I was like, because I don't want to be looked at as someone seeking attention, or attempting to jump on the bandwagon along with certain people who perceive personality disorders as trendy. And besides, I still want people to talk to me on Reddit, instead of ignoring me. I'll only go so far as to say, that while I tried to be everyone's friend for a while, eventually that changed and instead I began to use everyone for my own personal gain. I also became exceptionally sadistic. I would say about 95% non-sexually sadistic and 5% sexually sadistic. And that's where I'm going to cut it off at. This was during my preteen years, all the way up to the age of fifteen. When I was fifteen I had a short lapse of memory, which when I came out of, I was extremely depressed and contemplating suicide. I can't remember why I was depressed, but the outcome for some reason led me to choose to try to get the sadism under control. My manner of dealing with it was perhaps less than perfect. I thought I would try to protect people by ensuring that they never could really know me, so I cut myself off from everyone and put up a thousand walls. In the end I build my own prison on the inside. Being that the sadism had fueled a lot of my more intense emotions, having it shut away for many years I think had some responsibility for how deadened my emotions ended up becoming. The sadism has been a lasting trait that has been absolutely impossible to part ways with. It's so interwoven into everything about me, I've wondered if I have a personality disorder. I only really started looking into psychology-related topics when my problems (predominantly my lack of emotion) started taking a toll on my mom during the last years of her life. She was diagnosised with breast cancer and I couldn't give her the emotional support that she needed. Naively, I was going to try to fix myself for her sake. The sadism, if your wondering, never actually gives me any pleasure unless I myself have inflicted it, and it is never directed toward someone that I care for, so I never had any pleasure from what my mom was going through. I just couldn't feel anything.

Now please don't think of me as a horrible person. I do try to genuinely help people both on here, as well as real life, but it tends to be very altruistic in nature. I don't get any sort of emotional high from helping people. I just do it because it's right, and because I'm trying to be a good person, even though what's locked away on the inside isn't good at all. I try to make it a goal to care to a degree for everyone, so that I don't hurt them. I help them instead, carry their secrets, and try to protect them instead.

Honestly, I've tossed around the idea of finding help from professionals on multiple occasions, but I'm always met with concern. No one knows me -- not really anyway. My family doesn't know me. The people who call me their friend don't know me. No one does. They just know what I let them see. And there are times when I wish I could open up and let someone into the darkest parts of myself, but I've vaguely hinted about certain aspects of what I've dealt with to  certain individuals before, and the common response is that they retract from me. I live with superficial relationships and I want something more (if I'm capable of something more), but to let people in, I'd have to stop lying and start telling the truth. And if people really knew me, I'm concerned that I would truly become alone. I used to do the whole self-diagnose thing, but after I matured a bit, I gave up on it. And while I most certainly will not view any opinions written below as law, I still am interested in what you think about as much as I've shared, as well as what I ***may*** be dealing with."

1565,Lack of will with everything,"Hi all (29M), just wondering whats usually your first though to get you up from bed in the morning?

Currently I've been struggling to find reasons to get up myself. Everyone around myself has moved along with his life and i just keep feeling im being kept behind. 

When trying to discuss these type of topics most of them think its just a way for me to grab attention from them so i kinda stop talking to them towards these type of topics.

Im currently working in IT an area that i really enjoy but currently finding no happiness or urge to go into  work, basically just waiting for the finishing hours to repeat the same thing next day.

I also had a life of loneliness since little due to parents working a lot and my relationships were short and really sad which also helps to make me lose confidence in myself, since no one really bothers to look to me with that different look, just another one.

My apologies for the long text, i dont believe to be actually depressed, just wanted to gather some opinions that can help me gather my thoughts together to move ahead on the right direction with my life.

Again thanks for taking time to read this."
1566,Am I a bad person for wanting attention?,"Cw suicidal thoughts
I keep getting thoughts that I’d like to be in hospital right now. Either for my suicidal thoughts (which are really terrible at the moment), or to have an accident where I’d need to go to A&amp;E. I know that it’s a terrible thought and I’d never act on getting myself hurt just to be in hospital (partially because I don’t hate the NHS, and it’d be a *particularly* bad idea right now. ) 
I feel like it’s because the only time where I’m taken seriously is when there’s something physical wrong with me that people can see. I know that this is selfish of me, but I just feel terrible for wanting someone to care."
1567,"Trained Therapist ""Call-In Show"" Idea?","Hello,

I'm Daniel, a trained psychotherapist from the UK. I use the word ""trained"" advisedly, as I have just reached the end of four years of studying and training, only to have my actual qualification delayed by Coronavirus measures. 

I would like to set up a listening service on Twitch. Here are some details:

I have completed (and passed) my final assignments, I just will not be able to receive my certificates until some time next year as I need to complete my remaining hours of practical work. My practical work takes place at a local college where I have worked for a year, however the college will not open until September and the counselling/therapy department may open some time after that. 

**Proof of my studies, qualifications and professional membership (BACP) is available on request.**

To keep my foot in the door and hopefully offer something of worth to anyone who needs it, I would love to offer my services. There are a few catches, and I would like to be as transparent as possible:

* I am working for free. You do not have to pay for our conversations, but I will stream them (without your face, and potentially with a voice changer) on Twitch. This is so I can receive donations. I understand many will not like this and that is okay, I am happy to signpost more suitable services instead. The reasoning for the stream is financial. I understand it might sound crass, but it is as simple as having bills to pay. 
* I am currently working without a supervisor. My supervisor is provided by my workplace and I cannot access them at the moment due to lockdown.
* I am not offering ""true"" therapy. It would be completely unethical of me to say I can give anyone weeks of unending, uninterrupted hour-long sessions that abide by a professional framework. I am offering a boundaried conversation with a mental health professional wherein I can listen and support you, and offer some kind of insight into next steps if you wish. If you like our conversations and would find it benefecial to have more, we can reach an agreement about that at the time. At work I book in blocks of six sessions, so I would do the same here. 

\-------

**In practical terms, here's how it would look.** 

*  You DM me or comment here.
*  We exchange info (First name, age, what you would like to talk about) so I can ensure we can work safely. I am unable to offer support with people suffering from severe mental health conditions such as schizophrenia and psychosis. 
*  We decide how to talk. I have Zoom, MS Teams, Discord and can get others if needed. 
*  You tell me if you're happy for me to show your face or real voice. 
*  We talk for 50 minutes. I will behave as I do in sessions. Towards the end of the session we can discuss the idea of more conversations. 
*  Money is never mentioned. I understand the lingering thought of a donation jar can be very offputting and it will not come into our session or messages. 
*  On stream, viewers will see me on one side of the screen, and a blank box (or your face if you don't mind) on the other side. They will hear both of our voices. Your details will not be shared beyond what you choose to share. Clips are disabled, however it should be assumed that if someone really wanted to record it then they could. 
*  My working model is predominantly person-centred. This means I am quiet and relaxed, sometimes casual. I aim to be sensitive, warm and genuine. There will be moments of silence, potentially even awkwardness, and I feel they are important to sit with. PC therapists can be extremely frustrating to work with for some people; I am happy to explore that with you but I am not in a position to change my whole method as I simply am not trained otherwise. 

\-------

If anyone has any questions or concerns about what I am offering, please do let me know. I am trying hard to walk a line between ethical practice, helping people, and paying my rent. I am not claiming to be doing so perfectly, and any feedback is appreciated. 

Daniel"
1568,Is this normal?,"Hear me out, I feel like I have an emptied memory bank. It’s difficult for me to remember things in the past most especially to the cases I suffered the most (ex. heartbreak , rejection). I have to brainstorm for a while to get accuracy in my memories only to be confused if it actually happened or not."
1569,Does therapy really help?,"Hey everyone!

So I was recommended by several people over the past few years to go to therapy, see a therapist, psychiatrist, etc., but I'm 19 now and I've coped with my issues and they keep getting thrown on top of each issue already on my shoulder. Knowing that I've been able to handle myself without much help from others, but I thought it was about time to get a bit of closure on certain events that have occurred and follow the advice of people. I was wondering, however, if you guys thought therapy really did/does help one, or if you found it really useful and healthy?

Thank you :)"
1570,What does a psychiatrist do with you?,"I'm FINALLY going to have my first appointment with a psychiatrist, i still don't know when but i'm hoping soon enough because my mental health is possibly at its worst right now. Based off the advice that some redditors gave me, i asked for a psychiatrist to get a diagnosis and maybe even medication if i need any and then maybe she will appoint me to a therapist. 
I was curious tho what does a psychiatrist do usually? As in how is it any different from a therapist? I know theres a difference but can't remember which. 

There is also another small concern for me which some people might not understand. I dont know if parents have to be with you during your appointments but in case they do, is there ANY chance my psychiatrist might listen to my mother more than me/ side with her more? Im really scared about this."
1571,"I feel pathetic that I’m not achieving my goals, but I’m too scared to try. Suffering from loss of identity and not knowing how to feel better.","Hi all,

I’m near the end of high school in Australia and I’m finding myself in a difficult place. Until a year ago, I was doing very well in school and I expected to do very well last year and this year, but I didn’t. The problems I’ve faced include:
- Perfectionism resulting in procrastination due to inability for every assignment to be perfect
- Executive dysfunction (this has always been a problem but I’ve reached the point where the work is difficult enough that this impacts my grades)
- Emotionally abusive household
- Burnout

I try my hardest despite these but I’ve repeatedly failed and others have berated me for it, making me feel I don’t deserve to exist. But not only am I scared of failure, I’m also scared of success. I don’t like being praised or otherwise knowing that I’m doing well from others (grades, money, etc.) because it makes me feel like I’m being moulded and manipulated into what someone else wants me to be - not *who I am.*

I don’t want to be a drone, but I don’t to be a failure. I don’t want to freeload, but I don’t want to work. I don’t want to be pathetic, but I don’t want to be successful. I don’t want to be traumatised, but I don’t want to heal because I don’t know what I feel and think besides all of the negative thoughts.

But, I don’t know what I *do* want, either. I’ve recently come to the realisation that all my dreams and aspirations are really just my interpretation of what I think others expect of me and I never really wanted to do any of it. Still, I don’t have something I want to do besides all this. I’m not even one of those kids who has the wild daydream fantasy of playing video games for a living - I can’t imagine a single thing that I *want* to do.

About the only thing I think I want is to move out of home to escape my condescending parents, and that’s about it. I have no additional plans besides working a job that I haven’t decided on and finding a close friend to heal with.

**How do I learn to look inwards and discover who I am; who I want to be; what my identity is?** I don’t know who I am and I don’t know who I want to be. I can’t even describe or know my interests, my goals (besides that immediate one), my personality, or even my *gender* and I don’t know how I will discover them. All I see when I look inwards is a pathetic, hurt wreck, but I know that that’s not me - that’s my trauma.

Also, **how can I decide that success is a good thing and get over my fear of it, including my fear of being successful at healing?** Yes I am scared of success, but I know that I’ll be happier once I’m not because if I aspire to be successful, I’ll have more money or more spare time or more happiness or whatever it is that I discover that I want. I’m even scared of being successful at overcoming my trauma, and the dilemma between healing and not healing has kept me awake at night.

I just want the pain to be over. I didn’t ask for any of this."

1573,The side of me that doubts the others existence,"I (17M) have a version of my self, that has been really struggling as of late. Crying at night and being afraid to go to sleep. But then I will have another side to me that doubts side 1's existence

I have no idea is side 2 is healthy for me or bad for me, sometimes it perks me up and sometimes. But recently I have been challenging side 2's belief which  causes more pain.

When I have the emotions if side 2 if I accept them it perks me up, but makes the nights worse. If I deny side 2 it saddens me then but lifts the burden at night

A day ago I have decided after long thought to make a sort of diary of emotions, setting some ground rules for myself and such, enforced by the idea that if I betray them I would be hurting my past self. But by putting my emotions into the diary I proved accidentally that I do have issues.

So now my question is should I keep investing my feelings out into words or not"
1574,I don’t know what to do/say to this counsellor I didn’t know I had,"Recently I’ve been feeling the need to talk to someone but had never gone through with making an appointment.

One particular night I got drunk by myself and I remember taking a quiz on the BetterHelp website. When it got to paying and all that I backed out and closed the tab.

Two days later I look in my junk folder and find emails about a counsellor being assigned to me and wanting to message me.
The day after that someone else from BetterHelp emails me saying that they can help me if I want to change counsellors since I haven’t responded.

I don’t know what to do!
I didn’t put my bank details in so I haven’t paid for any sort of appointments online or anything. I don’t even remember making an actual account.
Do I just ignore these? Or do I have to talk to someone in BetterHelp and explain the situation?"
1575,My housemate's laziness weighs on me,"Long story.

I (24M) have been living in a house my mom owns, mostly by myself over the past years. Now I live there along with one of my closest friends since high school (25M), he pays rent whereas i'm living by my mother's grace since i'm still in college. He is also about to graduate sometime next year. 

We get along fine as friends and mostly there isn't much conflict as housemates.

The problem is that he is incredibly lazy and while doing nothing he has his presence by being in the living room every day, watching tv all day. 90 % of his daily activity involves sofa &amp; TV, it's either that, taking naps or staying with his gf for a couple hours. When satisfied, he comes back, takes a nap, etc.

I realise all this hasn't got much to do with me, but the fact is that I come from a couple of rough years marked by the same passiveness and sometimes 'hopeless' attitude this other guy also shows. I was excited to be living together because the plan was to lift each other and taking on more of an active lifestyle. He's taking anti-depressants but doesn't do much effort aside from that to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The sitting, smoking, tv, napping- thing is honestly getting embarrassing.

I'm not looking to frame him because I am able recognize some my own laziness in this setting; the difference is that i'm not content with this and want to reach farther outside and into the world to actually make something of my young life. I find myself heavily influenced every day to not sit down with him and staying there for the next 5, 6 hours. Sure I can go about my own business independently, but often it requires someone else to do something fun with and he basically says no to everything I suggest. Yeah, 'my friend sounds depressed', but let's say he's been the 'happiest' while depressed that he's ever been. He takes meds, seems totally fine and content when some mates come over, etc. This does not come off as his depression speaking, but his comfort and lack of shame. Sure, it's his life and I should lead my own. Then why do I feel taken hostage when trying to improve my activeness all the while living with someone who does nothing all day, every day...

Frustration all over, who's got any ideas?"

No matter though i don’t feel like I’ve grown past this and I still have a lot of my immature teenage thoughts and actions. I still lash out with no regards of the consequences, I play silly mind games in relationships. I do sneaky immature things like reading private journals and text messages. I’m just an awful person right now and I hate it, I know all of these behaviours aren’t just down to arrested development, I also have BPD traits, and an alcohol problem that helps turn me into Jekyll and Hyde.

Anyway, I went on a bit of a tangent there, does anyone have any experience with arrested development? Especially with BPD? Will I be like this forever? Gd I really just want to be a better person and treat everyone in my life with the respect that they deserve"
1580,I (41M) have never been this close or serious about ending my life before.,"If you knew me, you’d probably tell me to suck it up. My life really hasn’t been horrible. Definitely hasn’t been filled with good fortune though.

1582,I never have energy and am constantly dealing with a foggy brain.,"Hello,

So to be brief, I genuinely don't know what's wrong with me. 

Everyday I wake up, i have such tremendous brain fog. It's like my brain actively doesn't want me to do anything. I can't handle it anymore. 

I'm a diagnosed insomniac not taking any medication because my mom doesn't approve of meds, so that's my first problem. And at first I thought that all that brain fog and lack of energy came from that. But even when i sleep long enough my brain is always foggy.

What can I do to fix that. It's really taking a toll on me. I stopped learning the things I love because I always fear that I'm not absorbing the material because of it and my brain fog just doesn't go away.

I cannot even remember the last time I had a clear mind. I want to fix it so I can have a normal life and do what I want to do.

tl;dr: I need to fix my brain fog issue and lack of energy to be able to fix my life and do the things I love."
1583,"It has been going south for a while, but tonight it reached the south pole","\[22M Australia\]

Long story short, I give up as soon as I can to go back to doing nothing (gaming, internet etc). College took a break for Coronavirus and tried to do online stuff but didn't do a good job of it. I saw the opportunity and ""sub-consciously"" took it. I say that with quotes because I barely feel like I'm making logical decisions anymore, my body just says words and I live with the consequences later . I put in a letter of 'paused study' which means I take a break and pick up next semester. Studying online felt rough since I kept having to ask the lecturer questions on almost anything that we covered and even then I wasn't getting it.

My mum is extremely disappointed since she knows she didn't raise me with those kinda morals and she's right she didn't but I can't pull myself out of the 16 year long depression that I've been in. Every opportunity I've ever had has been screwed up either by me or by random circumstances. I lost all motivation to continue and I just can't be bothered with anything outside of gaming etc. Mum's put a lot of effort into motivating me with stuff and occasionally asks me how getting back into college is going, which I just get mad at her and try and shift the blame or attention somewhere else (either to a lecturer or an email not getting replied to).

That leads to tonight where she broke down and said she can't do it anymore. This has happened before and its for the same reasons. But this time felt different as she asked me what I wanted to do with my life, truly. I told her I don't want to do anything, I don't like the world with the people in it they're all greedy and self-centered etc etc. I understand there's some people out there who aren't like that but they are almost always superseded by a dozen of others. I told her I didn't want to live in that world and she said ""You want to kill yourself!?"" to which I agreed. I remember that since I was about 6 I was sitting in the bath with her next to me as ""I cried out I don't wanna live anymore"". I didn't think much of it but I noticed she immediately got more upset.

She got up and walked away and I followed her out. She turned to me and said ""Fine I'll say it. Kill yourself if you want to. I know that's what you've been waiting for someone to say"". It's true, it hit me hard but its true. I had been waiting 16 years for someone I loved to seriously tell me that. But as soon as she said it she started crying since, well, no mother should feel like they have to say those words. She walked away again and I followed her and gave her a hug as she told me how I keep blaming others and getting mad at her for trying to help. About wasted potential and squandered opportunity.

I just, I can't ever care about anyone other than myself. I don't feel empathy or sympathy towards other people, I don't get happy or sad. I used to get angry but that's dialed back a lot in the last few years. I think the best way to describe my emotions is ""disappointed"" and ""not-disappointed"". If someone says they're going to do something and they do it, I'm not disappointed in that even if they did a great job on it I still feel the same. If they don't do it then I'm disappointed and I just try and forget that we ever had an interaction and go back to doing 'nothing'. When I'm doing 'nothing', my mind is focused on the task at hand and I don't have time for emotions. I just do what I think will progress me to more content either something good to watch or best decision in a video-game.

I've done a couple jobs and courses around the place, work for the dole type deals. None have lasted more than a year and the first study I chose to do I didn't finish since I missed one assignment and they said I had to redo it, so surprise I didn't do it. I once had to move up north of the city (am currently south of it) for some work with a random company who promised a short course and guaranteed work at the end. I spent 3 months with them and then 1 week with a ""sister company"" for $150. They lied about work and the qualification they provided wasn't anything besides manual labour. When I asked them about the work they pawned me off to the owner's sister's friend's company who lied about how I didn't need my license.

I do stuff around the house, I'm respectful to guests and the rest of the family here. Mum says I'm a smart guy who could do well if he put in the effort. I'm taking medication that seemed to improve me from who I was before I started taking it. I've seen I believe 7 psychologists and nothing much has come of it besides the medication and saying how I don't have Borderline Personality Disorder.

I don't know what to expect from this lengthy post, its a vent but its also an admission of guilt. Guilt I feel is about how I'm emotionally a void. I cry when others cry or talk about something I've done in the past I'm not proud of. I don't remember the last time I was happy, only the times when something has made me laugh. We all make mistakes but I don't know how to fix this one.

Thanks for reading. No I'm not going to kill myself.

(a lot more has happened at various parts in my life that has affected me negatively, but this is very specifically relating to tonight)

1584,Self Diagnosis,"I know self diagnosing is highly stigmatized, but for me personally it's been a life saver. I tend to cling to labels because it helps me feel valid and in control, so when I was at my lowest mentally I decided I wasn't crazy and this was more suffering than the average person goes through and did all the research I possibly could and diagnosed myself with social anxiety and major depression. Eventually I got to a psychiatrist who confirmed the major depression, but the therapy was awful so I was never diagnosed with social anxiety. I know depression and anxiety go hand in hand almost every single time, but for a few years now I've been wondering if I might just have BPD with the depression and anxiety as symptoms. It's really hard to find good sources on BPD and I'm mistrustful of most mental health professionals after bad experience after bad experience with them. Not to say I doubt them intellectually, I just wouldn't go to them to ask for help on a personal level if I even had the ability to in the first place. I'm more hesitant to self diagnose BPD than I was with the depression and anxiety because BPD is a lot more complicated no matter how many resources I exhaust. I experience obsessiveness (over people mostly), I used to have extreme ups and downs in moods and ""irregular levels of energy"" like being extremely hyperactive one day and practically dead the next. I don't know if it relates but I only realized a few days ago that what I called superstition was actually hypervigilance. In the past I've had explosive melt downs and mental breaks, and the biggest reason I feel like I have a mental illness bigger than depression and anxiety, wether it's BPD or not, is that for the last 11/12 years I had dissociated into a caricature of a person, becoming all of the media I consumed and acting as myself through stereotypes and TV tropes, like being the Cool one of the group (I was obsessed with being perceived as cool and would freak out if anyone said I was) or the Abed Nadhir type or the Rebecca Bunch type etc. Lately internet culture is really triggering this side of me that I've mostly gotten under control in recent years. I used to be extraordinarily toxic because of this facade and I would manipulate every possible situation and person to make life like a TV show. I could literally get people to say exact phrases I stole from tv, that is how deeply I was pulling the strings, along with many other highly toxic behaviors. Now I know that might be its OWN thing or maybe I'm just fucking insane, but if you think I have BPD or something else I'd really appreciate the input because all of this Twitter and tiktok stuff where people are constantly saying things like ""I'm the main character"" is making it hard to live and I would just really like to know how to treat this because I've made, I feel, as much progress as I can at this point and I'm really proud of myself and I don't want to relapse into that mindset again. Thanks for reading and if you have any suggestions thank you in advance :) (also sorry if the flair is incorrect, I barely post)"

1586,Update on Richard Dillard,"I’m not sure if everyone saw a previous post mentioning him, but this man reached out to the public on YouTube for his mental health. He’s in a very bad place and is clearly struggling. 

One thing he mentioned was wanting to see his daughter, but can’t because of his financial situation. Can we raise money for him?"
1587,Just venting,"I honestly haven't told anyone about how I feel sometimes.  I've gone through a lot of things in my life, and have always fought to rise above them and not dwell on them and let them drag me down. But here lately I feel like I can't fight it anymore. I've felt so empty for a few months now. I don't know why, I'm finally in a healthy relationship with an amazing girl I love, I have a job that's perfect for me and pays good. I was happier than I've ever been for a while, but for few a months I feel like I'm going downhill, I keep messing up at work, leaving early and getting small checks, so I'm falling behind on bills. I feel like I've been cold to my girlfriend even though I want nothing more than to support her. I don't know I feel like this again, I just want to get things back on track but I've lost my motivation and drive to keep going. I don't want the tell my gf cause I hate people worrying about me. I don't even know what made me want to post this, I guess I finally broke and needed to rant in someway."
1588,"Overthinking, a never-ending novel","I overthinking and over-analyze almost every little thing. If things go wrong or there's an obstacle in my way that I didn't think about before then I freak out and give up and don't know how to solve the situation. This ruins things as little as jokes and as big as my trust in myself. I don't know how to stop, and it makes me feel like a loser because it takes the fun out of everything :( this is mostly a vent but if there is anything I can try to stop doing this, I'll try it 👉🏻👈🏻"
1589,"Have you ever heard of the podcast ""Feelin' Weird?""","I apologize if this isn't the subreddit to post this on, but I'm not trying to promote anything. I just wanted to share a podcast that I really, really resonated with that I think more people would like, too. It doesn't seem very popular, which confuses me because the content is so raw and memorable.

I discovered [Feelin' Weird on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/05ypxkRCMngoVdLelLfQSf?si=1zMKRbHMQBahehup20DISA) last January when I was going through a lot of really tough emotions. It seemed like it popped up randomly on my recommended feed when I needed it the most.  The host shares a lot of his own vulnerable moments as he suffers from binge eating, depression, and PTSD, while also interviewing others who have gone through some tough shit.

Show description from Spotify:

&gt;Gentle &amp; intimate conversations about taboo and stigmatized subjects (mental health, trauma, addiction, gender, etc.) with the goal of feeling less alone! Usually a few laughs, sometimes a few tears, but ALWAYS honest, genuine and real.

The podcast covers A LOT of topics from childhood trauma, to ADHD, eating disorders, and spiritual abuse. I haven't heard of a lot of mental health podcasts/channels that truly empathize with its viewers and interviewees like Feelin' Weird does. It's not just ""I suffered from X disorder and here's how I fixed myself."" It's more like, *""This is my story, and you're not alone.""* If you know of any other podcasts or YouTube channels, please comment your recommendations! I think there needs to be more content like this out there."
1590,(Urgent) Need some outside opinions,"So, this will be a long one but thanks for reading.

About 4 years ago my Mother was diagnosed with ALS and given maybe a year to live. Me, my Dad and my Sister were there to support her for the next 9 months as she slowly stopped being able to talk and to eat on her own. The ALS really only effected her mouth and throat. After about 9 months she eventually ended up vomiting, aspirating it, and getting a severe repository infection. Her immune system couldn’t keep up anymore and she died.

Ever since then I have temporarily dropped out of high school at grade 11 because of the stress it was causing me. I have been to a few different councillors and have been on Prozac for depression for a while. About two years ago I came off the Prozac and seemed okay.

It is now 6 days till the 3rd anniversary of her death and for the last 2 weeks I have been cripplingly afraid of dying. Not of when it will happen but of the endless nothingness afterward. I know that it is somewhat irrational but my brain keeps saying it isn’t.

Over the last week I have gotten slightly better by just talking to my Dad and my consultant that I’ve known for 8 years and I am trying to make an appointment with another councillor. But with COVID-19 it is getting pretty difficult to get into somewhere.

Luckily, I haven’t been suicidal at any point.

I mentioned to my Dad yesterday that it might be some sort of PTSD from the 9 month period because any time I hear death mentioned I have what is basically a small panic attack. I have not been in contact with anyone outside my family for the last 6 months but I’m not very social anyway.

I came here hoping someone has some advice or maybe had even been in the same sort of situation before. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Thanks again for the read"
1591,Living with ignorant parents is torture.,"My whole family is super ignorant and they are all such narcissists, i live and ""spend"" most of my time with my mother and i'm really starting to get tired of her bullshit. 

This honestly goes out to anyone who has children because if you'll treat them this way then you have no right to say that you are the victim in the situation, ignorance should not be excused if you don't even want to educate yourself. 

I show severe signs of depression and anxiety. Now about 3 or 4 months ago my mother found out about my harming scars which even at that time were already at least 3 months old, threw a tantrum at me because she thought i wanted to die when as you all know and understand, self harm isn't really the same as suicide, especially not in my case. I was doing it to release all of the emotional weight off myself, on top of the fact that i believed and even still believe that i deserved that pain, but no, that woman won't ever just shut up and listen. 
This sense of entitlement that i've seen a lot of parents even today have, its so fucking toxic that if your child honestly starts hating you, you have absolutely no right to call them spoiled or shit kids, because this is your fault, especially if you were given the chance to change and educate yourself on the matter many times in the past. 

My depression wasn't caused by interacting with certain friends mom, it wasn't caused because i read about it IN ORDER to educate myself. My depression isn't just laziness or me being a spoiled teenager who's life is just so great that it gets boring so i just decided to spice things up one day. Do i know more about it than you? Yes i do, because i decided to not stay shallow and be like you, i decided to educate myself on it, which is apparently too much to ask for from a person that was supposed to take every little bit of responsibility for me when you decided to give birth to me. And no, you don't get a thank you for getting me help, its your job to do that as my mother, it is the bare minimum, just like it is to get me the necessary medical help or clothes or food or a roof under my head. And no, I'm not trying to ""embarrass"" you by telling you that youre not doing what you should be doing. Grow the fuck up people, its never late to change out of this stubborness."
1592,I’m honestly feeling really shitty about myself today,"I’m laying in bed and I’m just feeling like a shitty person. Shitty about my life, or at least the way I see life. I’m too idealistic, and honestly it just makes me stupid. No one understands me and no one wants to understand me. Nobody cares so I just don’t care. 
It’s like I just want to throw everything away and get back into my shadow side. I feel unworthy of anything because of how hard it’s been for me. My feeling of being unworthy and wrong and flawed is due to everything that’s happened to me that said to my face “you’re nothing”
I don’t know why I’m even here."
1593,Volunteering with mentally ill kids,"I’m F17 and in my country you can volunteer for 2 years in doing several jobs, one of them being volunteering with kids and teens with mental and emotional problems. Do you guys think it’ll be a good idea to volunteer with kids and teens with mental illnesses/ emotional problems/ behavioural problems/ from bad homes?
I’m asking since I think because I’ve experienced and still experiencing emotional problems myself and have also experienced emotional abuse and neglect I might actually know how to help some kids find someone they can relate to and ease their problems, but I am also a little scared that it will damage my mental health even more. 
I do feel as if I don’t do it I’m actually just wasting my childhood and teen years experiences :( 

Sorry if this is not related to my own mental health, I hope this is ok :)"
1594,A maze of dead ends,"I had my first episode of anxiety/shame when I was a kid. Now I'm in my twenties. So for over a decade, there's never been a time I felt ""ok"". The best I've attained is fleeting moments of peace or happiness that are painfully brief. 

It's gotten to the point where hanging out with people is starting to feel pointless. I'm so deeply unhappy that chit chatting with acquaintances feels like a waste of time. So many people have come in and out of my life. And many have taken advantage of me. I used to easily open up to people and tell them about myself,  my problems and struggles. But recent incidents a few months ago, really hammered home the lesson that I can't trust most people.

 In the past I've been the type of person who rolls over on my back to get friends. I will share my vulnerabilities and at the same time offer them anything. But again and again I've been used or abandoned. So it's a dilemma. It feels meaningless to only be able to connect on a surface level, but there's almost no one in person I trust enough to share anything meaningful with. I've made the same mistakes too many times. I've asked people I barely know for help, and shared personal details with them. And the way it turns out is they think I'm weird, they don't care, they have too much else going on, they flat out take advantage of me or they react badly because I'm coming at them with heavy shit when they don't even know me that well. I can understand that- you have to build relationships before going in deep with shit. But too often, I feel so desperate that I will resort to these measures. 

Part of the problem is I fluctuate between intense emotions, depression and apathy on a daily basis. Like, I feel deeply. Alotta times I just want to scream or cry or yell. Also doing something physical helps get the negative emotions out. But there's rarely a good time to do any of these things. If I do these things in the wrong context it will disturb others and people will think I'm crazy. The only times it is okay to act that way is at a concert, club or in theatre. Well covid has made those things even harder. Its against social distancing to go and sing or dance out the trauma that lives inside. Same with theatre. The theatre community is hard to get into in general because it's mostly for professionals or those who are artsy and connected. Theatre is also harder to get involved with because of covid. There's also the issue of safety and privacy in public settings like this. Club's are full of predators and theatre companies have pecking orders, interpersonal conflicts and politics like everywhere else. 

For a time, I used fashion to deal with my internal state. I painted my face in extreme ways, wore expressive clothing and jewelry. But I can't do that anymore. Doing that makes me too vulnerable to other people. Too easy to read. Sometimes on my really dark days, I have the urge to dress in all black, with corsets, black lipstick and extreme eye makeup. But it's just not worth it anymore. And even though it works to get attention- most attention is not good or helpful even if people give you compliments. And people will assume things about you. I feel that there's no safe place. And this knowledge leads to greater feelings of apathy and depression. I can't sing, dance, scream, draw, paint or costume any of the emotional pain away. If I do it has to be contained and in private. Maybe in a journal. Or in an anonymous reddit group related to mental health ;  )  Even then, posting this could backfire on me. Idk how secure this site is. 

As far as therapy goes, I'm seeing a therapist who is pretty nice. But I don't like the one sided nature of the interaction. And I don't trust her either. I hardly know anything about her and have already told her a lot. I feel like she gets to feed off my energy and yet I still have to pay her for sessions. She gets to hear intimate things about the details of my life, and the way I think- but she hasn't done anything to deserve learning those things about me. Granted, it does help to talk to someone. And she has to use a lot of her emotional energy listening to me and trying to help me problem solve. But I don't even know if she's dealt with mental health issues- let alone the type of stuff Ive had to live with for so long. It just feels bad. I don't even want to tell her some of the stuff I'm writing in this post.

I have a few friends out of state who talk with me sometimes. But there's problems there too. They seem to be happier than me, and more socially connected. Theyve also made more reasonable life choices. In my situation, chronic mental illness has contributed to me making impulsive decisions that have put me in life threatening and traumatic situations. The differences and distance between us make it hard to connect. I know they have their own pain but they dont open up to me as much as i open up to them. It feels unequal. And I feel like the fun sucking friend. The one that always has bad news. And who is sad all the time. And that's sad because I have a sunny, hopeful and silly side to my personality that rarely seems to come out."
1595,I almost killed myself last night,"Last Monday I was discharged from a residential eating disorder program and moved into their transitional housing apartment to do PHP. I thought I would have time with PHP but my case manager said I would only have three weeks then I would have to do IOP at a completely different program, start all over and I know I'll fail. I'm alone in this apartment until later today when my roommate discharges and joins me. I went to my dad's house last night and picked up 35 benadryl. Put them all together with about 13 ativan and put it to my mouth. I am so tired of life. I am a burden on society. I made friends in res and they have to mother me all the time, it's too much for them. After I'm done in 3 weeks I will have to go back to my dad's house because I can't afford to go anywhere else. I'm over it and just need the strength to put those pills in my mouth."
1596,Gaining confidence and fearing everyone is mad at you/spiraling,"I need help not hating myself. It’s not just a physical thing. I hate everything about myself, how I think, how I sound, how I look, how I process things. It makes it so hard to crawl out of my depression. Meanwhile I feel the people in my life are growing inpatient with my mental health problems. I’m trying the best I can I have therapy twice a week, I do tons of independent exercises, I track all my habits to make sure I’m not letting myself slip into depression. It helps but it’s still lingering over my head and I’m afraid I’m going to drive everyone away."
1597,"Almost a year and a half ago, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I fear losing her everyday.",She is luckily in remission now and I am forever thankful. She was only 48 when she was diagnosed and it broke my heart. It is just her and I and she is my everything. Every since day I worry about her. She is still weak from the medicine she has to take for a few years. I’m always scared something will happen on her way to work or home from work. I stay up in the mornings until it is time for her to have arrived at work and anxiously wait when I know she has left work. I cry nearly everyday thinking about it. I worry if something were to happen at the house with just her and my dog there. I fear going away to college in the fall because I won’t be there. I fear the coronavirus deeply because she is immunocompromised. I am so tired of feeling this way. I feel broken-hearted when I see her and I want to feel happy around her. How do I heal?
1598,Why do they tell you to ask for help if you're going to hurt yourself?,"I'm not trolling. I literally don't understand the mixed messages society gives me. As a background, I do not have friends. 

Everything I have read says, ""if you're afraid you're going to hurt yourself, SAY something to somebody."" But when I finally told someone what I wanted to do, they didn't say anything back? It makes them uncomfortable and I don't blame them. What can they say? besides, ""that sucks..""

And what do they spam all over the radio, the internet, TV, music videos, everywhere? CALL THE SUICIDE HOTLINE! Sure, but when you call, they just tell you to go to the hospital or call 911. I live in the US so this practice has racked up quite a bill. Calling 911 is about the worst thing you can do. About a hundred police will break down your door, shove you to the ground, handcuff you, drag you off to some psych ward. In the psych ward, the first thing they want is for you to get naked. What does this have to do with getting help? They want to see your scars, they say. I haven't got any scars, I tell them, I'm just sad. But they want you naked. You can refuse, but they will tie you down and rip off your clothes. They will inject you with psycho-actives to make you compliant. 

And then? After a 5 minute chat with a traveling psychiatrist who will diagnose you with major depression, or some such thing, and a note from said travelling psychologist stating that you need to find yourself some ""after-care,"" whatever that is, they will shove you out the door. Nevermind that you don't have money for the bus, or even shoes on, since the cops dragged you out of your house without warning in order to get you some ""help.""

And you're on your own again. Maybe you call around to different therapists in the area looking for the elusive ""help"" they assure you is ""out there."" Where is the help? I live in a rural town where about 20 people kill themselves every year. Nobody I call is accepting new patients. I was placed on a 3 month waiting list 6 months ago. Sessions are $120 each. 

Where is the help? Why bother telling people to ""pick up the phone"" if the person on the other end of the line hasn't got a clue how to help? Why give false hope in the first place? Why not say, look, no one is going to help you, nobody cares, But if you want to survive this, here's how?"
1599,Ranting,"Idk if this is the right place but no one else listens so here I go

Just yesterday I was feeling pretty flat and started to remember that this all happened and then I realised that I can’t remember their name.
I can’t remember their name...
What they look like...
And now I’m filled with so much guilt and everything’s becoming too much to deal with.
I know from talking to my therapist I have a few repressed memories from when I was younger to the point where I’ve got the majority of a year blank that I can’t remember but I didn’t realise it happens that easily.

I hate myself so much for forgetting their name and what they look like. Does anyone know if I can do anything to remember?

1603,Rapid cycling with Bipolar Disorder,"Hello,

Not asking for a diagnosis, my friend is in the process of getting a GP and psychiatrist. This question is purely by own curiosity, and hopefully will help me learn about what hes going through. I have a friend (21, male) who is pretty sure he has bipolar disorder. He has manic episodes where he has impulse bought expensive things, shaved his head (done or to lockdown haircuts becoming a thing!) and is generally very irritable and easily gets angry. During depressive episodes he stays in his room all day, ignores his phone and doesnt really eat. It seems to have gotten much worse over the COVID period (or maybe it's just more noticable now he has little to do).

The thing is, he seems to switch between the two moods almost weekly (one week manic, next week really depressed), which seems far quicker than anything I've read. I'm pretty sure these are bipolar symptoms, but I'm not sure about the time frame. From what I've read he each episode lasts much longer (a couple of months?), while he cycles weekly. For your experience, is this normal of BD?

Sorry for my ignorance, I just want to help my friend and filling in these gaps in my knowledge might help me understand his behaviour and help support him. 

Thanks"

1607,How to deal with a partner who doesn't share his feelings?,"Me (19) and my boyfriend (22) have been in a relationship for last 2 years. We had our ups and downs like every other relationship. He is a very calm-headed person. I had anger issues (I'm getting better day by day). He let me know he hasn't been happy for last 2 years one month ago (he dropped out of his university 2 years ago, we got into relationship some months after). He still isn't over the university thing and I think the main reason behind this is he has never spoken to me or anyone else about this, no matter how many times I've asked him to do that. He thinks that he bothers people with his sadness. I always try my best to be supportive with these. When he let me know he isn't happy, I asked him to send me a 'code picture' whenever he is sad, he didn't do it either. The worst part is he always bursts out whenever we are on a fight. For example, I did something a year ago or months ago, he didn't tell me that then. This is really bugging me. The last thing I did is, I made a spreadsheet, I asked him to fill it up daily so that I get to know about his day and if he felt sad or not. ( Idk if it sounds silly but I had to do this)"
1608,How to Deal with Financial Anxieties,"I have financial anxieties; often being worried that I’ll end up homeless or living in crime-heavy areas. I compare myself to my best friend who, at the age of 25, recently bought a house. He makes twice what I make yet didn’t go to college like myself (*meanwhile I deal with loan debt*). This makes me wonder if college was a waste of time and money. I want to provide for my wife, but the cost of living is daunting. I’m unsure what to do as a career since the idea of loving what one does as a job/career seems to be a myth (*I base this on the idea that most Americans work to survive, not because they enjoy it*). I am an average USA citizen and doubt I’ll ever be wealthy. I just want a comfortable life with minimal financial stress. However, as of now, I’ve given up on the American dream and want to be practical about finances.

Any advice on how to deal with financial anxieties?"
1609,I mimic others personalities?,"Hello everyone. I hope you’re all doing well in these chaotic times of ours. I’ve been doing some thinking about a conversation i had with my brother yesterday, and things are starting to worry me. 

So, in a nutshell, we were both hanging out (I’m 21, he’s 30) And he said something along the lines of “i’ve basically figured out every family members psyche” And this really peaked my interest, because it’s always interesting to see other people’s views on you. But what he said was just extremely true, and shook a lot of my views. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, along with a constant generalized anxiety. But basically, he laid out my last 3 years of life and what i’ve been doing. And in short, i’ve been mimicking my brothers personalities/other peoples over time. For example, my brothers drug phase-i went through the same thing, my other brothers right wing views-which i also picked up, streetwear-from a friend. Basically, everything he said was true. So my anxious brain decides to google some things, and it turns out that this is like a huge sign pointing to a personality disorder of some sort.

Do i need to talk to my therapist about this? I’m really concerned about it at this point, partly from my anxiety, partly just me. But is this something i need to talk about and figure out? Is this a mental illness of some sort? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.


TL;DR- brother broke down my psyche, i’ve been mimicking personalities for about 3 years now, i’m extremely confused and am unsure what to do"
1610,I’m thinking of overdosing,"Dear Reddit, 

Recently the days have only gotten harder. Sleep doesn’t come easy anymore, I wake up feeling so unenthusiastic about the day. Nothing that used to interest me is appealing. My appetite has shrivelled into smaller portions, I’m missing breakfast more often and I’m constantly sick to my stomach. My parents... I’ve been blamed for screwing up my relationship with them and I’ve been told they feel like they’ve failed as parents because of relationship choices I’ve made. I’ve been told I’m a disappointment, made to feel like my intelligence has been put into question and that they want nothing to do with me anymore because to them I’m just a liar who betrayed them by liking a boy before I was 18. Now the situation is a bit more complex than that but that’s the gist of it. 

This is the first time I’ve ever really planned how I’d want to take my life. My mother has a drawer full of pills. Strong pain killers, prescription. I’ve taken them at normal dosage before, the usual drowsiness side effect. I want to take more. 

I’ve given up on everything at this point. My body feels like an empty vessel. I smile while being yelled at by my parents, to hid the face that I’m in pain and that their words hurt. Because it’s my fault. It’s always my fault. I did this to them. I’m the ungrateful one. So why do I deserve to live? 

I have a sister (10 yrs), a best friend, and a boyfriend who I think I might directly effect. But I’ve thought about it and I’m not sure I care enough to not consider going through with it. I know it would hurt them but I’m tired, I’ve been tired. Now the drama with my parents has fuelled the flames of my anxiety and depression. I’ve always bottled everything, that’s how I’ve coped with things. I don’t like to cry because that makes me feel less strong. 

I’ve literally prayed for death. Because I’m tired, so, so tired."
1611,I'm scared,"I suffer from OCD. I take anti-depressants for about a week now. And I'm supposed to start CBT next week. But I can't stop these thoughts. I stream on twitch and kn youtube. And a lot of stuff has been happening too fast. I have like 4 different things in my mind at a certain time. Everyond loves me and they tell me it'll be okay. My parents support me as welland will be there for me if needed. I have a team who supports me with everything. From creating content to editing and thumbnails. Everyone gladly helps and enjoys the content and helps cause they like me. But I can't stop these thoughts. I workout, I try to eat healthy. But I just don't know. It hurts. I feel this pain in my chest every time and it hurts so fucking badly.
I'm scared that my channel will die or something. I am scared that I won't be able to create content not because of my own limits. But because of the big corporations and I will just get demolished and won't be able to experience the things I work so hard for. Everyone is telling me it'll be okay but I just dont know. I sweat so much and I can barely eat cause of this stress. Please someone I don't know what to do I am begging"

1615,Let down by mental health service.,"I've been sitting on this for a while now and i think im hitting the dead end for a conclusion. Hi im a student (19F) from Northern Ireland.

So to start off, I have been battling insomnia for a very long time (almost 8 years or so) &amp; there has been underlying issues lately that have risen up in the recent weeks &amp; due to the lockdown its been a struggle dealing with my mental health (As everyone else surely would aswell.)

Well, i reached out to my GP a few weeks ago, and was referred to the MH services again. I thought, aw great back at it again (as i was discharged from them just 2 yrs ago and i had mixed feelings about it).

I had an updated mental health assessment done, it was a very thorough and indepth one which kinda messed up my head abit as the woman assessing me over the phone threw my entire mental state back when I was 11 yrs old. (Without disclosing too much detail). She gave me a quick summary that I was apparently  hypervigilant due to the childhood trauma and had poor emotional management and was unstable inspite of me still managing to function on a daily basis but (and I quote she said-) ""only to a certain extent"".
I felt traumatised the whole day after the assessment and hadnt felt like myself a few days later.

A week later, she called me back and said "" We realised youre a student at x *university. So the team has concluded, to reduce the pressure in our services if you can just speak to your Uni. Frankly, your GP should have known you were a student before referring to us."" 

I was taken aback by their response. I explained that I had already reached out to the Uni student guidance centre prior to my GP appointment but my Uni does not have as much staff to support so many students &amp; if people would agree and advoce this- the waiting lists were wayy too long! Not to mention, no one got back to me to arrange an apppointment &amp; I reached out twice. 

I felt so upset and the woman just responded back, ""Well our team leader has already decided."" And that was that.

I felt so let down and betrayed after all the thorough assessment and digging up all the sensitive parts of my life  that ive suppressed for years,only just to be told that they couldnt help me. I spoke to staff from my uni and said how upsetting it was as they said my Uni couldnt offer anything w medication. I was really hoping i could get something to help with my sleep better and to figure out how to manage everything else. 

I just want to be able to go to bed every night and not wake up at an awkward time. It got so bad over the lockdown i would have breadowns like clockwork because of the anxiety I felt, which in return causes me not being able to sleep. ik im prob overreacting and  ik its a basic thing to just shut your eyes and nod off.. But ive battled it for years... And im tired. I'm always tired.

 I literally only get about 3-4 and a half hrs a day and its so draining. And when im now wanting to do somethin about it i'm left in the air. 

I dont really know which direction to go now. Would really appreciate any advice at all."
1616,I've Had Enough...,"This will be long, so sorry for that. The last five years have been hell. My life has never been great, I have always struggled with depression and anxiety. It has only gotten worse though. 

I am going to try to keep this short because the whole story could fill a book. So we are just going back to recent events. I have been jobless for 4 years. I was never great at talking too or relating to anyone, but since I lost that job, on top of all the anxieties that come with having no money, and a girlfriend with crippling mental disabilities, I have lost my ability to talk to people without feeling like I am having heart attack. 

The mere thought of trying to stand there behind some grill, or in some store for 8 hours and try to talk to somebody, while they look at me like I am stupid for not knowing how to respond, or what to say makes me want to die. 

This might seem like a harsh reaction to just a basic social situation, but there are A LOT of other factors at play here, it isnt just this that makes me want to just end it. I am plagued by panic attacks daily, about life, existence, what I am doing, where I am going, going to the store, getting enough sleep, the fact that my best friend is a complete ass hole that just uses me and creates more problems for me. 
 
I used to just do drugs about it, but that is not exactly healthy, and with my current living situation there are kids here and I will not subject them to that kind of thing. Therapy is also not an option unfortunately as I would LOVE to go back, but I HAVE to get a job in order to survive, and can not afford therapy, and do not qualify for a med card that will pay for it whilst having a job. 

I am at complete wits end. It feels like suicide has become my only option to escape this constant panic about nearly everything. I do not want to die, and I am pretty sure I am too chicken shit to actually go through with it, as I have tried before, not to mention I am terrified of the concept of going to Hell but...wth do I do? What other option is here for me? I can not get help, as much as I truly want it. I feel completely idiotic for reaching out to random people on the internet for advice, but this is what I have left.

Tldr 
Life is in shambles, always has been. Feels like suicide is my only option to escape despite being terrified of death."
1617,Looking for validation after years of struggling (sexual trauma?),"Hi friends, 

This is a throwaway account and I’ve never talked to anyone about this, but it’s something that still affects me deeply, years after the fact. I’m mostly just looking for reassurance, if not a “name” for what happened. It wasn’t rape, as I didn’t say no or very clearly withdraw consent. But I wanted to super often.

Basically, from high school to early college I was in a relationship with a boy for whom I had to do a lot of emotional labor, before I knew what that was. He had a hard home life and was remarkably well-adjusted considering, but I always felt like more of a safety blanket than a truly valued partner. 

Important context is that I was a very shy teenager. I still struggle to stick up for myself in one-on-one relationships, but I’ve gotten much better since. He often ignored boundaries I tried to gently set, like personal space, staying past when I wanted him to leave, etc. I always felt incredibly guilty for that. I value personal space, and I’d always have to ask him 3-4 times “when are you thinking of heading out?” “I should get to bed” etc. before he’d even consider leaving. Even when I’d have panic attacks and desperately needed space, he’d say “I don’t understand why my being here isn’t helping.” It took A LOT for me to even stick up for myself, and when I did he’d just argue and ignore it.

I didn’t know what to tell him, and I internalized a lot of that by thinking I just wasn’t a very giving girlfriend. But I slowly started to resent spending time with him/being on close proximity to him because of it. Even when we’d be sleeping in the same bed, he’d grab at my chest and just pull me in in a semi-sexual way when I was absolutely not into it. I began physically recoiling from him as instinct, and I still have issues when my current boyfriend touches my chest. 

Anyway, the sex began to feel very one-sided, and being the shy teen I was, I didn’t know how to say anything, and I very much felt like it was me being a dysfunctional partner if I didn’t commit to regular sex. Here’s the important part: I don’t remember a time I ever said “no” and he continued sex. But SO often he’d grab me or do something much smaller and I’d have to say “stop” multiple times before he’d stop. There were boundary and consent issues, but it didn’t feel that serious at the time because it was little things like touching me too much or grabbing at me when I tried to pull away. My mind didn’t really register that as bad, but my body definitely did. 

We both had a very hard time communicating about deeply emotional/intimate stuff - which I don’t believe was entirely our faults, as we were young and fairly shy. So we didn’t talk about sex. It just became something I decided to endure. I have very vivid memories of just laying there, my face turned away, just clenching my jaw and waiting for him to be done. I’d try to hide some of the discomfort - but another part of me is still grappling with WHY he didn’t see that I was uncomfortable/in pain/ just enduring. He had to have known to some degree. I’d sometimes cry after sex because it felt so intimately violating. He’d hold me. But it all felt very retroactive, like he’d continue to do it and handle the fallout afterward. Idk. 

After a while this became normal for me, and there were a couple times where he’d bend me over (so my face was sort of hidden - that was a consensual position) and I’d start to panic so much that tears would be streaming down my face, but I told myself “you just need to let him finish.” Of course, when he saw that I was crying he’d feel bad &amp; hold me. But we wouldn’t really talk about it. I felt totally unable to bring it up. 

All of this, coupled with the fact that he cheated on me in a very out-of-left-field, gaslight-y, painful way the year prior fed into the panic and silencing I felt. 

But again, I never verbally withdrew consent. 

About a year after we broke up, though, I started having pretty dramatic flashbacks and panic attacks, all centered around sex and feeling totally out of control of my own body. It’s still with me to this day - about 5 years after the fact, and it’s become a regular problem in my new relationship (with a really lovely, open partner). I panic and cry a lot during sex. I hate it. I hate him, honestly, and I wish I could make this go away. I hate that it feels like he still has some level of control over my body. 

But, he has no idea. He doesn’t know he ever did anything wrong by me, let alone that I’m dealing with this trauma years out. Haven’t spoken to him in years. And even though I hate him when this stuff comes back up, I do believe he’s a good guy and I wish him well. It’s hard to explain. He really just doesn’t know.

Basically, I’m really struggling with how to identify and address this, because I can’t even justify my feelings to myself. It wasn’t rape, it likely wasn’t assault because I didn’t feel confident enough to communicate or withdraw consent (I still don’t know if I WOULD have if I knew how - I felt such a responsibility to just get it done and over with). It’s a lot of gray area, and I go back and forth between “he didn’t know” and “how the fuck could he not have known?” 

Does anyone have a similar experience or any kind of advice on how to identify/make peace with this kind of trauma? (Calling it trauma still feels disingenuous to me - but it causes me physical panic attacks, so....)"
1618,Any Good Stress/Anxiety Relief Apps?,"I find certain low brain power games help me personally, but I'm really looking for a sort of guided mental health app, particularly one that can help me reduce panic early on before I actually go full blown anxiety attack. 
Anyone come across useful outlets? 
Personally I find that idle games help me, specifically Realm Grinder
Thanks :) have a great day everybody"
1619,What to tell a friend who is mentally still struggling with covid?,"Long story short, my friend is an extremely talented and highly esteemed colleague that has been housebound since covid has started.  He is gripped by fear.  Legitimate fear.  I am having a really hard time finding the right words to say to him.  I don’t want it to just be the typical “it’ll get better” or “hang in there” yada yada.  He’s starting to experience physical symptoms on top of the mental.  He has never been like this, ever.  What can I say? Thank you."
1620,Can I go to a phycologist to clear me of any mental health issues?,"I want to be a police officer in the future, but I was diagnosed with all sorts of mental health issues due to trauma from my abusive dad. All the diagnosis was made when I was 16

I had since moved to my mom's, and have no symptoms of anything I was diagnosed. Can I go to a psychologist to be cleared of the diagnosises, or have it on record that I am no longer suffering from mental illness?"
1621,Am I normal or should I see a doctor to get tested for an illness of some kind?,"   It’s been really bothering me,  especially over the last few months I’ve experienced what I call a foggy brain,   I’ve seen other people speak of it.  It’s really hard to focus, and I kind of zone out.   Not really able to focus on anything.     It’s really starting to effect me at work and home because I’ll forget what I was doing,  misplace things,  get distracted easily... but then sometimes I get really focused on doing one thing and it just completely takes over,   Almost like a need to complete something like cleaning around the house, usually I forget but sometimes I’ll just be super focused on getting it done that everything else fades away.   And next thing I’ll know hours have past.   Same for video games... I’m an extremely avid gamer and play for many hours usually.    Some days I have a hard time choosing what game to play, and often switch between them because I can’t decide what to do, and other days I know exactly what I want to do and only do that.  

I don’t understand if this is normal,  but I’ve been searching for answers  most of my answers link these symptoms to ADHD, and I’m scared.   I’m scared of asking for help because I don’t want to waste the doctors time if it’s normal, fuck I don’t even know if the doctor will see me with covid going on.  

I could really use some advice,  I’m hoping to find some local options,  but if some online options are available I’ll try too.  My city is Saskatoon Saskatchewan,  I’ve reached out to LDAS which is a local help centre that deals with learning disabilities including ADHD to see what my options are but again I’m scared of wasting people’s time. 

I’ll try to respond to any questions or comments I might forget about this thread so if I don’t reply right away that’s why"
1622,Having a not the best time,"So quick non detailed background. I have PTSD, MDD and likely some other acronyms rattling around from just a whole bunch of stuff. I learned I was getting divorced in March and it’s been a struggle since then. I went off the rails for a while into depression and self loathing so, I felt like hell which makes sense.

Here is the bit that absolutely crushes me. I did my research, spoke to my therapist. About 3 months ago I started to regularly keep a gratitude journal, started a new art hobby, practice meditation, work out, eat a balanced healthy diet, sleep at least 8 hours a night....and I feel worse than I ever have. At this point I’m at a loss, I tried doing things in a healthy and unhealthy way both with the same result. 

If anyone has any ideas on how to at least find some small amount of peace I’m willing to try anything."
1623,Making progress slowly,My dad taught us to be strong and need feel our feelings.I have noticed that I am sort of scared of intimacy because I'm not comfortable with being vulnerable. I have a lot of work to do seeing that I live at home till I move out and I have to pretend like I'm alright all of time. I'm not trying to block out my emotions but I just feel anger and resentment towards my dad. I feel alone in my house and I am the only one in my family that chooses to work on myself to better my mental health.
1624,I tend to have little to no filter when speaking or social awareness,"Hi I think I might have a problem. I tend to find myself to speak with no filter around the people that I am comfortable around with. I used to pride myself in have this ability to ""roast"" others as I thought it was me being brutally honest. But nowadays I realize how messed up and hurtful some of my comments were, especially to those people I am comfortable around because I know them really well, and some of the hurtful things that I say are things that they are really insecure about. I've lost many friends because they told me on multiple occasions that my comments were hurtful/disrespectful, I apologize and truly feel bad but I find it hard to change the way that I speak. I find it hard to make friends at first but when I get comfortable around them, I'll start to say none filtered things again and ruin another friendship. I often find myself lonely but at the same time make zero effort to try to go out and make friends. I will ghost many of my friends bc I don't want to/ feel like putting effort in online conversations bc I prefer to talk IRL. I find going out with friends very exhausting sometimes. I currently don't have any real friends, and I've said some really hurtful things to my gf before that I feel really terrible about. I tend to become obsessive in one thing for about 3 months then would drop it. Am I just a spoiled asshole who is inconsiderate of other's feelings or is it something else like AD, bc I really want to genuinely change for the better. I took the Asperger’s Quotient Test online and got a 24, I don't know what that means. Please I feel like I need some help. What is wrong with me because I don't know. Thank you"

1628,Self Love,"Hello everyone. These past few months have been hard on me and I felt like the world hates me. Every day I wanted to die and when I wake up, I feel disappointed because I'm still alive.  But then I told myself that nothing will change if I'm not gonna step forward so I made a letter and sent it to the girl I love.

Ever since I was a child, I'm not good at opening up to other people, and yesterday I just steeled myself and open up to the girl I love. She said that I need to learn how to love myself before I can love others because if not, then there will be more problems coming into my life and she also said that I should not rush it and I need to change for myself and not for others (God I really love her).

After that, I had a deep reflection on myself. I always think that people secretly hate me and that I constantly feel that I'm just a burden for everybody. If a person doesn't reply to me I will tend to think that person dislikes me or I might have done something stupid that makes them hate me. I also think that people are talking to me because they are just being kind or they are bored and don't have someone to talk to. Even now I'm having a hard time trying to reconnect to my friends because I feel like I might just waste their time and I also think that they might not reply to me because I've taken a break from social media for almost 4 months. I can't stare at my face in the mirror or in a picture even for a short time since I feel like that I'm ugly, even if other people are saying that my face is decent. Also, sometimes when I am in a group of people and they are all having a casual conversation, I tend to be quiet since I'm afraid that they might not relate or ignore what I'm going to say.  This leads me to my question:  How can I truly love myself when all I can see are my flaws?"
1629,how do you get motivated to brush you teeth?,"today i noticed that my right front tooth looks way different than before. it's very short and seems to be breaking. 
i never brush my teeth and it's been like this for more than 7 or 8 years. i only brush them when the cavities get really bad or when i'm tired of only eating with my two front teeth. i'm 16, so i can't just get up and go to a dentist. 
i always try searching up how to get motivated with simple tasks like this but they never help. i wanted to try making an alarm, but i cant because i have to put my phone up at the time my mom tells me to and i cant get it again until she says i can which is mostly after 2-5pm. i have to wake up at 8am or ill get in trouble, so it's impossible to try this method.
i put a sticky note on my bathroom wall telling me to brush my teeth earlier. as embarrassing as that is, i have a feeling that might help but idk cuz i can never depend on myself to continue doing the things i need to do.
sorry for this long post, but i seriously need help. i dont want to lose my teeth, so please give me some suggestions."

I KNOW, I know for a fact that my mental health is fucked up. I am okay with being sad or depressed or anxious. I don't wanna be angry bc it hurts the people I love. I don't wanna yell at my lil sister and brother about smth dumb. I CAN't HELP IT I SWEAR. I don't know what it is, everything pisses me off so much.

I just can't put it down. I just can't. I try putting it down and then before I know it, I've picked it back up again. If I could get my hands on some rubber bands, I'm seriously considering putting it on and snapping the back of my hand whenever I start losing focus.

I can't go to the doctor to get tested for anything cuz lockdown and it's just getting worse. Today I experienced some crazy mood swings. I laughed at a meme for too long and then spent a few hours feeling empty and useless. The thing that scared me the most was that I didn't even feel like the same person during the episode if that makes sense. I'm really scared it might happen again and want to take steps to prevent it because I have a feeling this isn't the worst it can get.

I am 64 kilos. My goal was 65. And you know, they were right. It didnt change my life in the way i wanted to.

I  spend all my time in quarataine focused on diet and exercise. I was so  passionate about it i didnt care about anything else. I bought a road  bike and i go on it everywere. I never thought i could lose the weight  but i am on my way to 60 kilos. I started at 70. I got the hang of it  and i feel i can built muscle and lose fat whenever i want. Ofcourse it  changed my life. In the way that i am now a fit, more muscular person  that cares about their health. But that was not the reason why i wanted  to lose the weight. I thought i would be appreciated, i would be more  confident, that i would fit into society in a way i didnt before. That i  would be the person i truly wanted to be. And being fit does not have  so much to do with that as i thought it would.

I  had such a tunnelvision for a long time that i didnt develop any other  interests. Even my school grades suffered because i wanted to lose the  weight so much.

Now i have a six  week break from school. And i feel like this is the time to figure out  what i can do to become the person i want to be. But i have no clue  where to start. All i do now is look at my phone and watch youtube all  day to fill the void.

I was fired from my job in January for calling in sick. On 2 different occasions. Really knocked me for six. Yesterday I drove up upon a horrific car wreck, trained in first aid I assisted until first responders arrived. 

One didn’t make it, I didn’t even need to touch the person to know. But I did check for a pulse just to be sure. (RIP) 

Then all of a sudden it hit me!! Bam my mother died 6 years ago and watching her died hit me all over again, now I never broke down but the feeling I wanted to. They say once you see death it never leaves you. This is true!! 

Yet another death my partner father of my 2 children 17+15 a very tragic accident. This hit me really hard my children too. My eldest will be 18 this year and I have nothing for him. 

Things drastically changed in my life and I cut off everything and everyone from my life, not completely now but still cut off. I stopped going out I stopped applying for jobs for the fear of rejection at my age! Stopped going out socially stopped meeting with friends for lunch/dinner. 

I am on medication I find it helps but it’s like there’s something missing, I’ve no energy tired most of the day and no get up and go feeling..

1641,"My doctor's tell me im fine, why don't I feel fine..","I'm just writing this to let it out.. I do not expect anyone to respond to this i just wanna, idk, ask into the void that's called the internet haha.

I'm 20 now. My doctor and psychologist told me 2 years ago that i was fine. I was cured of my depression. I didn't self harm that often (I'm clear now) and my mood was a little better.

And for a little while i felt better. 6 months ago i moved in by my boyfriend. And around 3 months ago the negative thinking came back. Wenn im alone i just cry.. I  cry in my bed with nothing on my mind.

I don't have a reason to be sad. I don't know why i feel this way, i was suppose to be cured.. Wenn i tell my boyfriend (this isn't to often because i don't wanna be irritating or a stupid child that cries over everything) he comforts me and tells me that i just need to let go more. Just let my thoughts go. But i don't know how.

I have no idea how to help myself and i don't want to ask him for help over and over again. My bf thinks i don't need a psychologist or anything because it isn't that kind of problem in my head and i just need a little peace in my head. But idk what i need or what i feel. I have no idea what this feeling of emptiness is. I just feel nothing.. Just like 2 years ago.. I don't wanna be that depressed girl again..

Well this is a long enough rend into the void for today.

If you read this thank you for reading my stupid post.

1643,Tiny things make me cry and i can’t stop it no matter how hard i try,"Everyone at school knows me as “that one girl who always cries for no reason”. I was sensitive for as long as i can remember, even when i was a child, a few years old, i would easily get upset and cry all the time. It’s hard— impossible to just suck it up. I grew up not to be ashamed of crying. I’ve cried in probably every possible place - coffee shops, hospital, bus, school, friend’s place and etc. Such things as just raised voice, not agreeing with my opinion, thoughts about losing someone and dreams easily make me cry. Within the years of struggle with a few coping mechanisms such as deep breathing and  closing my eyes for sometime.

At first they disagree with me pursuing psychology because they thought i was just being “rebellious” and to prove me wrong they brought me to a career and talent psychologist who hinted that i am prone to some mental issues and would be terrible at law because i wouldn’t be able to handle the pressure, so their plan backfired and they allow me to pursue psychology. They got further disappointment when i didn’t get accepted to their alma-mater but accepted to another prestigious uni at a different state. Living outside my hometown has been the best, i was able to experience a lot of things and even though i had a rough start i became quite mentally stable at my second year, but i was still financially dependent to my parents. My parents are a bit late in realizing that mental health matters, until now my dad never brings up the subject while my sister and my mom tries to keep up, but most of the time i still found them quick to judge people with mental issues or just judgmental in general idk. Since senior high school i know something is wrong with me, all the symptoms point to GAD. My sister called me crazy, my mom doesn’t allow any of her kids to cry until now, my dad is a statue. I have an uncle with depression and sometimes my mom and sister would judge and it scares me how unconscious those judgements come. Because of my studies in psychology, i was able to check out some of the assessments for GAD and well i ticked all the boxes. But due to my mom and sister’s POV i am really scared to get checked out by professionals, i’m really scared that they will judge me and alienate me, i know deep down something is wrong and i don’t want to play self diagnose but it’s just that if i get checked and something comes up i’m scared. I’m scared this would ruin my dating life with my current boyfriend. I’m really torn because during quarantine we all have to live under the same roof so there are lots of fights and i had several episodes that i try to hide including self harm but at the same time i unconsciously took it out on my ldr boyfriend. Like how do i get help? How do i prevent my family from alienating me and opening up a conversation to that? Should i do it now or should i wait till quarantine is over and look for help from a psychologist from my uni instead?"
1645,"Therapy isn’t helping, but I really want help. What do I do?","I’ve been depressed on and off since childhood and I’m 27 now. It has gotten particularly difficult the past year so I decided to try therapy again for the first time since I was in high school. To my surprise it was incredibly difficult to even find a therapist. I reached out to a couple therapists that seemed like really good matches based on their online profiles, but they never returned my calls. So I reached out to some more that didn’t seem like the best match but “good enough” and even they didn’t return my calls. Only 1 person returned my call to say she was too busy and not accepting new clients. Finally I reached out to literally every therapist in my area that accepts my insurance and finally someone called me back and scheduled an appointment. She was the only person to do so out of probably 15 or so therapists. 

I’ve been seeing her weekly for almost 3 months. I find myself becoming frustrated with her style of therapy. At first I thought it would take some time to get to a point where it was helpful and that waiting it out and allowing her to really get to know me was essential before really getting to any progress or deeper issues. 

My biggest problem is that she seems so only want to focus on my current day-to-day issues. I’ve told her about my trauma from childhood in our first couple of sessions but she never touched on it again since then. 

Every single week it turns into “maybe you should try something new like yoga” or “have you ever considered going to AA to deal with your issues regarding your alcoholic sister” or “have you considered medication for anxiety”. All things that I feel like she is shifting it off of her plate and putting it elsewhere. I want HER help, not AA, not a medication. And I don’t think I’m being too hard on her. I’ve been going along with it and giving her the benefit of the doubt but I feel like every week it is all surface level stuff and I want to get deeper. I told her this and she insisted that she thinks my depression is “situational”. I’ve struggled with depression my whole life and I honestly disagree. I told her situationally things are getting better but I still feel miserable, and that I want to get to the root of my problems. Rather than listening to that she recommended considering medication, and never addressed my deeper issues and went right back to my day to day crap. 

She’s only been in practice 10 years. So maybe she’s still new at this. I don’t know. But she feels more like a life coach than a therapist and I find myself feeling frustrated at the end of every session and like nothing was accomplished. It’s all so surface level. 

The problem is that I’ve tried finding other therapists and it seems like everyone is too busy to accept new clients or even return calls. 

I’m so frustrated. I never thought finding good help would be so difficult. I almost want to give up on therapy all together. Should I tell my therapist all of this? How should I navigate this?"
1646,In reality no one gives a fuck,"I accept it. This the way life goes. No one will care about this post either and I don’t blame you/them; I’d just move along too. People don’t care about your problems. Those who seem like they do, won’t last if you’re someone like me (hopeless. A hopeless, sad, whiney little pussy). They’ll care for a couple weeks at most. The only types of people to stick around for the long term are psychologists and therapists because they get paid to.  I’ve officially given up on people. I’m okay with being alone for the rest of my life while silently wallowing in my misery. Or kill myself 🤷‍♂️ I’m okay with either outcomes."
1647,"I don't have energy for anything, I don't want it like this either","If I have a coma or anything at least I can get rest from school. It would just be lazy when you skip school constantly, seem normal but crumble inside."
1648,Why can't I remember my childhood and some teenager years?,"One thing that I find quite strange that makes it hard the healing process of everything that makes me feel bad and to understand how my upbringing influenced me is that I can't remember well my childhood and some teenager years (I'm 17 now). It's like I was born 2/3 years ago and everything that happened before is kinda a hazy dream that I can't remember exactly what happened except from very specific things, or that I was a completely different person. Even then my memory kinda mixes some things up from 1 to 2 years ago. I don't remember having a traumatic experience (not that I understand  the topicvery well). It's very annoying, and I would like to know why that happens."
1649,Has anyone here never felt like a human their whole life?,Like I never did what the normal people do..always the outcast..always the side character ignored..people have stuff to share from their childhood I did nothing..just a life full of regrets..lke idk
1650,I can't find anyone who relates to this feeling,"I hope I manage to express this succinctly...

Sometimes, when I'm having a really good time, like for example, if I'm out enjoying dinner and wine with my husband and enjoying it, my mind will wander and I'll start to think...""What's the point of this? Taking ourselves out to be entertained, greedily paying for overpriced food and wine, indulging in nice experiences that will fade and quickly as they come""... and then I can't be in the moment or enjoy it.

It happens a lot. Going on holidays also. I'll be loving it one minute and the next thinking, ""who do I think I am here? Flying myself somewhere, looking at things, then it's over, what's the point of that?""

The thoughts are fleeting but they almost always come when I'm happy or doing something I enjoy. A deep sense of, what is the point of this deeply selfish and temporary experience?

I've expressed this to others but even friends I have with depression or anxiety don't seem to get it. I'm generally happy and healthy, no diagnosed mental health conditions etc... I get down days of course, but they don't bother me as much as this. 

Just wondering if I'm alone in this..."
1651,is this abuse?? long post [tw],"Hi, literally asking for a friend, whom isn't sure at all if this is abuse and won't really take it from me that it is, so, what do yall think? I have his full permission to send these, near enough quotes. big trigger warning since I do personally think it's abuse. the parts about ""him"" are about his dad
""Can't walk past him or touch him"" 
""my mam has called me pathetic, dissapointing, lazy, manipulative, attention seeking, brat, selfish, disgrace and things alike.and she constantly talks about how my problems make her feel depressed and how its so hard and frustrating trying to care for me. my dad just yells a lot in general, i dont remember things he says often because i block it out but he gets in ur face a lot and says stuff like ""ill give you something to cry about""""
""he (his dad) stabbed himself with a yellow gel pen whilst yelling at me about ""is that nice?? is that nice to see or think about??"" and threatened that if i ever did that again he would use alcohol to clean my yeets (self harm code word) and then i would get some real pain and that he would slit his wrists with a bread knife and make me watch""
They threaten to take away his door if he doesn't do as they say, he dissociates whenever he gets yelled at by them and even by others. He got hit a bit when he was 10 or 11, like a slap, but considering the fact his dad is strong as fuck, literally does martial arts, and is fully aware of how defenceless his kid is, it's even more fucked. Apparently there was even a hand print on his back after school when he was smacked BEFORE school one time. He still, despite this all, doesn't believe its abuse at all. However, what do yall think?"
1652,Anyone got any tips on how to deal with self sabotaging?,Every time I try And better myself I seem to end up sabotaging it for no discernible reason dose anyone have any idea why?
1653,So hopeless. So very hopeless.,"Just need a place to vent. 22 years dealing with depression and it feels as strong as ever. I hate that the effects of medication just don’t seem to work and I have to rely on alternative therapies to feel better. Already did ECT. I’m praying to God that my insurance covers Spravado treatments, I’m currently waiting to hear back from my insurance company about it. Then I have to hope I can work it out with my work schedule.

I feel hypocritical because I try to help people on this subreddit and other subreddits about depression and mental illness and give them advice, but I can’t seem to follow my own advice. I’m miserable. I feel like it’s making my wife miserable. Every day is a struggle to not grab a blade and tear up my arms and add to my massive scar collection. 

It’s hard to goto work and do my job. It’s hard to have days off work. All I did today was sleep. 

I hate being alive right now. Blades are soooooo enticing. Life just sucks. My loved ones say they need me in their life but I’m confident their lives would be better without me in it. I’m tired. Tired of this disease. 

Anyway.......I guess that’s all I have to say. Thanks for listening."
1654,"Just had my engagement broken off. If you're reading this, please get help for yourself before you regret it.","Please let this serve as a cautionary tale if you think you can ""handle"" everything by yourself. Your self-care dramatically impacts those around you, especially the ones you love. If left unchecked, your mental health may do irreparable damage to you and those you care about.  

To say I feel awful is an understatement. Beyond feeling rejected and lonely, I feel my entire concepts of my identity, my relationships, and my worldview have been rocked. 

I realize now that I was incredibly toxic for my ex. I gaslit him and manipulated him for months on end. I disrupted a lifestyle he so carefully took years to create. I ruined a beautiful vision of our future together, humiliated him in front of his family and peers, and got myself a literal one-way ticket back to square one. And it was all because I didn't keep my mental health in check. 

I was intensely insecure and unstable. I didn't leave him any room to show me love because I didn't think I deserved it, or I didn't think I'd ever be able to ""repay"" him. I denied his repeated reassurance that he wasn't keeping score. I denied all his gestures of genuine love, selflessness, mercy, and grace. I made HIM out to be the manipulative one, the controlling one, the villain. But the whole time, it was ME who was creating the problems I constantly complained about. It was ME who squandered my opportunities and sought comfort through self-medication. It was ME who neglected to take care of myself enough to be a loving, respectful partner. And it took this very painful experience to make me aware that I've repeated this cycle in virtually all previous relationships. 

I had no idea I was doing it. In my mind, I was just acting in self-defense and preservation. My intentions were good, but my methods were damaging. I've been hurt before and I expected that he'd inevitably do the same. Stupid me; I was the one who looked for red flags that weren't there. I looked at this incredible, amazing man and wanted to see a monster, because it was easier to externalize and project instead of looking inward and confronting myself. I made excuse after excuse, and every one of them was pretty much just ""BUT DONT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I FEEL _____???"" I was so self-centered and caught up in my own pain that I denied anybody else around me the ability to feel their own pain. 

I had unrealistic expectations that I had no right to ask. Furthermore, I left no room for him to meet them. Nothing was ever enough for me, though he gave me the very best of everything he had -- his love, his time, his patience, his money, his attention, everything. Though it wasn't my intention, I took advantage of him severely. And the whole time, he only gave me love in return. 

I feel like a huge asshole. For doing so much damage to him and his family. For doing nothing but take and take and take without giving anything in return. I didn't feel like anything I had to offer was good enough, so I barely even tried. All he wanted was for me to be happy. No wonder I couldn't share happiness with him; I had none to give. 

And as much as I want to feel sorry for myself and wallow in my own pity, I know the right thing for me to do is just humble myself, have compassion, and start over again. IT REALLLY REALLY FUCKING SUCKS. But I can't let this cycle keep repeating. I need to learn my lesson. And I urge you to heed my lesson now before life teaches YOU the hard way, too.

Please. Please get help. Get help before you hit rock bottom. Please get help before your mental illness digs the bottom of that pit so deep you can't see the light anymore. You deserve to be happy. And the people around you deserve happiness too."
1655,I drove away my friends and I feel sick.,"This is a long one.
I (17m) have been friends with a girl (Let's call her N, her username starts with an n, all letters are based off usernames,) since I was 10 years old and she was 11. I've been through a lot with her, helping each other with our depressions and encouraging each other, she was always there for me, and I felt like we would be like this forever. 

Now, N is severely mentally ill. She grew up in an abusive and neglectful home, and felt like fictitious worlds and characters were the only constant in her life. She began to have dreams of interacting with them, and felt like they were her only friends. She believes that the person she is in the dreams (A shape shifting dragon who protects characters from their creators, she made up a whole world around it) is the ""real"" her and her actual body outside the dreams is merely a shell for it. 

It's gotten to the point where she cannot watch TV or play games due to feeling too connected to their characters, and grows depressed from nobody believing her. I only know this because she knew me long enough to trust me with it, she thinks I believe it's real, and honestly, I probably deserve this for not doing more to release her from it, but seeing how she firmly believed in it and refused to listen to anyone who says otherwise, I didn't feel like I had a choice.

N does lots of online roleplaying with her characters, and always has. I used to, but later only really did it to support her. An older friend of hers (P) who she (according to P) cut off all contact with after she didn't believe her dreams were real, reached out to her, and gave her a discord invite, wanting to get back in touch with her and saying that she missed roleplaying with her. I was interested and joined too. Now there were lots of people here, but the most important I'll call K and C. K was 19 when N was 17, and right off the bat relentlessly hit on her, and made explicit comments about her to her in private messages. She put up with this because she felt flattered by the attention. C has anxiety and didn't like K. Most of us didn't, but we were too scared to say anything because of how close he was to P. 

I for one always felt incredibly anxious there, and I was in a really bad place, right off the bat K hated my guts and saw me as a rival, I hated how he would talk about N, in front of everyone no less, and, after N invited me to a new server she made for close friends, walked in on them basically being really sexual before she nuked the server and apologised to me in dms. They had a big fight and N left the server, not because of K's sexual harassment of her, (which she apparently vented about to other female users in pms, according to C) but because he insulted her characters after he figured out she thought it was real. K also exploited her longing for the lover she has in her dream worlds. K got mad at me and accused me of turning everyone against him, we fought, and P banned me. 

N started a new server for the friends she made on the old one, including C and myself, and we bonded, I really felt a deep connection to them all. P also apologised for K's actions and started a new roleplay server. 

Now, it's a bit of an open secret that N is mentally ill. She takes the roleplay super seriously, and gets upset when people don't like her characters. And so, everyone else's characters practically worshipped the character that was meant to be her, and it got annoying to me after a while. C felt the same way, so we talked in pms. I'm an absolute asshole for doing this, but we complained about N a lot. Turns out she led C to a mental breakdown over her getting tired of playing a character she liked, but C never told anyone. So N never knew. We complained about how her characters could do no wrong, how I felt like she didn't care about me anymore, and all the times C felt like she was pressuring her to always be online and hold up to her expectations. Sometimes I felt like we were going too far, but kept it to myself for the most part. 

I felt bad for C, so I talked to N about it in pms. She got super depressed and scared that the others were scared of her, and were gonna leave her. I did my best to help her. Later in a voice chat C's stream cut out and N said things like: ""Hey C!"" ""You there?"" ""Miss you!"" In text. I was worried C might take that the wrong way, so I told her to please stop. She was silent for a while, then left. I told the others I was worried about N. 

Seeing how sad she was, not talking for about a day after that, I felt extremely guilty, and was offline for a few days. I came back today, and saw that N had vented. A few days ago. Saying I had pushed her into believing everyone hated her and was going to leave. C tried to defend me, saying I was stressed, and then she replied (copied to the best of my memory.)

N: ""Stressed about what?"" ""Making me cry myself to sleep?"" Leading me to catastrophize for days on end?"" ""(My name), we were supposed to be friends, you're not my father."" 

I read that, realised that to everyone on that server I was the bad guy now, and left the server entirely. I feel sick, I have no friends now, I am filled with self-loathing and just can't think of a way forward. I wish none of this ever happened."
1656,Just got back from my Alcohol Assessment...,"Ugh...an hour of answering questions. I am 100% sure that I do not need services because I do NOT drink!!! The positive on the drug test was a false positive (it 100% was because I have not had alcohol since 9/10/16), so I have to go through all this bullshit now.  


I am not worried too much. I know I have been sober for a long time, and I feel good about that. :)

&amp;#x200B;

It is HOT out there too. :( Temp was 93F when I looked before I'd gone in for the assesment. It is humid as hell too. :( Yuck. I am in the AC again now...I am much happier--munching on pistachios and enjoying the cool air. :D

&amp;#x200B;

How is everyone else?"
1657,I'm on my way down,"Recent times have been hard on me. I'm struggling to stay happy all the time, I wake up feeling okay but the day goes on and my emotions and mental drift away.

I finished high school recently although I haven't been there in a good 3 months. The dropoff is real, I finally cut off all of the toxic people and that part is great but the pandemic is putting me in a bad situation as well.

My family doesn't have my social security card and I need one to get my ID, I want a job so bad to get my life on track and after many efforts to get it online, nothing has worked out and my family and I are waiting on the social security offices to open so we can go in ourselves.

It's been a long time and I've been 18 for a while now so I should have gotten a leg up in some way but my life is slipping slowly and I have such a bad sense of dread that I haven't reached the worst of it yet.

My girlfriend has started a job, is working on her promotion to manager, and has so many things going right for her that I am so proud because I was with her when she was at a similar low, helping her achieve her personal success.

So I'm socially disconnected from losing my friends, my girlfriend is doing amazing on her own which leaves me in a bad mess in comparison, I'm hopeless in regards of improving right now, and my mental state is being bombarded by my failiures. I'm acting different due to stress which I know affects my girlfriend and my family, and I am losing my ability to accurately reflect on my feelings and thoughts as well as I used to.

I have such a bad feeling of dread all the time, and I know that I'm dragging others down with me. I'm changing from being the person I loved and adored sharing with toher people I care about to a helpless husk, and I know I'm causing so many more problems than solutions, and I want to get out of this slump before it gets any worse.

Idk if this is fit for this sub or not but I need some support coming from somewhere because I feel like I am losing myself and the life I was dreaming of creating."
1658,"i want to die more than ever, losing functionality TW","i don’t have the energy to do anything but lay in bed, and i can’t sleep either because the thoughts won’t stop for even a second. i have to stay up till im exhausted plus take three sleeping pills just to get a few hours. all i can think about is how much i want to die. 

nothing in my life is ever going to get better, literally the only thing good in my life is getting high, that’s the only way for me to feel okay. and then as soon as the high is over im sucked back into this state of being lazy and dreaming up ways to kill myself. i want to be high 24/7 but i have no job so it’s not like i can even afford to keep buying shit, as soon as my current supply runs out im screwed. i guess that’s when I’ll finally  do “it”.


i have body dysmorphia, a history of abusive relationships, and possible BPD, and together these symptoms are working to tear apart my sanity. i feel disgusting and unlovable constantly. all i want is to be skinny and tall and have all the desirable traits women are attracted to, but also i know they would only like me for my body then and still not care about me, and im so done with feeling used and like im here to give people gratification and then get tossed aside when they find better toys. im always compliant though, because some attention is better than none. i just want to be loved and given affection. i feel love in such extreme levels and no one else ever has the same energy for me.

i don’t even feel loved by my family, they’re always busy or far away from me, or they die and leave me alone. i spend all their money just by existing and im sure they would hate me and want me to die if they knew i was into drugs, starving myself, vain and obsessed with my appearance. in short no one would give a fuck if i committed suicide, in fact they would actually be better off and prolly say good riddance."
1659,i can’t quit weed mentally,"i don’t know how to do that. It’s not like physical addiction. I’m not craving it but i can’t think straight without it. I become a horrible person to everyone and feel like a real shit. I realize myself and i don’t like myself. 
(i didn’t smoke for 1 day and i realized it ps. I smoke more than 8 jo every fucking day.) 
I need help. My doctor only says u should stop smoking weed, she doesn’t say how to. I want real advice from who stopped smoking weed."
1660,My pain literally will never go away.,"Now, everyone always tells me ""It'll go away eventually"", and this is true for 99% of people, but not me. It's not because it just wont go away, but it's the nature of my affliction that makes it so horrible. I can't even talk about it here, that's how bad it is. Unless most of the modern world ideologically changes, I will never stop hurting. The worst thing is that it is hardwired into me, ever since I was a little kid I was this way, before anyone had even talked to me about it. Only recently have I started thinking about the idea that I am wrong. The worst thing is that if I am wrong, I will never be able to fix myself, and if I am right, I will never know.

(PS, All people are created equal, science is truth, etc.)"
1661,Soul crushing loneliness - how to treat?,"My earliest recollections of feeling this was when I was a child I'd sometimes start spontaneously crying for my mother in class. It only happened a few times, (once in each grade growing up - likely near the start of the year) and I suppose I eventually made friends (it didn't happen fast) and realized I'd see my family when I got home.

Fast forward to the present, it's INCREDIBLY difficult for me to leave the house (as in, move out, sorry, not agoraphobic). I'm 28, and I just moved out and I want to go right back to my mother. My mental health does suffer on my period, but I'm getting over that and can barely move forward. COVID shutting off many avenues to meet people surely isn't helping, but I had this problem in college too and I could have met more people then. Once I get like this, I have a hard time going out and meeting people too since I am so badly in need of comfort and ""a place that \*feels\* like home.""

Is there a name for this? (Is it just some subset of depression? I've been crying for over a week now and been unable to eat much.) I look like a normal, well-adjusted adult until I get an anxiety attack at the fear of online dating or leaving my mother's house."
1662,Scared of letting down my sister,"Fuck it, I’m going to the ER tonight because I can’t deal with my thoughts anymore. I’ve (sorta) thought through how I’m gonna tell my parents, but not my sister. My sister has INTENSE anxiety about the whole family and is always paranoid about us getting hurt/sick. If she found out I’m going to the hospital for suicidal thoughts, I don’t even know how she would react. She’s so nice to me and ever since she found out about my depression, she’s been leaving little notes on my bed &amp; taking me out to do activities with her, and I overheard her tell my mom that she “just wants [me] to be happy again”. I don’t know if I can do this to her"
1663,Extreme rage at past traumas. Suicide seems like the only option. Why has life gone so horribly wrong for me?,"I'm in my early 30s. I feel so filled with anger these days that I feel like I might kill myself. I've been through quite a lot of traumatic events in life. Don't have close family relationships. Dad in particular is an abusive piece of shit. Functioning alcoholic constantly calling me names failure, loser my whole life. Therefore my romantic relationships have been turbulent at best, I have an extremely annoying anxious attachment style which makes being in a relationship a nightmare for me, it's easier being single but obviously lonely af and feels like a life half lived. Friendships have also been rocky to be honest. Seem to pick friends who bitch about me, and despite my best efforts don't seem to genuinely like me underneath it all. I never have had trouble starting new relationships and friendships it's maintaining them that never seems to go well. Countless burned bridges. 

I used to drink lots to cope with everything but I've now given it up. I have never been an angry person really up until now. My anger is overwhelming me so much it's worrying me. It's spilling over into my daily life. I have developed bad road rage and I even got into an argument with a stranger the other day in a line, who turned out to have worse anger problems than me. He screamed at me and for a moment it seemed like he was maybe going to attack me. It was ok in the end. I can see the path this is leading me down and it's not good.

Ive quit drinking, but my health has not been great. I feel the serious anger and traumas living in my cells are keeping me sick, partially. I'm trying to get super zen and health and I have never been more filled with rage. I'm getting so many flashbacks throughout the day where a memory or some horrible altercation or argument or time I was wronged floods into my head. It could be the two times I was raped, miscarriage, domestic abuse (family and boyfriends) or severely bullied, some throwaway snide comment someone made or sometimes even it's harmless things. I know that reads like a guest on Jerry springer but it's real life, I'm college educated blah blah 'normal' and all of this horrific shit has happened to me. Not that these things don't happen to normal people. I still dream about being bullied years later. I ran into into the bullies a few years ago in the street and the pointed and laughed at me. The injustice I felt and feel..the anger is indescribable. Also because I'm NOT a shy, nerdy type. I'm someone who's outgoing, confident etc. Nor am I obnoxious, bullying either. I'm just normal, in between. I feel like just got really unlucky. So thats an extra killer for me how these shitty shitty things have happened and people have treated me like a disposable but of trash when I know I'm worth more than that. I spent years in therapy trying to figure out why I was attracting all of this negative energy, but I got nowhere. Even recently I introduced two friends of mine and they have gone off and ditched me. I feel so DONE with life. I can't see how I can continue like this. It's like a shitty dark cloud has been following me around my whole life.

At least once a day i could explode with rage. I now feel like I 100% hate people. Like HATE. All people. I'm disgusted and maybe traumatized by it all. Having to smile at a stranger I pass in the street or a shopkeeper etc- these kind of things I strongly do not want to do. I notice it when I'm with people who aren't burdened by all this anger who they smile so easily. I'm not socially awkward I can force a smile and fake conversation but inside I'm fucking over it. Work wise, I can mask it well working remotely during covid but today I flipped out momentarily at this extremely annoying colleague (not just me he's legit really annoying). I was annoyed at myself for showing my hand like that. I prefer not letting myself down and remaining chilled.

My question is...Ive been in therapy on and for yearssss due to having no family support and getting through life alone essentially. I've gone through every minor detail with strangers (therapists) at this rate I feel like I could be a therapist myself with all Ive read and have been through. They overall were not much to me. The thoughts of having to divulge and the shit Ive been through again is a no for me. Too draining. I'm wondering what's up with this anger, is it PTSD? What is going on? How can I move on from it? I have books on emotion regulation, CBT etc. Ive really tried it all. I felt so hopeless yesterday that suicide seems like the only option.

I'd love to hear some rational thoughts / suggestions. Thank you for reading..."
1664,"I done know how to have a normal life, I dont know how it looks like to be normal","I've had depression for the last 5 years plus stress from university entrance exam for last 2 years(ended last year), for some reason meds made things worse so I dropped them. I'm having trouble with basic daily activities. Cant control my anger, constantly fighting my family and locking myself in my room. Sometimes when I don't focus on something I start crying like my most important person in my life is dead and most of the times  I start to hallucinate for 1-2 hours before realizing I'm in my room. I have no idea how a normal life looks like. At some point 3 years ago I was numb to pain and constantly carved stuff on my body with mechanical pencil that was when I was using drugs.

My parents doesn't know I have these problems before I went to doctors myself without them knowing, because if I give them a shock like this something bad will happen because of their condition. And also because I was like this and have high functioning autism I lost all my friends and none of them answer my messages or calls. I kind of feel lonely but first I want to live a normal life I want to know how it's like to be normal and being sad all the time I have no idea how I'm supposed to do that.

Anyone can tell me how it looks like?"

1666,Life After THC bad trip and Compazine,"Hello.

So in June 8, I decided to eat some edibles I had bought from this company called Smokey Business on Instagram. We bought a bag of brownies and a bag of stripped gummies. That night I ate one whole brownie and half of a gummy strip. Within an hour and a half I experience an anxiety attack bc everything was happening at once. I went home and walked around my living room for 5 hours during my bad trip. The next day everything looked weird. My perspective had changed and my heart rate was up. About 5 days later my brain felt like it was burning so much that I couldn’t sleep. I went to the hospital and was given Tordal, Benadryl and Compazine. Worst decision ever. I got home and felt worst. I was anxious and could stop walking around the house. I couldn’t sleep. The whole week I had problems waking up every hour anxious with heart rate at almost 100. 

Fast forward to today. I’m better, I’ve slept this week only bc I can only sleep somewhere that’s not my home. I’ve been mentally not as much myself though. It’s been a push to be alone. My anxiety has gone down but today I tried to stop at my house and grab more clothes while driving around that area my heart became for fluttered. I don’t want to take anxiety meds bc I’ve never had anxiety in my 27 years of living. But I want to know I’m not crazy. I can drive fine, I don’t necessarily wanna kill myself but sometimes I feel like it’s better than feeling this way. I had so much going for me, I was about to buy a home. Now I have no desire to do anything but stay cooped up with someone...Any advice?"

1670,I just remembered a traumatic memory (i think) from ages ago and i can’t get it out of my mind,"When i was like 11/12 years old someone had done a poo in the toilet and left it and my Mum found it and both my brother and I said that we didn’t do it. 
So my Mum made us both bend over in front of Dad and her and wiped our bums for us and then showed everyone the piece of toilet paper and whether it had shit on it or not.

I remember her telling us to bend over more because she said she couldn’t reach. 

My subconscious and conscious is telling me i’m a horrible person for saying this about my parents and that i’m just imagining it. But i know i’m not. It’s killing me not being able to remember things from this event and from when my Mum left.

The next parts foggy but i know that the first part above is definitely accurate 

I think my Mum wiped my bum and got shit on the paper and blamed it on me or something idk. And then i think my brother had shit on his paper as well. I think we were both ridiculed. 

I have many traumas involving my parents since then. I’m now 18. And i’ve been in an emotionally incestuous relationship with my Father. 
My brother beats me. And my Mum doesn’t do anything because she feels powerless because she’s now a single mother (my parents are separated) 

I also reported my brother to the police last year for touching my boobs and beating me with a belt (which my mum saw). But nothing happened and i don’t think the police believed me because i was overweight. 

Anyway, what’s everyone opinion on the poo wiping situation. Is that normal for parents to do?"
1671,Bragging about mental heath issues?,"TLDR; my friend was diagnosed with DID and I find their behavior related to it unnerving

My dear friend has been struggling with their mental heath. I have known them for 6 months and they are 20 years old. They have communicated with me their past of extensive trauma &amp; abuse, as well as having parents who are/have been addicts. They consistently trauma dumped on me and most conversations we had are based on their memories &amp; trauma.

3-4 months ago, they called me and said they lost 8 years of memory &amp; had very little / no knowledge about common things like cars and university. They said they didn’t know who I was, but knew they could call me. 

From there they went to treatment and when they got out, they made some really strange claims. 

They claimed that their behavior made nurses cry/quit because of their behavior, that they were “basically the therapist” because the doctors were incompetent, and that they were god. 

They initially claimed to have 4 alters, but now they say there are over 100. They post publicly about their alters frequently, not mentioning any sort of conflict between alters.

I’ve observed (through their art) they have been having waves of loss of coordination.

I want to be there for them, but I get a feeling of insincerity that wasn’t there before. I am starting to doubt some of the outrageous stories they have told me before. I don’t feel like they actually care about how I am doing, but they just want to talk about themselves. I have been distancing myself from them because I have been feeling overwhelmed and lost as what I can do. It’s not my job to help them, but when we talk it feels like that’s my job. 

Anyone have any advice on what I can do besides distance myself? How I can support them without exhausting myself?"
1672,I am in a weird situation...,"I have an issue,  some time i think about trivial stuff obsessively , i overthink and i literally sometimes spend a day or tow thinking about the same thing , it's like whenever i tell my self not to think on a particular thing my mind just do reverse,  sometimes at night i am thinking and making myself uncomfortable and sleep and wake up and it is quickly the first thing on my mind , it gets even worst,  i literally lose my concentration. The more i tell myself not to think the more obsessively i do it , this trivial thing can be anything like social issue , thinking about future, or something i read about ecology etc.

1674,Am I bipolar ?,"Okay so for years now I’ve been getting little bursts of energy where I have fun and be nice and social with people, but then I have long drawn out times where I lie in bed for days , some times weeks and tell everyone to piss off. All I think about while lying in bed is just thoughts like “it would be better if I died” or “I don’t have the guts to kill myself” or “I should kill myself right here and right now without a second thought so I don’t hesitate and don’t stop myself”. I don’t have any social interaction during these times and all I do is eat microwave meals whenever I’m hungry (sometimes I don’t even realise I’m starving) or go to the toilet but other than those things I just stay in bed. I have been having  these depressed times a hell of a lot more than the times I’m social for the majority of when this has started occurring (it’s been happening for about 2 years). Am I bipolar and if so, should I go to the shrink ? I’ve heard that in some cases they lock people up"
1675,My dad believes that I'm 'convincing myself' that I have ADHD and (POSSIBLY) Aspergers.,"Before I go into the full on vent, here's some context: (Also I'm on mobile so sorry if formatting is weird) 

- I'm not officially diagnosed however I'm trying to be and this is the conversation I had with my dad less than an hour before making this post.

- I consulted a college phychologist about ADHD, about a month or two before lockdown started, she said she can't 'formally' diagnose me but there is a high chance that I'm correct in my suspicion and there's also a chance that I have aspergers.

- I know I might make it sound bad, but my dad IS trying to be understanding (more so than my mum), he just believes mental health is 'made up' and 'all in your head'. Old fashioned, basically, and is convinced that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm just believing everything I read on the Internet.

- This is translated and paraphrased from Polish because that's the language me and my dad speak. 

I'm trying to convince my parents to allow me to see a professional and get formally diagnosed and possibly put on some treatment, particularly about ADHD because it's started to seriously affect my college life. This is where today's conversation came in.

I've brought it up with my dad a few times already but I feel like he's dodging the topic, telling me ""yeah talk to your aunt she knows a phychologist"" but not understanding that I want him to sort me out an appointment because one, I'm 17 so I don't think I can get an appointment myself (I Think, I live in the UK but am currently in Poland and my parents would rather me see a Polish professional), and two, I'm too anxious to make the phone call myself and I do want him to be a part of this because I need him to understand.

But today I think I finally convinced him through a very painful conversation. Basically, we got into a bit of a spat earlier today regarding my anti-social spouts, and that I think he takes everything too personally because ""No, I'm not ignoring you on purpose, I just get lost in my own head and don't want to talk or interact sometimes. Sometimes I just dissociate.""

He wants me to constantly be smiling and takes it to heart when I just don't talk or 'seem sad' even though half (Actually like 80%) of the time I'm just thinking/over-thinking and I do have a bit of a resting b*tch face ngl. In all honesty, I don't smile that much, but not because I'm sad it's just I don't feel the need and don't want to. Same goes for constantly having to maintain conversation or ""Behave like I'm happy.""

I started tearing up before I even started the conversation, because I can't handle conflict and I was afraid of how he'll react. I continued to almost cry and aggressively claw at my hand throughout (I can't deal with huge amounts of emotion and start stimming really heavily when I'm even remotely anxious).

I always knew about the ADHD, I just didn't have a name to it until mid-highschool, but I've researched some on Aspergers/autism and noticed that a handful of symptoms align with my behaviour. I told him about a few symptoms I've seen in myself E. G:

Excessive Stimming. Leg shaking, scratching (myself, though that one is mostly when anxious), random snapping of fingers, imitating random noises (Like alarms or animals), and the worst which he can't tell me he doesn't see because he nags me for it almost daily: Pacing. And when I say pacing I mean spending hours walking from wall to wall lost in my own head with headphones, occasionally if I have a particularly intense daydream I tend to 'bounce' off the walls or imitate a few actions in my daydream. 

I've had trouble focusing since childhood, I'd spent lessons in primary zoned out and by the end I wouldn't even remember what happened. It was usually the only thing teachers complained about me. In high school it kinda got better but not really because I still had to constantly snap myself out of daydreams and try really hard not to fall asleep or space out. However, no one ever thought anything of it because I was a 'gifted' kid and tbh I didn't either. I got really good grades in the end but by that age I was starting to become more conscious that the amount of times I lose focus or how I behave in some cases is not normal. 

High emotional sensitivity, leading to an inability to compromise which is the root of 90% of our arguments. I can't argue face to face for the f*cking life of me, even if I know I'm going into a calm debate I just get overly emotional and it affects my ability to form coherent arguments. 

Issues socialising, I only really have two real friends and I don't talk to most people unless spoken to. I'm not on speaking terms with anyone but one of my classmates. I don't catch some social cues, over-share, over-think and over-analyse people's responses, don't know how to start or continue a conversation without the other person doing a fair share of leading the conversation. Dislike of eye contact. An aversion to physical contact, not always, I can get clingy occasionally but like a good 75% of the time I cringe. Heck, even with my own family I sometimes feel unnecessarily awkward. I'm mortified to make important phone calls. Constantly worried about people's opinion of me and seeking out approval. I tend to go into anti-social bouts where I don't wish to be interacted with in any way and would prefer to be left on my own. If I'm already in public, it shows as me being quiet and not contributing at all to the social event going on around me. 

Though this one is a bit of a paradox, because I DO experience spouts of becoming a social butterfly and once you get me started on a topic I'm currently passionate about I don't shut up to the point I tend to over-step what's an acceptable amount to explain. And my dad thinks that is the 'normal' side of me, that I'm normally in the 'social butterfly' mode and that's what he wants me to be all the time. He's starting to get the fact that I need my alone time and that I'm not always a social butterfly, but it makes me incredibly guilty to see him be bothered by my anti-social bouts. 

I want to say I've experienced a few 'special interests' especially as a child and even a few now BUT I'm not so sure on that topic and whether it truly applies to me.

Those are the ones most prominent I've noticed in me.

My dad passes most of those off as normal behaviour, chalking it up to me being a hormonal teenager and that once I'm an adult I'll grow out of all this. Here's the thing though: What if I don't? If I grow up and have it worse as an adult because I didn't do anything about it now? I already went completely under the rader as a kid, one because I was a 'gifted child' and two my parents don't believe in mental illness.

I didn't bring this topic up until high school because I simply didn't have a name to it, nor did I really know or care much about mental health. I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything, but I know what it's like to live inside my own head and can recognise that not everything I do and the way I think is normal. But because ""nothing was wrong with me before"" and ""suddenly you've come up with all these problems that you never mentioned before"" and ""I don't see anything wrong with you"" ""You've been influenced by your friends and the Internet"" ""You don't know what you're talking about"". He thinks that I've convinced myself to having these problems, because I just searched it up on the Internet and cherry picked what applies to me. 

And let's say that OK, maybe I have convinced myself because I've read too much sh*t on the Internet. Isn't it better to see a professional and find out anyway? To finally settle this once and for all instead of me wondering if there's something wrong with me? 

That's kinda what I finally convinced him with, he still thinks there's nothing wrong with me. I feel like I have ruined his holiday though, he was supposed to relax now that he can't really work during the pandemic. He told me how he ""misses the old times when I was a child and would always be smiling and enjoy holidays together without any emotional baggage or problems."" 

He's a good parent and I know he genuinely cares about me but is just incredibly ignorant on the topic of mental health and convinced that it doesn't really exist. (Like he gets everything else right as a dad BUT THIS.)"
1676,[help] Intrusive thoughts about something I did are taking a huge toll on my health.,"&amp;#x200B;

I kinda did something I'm terribly ashamed of and can't get past.  


I've watched porn before, most people have. I always noticed that many entries' titles showed some kind of ""step fantasy"".  I always strayed away from them cause it's not something I want to think about when I'm doing *that.*

However, just recently I watched one of those, in 4 different occasions - the thing is I'm not watching it for the ""fantasy"", I'm watching it for the actors/behaviour themselves. I realised it made me uncomfortable around my fam, and made me feel disgusted. So I stopped.

Now I'm incredibly anxious about my father or someone finding out about what I've seen and jumping to conclusions and feeling ashamed of me. So much that for the last days all I've been doing is researching about how private the internet is, if someone can trace my activity to me, if someone will expose me, or how to overcome that type of ""fetish"", or if i really have it and whatnot, and everytime I look more about (even posting) - I feel like i'm creating more that can be traced back to me, more chances of him finding out and making things worse.

I try really hard to forget and move one but, specially locked inside, its super hard: I'm unfocused, depressed, anxious and tired.

 My whole mood will swing: I'll go from *blah, who even cares? i did nothing wrong or illegal, so what.*  to *i've ruined my life, this will never get behind me and ill never become someone important because otherwise people might find out.*

I feel like a freak now, for having done what I did - and that's the thing: successful people never did anything of the sort, right?

The thoughts are intrusive; my life was uphill - i'd taken on new aspirations and hobbies until I had to do this and spoil the happiness i was enjoying."

I never admitted this to anyone but my best friend. I have self harmed since i was about 9 years old. 

I always cut myself in places it could be passed off as an accident. I never wanted people to know i was doing it but i just felt the urge to feel something physical other than emotional. 

The last time i self harmed was 2 years ago and it was so deep it still hasnt fully healed to this day. I feel ashamed of them and hate when people ask me about how i got my scars or when they look at them. It gets harder each time to explain how i got the wounds but sometimes i felt it was the only way to feel something. 

I have had no urges to do it recently and hope it stays that way."

I have a really bad case of overthinking and I believe it stems from my Computer Science background ( a lot of problem solving through thinking and analysing). Any tips are greatly appreciated!"

My mum knows about my anxiety, we've seen a doctor about it but even afterwards she doesn't see it as a mental illness or that serious. I'm really not good at explaining things to her because I'm bad at phrasing and she doesn't really listen. I'm afraid she'll think I'm doing it all for attention. I was about to have counselling for my anxiety but then lock down happened in my country and it all got cancelled, but even before that she said ""oh you're managing fine so I don't think you need them"", I'm not 18 yet so she's still in charge of my appointments.

1682,If Only I could Sleep.,"I am smart. Well am I?
I've been finding myself up at 4am. Now more than ever. I've seen myself break down infront of the mirror. Asking myself questions. Wondering what is up with me. What are all these overwhelming emotions?

What did that person think of what I said? Why do I have this constant need to affirm the same thing a to someone a 100 times? How come I find myself repeating it  for the sole sense of my mental peace, for if not fulfilled,for if not affirmed  the array of possible scenarios my head will rush to are endless thereby setting a whirlwind keeping me up yet again.

I'll feel numb. I'll cry. Maybe feel like a burden. How come nothing matters and then suddenly a single itch pinched so bad? Why did I say that? Should I have? Am I doing this wrong? Am I good enough? Shouldn't I apologise for this thing? This sure was my fault. Am I liked enough? Did they like me? What's with this constant need to be appreciated by certain people for a sense of fulfillment?

Am I smart? Well what is smart. Whatever it is, I am not smart. I am  worrier. I am a product of the influence of bad childhood memories, frustrating peers and blended and churned with the tinge of cinema. Trying to find an ideal world. Definitely? Maybe.

A lack of piece of mind. A confused mental state is not always things they show on TV and factors which seem cool to talk about. They are things which eat you slowly, deep. Gnaw at your well being and every time you try talking it out, the good old overthinking haunts you at 5am, makes you sweat in bed, your stomach up in knots your heart beating at 120 bpm. Your eyes blurry your fingertips numb and a constant feeling of hopelessness looming around your head making you question everything,  doubt each aspect of your being. Then when you try to get up the next morning, hoping to be smarter, wiser better than the weak miserable soul from last night that you were, someone out of the blue tells you how your tshirt isn't matching or your Jean's lookspale. Your skin ain't perfect or your hair ain't shiny enough and well, if you thought all of this is not a  call back to the previous night, you most certainly arent smart,  just a damned fragment of a generation without a revolution fighting civil wars within their minds.

History:

It started back in February of 2018 when he got mono. It just messed with his hormones so bad that his T count dropped and he had to go on a medication that encourages hormone production  (he got the low T up to a good point in 2019, so then doctor took him off the medication for 6 months and his T levels plummeted again. He is back on medication now starting March 2020 but at a slower rate this time) ...and then two people close to him died (his aunt and a friend) pretty unexpectedly over the rest of the year. During all of this, we moved in together and got a dog. He started to see a therapist because of the strain of the two deaths and work stress in late 2018 and eventually was formally diagnosed with depression and started taking anti-depressants (lexapro) in the spring of 2019. 

The anti depressants that he was on didn't help, so they added on another (wellbutrin). Still didn't help. So we started going to a psychiatrist (previously it had been his GP prescribing medication). They added a third medication (vibryd) and he got some relief in November/December 2019 and he proposed December 13, 2019.

He stopped seeing his therapist, because he didn't know what to talk about and wasn't connecting with her. Then they took him off one of the medications (lexapro) and he took a pretty steep downturn in January 2020. He was sad and thinking about what kind of relief dying would be. He was sleeping all the time, but never feeling rested. They put him back on lexapro and took off the wellbutrin. Still wasn't great. So they added Ambilify at night. In the middle of all of this, he was diagnosed with sleep apnea and started sleeping with a CPAP, but it hasn't helped his ability to sleep. Then the psychiatrist switched the vibryd with Pristiq and recommended TMS.  Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of depression. He went in 5 days a week from April 2020 to late June 2020 to have the TMS therapy for 30 minutes a day. Well, he's done with the TMS and they gave us a chart that showed time on the X-axis and his depression/anxiety scores on the y axis. It was a straight line. Didn't help. 

Current State:

It's not good. Medications and TMS and sleep apnea and low T and depression and anxiety and weight-gain and...the list goes on. He struggles at work because he is so anxious. He still sleeps all the time but is always tired. He struggles to go to sleep every night. He feels hopeless and while he knows that I love him, he doesn't understand why. At this point, I am struggling too. We have some good times, but they are constantly overshadowed by his sadness or exhaustion. He doesn't work out, because he is so tired. He crumbles and withdraws if he feels like I am upset with him or like he has disappointed me, but I'm usually not at all mad or disappointed. I do sometimes get frustrated, because I often feel like he isn't enough of an advocate for himself. He has a tendency to downplay things or deflects with humor. His medication causes low sex drive, which just saps my self-confidence and my feelings of being connected. We have sex once a week when times are ok, but currently haven't had sex in three and a half weeks. We've talked about alternatives that still inspire intimacy and satisfy my normal sex drive, but that hasn't ever actually been put into action because he is so in his own head. We started seeing a couples therapist, so he is in some sort of therapy. Truth is, we both need to be in therapy, but he hates talking about his feelings, so that has been agonizingly slow. Sometimes he is snappy, but will keep what is actually bothering him locked up inside. Last night he told me that while he doesn't have plans about killing himself, he does think about falling asleep and not waking up again. I don't think that he will hurt himself, but the fact that living in his brain is so exhausting and sad that just dying in his sleep is an appealing alternative for him is terrifying. 

Anyways, I spoke to one of the doctors at the place he goes for medications and she mentioned inpatient treatment would be the next step and he said that sounds scary and I get it. I don't want to push him into anything, but I feel like we are stuck in this vicious cycle and we don't know what else to do. Does anyone have experience with inpatient therapy?

TL:DR: My fiance has severe depression and anxiety along with a myriad of other things. Is it time to think inpatient? Does anyone else have experience with an inpatient stint? It sounds scary, but at this point, necessary?"

1697,"Boundaries, how is that supposed to work","So I always here about setting boundaries for yourself and others. I guess I understand what that is supposed to do, like keeping you out of uncomfortable situations or triggers away.
But, for a recent example, my mother wants to go on a vacation and we would have to fly to get there. I'm not sure how it is elsewhere but where I'm from it's allowed to do that to certain places but only with masks on during the entire thing. And here comes the problem I hate wearing masks an have severe social anxiety that already creates problems for me during flights and the restricted air flow can make me panic easily. But since I don't have a physical problem with the masks I'm not allowed to stay home.
Now to my actual question.
I have tried setting boundaries many times from privacy to people who have made me uncomfortable but everyone just ignored me and I don't know what to do and how to go about this, now that it could end up with me having, as a worst-case scenario a panic attack or quite possibly at least a crying fit in a place I can't leave to calm down for up to 3h."
1698,Dealing with anger stage of healing,"Long story short, a chapter of my life in which an extremely narcissistic, heartless, and rude person who I loved very much romantically, gaslighted and lied to me, had come to an end around two months ago. It had mainly been pain, being delusional (eg blaming myself and constantly apologizing to not lose that person, despite everyone who cared for me trying to open my eyes and restore my self esteem) and just being a complete emotional mess. That passed with time, and I can proudly say I do not miss them, have blocked them on all social media (they've tried many times to apologize and start afresh but never would carry through, so I won't let them this time) and I don't feel any pain or sadness attached to them. I know now that I was not wrong in anything I did, and I'm very thankful to my friends and family who knew this since day one. I can see clearly now.

However then came the anger. Both directed at that person and myself. Just the sheer thought of just how much they did and what they said over the past year. Things that would've made any normal person recoil in disgust and leave them. And the things they did too. I can't believe I let it all happen because I cared for them when they only cared about themselves. And that's where the anger directed at me steps in. I simply am blown away that I let them get away with all that, that I was so absurdly nice to them, always forgiving and blaming myself, instead of realising what was going on right in front me which everyone warned me about. Love really does blind. My main issue is how do I deal with this anger? Something will remind me of them and it will snowball to the point where I just want to punch a wall or rip a pillow or scream. I don't feel any sadness or pain anymore, and I'm the happiest I've ever been when I'm not fuming over this. Any advice? Thanks in advance."

1700,I find it hard to comprehend people have lives.,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post but here it goes; 

For as long as I can remember this is something that on off bugs me whenever I ‘remember’ i can’t do it. I just completely forget or dismiss people have full functioning lives just like I do. 

Pretty much the same as the common concept of kids thinking teachers live at school and don’t have lives. I find this with everyone and I find I have to fully sit there, think and try to visualise other people are out there right now literally going about their day. 

I have no clue if this makes any sense and I don’t know what I’m expecting but maybe a little clarity on why I might do this?"
1701,I've been feeling strange for at least a year now. What to do?,"I'm also isolated for a few years now which means I'm in front of the computer most of the time. 

I used to supplement with magnesium + b6 everyday and felt weird ""on"" it and after I stopped it slightly got better but I still haven't recovered. It was like a mental impairment like I was living like a robot. Also coffee/caffeine too. I'm not saying these causes the issue but might be related.

I also used to experience with derealisation/depersonalisation and had feelings like others are NPCs and this life is an illusion of our perception. and honestly it can be true as much as I don't want to admit it."
1702,Medication for depression not working,"I have been on a handful of different medications for multiple mental health issues, but my depression always seems to be severe no matter what. Today my new therapist said she wants to find something that works because until my serotonin is up, therapy can only do so much. I’m tired of trying and trying when I feel like it just doesn’t work. Has anyone else been in this situation, any advice?"
1703,"I feel like a fraud - How does a depression ""feel""?","Is there any way not to feel like one when being confronted with a severe depression? I'm in my early twenties, and currently in my fourth semester at uni.  I'm running  1/2-1 semester behind the schedule. My depression started at the end of the second semester, since then I feel completely drained and barely able to accomplish anything. I decided to stay in uni as some sort of routine seemed better than becoming a full-time depressed individual. I started seeing a therapist, but as she didn't seem to get my particular case (she did a good job, but something just felt off the entire time), I stopped going. I also started medication as proposed by my psychiatrist, which has already been changed once due to bad side effects, and has me feeling fluctuating at best. Anytime I try and talk to someone about my situation, I can  feel them articulating ""well, seems like you're just lazy"" in their heads. The thing is, I like to believe that I'm really not. At least not to the degree of not turning in assignments at all because I'm feeling dull and paralyzed. 

This constant feel of being a fraud has me questioning my symptoms already. More worryingly, I'm quite sure that some type of depression has always been lingering inside of me, so sometimes everything seems just ""normal"", while I'm sure it isn't. I mean, how does 'brooding' feel? Is it like in a movie, where the thoughts are screaming to you all the time? When do 'normal thoughts' become intrusive thoughts? Is the general topic of suicide (and how I don't want to commit it) being on my mind my own thought or is it intrusive? Is it normal that I tear up regularly (always have), but never arrive at crying? When I was ten, I would sometimes lie awake at night, thinking about how my death is inevitable, which in hindsight strikes me as big red flag. I also briefly underwent medication for ADHD,  which was stopped by my mother back then. Today, I feel like I should have continued to take it, but as my grades were good there was apparently no further need for it. Now, I feel like my supposed ADHD and depression are interacting to make me feel even more unconcentrated, restless and antsy.

1704,Looking For: Positive Sentences,"CW: suicide

I rarely use reddit, so I'm sorry if I do this the wrong way. Long story short, one of my best friends tried to take their own life last night. They are currently committed at a hospital and I have the keys to their apartment and I am watering the plants. I have an idea to use post-it notes to put positive, uplifting sentences all over their apartment for when they return and am looking for suggestions from others. 

Particularly, what quote has gotten you out of a funk in your life? What helped you during a similarly distressing time? This friend in particular suffers from ADD, low self esteem, and is in the process of leaving an INCREDIBLY toxic relationship. 

I guess additionally, if anyone has any advice for being ""the friend"", that would be appreciated. I am speaking with a social worker tomorrow about how best to do this, but any first-hand advice would be swell.

Cheers!"
1705,The one person who I opened up to is now ghosting me,"I've only shared my dark thoughts with one person, not a lover or a crush, but a friend.

I know she might be going through something or she just doesn't have time to reply, but I feel like my walls are being rebuilt. I feel like I'm entering a downward spiral again and I'm scared I might never get out of this one"

Ugh...an hour of answering questions. I am 100% sure that I do not need services because I do NOT drink!!! The positive on the drug test was a false positive (it 100% was because I have not had alcohol since 9/10/16), so I have to go through all this bullshit now.

I am not worried too much. I know I have been sober for a long time, and I feel good about that. :)

It is HOT out there too. :( Temp was 93F when I looked before I'd gone in for the assessment. It is humid as hell too. :( Yuck. I am in the AC again now...I am much happier--munching on pistachios and enjoying the cool air. :D

1710,Escape rooms make me suicidal.,"—TW for suicidal ideation (obviously), homicidal ideation, and drug use—

Why can’t I (19F) just have fun with something intellectually challenging without taking it so personally? 

I just came home from an escape room with my sister (13F). She seemed to have some fun, but for the most part, I was frustrated out of my mind. By the end, I wanted to hurt her and the staff. Badly.

This happens every time. My sister seems to love them, and dad (40M) emotionally pressures me into going with her since it requires at least two people. 

My sister lives with my egg donor, and she only visits periodically. I try to treat her as well as I possibly can in the limited amount of time we spend together, but I’m very short with her in escape rooms, and I feel like I’m part of the reason why she gets so stressed out in them, too—my bad mood has a history of being rather contagious.

For some reason, these things make me so quick to anger. Before I ever went into an escape room, I thought it would be something fun and a little challenging. My intelligence is something
I’m very proud of, and it’s helped me to face many obstacles with confidence. 

I endured a lot of abuse when I was younger that was mainly psychological in nature, so in order to push back and survive, I needed to outsmart many people, many of which were considerably older and more powerful than me, so I consider my brain to be no joke. I feel like there’s almost no challenge I can’t face in that sense. 

But escape rooms? For some embarrassing reason, I just can’t handle them. I can’t handle the idea of being stumped so badly (and while other people are watching, no less).

At the end of every escape room, one of the staff will come into the room with you and show you how it’s done if (when) you don’t escape. And every single time, it’s only makes me more upset. Either parts of the puzzle are so easy that I feel like an idiot for not figuring them out, or they’re so complex that I can’t comprehend how ANYONE could solve them. It makes me angry at myself and everyone else in equal measure. 

The most horrible part is that being unable to solve escape room puzzles totally depletes my self-esteem. It’s like my brain is screaming at me, “Why can’t you do this? Why are you so stupid? It’s probably the weed. It’s make you a moron, now. It’s too late. Your brain is worthless. You might as well die. How are you going to navigate the most basic aspects of adulthood if you can’t even do this? You’re a pathetic, worthless piece of shit. People lied to you when they said you were smart; they wanted to lead you into a false sense of security. You can’t even be nice to your sister in a wittle escape room? Aww, does baby want her bottle? Your identity is a lie. You’re not smart. You’re a failure.”

And these thoughts are so “loud” that I can’t block them out, and they make me fall into a spiral of depression and fury so strong that I can’t even describe it much further than that.

Now, I’m completely exhausted, my face feels hot to the touch, and I want to kill myself. Again.

I want to enjoy this. Every time she and I have gone to one of these things, I try to force myself to have fun and to not get too emotionally invested, but I can’t. I end up thinking so poorly of myself that I contemplate finding a way to commit suicide right there in the room. 

The anger that I feel... It’s stronger than my own body. I lose everything about myself except for the anger. And I feel so helpless because I can’t channel it into anything healthy when I’m trapped in a room full of confusing puzzles with a ticking timer. 

I don’t know how to feel better right now... I’m so tired that I don’t even have the strength to eat. Tying this was a little hard, too, but I had to get this off my chest. I feel miserable—nihilistic, even. I’m regretting everything I’ve ever done in life, and wondering if I’ll ever be able to properly navigate adulthood if I can’t even keep my emotions in check. 

tl;dr: escape rooms are horribly stressful for me, and my self-esteem suffers a great deal. Is there any way I can learn to feel better about them to improve my experience? And if not, should I just avoid escape rooms entirely?"
1711,Has anyone gone from a therapist to a psychiatrists? Advise needed.,"So I am on my fourth therapist and I really like him (as a therapist) and don't want to fire him if I am wrong.  However, after 4 years I don't feel like I am getting better. I am wondering if I need to move to a psychiatrist so I can get medication. I know that the answer people are going to say is, ""talk to your therapist about it."" however, I don't want to hurt the relationship if I don't need to. Is it frowned upon to ask a psychiatrist for a second opinion without telling your therapist? Do I go through my general practitioner to find a psychiatrist?"
1712,"I think, I don't actually have any mental illness - I'm faking it for enjoyment purposes","I ofnet say that I have depression of suicidal thoughts, but right now I think that maybe I don't **really** have them. They generally don't come by themselves - I cultivate them inside me. And I'm clearly doing it for a surplus. I feel better when I feel that way. I **enjoy** this inner sadness, hollowness, and ""I want to die"" thoughts. I **intentionally** say this to myself, intentionally recreate thoughts that make me feel bad, intentionally read subreddits the make me feel lonely and worthless.

That's not how real mental illnesses work. People don't enjoy them and definitely don't intentionally make themselves feel worse. So, I'm not actually ill. I'm just exploiting my brain for some strange masochistic pleasure. This explains why multiple different medical treatments didn't worked - you can't cure something you don't have. I'm just a lazy shit who enjoys feeling worthless, since it provides him a great excuse to continue being lazy for years.

I'm sorry for making this post. I don't know why I've decided to write it, especially here, where people with an **actual** problems are seeking for help. Maybe, I't because I just want attention. I will still post it (since I feel a strong need to do this), but **you can delete this.** Again, I'm very sorry!"
1713,It’s been a whole month since I last self harmed :),"I’ve been doing it for 3 years and I am now 1 month completely clean from it, I’m proud of myself don’t get me wrong but there is always an urge to do it.

1714,Is it weird to want to self-medicate?,"I have depression and anxiety. I come from a really rocky and unbalanced family. Sometimes when I'm so frustrated and angry, I don't really know how to deal with my feelings and I'm filled with so much hate. I just want to drink alcohol, smoke weed, or a cigarette so I can just hurt myself or deal with the pain as a relief. I'm straight edge so I can avoid this problem but being surrounded by people who do the above makes it more accessible.

I hate myself and the situation I'm in. I just want to reach a point where I'm so addicted I overdose or die from bad lungs or something. I feel bad for wanting it because I know people suffer from addiction and some have lost families in this way. 

I know there's better options to coping and I'm doing all I can. It's just sometimes you know?

1715,Ummmm,So I messaged the legal uk page and honestly those guys made me feel like shit about my question like there's 1000 thoughts running through my head and they've set off most of them
1716,Constantly being told that you’re not entitled to something starts to sound like “you’re not worthy of that” and feels like “I’ll never have it”. Or are my brains just scrambled?,"Example, being told “You’re not entitled to sex” starts to feel like “You’re not worthy of sex”.

Being a 24 year old virgin, it really feels like a reinforcement of “never gonna happen, unless you pay a sex worker, at least”.

And what about love? Can’t buy that. What if I CAN get one, but not both together?

I’ve been told “You’re ugly as fuck” and other similar things by so many back in grade school, and by literally hundreds online. This is what makes it really feel like confirmation that I’m unfuckable, and unlovable. 

I hear too many mixed and contradicting opinions online, like “Embrace being single and celibate”, “Just wait for it to happen one day” (waste even more youth), “Get chemically castrated or on something to kill your libido” (I can’t help but feel that this might actually make me feel even worse? And it just sounds unhealthy. But if I have to be a “cuck” it’d be better if I could at least not care about it, right?), and of course “Just pay for it.”

I almost fell into inceldom, a group that claimed to be non-hateful incels (which was bs). They were just telling me to accept my fate, and making me further believe that I am somehow universally unattractive to the female race on a genetic level (that’s not possible, right?)

I’ve been told that I’m not entitled to ANYTHING. But food, shelter, healthcare, etc. Seem to at least be debatable, since you will literally die without them. This bothers me less, since I’ve never had to go without any of these and had them provided to me/accessible my whole life, but I could lose all that at any time too. 

The existence of real life 30-40+ year old virgins feels like reinforcement that I’ll be joining them if I’ve still never been able fi do it, because my life up until this point, points to their direction.

The existence of virgins losing it in their late 20s (older than me, but still in 20s) is KIND OF HOPEFUL, but that doesn’t prove I’ll be like them either.

Just waiting for life to happen seems like justification to not put in any effort, or maybe I’m misinterpreting that because I’m so sheltered and inexperienced at life and take things so literal.

Say I DO lose it within the next few years, or even this week (LOL, just an example, no way that’d happen, especially with the you know what virus going on), and me and her end up in a serious relationship. I don’t see it lasting, because I’ll constantly feel inferior (especially if she’s had multiple sexual partners before me) and wander about what I missed out on, sex with multiple partners, what that variety is like, before settling with one to be seriously together with.

I honestly see myself looking up and shooting the birds (my fingers) and yelling “TAKE THAT GOD/UNIVERSE/WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU ARE! FUCK YOUR PLAN FOR ME TO BE A LONELY VIRGIN! I TOOK CONTROL AWAY FROM YOU! IT’S MY LIFE MOTHERFUCKER! GO THROW A FUCKING FIT ABOUT IT! MY FATE MY CHOICE MOTHERFUCKER!!!!” and laughing like a hysterical maniac, after losing it. 

It’d be a victory against forces higher than me. But a lot of people’s contradictions about God or whatever have probably corrupted my view about God too, if there even is a God.

I know, I sound crazy. Just goes to show how ridiculous the concept of God, or the interpretation of God can be. No good God would send us to “Hell” for not believing in him without providing reason/proof to believe in Him...."
1717,Just them nights 😔,"You know when you’re just thinking about how pointless your life is, how everything you’ve done in your life means absolutely nothing. You feel like you have achieved nothing but tried so hard and for what? Nothing matters, I could just sit here and watch time tick over and see everyone go on with their lives as usual. Is there even a purpose to this life?...  we don’t know. You can make goals in life, things that you want to achieve and succeed in but once that’s all over and done with what’s next? 

If someone asked me if I wanted to restart, start fresh in life would I do it... mostly yes but as of recently I’ve came across some incredible people and seen some light at the end of the tunnel that kept me going. First time in years I’ve gotten a crush on someone and this time it feels so much more special. I can’t describe in words the feeling I get when I’m with her, she makes me smile on my worse days 😢🥺. If someone is keeping me going it is her, I know self love is the most important thing but I’ve been finding it extremely hard lately. But whenever I see her or we’re talking it gives me a massive smile on my face because I’m so thankful that someone can make me feel so happy 😭.

Currently crying like a little bitch now haha but it just warms my heart to know that the people I care about are feeling ok and are happy in their lives. If I can make them feel like they’ve done to me then I guess that’s my purpose in life. I don’t know how some people do it honestly, it’s like a superpower one smile at you and it brightens the rest of your day 😊 

So I guess to sum up my little feels rant, please go tell the people in your life how much they mean to you. If they’re family hug them tight, if they’re friends send them a picture of you and them together and let them know how much you care about them because you don’t know that they could be feeling the same way. And letting them know you care about them will give them a bit of hope ❤️ Thanks for reading"
1718,Having weird daydreams right before bed,"Okay so this is going to sound very strange but I just need some input/different perspectives on what’s going on!

Basically, I (21F) have been having very vivid nightmare-like daydreams right before I go to sleep virtually every night for the last 3 weeks to a month. 

To give some context, I’m usually a very rational and logical person, and during the day if I remember the scenarios it does not phase me. 

An example of one I had last night was that I’d dropped my Tiffany bracelet down by the London Underground tracks (I don’t live anywhere near London and have no plans to visit anytime soon) and my boyfriend jumped down to get it and you can imagine how horrifically that ended. 

The night before it was watching my two fictional children drown in the sea - when I don’t have kids or even plan to anytime soon! 

I do manage to sleep eventually but it takes a little longer than usual and honestly I have no idea what it all means. I’m not overly stressed, I stopped eating cheese past lunchtime in case that old wives tale was true, and I don’t have anymore actual nightmares than usual. 

Any opinions/theories welcome!!"
1719,I'm starting to loose it,"I've been doing pretty well since quarantine started and have actually benefited a bit from the lack of social contact but now its starting to hit me hard and fast. My friends are who I rely on to deal with stuff but they have all been blanking me and im stuck in a toxic relationship i can't leave. My family are slowly driving me insane. I feel so alone and confused ive never had to be independent before my entire personality is based off of those around me. Not intentionally I just tend to take on traits and things that my friends do or like and tailor myself to them. I don't have anyone to ""feed"" off so to speak. I don't know what to do its really confusing and the lack of support and continuity is starting to untethered me"
1720,What’s wrong with me?,"I don’t have friends but I really like to have them in my life. The problem is, I can’t sustain conversations for a long period of time, I only give short answers and it’s hard for me to come up with something funny or enjoyable and I feel so stressed and anxious when I write something, the only time that I can talk for so long is when I’m trying to talk about myself and my feelings. Maybe because I’m super introvert, I didn’t use to talk too much even with my family. 

The issue that I’m going through now is that I’m learning languages and I can’t learn a language without talking and practicing with people and it’s frustrating a bit. When I find a language partner we only talk for one day, and then I never get a reply. I tried so hard for a year now but I haven’t made any progress. 

Now what is bothering me a lot lately is that, I start to feel so jealous when I see someone online on WhatsApp for a long period of time, it drives me nuts, I really don’t like this feeling at all and it started to take a tool on me honestly.

Someone help please, what should I do?"

It has been proven to be very effective for those struggling with BPD.  DBT takes a lot of effort, but if applied, can be very beneficial.”

My therapist is from and based in the US, it was a long distance relationship, so I’m not sure if we have these outpatient treatment centres here in the UK? At least not here in Northern Ireland. I could be completely wrong on this though! And advice or direction would be greatly appreciated!"
1723,Why am I tired?,I’m so tired. I’ve been sleeping all day basically but I’m so tired. What is wrong with me?
1724,I’m so tired of being a shitty person.,I wanna change so badly but i don’t know how to. I hate myself so much and i can’t cope with it anymore.
1725,Am I being an awful person for feeling like enough is enough with my best friends crippling anxiety?,"Best friends for almost 8 years, both currently 25. She has always had anxiety and slight control issues. I've ALWAYS been accommodating and patient with how she handles things/social interactions, but lately I don't enjoy things together anymore and it feels like her anxiety is getting much worse and creating toxic behavior.

If we want to do anything, it has to be planned out to a T from the second we leave her house to when we arrive back home. Almost like a listed itinerary with exact times. She's the only one that can drive or she gets too anxious being in the passenger seat (aka feeling out of control). She also has irrational anxieties, like needing to check the oven to make sure its off every time we leave the house (even if she hasn't cooked in 2 days). Having a panic attack while agreeing to drive all her friends at night because she's going through all the things that could go wrong (flat tire, getting into an accident and killing everyone she loves, getting arrested). Yet no one else can drive because she gets anxious so it's a lose lose. The other day we were driving to a friends together and my boyfriend and his friend were going to drive together and try to get there around the same time. When they said they were gonna leave a little later than planned she got very upset and irrationally mad. I told her them arriving later does not affect us. We aren’t their ride, we don’t need to wait for them, they can do what they want. They wanted to hang alone for an hour or two longer then meet up with everyone and they’re entitled to do that. She was pissed they couldn’t stick to the plan.

If something changes in her game plan she gets VERY stressed and grumpy and panics. Say we have to leave at 9:30 for the beach and my boyfriend is dragging a little and we don't get out the door until 9:35, she makes it known that we're running late and gets very agitated. Literally just a 5 minute difference in her plan is enough to ruin the next hour for her. Our group of friends is very go with the flow, fly by the seat of your pants type of people. Not planners AT ALL. She tries to make a plan for 10+ of us and stresses everyone out in the process, and then when things don't go perfectly to her plan she gets anxious and overwhelmed and can't talk herself down. Even when she's being invited somewhere that's not her house or town, she's trying to make a plan for everyone to make herself feel in control. But in my mind it's like, you can't tell 10 grown adults what to do every hour of the day and you can't expect things to not naturally shift and change throughout the day. You also can't try to control people when YOU'RE THE GUEST. 

I finally had enough a couple nights ago when she completely ruined my whole weekend with this over planning mentality. Tried helping her talk through things and see a lot of her thoughts were just irrational anxieties and that she shouldn't let a tiny bump in her game plan ruin the whole night with everyone. But almost an hour into calmly trying to help talk her down, she was still going on and I got frustrated. I wanted to get back to enjoying the night with our friends. I told her the way she acts not only stresses herself out, it stresses everyone else out. She doesn't handle confrontation well and ran out crying and locked herself in the bathroom. I decided to not baby her and coddle this behavior, so I let her calm down for 15 minutes and suggested we talk outside and go for a walk. She thinks i'm being a horrible friend for telling her to stop controlling everything, and for acknowledging her anxieties are irrational. She wouldn't stop crying and being over dramatic during the whole conversation (me just trying to communicate enough is enough after dealing with it for 4 days straight) so I got even more frustrated and asked her to stop crying and talk to me like an adult. She got even more mad, said I was being mean and shitty and that I was just trying to reprimand  her and so I said that was enough for the evening and we would reconnect the next day.

The whole thing was so childish i'm still wrapping my head around the situation days later. I tried reaching out today and she said she needs more time to process everything as if i'm the bad guy?? I can't handle this excess stress she is always causing. She justifies her behavior with ""well I have anxiety this is what that does to you"" I'm just trying to help her grow up a little and try to get some help to find some coping mechanisms because being a control freak and over planner isn't helping her and it certainly isn't fun to be around."
1726,My employee passed away + midlife crisis,"I turned a number less than 30 yesterday and had a melt down about what's next in my life and is what I'm doing really what the rest of my life will be like?

I went into work this morning and found out one of my employees passed away over the holiday weekend. Their passing was super sudden and I'm new at my job and didn't really know how to handle this. My boss, who would usually help me through these things, was on vacation and my coworkers, who usually step in, didn't know what to do either. The thing is, I didn't even like the employee that much and was planning on putting them on a performance improvement plan and take away privileges when they returned. 

People part of my usual support system are all struggling at their own battles right now and I don't feel I have the right to reach out nor to add the ""need support"" flair. This is especially because most of my agony comes from this conceitedness I have that I'm better than the job I'm in and from the guilt I have towards this employee's passing due to the disciplinary action I was shamefully excited about implementing upon their return. People keep asking me if I'm ok at work, but I'm just mad at myself for being useless and for being so heartless."
1727,Please let me know if you experience the same,[removed]
1728,I’m scared of my life,"I’m never happy, I always feel like I’m unnecessary and that no one cares about me.
I’m scared of my future as I’m aware I have nothing going for me at all, I’m ugly, fat, unfunny, not smart, not athletic, and just not talented at all, I feel like everyone else has something going for themselves around me.
I’m struggling in school, I’m in year 10 and am far behind in almost everything because no matter how much I try, I have no motivation to do any work. I’m bad at all my options and am just generally unhappy with school, which is only made worse by the fact all my family thinks I’m smart and have potential I don’t want to disappoint them, but I know I will.
Also, I lack confidence in anything. I’m very insecure about my body and always feel like I am constantly judged for it.
I’m always thinking about this one girl, which isn’t interested in me and I know she never will be, which has almost brought me down for like a year. As well, I haven’t stopped thinking about this other girl for 2 years, I cared about her so much and then we just drifted, and now she is with one of my best mates.
I’ve always been unlucky in life, both with school and family, I’ve missed one of the most important times in school because of coronavirus, and also missed a lot of school time because of constant issues with surgery’s. I’ve also been unlucky as my great grandma recently passed right next to my birthday as well as might grandad being diagnosed with cancer at the same time, and around 1 month ago we got the news that it was too late and nothing can be done.

I’m scared of life and I’m scared of being a failure. But I always feel like I’m overreacting as I’m general my life has been much better than most. I feel like I’m a pussy about everything."
1729,This is basically my whole life so far and i literally want to kill myself more and more everyday,"So lets start of with a TLDR: Dad kidnapped me as a baby exploited my grandparents to get me back. Saw my great grandad die in front of me. Sister was bullied by her ex bf for 8 years on and off. She then got raped. And i got my heart broken by a girl i adored. Theres more but thats the TLDR






So lets start of!

As a i Child i never really felt wanted by either of my parents. The Dad? Didnt care about me, he actually tried to murder me a few times. Social services were called and i was sent to my mums. She fell into the wrong crowd when me and my sister were about 4- 7 years old. She dated this real cunt of a bloke. He abused my sister  and me till social services got involved again. They didnt do anything the first time. Only asked a question about how we are feeling. I didn't know being abused was what i suffered then. The next time was the last year with my mum. She didn't care about me but i digress. The polie were involved this time cos i got drunk and ran away to my grandparents.  THEY called the cops like the absolute gods they are and i fully fucking repsect that cos by now I'd definitely be arrested or dead. I was your typical ADHD schizo kid. Smashing up everything and just a general fucking cunt of a kid. I was aggressive and if i didnt get my own way I'd smash a window or stab my self so i could basically bribe my mum into doing what I WANTED. We were moved to our grandparents and we lived with them.



The grandparents were the BEST thing that ever happened to me. They treated me like a human instead of a monster. My sister got her first few boyfriends and she then met CuntHead.We wont use his name. He was abusvive to her. very *fucking* abusive.  He hit her beat her stabbed her and sexually abused her. If she broke up he'd stalk her and get his mates to bully her and break our door locks and windows. She didn't eant the cops. When she was about 13 she went to live with my grandads daughter up country. She made friends was happy but got into drugs and missed her grandma. She *ADORED* that woman.  Anyway she stayed up there while i lived down here with my grandparents till i was 16 then chose to move back in with my mum. 


Now we're living with me and my mum. I got my first pet which i fucking love she's still going strong. I got a new lease on life.  Was feeling like a god smilimg enjoying hanging with the Homies . Didnt drink didnt smoke was a proper nice chap with my grandfathers guidance.  I get a girlfriend whos long distance.  I get my first ever breakup but i dealt with it like a absolutely champ. Jokes i got depressed but ""shrugged it off im fine bro"". Flash forward a month im still depressed and i found out my sister tried to kill herself.  We get the grandparents involved and brought her back down here with us. I gradually get over my depression but its always is there. We flash forward another few months, still depressed and I'm in college. Made some friends and fuck they're so sickk! Find out literally 2 months into the course i found out my sister was raped by my mums ex boyfriends family member. She pressed charges but lost. And she dealt with it with self harm and suicide attempts.  Flash forward she now has a friend on snapchat who is literally the best friend she ever has. She starts to live with he. She catches feelings for her brother. Not the cleanest man ( bit of a police record) but the way he treated her and us was astonishing. He had mannees and actually cared. Talked out stuff with her and refused to sleep on a argument till they have sorted it. She moves in with him and is happy as fuck and i buy a dog for myself and geta drug addiction


I'm now 19 and finally get another girlfriend. She was perfect. I was truly in love with her but if fell flat. She couldn't accept that i didnt like her flirting with her friends ( she called them sexy and shit) while i was her bf and she was living with me. She and I couldn't fix a arguement of me asking her to stop so we ended. Pretty fucking badly but I'm the asshole in that situation. Everything and i mean EVERYTHING i did reminded me of her and i just couldn't cope. She meant everything to me and i just couldn't forget her. I finally patched things with her and we agreed to just not stay in contact. I still fucking miss her. After a few months I finally start to get over her till i bump into her with a friend. I'm currently severely depressed. Didn't shower or anything till i had to meet my friends which by this i was just saying im busy all the time but just stayed kn bed wanting to just be gone.  I start to remember all the memories we did and she spoke to me. She apologised of what she did and i said im sorry as well. She hugged me and i really wish i just didn't go out cos this absofuckinglutely broke me. 

Now, everything i do theres always a lil voice saying just off yourself you dont deserve this shitty life. Blah blah blah. We're only a few days after she hugged me and I'm just crippled.  The voice is literally screaming now and i keep breaking down. I feel like my whole lofe is a failure. I couldn't protect my sister. My  first ex was a POS and i still missed her. I got kicked out of college cos i didnt turn up ( my fault shoulda rung and said i was having a bad time). My ex from a couple weeks ago literally ripped out my heart and burnt it alive. All after i let down my guard down for years. I felt like shit hell i still do. I keep tying nooses and fiddling with the knives in the kitchen debating slitting my throat and hanging in the woods. I don't know what to do with life and i just don't want to be alive.  I just want to.be gone and i can't explain that to my friends without feeling like a burden


Thanks for reading btw"
1730,Over the last year my mental health has degraded and I need help managing,"Hi, so I’ll keep this short. Basically over the last two years I’ve had a lot of big changes. I’ve changed medication, lost weight, changed diets, etc. the world has also been pretty wild over these past seven months. Needless to say, my mental health is considerable worse. I get randomly paranoid and obsessively, I’ve developed compulsive traits (both mental and psychical) and I have to be extremely careful not to see something that triggers an panic/anxiety attack. It’s becoming harder and harder to socialize because any little minor thing will throw me into an anxiety spiral. Simply put: I’m exhausted. I’ve already had to get off social media (for the most part) because people online trigger my social phobias. I’m currently speaking to a doctor to get these issues sorted out, but in the meantime, I’m curious to know if there’s anything I can do to soothe this. These issues are getting out of my control and I just want some rest. I don’t need anything super in-depth or deep, I just am curious about what y’all do to cope when you’re going through hard mental periods. Thank you."
1731,How do I make people stop thinking I'm suicidal??,"So I'm a really chill guy and I keep to myself a lot, but I have great friends and I'm happy. I feel like people just assume that I'm depressed and on the verge of suicide. A while ago I put on my snapchat story that I was at a mental hospital, but I was there for one of my brother's friends, not me. A lot people thought I was there because I tried killing myself and this girl who I rarely talk to sent me entire paragraphs explaining why I'm worth living and that I can talk to her if I need help after I told her that I'm fine. I feel like so many people talk to me simply because they think I'm depressed, and I notice that I'm always treated like an injured child by teachers, girls, etc. and they always check up on me and make sure I'm okay. I get that that's really amazing that people can do that, but it just makes me feel so uncomfortable and honestly awful because I'm not suicidal or depressed, and it makes me feel like anytime people try to be friends with me, anytime teachers talk to me, they're just trying to make me feel not alone. I've dealt with this problem since probably 8th grade and I don't know how to appear not suicidal?"
1732,What's the point,[removed]
1733,Stuck in a depression rut and not sure how to get out.,"I've been on working doses of an antidepressant and ADHD medication that have been helpful in the previous months but the last two weeks I've been in a depressive rut that I can't overcome. Not only has the depression been bad, but it's brought with it intense fatigue where I constantly need a nap and even the thought of walking to check my mailbox is exhausting. In addition to the physical fatigue, I broke up with my partner a couple months ago and was recently rejected by someone I have long since liked (right before these two weeks started), so loneliness has been a constant companion. I've called to set up an appointment with my doctor, but the soonest they can get me in is late August.

Any thoughts on how to get back to being my happy, energetic self? I'm still running three times a week but beyond that getting out and being active has been tiring."
1734,Why do I keep sleeping?,"I’ve been dealing with depression for years and developed a habit for oversleeping. I assumed it was a side effect of medication and switched three times; and recently cut my medication all together. But I still find myself sleeping almost 16 hours a day. I try to stay up all day and stay busy, but can barely keep my eyes open."
1735,I am a terrible person and I need guidance. Help me please.please,"This was a facebook status I had to cut and paste here instead. This is how scary close I am to breaking down to 200 people on Facebook. I dont want to do this to them. I dont want to do this to reddit either, but I'm even more of a nobody on here..  I guess that's why my last post wasn't read either on here.. kinda like this one probably. Haha I'm so lonely 


Sure I love being told I'm a peice of shit everyday. Sure, I love being told im useless everyday. And I extra love when I'm compared to not being able to hold a ""normal"" conversation every fucking day. I'm fucking tired of being told im lazy when I have fucking spinobidida and scoliosis. My fucking stomach is getting crushed by my god damn spine. I can't fucking eat more than a childs amount of food at a time. You all made fun of me tho for being skinny tho thanks friends. You try and going one month on my diet and see if you can have the energy to move. I fucking cant even get a fucking good job once in a while. I'm fucking slowly dying anyway, but I'll work harder and tell myself I'll be ok!! Thanks guys! Oh and I'm sorry your depressed too, I am. It fucking sucks. fucking tired of it. I fucking begged for some form of compassion because I dont want to fucking admit what I have to fucking deal with on a daily fucking basis and I'm sorry


Fuck this shit, I'm fucking tired of this fucking disgusting shit and I'm fucking NOT able to physically do anything fucking about it right now.

I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. I'm fucking tired. 
I'm tired of my head and I want out. I'm a psycho and I'm aware of the road of loneliness I'm headed down.

But god damn is it better than being constantly lied to. Constantly told theres still better out there. Constantly told I'm not a motivated individual even though it's impossible to build something with only my heart involved.

I'm tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to lead. I'm fucking tired of being told I'm the one that's supposed to be a man but then getting asked for space in return.

I'm tired of putting my emotions on the table only to not find out about someone 2 years down the road.

I'm tired of being told I can depend on family yet they are the one who bashed my head in and sent me to the hospital

I'm tired of being monogamous and finding out your fiance with 2 kids of 7 years admits shes polyamorous and when the new girl comes into my life 6 months down the road, she promised she was different but told me 2 years ago she was polyamorous. Then I tried for a year and she kicked me out homeless right before the coronavirus.

I get run out of everyone's lives so fast and obviously its because my mental health, but fuck. Governments got to get rid of the stigma of ""oh ask for help"" because what in the fuck does it do but have people tell you that it's going to be ok and then just dissapear? Lol. Where's the friends I drove around for free all those years in highschool. Now that I'm homeless none of them show up lol

Wheres my friends when i constantly put their well being before mine? Wheres my friends when i paid for whatever they wanted without asking to be repaid?

Wheres my friend i once drove to woodstock during college because he missed his mom? Oh and drove home without asking for gas money and went back a week later to pick him up.

Why am I always told I should stop being me so I can stop being depressed? How about some of you show compassion like you all say you do in all these fucking statuses of world events you all seem to seem ""worthy of a profile picture banner""

I was told by someone that I shouldnt be upset no one came to my aid because you dont know their situation.
Yeh I do get that, but shit there are some of you on here I really really thought I'd at least get a message from by now.

I'm tired of being the first to always offer myself to be fucked in the end.

I dont know what this status is about but I know it's what constantly fucks with my head


I'm not a good person and you should delete me off facebook and be done with it, please. I'm just done with my own personal bullshit"
1736,Title,
1737,Feeling self destructive after 4 years,"[TW: self harm, depression]

After 4 years of not wanting to hurt myself anymore... I finally really want to start self harming again.
I want to feel the pain again so I can feel something.

I thought about cutting my thigh with my knife, but resorted to hitting my knee instead.
I'm so depressed and lonely... only 17. I have no one I can talk to.

My parents don't understand the full extent of my depression and Bipolar 2 disorder. They believe it's alright to leave an emotionally unstable depressed person by themselves and make it feel like it's their fault their depressed. 

I cant talk to my mom about any of it because she is so double sided on my mental health. She'll act all sweet one moment when I'm having a breakdown and then the next breakdown she's harsh. 

I cant take it any longer, I just want consistancy in people. I want a happy life. I want some reassurance in my family, but my life has become miserable and lonely. For the last hour the only thing I've been able to feel is the tight squeezing of the heartache in my chest. It makes my finger numb. I was sure I was going to end up having a heart attack.

I've been strong for so long... but everyone just sees me as weak. They think that back when I was pretending to be happy I was strong, even though that was when i was the weakest. I feel so alone. My thoughts are all over the place and it feels as though I'm just venting now... but I yearn so much for someone to call me strong or to acknowledge my hardships and see that I am trying... and not that I'm just some shitty little brat.

I dont want to hurt myself... to see bruises or scars. But I dont know what to do. It gives me a high, if only for a moment. Please help."
1738,"I’ve worked too hard, and don’t want to be a burden.","Like many of us have posted here we’ve all dealt with our own stuff. I don’t wanna be a burden to my family because they have great burdens of their own. I grew up in a very poor household and I’ve dealt with my fair share of bad experiences and turmoil, what have you. My only hope in life is to help others because I know what it feels like, But you can’t help other people if you can’t help yourself. I have been on and off drinking again and I know it’s not making it any better it’s only making it worse but I can’t control myself even though as soon as I grab the drink I know it’s the wrong thing to do but my body is just taking over and I really can’t stop it. E ven saying this out loud I feel like it’s a crazy thing to say it’s insane I don’t know why this is happening I am not one who Takes these things very lightly. I know it’s super easy to say just don’t drink or just have self-control or whatever because these are the things that I would be telling to my friends if they were saying these same things to me. I am usually the one who is giving out advice unfortunately I am not in this position right now. I’ve been recently seeking mental help in my local area.Unfortunately after receiving said help my therapist was unknowingly by anyoneThe I have a contact with put on an undetermined on the time leave. I was scheduled a new therapist which actually is not bad whatsoever. But that being said with my own circumstances I know that I need more therapy because certain things have arisen I am not capable of really dealing with once a week. I just was able to get my life back in order by getting a job and an apartment so on and so forth. Now I feel like I need more help than a full-time job as a general manager of a restaurant will allow. I don’t know what to do at this point. Should I just suck it up or is there an alternative that will allow me to get the help that I need and still be able to afford  the only thing that has given me even partial comfort and peace so far."
1739,Was my ex friend gaslighting me?,"I had a best friend for three years. We met in mental health treatment. At some point, I became more vocal about my trauma and that flipped a switch in her. Idk why. She started leaving passive aggressive comments on my Facebook and making fun of me with her friends.

But then she would say stuff like, ‘I’ve noticed you’re not talking to me as much. Why?’ and ‘I miss you’ and stuff like that, almost as if she was pretending that she didn’t realize what she’d done.

I guess I don’t understand what the point of this was. Is it gaslighting?"
1740,I don't know if this is to do with mental health but please read it.,"Sometimes I get in this feeling of pure terror. I can't move, I can't think properly, i cant feel anything... just fear. I turn on all of the lights I can and stand in the corner of the room with a weapon. Eventually i run to my room and stay in the corner. By this point I can't breath properly. I keep thinking im seeing shit through the corner of my eye and just feel dread and fear. I heard a tiny noise and thriw my phone and glasses and collapse and don't breath until I feel its safe. Tonight this happened and someone came into my room, I pretended I was sleeping then jumped round ready to knock them out. It was my dad.

I feel so fearfull of everything when this happens. Please let me know what I can do."
1741,Panicking,"So this started about 9 months ago (while I was still in a very toxic and unhealthy relationship) and basically every time I wake up after a nap I always start shaking, sweating, and my heart rate goes up. Sometimes I'll start crying as well. This doesn't happen when I sleep, and I don't know why this is happening. This made school very stressful and tiring to deal with since I had early classes at 6:45 in the morning, and I don't know why this is happening."
1742,So I was watching tik Toks...,"And I was brushing my teeth. So I was finishing up and looked up into the mirror and I legitimately said “wait, I’m pretty.” Like I was actually shocked. I’m not sure how to react to that."
1743,17M. Finally coming to the realization I have mental problems. Any ideas as to what I may have?,"Don’t know where to start. I go through periods where I am super depressed and just feel low. I have no energy and appear very dull to people. Like no emotions around them. Then sometimes I feel super happy and euphoric. Usually I go one minute feeling depressed then the next super happy. Sometimes I’m super euphoric for days and on other days depressed. Also have some aggression and anger issues. Definitely have been heavy on drug usage, nothing hard like crack or pills, but mostly alcohol. I think the depression has caused me to recently start having night terrors as well? Any ideas would help. Don’t want to deal with doctors right now. Thanks"
1744,Why do I feel like this?,"I want to preface this by saying i am a Mechanical Engineer and am currently going through more classes to better my abilities and a child I was considered ""gifted"".
I have began to notice more often that I feel like everything I know, all the information I have learned is not real or usable and that I am not as able as everyone says I am or that I feel I should be. I feel that all my previous successes are missgiven and that I feel like I am behind all of my peers when imperial evidence says otherwise. As a young child I was considered gifted, but I countinued to study and work because school then bored me. 
But now, with the world as it is, I feel so...wrong. As if I am one step from failure. I feel that every second that I am not working directly on bettering my future, I am failing myself. I feel guilty for taking a day off from studying or working on scholarships. I have not been in close contact with my friends in over a month. I feel as if I am spiraling, creating feedback loops of failure; the more I rest, the more I stress, the more I need to rest for fear of utter burn out. 

Have I reached a burnout? Am I failing? Please Advise"

She is manipulative, a compulsive liar, and has threatened to ruin our lives if she wanted to. At first I thought most kids dealt with this, but after years of meeting more people, and seeing them have genuine connnections with their mothers, I don’t know how to deal with it. I have a loving father, but due to financial struggles he can’t divorce my mother in fear she would try and play the victim and take custody of us and his money. I’ve been extremely depressed for months, and recently had suicidal thoughts.

I feel like i'm going crazy rn and can't think and have brain fog and am pacing and completely depersonalized. Idk what to do.

When I was a young kid, I was really paranoid. I’d constantly look over my shoulder and feel like someone was following me. For some more detailed examples, when I slept, I worried someone was going to break into my house and stab me. I grew into the habit of making sure all doors and windows are locked locked before bed, sometimes multiple times. When I was real young, I had to sleep in a bed with my mom because I didn’t have a room, so I would try to sleep in a position as close to her and as flat against the bed as possible, as well as under the covers so if someone came in I’d be able to somehow surprise them and fight them off. I’d have nightmares about getting shot or stabbed or injured in some form. When I was in the car, I was thinking of bizarre situations such as if the car were to get shot at. I’d sit with my head below the windows and keep my eye on my brother so if something, for whatever reason did happen, I could try to pull him down. I’m currently now a teenager (from U.S btw) and while I don’t worry about getting shot in the car anymore, I will get really worried over car accidents (especially on highways during longer rides) and sometimes will end up keeping an eye on the cars around when my parents are driving. At night I listen closely to footsteps to make sure it’s one of my family members or pets. I am so used to thinking that I’m going to die that I have a trouble being motivated, and It’s hard to think about future plans. I know this isn’t healthy, and I want to work on lessening this weird anxiety thing (at least this is what I assume it is) and being able to focus more on developing myself, especially since I’m a few years I’ll be an adult and have to go off to college. Any ideas/advice?"
1750,I feel like no one truly gets how I feel,"Most of my friends don’t understand how I truly feel even though I’ve told them how I feel.
I honestly feel like a low functioning depressed individual and srsly see no point in life sometimes, but my friends all think I’m normal and fine because I fake it so well.
After starting wellbutrin I do start to feel a bit better, but there’s always a sense of dread inside me, that I’m still not really happy. That maybe I’ll never be truly happy, maybe I don’t deserve it. If someone gave me the chance to die today with no pain, I’d still take it because I’d rather be dead than deal with this cruel world sometimes."
1751,I constantly feel like I'm punching fog,"There is a lot of fog in my head, making me anxious and unable to navigate towards my goals and purpose in life due to the lack of any clear view. I'm just aimlessly punching it as if it would ever go away by distracting myself with futile stuff like internet memes and pornography. But thoughts of defeat and ideas of ending it all doesn't leave my head."
1752,I really need some cheering up,"Hi im currently a teenager and as a preface: i never focused on my oral hygiene and as a result my teeth started to look worse. Well for the past few months i have been trying to work on doing better but ive been constantly harassed about how bad my teeth look by my family (mind you this is while im trying to get my teeth fixed), and im really feeling discouraged like im never gonna be able to do it because of the amount ive been mocked. I know this most might not be the right sub for this post but it was the only one i could find that might be able to help me out of my current pit of despair."
1753,Is my dad the reason I have anxiety issues? Why am I so afraid of him?,"So I’m not sure where to start but I just need to get this off my chest. I’m terrified of my dad point blank. Even as 21 year old I still feel this way. He’s never hit me growing up but when I was younger whenever I made (usually) careless mistakes I was scolded harshly and sometimes made to feel so guilty that I was too afraid to even make that same mistake. There’s a couple of scenarios I remember that I’ll always remember but I’ll just use one as an example. 

When I was in 5th grade I was asked to help organize some papers along with other kids. The counselor that asked us said to put our certificates (from our graduation ceremony) together on a filing cabinet to keep safe,  so I did and we were organizing for a while and went back to class. I assumed she’d give them back to us because she never said to take them when we left or whatever I just assumed that she would keep them safe and give it back the next day. So fast forward and my dad picks me up after school and he was in a good mood and being a kid I basically told him every detail of my day including me leaving my certificate with the counselor. He got angry immediately and was like “you lost it!?”. I can’t remember exactly what he said but just that I was irresponsible while raising his voice. I was trying to explain that I didn’t and tried to tell him exactly what happened, but he didn’t let me finish. I just shut down and didn’t look at him trying to hold back tears. I went to my room to cry and I didn’t leave for a while I guess because my dad came in later with my laundry to put in the sock drawer. I was obviously still teary eyes because he looked at me and said “you’re still crying?”. This memory is burned into my brain and I wish I could forget it. 

Nowadays I’m 21 years old trying to finish my certification to teach art and I’m still afraid of him because of how mad he gets. I get up late and I’m also taking a summer class so I don’t start on hw until the afternoon. My schedule is workout, shower, eat, chores, homework and draw. I try to schedule my time almost everyday to draw because I’m trying to grow my skills. Today he got to the vacuum before I could get to it, which I usually do. I was in the shower and I was a little confused that he wouldn’t just wait for me or ask if I could vacuum. I guess I should’ve said something but tbh I’m afraid of even asking. He won’t ask me either because he has this philosophy where he shouldn’t have to ask for us to do something and that we should do it without being asked to. Basically it spiraled into him cussing out loud in his room because of something but I always assume it’s me because I was doing homework instead of chores. Then I realized that my whole relationship with him is mostly just anxiety and fear. 

I always try to be one step ahead of him so that he won’t get mad. I’m afraid to ask him because I have this fear that he’ll just start saying bad things about me or that he’ll be in a bad mood. I’m always walking on eggshells with him. Especially because he’s retired so it’s just me and him most of the day until my mom and sister come back from work. I can’t even walk past him without feeling at least a little tense and with my head down. When he’s mad I feel like I’m a kid again I just freeze and hold my breath. All I want to do is hide in my closet like I did normally as a kid. When he leaves for errands I feel a sense of relief, when he comes back I get nervous again. When I do make a mistake I’m terrified of asking him for help with something (like car issues usually.) Even with chores I’m sometimes afraid to do them because he might say I’m doing it wrong or something. I just always think he’s judging me all the time from afar. I sometimes blame myself and feel like I’m a burden. 

I never talk about it with my family because they probably would say I’m being over dramatic and that I should just do the chores and nothing would happen. They know that he needs to calm down but nothing is done about it. We’ve honestly just accepted it that it’s just the way he is. I just needed to express my thoughts. Thanks to anyone sticking around."
1754,Feel low always but don’t know the reason why,"I always feel low nowadays, and I don’t quite yet have a grasp as to why I’m feeling like that. There are a number of topics that really gets me down. Love, Friends, family, career and god knows what else. Don’t really feel motivated to do anything in life. Just sit and play games and that’s pretty much what I’m doing. 

This results in fuckall sleep patterns, disturbed sleep, mood swings and most importantly absolute lack of motivation. Just feel like odds are stacked against me in every way possible. And cherry on the top is I live in a society where mental health is a joke. My own family just says take a day and then get better. I have no clue as to what to do. Even if I take up an activity it lasts for 3-5 days and then I relapse into the same cycle again. Sometimes I just feel I have no clue about what’s going on and I’m stuck in a middle of an absolute crisis. 

Honestly I don’t even know why I’m posting here, but I thought I might as well write it out somewhere and maybe get some sort of validation because I’m sick and tired in general for living like this in a constant state of tension and panic and putting up a face for the people who care for me. I’m just rambling. Don’t mind me. 
Peace."
1755,Why is mental health stigmatized and criminalized as it is?,"I've been on mental health holds twice this year, and spending time in a mental hospital is basically like prison, and I've been in the ER involuntarily five times now because of suicidal ideation, so I have to wonder why having mental illness and self harm issues leads to basically being arrested just for expressing or trying self harm.  Recently I have discussed wanting to end my life in response to the COVID-19 measures and my own GP told me to go to an ER, despite him knowing I refuse to wear a mask in any situation and so the ER would just turn me away.  He suggested this knowing I've been involuntarily held several times and that it was not a good experience for me, and I imagine not for anyone else, and others I've talked to even said they wanted to call a wellness check on me and blamed bipolar for my desire to end my life in response to ""a mild inconvenience"" (yeah right).  Anyway, a lot of people basically want me arrested simply for being mentally ill, and I want to know why this is the prevalent attitude in society."
1756,Is it abnormal that seemingly irrelevant things make me want to burst into tears (but I catch myself)?,It often happens during conversation where I could talk about something that has nothing to do with me and I can feel my eyes water slightly and my face feels like I want to just cry but it doesn't tip me over the edge enough to do so. Is this weird?
1757,"I see things moving out of the corner of my eye, but when I look they’re sitting still","I have no idea if this is the correct sub for this (it’s probably not, but the only place I could think to put it, I apologize.) , so if someone knows a better place for me to put this, please let me know

I’ve only been noticing this going on for the past two years at most, but much much more frequently in the past couple months. Before, it would be maybe once every few months, but today it happened three times that I remember 

I’m not sure how to explain it best, I know that it’s not a hallucination (I think) because the thing that is moving is an actual physical item. The first time I noticed it today, I was outside gardening and out of the corner of my eye it looked like a piece of mulch was moving very slowly, but when I looked it was sitting completely still. There was no wind at all and it was on flat ground so it’s extremely unlikely that it actually moved at all. The most recent time was when I was looking at my laptop with a notebook sitting beside it, and It looked like a circle on my paper had twitched. 

I’m sort of starting to get concerned that something could be wrong, it’s most likely due to a bad sleep schedule or stress , but I can’t shake the idea that it could be a brain tumor or something

any help or comments are greatly appreciated"
1758,I need a therapist,How did you guys find a good therapist? I finally went to therapy and just didn’t vibe with this guy. I wish there was like a tinder for therapists where you could swipe until you found a good match.
1759,What do you do when a family member has a psychotic break?,"So today I found out my cousin had a psychotic break sometime in the past couple months. I knew they had some issues with drugs in the past and had shown some signs of some sort of mental health disorder since they lived with my immediate family for a year when I was 14 (am 20 now). I never really knew the full extent of it since they moved a couple states away. However I had heard from my mom that something had happened and that my aunt had posted about it on Facebook. So I looked into it found out their social media accounts were deactivated and found out they had been dissociative for a few weeks. I found out the whole story which I won’t share since it’s not mine to share however it seems they have gotten the help they need for the immediate future however I don’t know how to bring this up to my parents as they are clueless of what actually transpired. As well as how to offer support to their parents/10 brothers and sisters. Where do I go from here? 


TLDR: my cousin had a mental break and has been disassociated for about a month or a month and a half. I just want to know how to talk about this with my parents or their family."
1760,Groundhogs day(kill me),"This is going to be extremely scattered, probably just random thoughts that are constantly going through my mind. Daily. Regularly. Non stop. In no particular order. 

I hate my life
Everything sucks
I feel nothing
I hate everybody
What’s the point
Fuck you bitch
I’m hungry but don’t feel like eating 
I don’t want to do shit, and I don’t even want to do that. 
Talking to people or doctors don’t do a thing because honestly they don’t know you, will never really know you or be able to fully emphasize with you or what you feel. They’ll just go off some generic bullshit recommendation regarding situations and experiences they’ve been through/studied/worked for others feeling the same. It’s bullshit. You’ll never tell me something I haven’t thought of to get out of this black hole of a feeling. 
Fuck everything
I have kids and they’re the only reason I haven’t offed myself. So that basically makes me feel more trapped and stuck. 
I have my son every other week, I’m trapped in a state I’ve been in my whole life and I really want to move but I can’t. Because if I did(to make a little happiness in my life) I’d end up feeling the same if not worse because I left him for my own wants/needs. So fuck me, I’m fucked and trapped here. I’ll feel like shit wherever I go without him. 
He’s all that keeps me here.
I feel fake as fuck because I have to pretend to be happy and good and do things I wouldn’t be doing if he wasn’t around. Which in return makes me feel even shittier when he leaves for the week. 
I don’t enjoy one single thing I used to be passionate about anymore. All my hobbies have disappeared.
I don’t want to eat
I don’t want to sleep
I don’t want to think
I don’t want to breathe
I don’t want to talk
I don’t want to listen
I don’t want to do anything 
Not doing anything makes it even worse so then I try to do something but fuck that, because doing anything fucking blows. No point. 
Please run me off the road and crash my shit into the biggest tree and full send my ass through the windshield. 
Ima go to sleep. Can’t sleep.
I’ll play some video games. Boring.
Watch tv. Who cares.
Go fishing. Wow fish
I need to eat. Why so you can shit.
You need medication. Ok autopilot(I already am)
I honestly just have no clue what or how to do this for another 30 years. 
What is the point? 
I don’t smile, I don’t laugh, I don’t care.
And to be completely honest I’m cool with feeling like this. Because again... what’s the point. 

Anybody relate to this, or am I really off the charts?"
1761,"Do you use any mental health apps? If so, which ones, and how have they helped you.","Given the pandemic, as we struggle with isolation and difficulty finding providers and groups that are accepting new clients, I found myself wondering if any of these wellness and mental health apps could be effective. 

I would love to hear your experiences!"
1762,I need some help...,"So im kind of new here, but there isnt really someone i feel i can reach out to about this.. Ive been seeing a lot of people coming out recently and talking about their rape experiences. Ive seen wonderful loving responses to them, but also people who say they are liars and are looking for attention. I feel pretty comfortable here and just wanted to talk about my experience and how it makes me feel. So i was dating this guy and all together we dated for like 5 years. After we had been dating for like a year and im sorry if this like too graphic but i told him that sexually i was starting to feel more comfortable with him because i had lost my virginity to him and i was really self conscious so i just felt more comfortable trying new things and thats when he started to do anal with me but i never really said yes do this and i also never said no while it was happening. So to me thats my own fault and i dont consider that rape. But after about 3 years of dating we were hanging out in his room and he kept trying to like finger me and i told him no i wasnt in the mood but he shoved me and pinned me down i was still saying like no i really dont want to. He kept taking of my pants and started having sex with me.. I was kicking and saying no and i started crying.. He wouldnt stop until i hit him and he just kinda stared at me and i told him i was serious and i broke down. He never really said sorry and it didnt happen again. After that ive just kind of felt like i shouldnt say things during sex or even if things bothered me. He was kinda neglectful like would let me cry myself to sleep most nights. He cheated on me.. Idk thats a bit off topic. But i just felt like my feelings didnt matter in any situation. In my new relationship i still get like anxious and stressed when it comes to our sex life. I feel very uncomfortable at times and feel like i have to give in even if i dont want to. Anyways, i basically just cant convince myself i was raped because it was my boyfriend at the time and that maybe i didnt do enough to stop it. Im just looking for people to hear this and let me know if i was or wasnt raped... Maybe this is like super insensitive and im sorry if it is i just want to not feel crazy for telling myself i was raped. I just feel like it was my fault."
1763,Self harm question. Am I doing it wrong?,"I started cutting myself when I was 14. It got worse through my teenage years, especially towards the end of my uni days. Things got better afterwards, when I started working. Although there are still occassions when I just lose it and start cutting again. 

Bottom line is, I have a lot of scars on my wrist. I'm careful about it though, in the sense that I always cut on a specific place. On my wrist, underneath my watch. It's very convenient because I always wear a watch when I'm around people.

The past few months have been rough on me, however. I was back to cutting myself. Big time.

So now my scars have piled up. I still use an x-acto knife that I've been using for a while now. It used to serve me well, delivering clean cuts. But now, when I cut myself, I don't bleed as much. I try to apply more force to it but I seldom get the performance I used to get. The wounds still hurt, and I still get a peak of the surface below my skin. But the lack of blood isn't as satisfying as before, I end up not wantimg to cut more and cut deeper... I was wondering if this had something to do with me cutting myself on skin that is heavily scarred as opposed to fresher surfaces. It's gotten me really curious. But I couldn't find anything online."
1764,I have been verbally abused and because of that I have severe confidance problem. I was never loved or taken care of I don't know wramth of tla lover or a mother.,What to do?
1765,Chronic Guilt?,"This probably sounds like a strange/annoying question and I've been going back and forth on if I should even post anything, but I feel like I need to because I'm starting to feel like I'm alone in this and helpless. 

I'm 23 years old, and for as long as I can remember, I have always had a ""guilty conscience"". But the problem is that it's almost never warranted. I'm not saying I'm a perfect person by any means and that I havent done things in my life to feel guilty about just like anyone else, but ive always had a problem with feeling overwhelming guilty even when I didnt do anything to feel guilty over. For example, I will be sick and have to call into work, and the overwhelming guilt I feel over the thought of letting people down and having people be angry with me will eat me alive for the entire day. I have had divorced parents since I was young, and still to this day when I need to choose whether I want to stay the night at my mom or dads house, I will feel so guilty about whatever choice I make that I cry and feel guilty for days, or even weeks. I know logically in my head that I did not do anything wrong in most of these situations and that I am overthinking, but I still cant shut these feelings down. Its starting to really take a toll on my life and happiness and becoming exhausting. I don't know how to go on with making big decisions in my life when I cant do simple things without feeling crippling guilt for no reason. And it doesnt help that I was just diagnosed with endometriosis, which I feel guilty about in my relationship now. 

So, I guess my question is, does anyone else experience this? Is it part of a larger mental health issue that I am just not aware of? I have a doctors appointment to discuss all of this next week, but I just need some advice first so I know how to structure my thoughts during the appointment. Sorry if this was so long to read! 

TL;DR: I have crippling guilt over every little decision I make in life, no matter what, even when I know logically that I did nothing wrong. Is this a sign of something bigger?"
1766,Hard Times in the Morning,"I need some advice if y'all wouldn't mind.

For me, some of the hardest times of the day are in the morning. Though it's more likely for me to, say, do something, I generally feel more hopeless and just awful in the morning. Does anyone know how to get over this?"
1767,Weird depressive episodes?,"I’ve always been a nihilist. Sometimes I can see why that makes my mental health worse, but it’s just my beliefs. I’ve slowly started to notice that every night (not necessarily at a specific time, just in the evening) I tend to go through these weird episodes. It feels like all emotion is drained from my body and that nothing good comes out of life. Some nights they can be really bad (like tonight) where i don’t feel anything. I cant laugh at anything or even smile. It kind of feels like i’m on the verge of tears, but i’m not at the same time (if that makes sense?). It’s like my nihilistic views on life are turned up to 100%. It’s gotten to the point where I cant even remember the last night when i didn’t have one of these episodes. I feel like I have no one to turn to or vent to (but at the same time i feel like i wouldn’t know what to vent about). I don’t know why i’m having these problems. Can anyone help?"
1768,I don’t know what to do - I’ve hit a low,"As a precursor, I’m a 15 years old boy. Around 3 months ago I received bad medical news, and for the first time in years I felt truly depressed. I just didn’t care about anything. I’m a very anxious person, and since then my symptoms have gotten much worse. Everything I do follows by the thought of “no this us stupid it’ll go badly and it’ll have bad consequences on me”. Since then, everything has gotten worse. I have no will to live anymore, it feels like I have no ending and it’s all towards nothing, my medical issues are not looking up, and most recently my anxiety has never been so bad. Whenever I say anything or do anything I am scared that people will ridicule me for it, and I now honestly think that everyone hates me. I feel like I know it isn’t true, but I don’t really understand it, like I get it, but I don’t REALLY get it. Honestly I’m scared because I’ve suffered from suicidal thoughts and depression in the past and have attempted and I feel like I’m in a similar place but worse. There was this girl I have a crush on, but I feel like if I try to make a connection with her and it fails it will out the nail in the coffin, but I feel alone anyways and feel the need to find companionship. I don’t know what to do, I just wanna be happy"
1769,How am I able to tell if medication is working?,I’ve been trying 4-5 different meds and I’ve felt better but I’ve also changed my mindset and attitude towards my mental health. It’s impossible for me to tell if I’m feeling better because of the mindset change or the meds. Can somebody help me with this? Would you be able to tell if the meds were working? I’d prefer not to take them.
1770,Am I losing my mind?,"Lately, I've been getting deja vu a lot.

Okay, okay, I know. Deja vu is a perfectly normal thing to experience from time to time. But this feels different.

I know it sounds crazy, and I'm mostly posting this to get my thoughts out and have it all written out, because I seem to always forget what's happening. I've always had deja vu, like everyone else. But in the past several months, things have... changed. It keeps happening more and more, and it's usually not even about the mundane things that I could brush off as coincidence. There are times in which it happens that I KNOW that's never happened before, and nothing similar has ever even happened. Things that would have been impossible to happen before. Oddly specific things that I just can't shake the feeling I've lived and experienced before. Series of oddly specific things that seem far too strangely familiar to just be deja vu.

It happened again today. I was on tinder, of all places. I'd only made an account two days ago, and had never gone on it or any similar app in my entire life. I got a match, and it wasn't that the person just looked familiar, but when I saw my screen with all my matches and that specific screen with those specific messages from those specific people in that specific order felt far too familiar for the third day of using it. It was strange to say the least. Then I happened to glance over to my window, and saw my phone cord unplugged and draped over the cord of my fan in my window next to my guitar.

It seems stupid. Even writing this, I know it seems absolutely ridiculous. But I've only been living in this apartment for 6 months. Only within the last few days bought that fan for my window, and apart from today, the cord was always plugged into my wall, far away from the window. This was the only time I would have seen that specific detail, and looking around my room... look I know I'd be used to living here. I know my room would seem familiar. But it wasn't just the room it was just all these tiny details of how everything was placed. My room was a little messy, and though some of the things in it had only today entered my home, but I swear all happened before, and everything had been exactly where it was in that moment.

I began to feel like I was losing it. But then I started to remember the other times this has happened. All the times in the last several months where I experienced this inexplicable sense of oddly specific deja vu. Far too many times to be considered normal. Far too many times not to question why or how it was happening so often. But I'd somehow forgotten, and so quickly, as it seemed. I'd felt like this countless times before, questioning my sanity, and wondering if I was starting to lose my mind. How could I have forgotten that so easily? How had I managed to forget questioning whether I was going crazy many times in each of the last several months?

Even writing this, I feel like I've done this before. I feel like I've written this exact post several times over and posted it to this exact subreddit. But I haven't. I KNOW I haven't.

And all this while, I feel like something's going to happen on August 20th. I first got the... premonitions, I suppose, back in January. In all that time, I keep feeling like something's going to happen on August 20th. I *know* it. It feels like some animalistic instinct, like when birds and insects all flee from an area just before disaster strikes. Could it be connected?

I can't help thinking of those speculations on what hell might be like. Hell has never been included in my beliefs, but the idea of reliving a moment, or some span of time, over and over and over again seems all too similar. Even though, despite everything, my life isn't too terrible right now, and I haven't done anything to deserve it, I can't help but wonder if I might be in hell. Is August 20th the day I die? Or is it something bigger? Some cataclysmic event that humanity as a whole is repeating and these are the memories bleeding through from past repeats.

I hope I can find answers. I honestly have no idea if there's something bizarre happening here or if I am, indeed, simply losing my mind. There's no history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort in my family, and until this began to happen and outside of these experiences, there has been nothing to lead me to believe I'm going crazy. I don't know which option would be better- if I was going crazy or if I'm right about all this and something strange is going on.

Has anyone else experienced this? Please tell me someone has experienced this. I don't want to be alone in this. I don't want to be crazy."
1771,What to do when I can’t do anything,"I often fall into these moods out of nowhere where I’m bombarded with thoughts of worthlessness, regret, and sometimes suicide. During these episodes, I can’t bring myself to do anything except nothing and hope that I somehow cease to exist. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions for what they do to occupy themselves during a particularly bad slump??"
1772,Coming off anti depressants,"Hi guys 
I'm not asking for medical advice, I'll give you some background and want to know what coping mechanisms work for you.

I had a workplace trauma in January and was medicated with 20mg valium and built to 150mg Zoloft

I've been cutting down the last 3 weeks and have been off Zoloft for 3 days. Valium is down to 1 tablet a day of 5mg

My brain hurts and I'm having crying fits of frustration over nothing. The brain zaps and pain seem to be normal from what I've researched.

My doctor has just told me to take a week off work she knows, I was never depressed just bad anxiety. She admits I've cut down too quick but I don't want to be medicated any more. I'm seeing a new psychiatrist on the 17th as I'm suspected to have undiagnosed ADHD and wanted to be drug free for that appointment so I can't start new treatment if necessary.

What do you do when you just want to lay on the couch and cry over nothing? 
How do you occupy yourself?
How to be kind to yourself?
How do I get through the next few days?

Thanks for reading this far, any advice is welcome"
1773,I know something is wrong with me but don't know exactly what - lots of questions,"So a little backstory: I've self-harmed on-off for many years starting since I was 15, I've had periods when I don't that have lasted for more than a year and then I fall off the wagon again. Having a semi-abusive boyfriend trough ages 16-20 didn't help either. Been clean since February for now so that's good I suppose.

I haven't really been to the doctor's except seeing a psychologist for a little bit a couple years ago (did nothing for me)  and then quite recently talking to the therapist at school  (via e-mail) who kind of confirmed my self-diagnosed depression but I wasn't able to actually start sessions with her because of the pandemic. 

So mostly I have some times when I'm okay and have energy and then I have times when getting out of the bed is the most difficult part of the day, I sleep more than usual and I can't get anything done. The worst bits are when I can't even motivate myself to do school stuff because the voice inside of me is saying that it's pointless. At these times pretty much the only thing I can do is drag myself to work because it's literally not possible for me to just not show up. Getting out of bed sometimes is the biggest accomplishment of the day. 

Lately I've been thinking about calling my doctor and get an appointment to a therapist trough her, so I'd get an actual diagnosis and also treatment. But I'm a bit scared that they'll just prescribe me some meds and then send me on my merry way. And I really don't want to take some random pills and then get sad again when the prescription ends. 

So just many questions here: 1) should I just hang in there and hope things get better once I graduate (o do believe that the biggest factor of my ""depression"" is university) ? 2) if I will take the pills - do they really help or will I have to be on medication for the rest of my life? 3) are there or does anybody have experience with ""natural/plant based"" medication? (And please don't say weed, I can't stand that stuff)."
1774,YOUR STORY COULD HELP SAVE NYC PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES,"Hey everyone, I hope that you’re all well during these extremely difficult times

&amp;#x200B;

So I’ll cut to the chase. I am a nurse in New York City, and a doctoral candidate in nursing practice, specifically in psychiatry. New York State hospitals are rapidly shutting down psych units and claiming it’s because of covid, even though my hospital hasn’t seen a symptomatic covid patient in about a month. In fact, the covid units are empty. I am currently working with a prominent nurse’s union, some of my professors and other nurses and doctoral candidates to do something about this. I can’t sleep at night knowing my patients are suffering both horrible injustices and serious mental illnesses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a meeting with a NYS senator this week, and I know that this is short notice, but if anyone has a story about how they or a family member needed/needs acute psychiatric care/hospitalization, and cannot get it because psych patients are being pushed out of ER’s etc. The cause could use your help. Feel free to DM me. If you have a story, something you would like to tell a public official in order to help us to reopen these desperately needed psych units, please come forward and message me.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I know of so many overdoses, suicides, and crises that are happening right now. People can’t get the help they need and deserve. I’m doing my best to fight for these people. Mental health matters. If you have a story, first-hand accounts are incredibly powerful. I would be more grateful than I can express for your courage and willingness to stand up and say that you, or a friend, or family member is suffering and cannot receive help.

&amp;#x200B;

It is preferable if you live in The Bronx or Manhattan, as these are the locations that are under this elected official’s jurisdiction and are the populations that this particular hospital system serves.

Thank you for your time"

1777,I Feel Broken,"Hey, this is my first post here and i’m quite nervous so i’m sorry if stuff i say doesn’t quite make sense, i’m a 17M and because of my past i’ve always had this feeling inside of me that i’m not good enough to be on this earth since i was around 7, i witnessed physical abuse and was on the end of it a few times, i have what i would consider bad ADHD and clinically diagnosed anxiety. In march 2020 i lost my grandmother to cancer and had to miss the funeral due to Covid-19, since then my mental health dropped, i couldn’t get out of bed most days for the best part of 2 months, during this time i attempted an OD twice, and have self-harmed several times, then i was getting better, then i lost my close friend to suicide, who i was speaking to the night before trying to stop him and he promised me he wouldn’t and still did, since then i’ve been on a downhill drop again, i’ve self harmed a lot again and considered suicide again, however this isn’t all, i recently came out as bisexual to my family and since then my stepfather has completely ignored me and refuses to speak to me, as well as this i went out with my friends, and they held me down and “beat the gay out of me”, i considered it a joke but the more i think about it the less i believe that, they also know about my struggles and recently told me to get over myself as i “don’t even have mental health issues and making it up to get attention and use it as an excuse so i don’t have to go out with them”, because of all of this i just feel so broken inside and i can’t seem to find a reason to stay alive anymore, i apologise for the long read."
1778,"Is this in my head, or not?","I don't know. I lot of stuff has happened in the past year. I'm 16, and my Nan passed away, then my mum got diagnosed with breast cancer, then we found out we're not covered for the expense for genetic testing to find out if me and my sisters have a high risk for it too.

&amp;#x200B;

These examples are going to sound weird, but its all I got. I started forgetting things. I can't remember clearly anymore, everything is fuzz. I watched the entire set of marvel movies with my family pretty recently, and I can remember none of it, except that there's something called vibranium in Black Panther. (Sorry, I know its weird.) I also was watching Doctor Who with my sister and I used to be able to quote things, and remember everything that happened, then I slowly started forgetting characters, including main companions and villains, and major plot elements. I cant remember what I did yesterday very well, I forget things in the middle of sentences often. This has been happening for months

&amp;#x200B;

My area is currently having a COVID spike, so im indoors most of the time (because I dont want my mum affected) and I just don't do anything. I can't, I feel a general sense of dread about everything I like to do. I keep telling myself im just being lazy, but I dont know. I dont know what im feeling anymore. I need some help."
1779,I feel so overwhelmed,I feel so angry and empty at the same time. I'm having serious doubts about the field I'm going into. Im currently going to school for said field which has put me into the hole. So I'm stuck in what I am studying until I can pay off the school. I have almost no support from my friends. Our relationship just feels extremely superficial. I'm try to keep myself motivated but most days I just want to lay in bed all day and not think. People have it worse than I do 100%. I'm lucky to be going to school in the first place but i just feel like everything is piling up on me. I'm having serious doubts about myself and if I'm even worthy or have any skills. My head is spinning. I hope everyone else is having a good day/night.
1780,Waking up feeling useless,"Hi guys, since the day my girlfriend broke up with me of 3 years. Most days i wake up feeling useless and unworthy. It’s been a year now since break up. I remember first couple months after break up i was working 6-7 days a week to make myself feel worthy.. i was killing myself by doing that. I deal with anxiety and depression. I just woke up at 5:30 am with a bad dream of her being with someone else and feeling useless about myself, unworthy. 

After the breakup i became like this. What would you recommend i do? I feel really low and I wanna feel worthy of myself and move on.

I also workout 4 days a week. It helps a little.


Thank you :)"

1782,I Have Run Out Of Gas,"As the title states, I have run out of gas."
1783,I want to not exist,"The stress of school, moving twice in a year, and being stuck in quarantine is really getting to me. I really want to unexist– not really die, but stop living because I’m a friend of what’s in the future. I don’t know what to do, or if I’m just overreacting and am calling for attention. i dont know what to do, I feel lost, confused, and fucking lonely. I’ve moved twice in a year, and I’ll have virtual school the entire first semester of my new school– meaning I’ll be alone and friendless in my senior year. and to put the cherry on top, I’m insecure as fuck about my body and I hate it. what can I do?"
1784,Somewhat mild depersonalization,"I've been experiencing what I've determined to be a case of depersonalization/derealization and it's lasted about a week. I previously had felt this way from a super high dose of marijuana edibles where it lasted about a week and somehow a similar feeling came back months later. I havent touched weed since so I don't know what's going on or if I can ""cure"" it."
1785,is this built up anger from being constantly repressed in my teen years?,"So for the past 6 months i’ve been lashing out randomly for small things that go wrong, or if someone says/does something to irritate me, i go OFF. i’ve never had problems with anger or lashing out. shortly i turned 11, i was diagnosed with pretty bad depression, epilepsy, and a couple other health issues. i started feeling very depressed and emotions id never felt before. lonely, miserable, sad, , hopeless and thinking about death/suicide a lot. then i was put on medications to treat other health issues with side effects being depression even though i already had it. all my emotions felt amplified no matter what i was feeling. this was during summer before entering middle school. my parents were putting me in one where i knew nobody. school was the last thing on my mind. i was too depressed and miserable to care, thus leading to never make friends in middle school and failing classes. this continued all throughout middle school until i switched to online for most of high school. i attended freshman year but it was too much for me. i did however make 2 amazing friends and we’re still super close. so for years i was terribly depressed with no emotional outlet other than family who claimed i was just being dramatic and missed out on having friends, parties, going out, and normal stuff teens do. i was at home in bed either crying or playing video games to distract me from my issues. i’m 17 now and i haven’t been depressed for almost 2 years. it feels so good. i was in mental pain for so long i almost didn’t want to seek help. depression became my security blanket. leaving would mean i’d have to enter the real world and couldn’t just stay in my little toxic bubble. all this led to very low self esteem that i’ve been gradually rebuilding over years and getting better but lately i’ve suddenly been lashing out once or twice a month over everything. and now with this whole pandemic i’m trapped inside all day and im scared to return to where i used to be. i feel like i could explode with rage and break thing sometimes. is this anger from built up repression for years just now surfacing due to my depression and missing out on middle school and high school life? other than that ive been “normal”. what should i do?"
1786,I’m scared,"I don’t know if this is mental health related but I haven’t been able to have a relaxing night for 4 years now. I keep having thoughts about people going out to kill me at night and they’re hiding in my room. I live in the basement so it’s a fairly big room+bathroom. If I have to go upstairs I run out of fear that they’re behind me trying to kill me. Today I kept hearing whistling, humans barking, and mouth pops (even when I’m alone and no ones awake).I did this when I was a kid but apparently it’s not normal to feel this way when you’re 17."
1787,It is hard to talk when people make fun of my voice and language,"Hello. Sorry if my English is not perfect. 

When I was a child, my mother try to teach me four languages. It was a good choice she made. We had to move many times. Speaking four language help me a lot. I can speak four languages but not all fluent.  I have a hard time to remember words and grammar. It is even for my native language. Sometimes I say the right word then mess up. It is hard for me to always remember. I can read English very well. I can not write or speak English well. This is a problem sometimes when I speak of my mental health.

It has been very hard talking about mental health. Many people do not understand what I am try to say. It means I have to repeat myself many times. I try to write my mental health but people do not understand that too. It is very hard to talk. My best friend understand what I am saying a lot. But she does not understand all of the time.

If I speak in my native language it is hard too. Many words are lost in my mind. It is hard to speak it sometimes. There are many words in English that I do not know in Cambodian, Chinese, or Jarai. There are some words I do not know in English. People say to use Google to translate but the translates do not always make it right. Sometimes the words are not equal or make sense. My mental health is worse by the languages. I would want to forget one language to be better in another. 

When I am sad I hurt myself. I do not think I do it in the bad way. When I hurt myself I pinch my arm. Sometimes my arm gets a bruise or it gets blooded. I do not do this all of the time. I only do this if I am very sad. A lot of the time I cry and sleep. I sleep many days for a long time.

 I live in a small town. People are mean to me for many reasons. I do not look like the people in the town. My voice is different. It is hard for me to speak. My brain is different. I do not understand what a lot of people do. I do not feel romance or sex the same way. People think I am a freak for being a boy who is not wanting sex. People say mean things about me because I have not kissed a girl. I do not need to kiss a girl for people to be nice to me. 

It was very hard moving to America. I did not get to say goodbye to my friends. Many people of my family do not live here. I do not think I will ever see my friends or my family again. That make me sad. I think about them a lot. To think about them makes me cry. I cry every night for them. When I google it said I have depression. That feels okay for me. It said many other things too. Anxiety. Post traumatic stress disorder. It said I may have the ADHD and OCD. I do not know if I have any of it. It said to talk to a doctor about them. I do not think I can go to the doctor. My mom does not have extra money. She provide all things for us now. 

It is difficult to know many people will not understand me. It is sad that many people will not learn or help me learn that way we can be friends. I want good friends in my life. I love the friends I have but they do not always understand. They support me always. But they do not know my hard life. Many thing happened that I do not like to talk about. It hurts me too much to speak. I want to get help but I do not think I can. That is okay. I will still live. My mom would be very sad if I did die. I can not make her sad. I will live for her and the many nice people I know. I will live for my neighbor that I like very much. Not in a romance way. I like her as a friend I think. She is very kind. I like kind people. 

This is to apologize for the long post. When I write it is hard to stop me. I like to write even if it is not perfect. I wish I spoke English much better."
1788,I keep having thoughts that I know are irrational yet somehow I keep thinking they’re true. Why do I keep doing this.,"Today my girlfriend went out with her friend and they had a good time doing whatever it was they did. She didn’t respond to me for two hours, and she could have literally done whatever she wanted because none of what she did was posted anywhere. Somehow, in my mind, I immediately worry that she may be cheating on me. Yet I know she would never do that because I was her first kiss, boyfriend, as well as many other firsts. She always tells me everything she does, but for some reason I cannot trust her. Every time I talk to my father I always think he’s trying to condemn me or put me down. But I know he’s just trying to give advice. But I also feel like he just wants to criticize me all the time. Whenever I hangout with my friends, they always point out the stupid shit I do and laugh. I FEEL like they just keep me around to make fun of me, but I KNOW they just think I’m funny.

Basically, I have serious trust issues and I have no idea why, especially when I consciously and can logically understand that none of these feelings make sense. Can someone help explain this for me and why I feel this way about everyone because I do not understand it and it keeps me up until 1:21 in the morning writing reddit posts about it."
1789,Navigating my highs and lows - Depression,"Last year I was diagnosed with depression. Pills do not work or they all make me obnoxiously tired, alcohol definitely doesn’t either and I suspect I may need to give that up during my low points or I’ll be facing addiction issues as well. I believe my depression manic if that’s still a thing as I go through really high points where I’m constantly improving and pushing myself, then there are the low points that are really low and I spend all my time binging shows, obsessing over people, or scrolling through my phone. I try to be creative at least but that only lasts a few days then sizzles until much later when I’m crying on the floor about something stupid and realize it is stupid so I tell myself I should be more productive. 

I live in AZ where the devil has us in an oven and notice that summer is by far my worst time of the year because in the winter I can walk or hike which usually helps me process my feelings in a healthy manner. In the heat I ‘melt’ as my friend likes to say in a literal and mental manner and all of my hard work on self improvement dissipates.... No more yoga, no more YouTube work out videos or running laps in the pool, just mush trying to function. Doesn’t help that my new job is soulless and the most stressful work I’ve ever done in my life so I feel the need to turn off my brain.

The only good thing I do is meditate on the week days. Therapy is too expensive and I have used all of my free sessions with work. What are things I can do to get out of my funks, to push myself to not turn into a blob and be productive? I am a single mom whose daughter’s father left state to start a new family without supporting her as well as I have started dating for the first time in 3 years and have met this amazing person who holds space for me during my bad times. I wonder how I can do better for myself first then do better for the people I care about? I was watching the end of the Sopranos (binged in blob state of course) and there’s a moment where Tony refers to being prone to depression and all his legacy is is to pass on his ‘wretched’ genes to his son who has been suffering the same way. It stuck with me in a way that hit home a little too hard as I know my daughter sees me struggle even though she’s so young and her father would struggle with depression as well but much more vocally. I want to give her happiness and not let mental illness rule her life like it so often does mine, but how can I do that if I can’t do well by myself first??

TLDR: Struggling more often with super low points of depression over the last year due to high stress and inability to motivate myself. What are tips, tricks, or techniques that you or someone you know has that help get you out of the deep hole of depression despair? I want to take care of myself to be a good role model &amp; mom to my daughter, but can’t afford therapy."
1790,What goes the inside head of someone suffering from depression and anxiety...,[removed]
1791,"Does anyone have a spouse that is ""too close"" with their parents?","My wife and I have been married for a few years. In that time, I have to come to realize that she is still connected by an umbilical cord to her parents.  She messages them every morning and every evening, and most mornings has a phone call with her mother.

Let me add my experience with my parents. They divorced when I was 7, and I grew up primarily with my mother. Even to this day, I do communicate with her more than 1-2 times per week, and I'm sure some of that has to do with being a male.

My in-laws and my wife are extremely close, she lived with them for awhile before she moved in with me. When we first started dating we would meet her parents weekly for dinner and this continued until the time we moved out of state. 

However I have felt that as time goes on, it just becomes more and more evident that I feel like I'm living with my in-laws, even though we are thousands of miles apart. We have a son, he is almost 4 now, and my MIL has nearly an obsession with him, and expects my wife to send photos every day of him, and needs constant video calls. 

I have expressed my frustration throughout the years to my wife, who empathizes but then nothing changes. Every once in awhile, she will suggest I talk to her parents.  But I dont see this as my place to do so, and dont even know what i would say or how I would being this up. I feel as though if she is in agreeable with me then she needs to speak woth them. 

I'm not sure if I am being unrealistic, stupid, or if women around our age (we are in our early 40s) have similar relationships with their parents. To me, this behaviour seems very co-dependent and unhealthy.

One small change that has come from my frustration is that most evenings she will set her phone down (we both do) which prevents the calls. On many occasions if the phone is on, her mom will either ""accidentally"" dial her or call with some frivolous concern or question that could have likely been dealt with at another time (like in the morning when the two communicate anyways).

If I am overreacting or in the wrong, I am willing to change (and of course have adapted to this situation already). But this type of relationship is killing my attraction for my wife, and is slowly killing the marriage too.

TLDR: wife is very attached to her parents and I want to know if this is normal behavior."
1792,My husband is struggling and I don't know how to cope with it,"He has depression and a lot of pent of self-hate, he doesn't want to see a doctor anymore and after years of not drinking he brought home beer today and I told him if he drank it I'd leave. I know it won't make him happy, he told me he was disappointed which cut me really deep. I don't know how to help him or if I even can help him, I keep telling him I'm sorry because I don't know any other way to communicate. I see a therapist for my own mental health shit and work on bettering myself every day and seeing him want to stop trying.... it really hurts, I don't know what to do."
1793,ER turned me away,"I was struggling with suicidal thoughts and finally built up the courage to go to the ER, but they turned me away. I told them I didn’t feel comfortable at home and that I wanted to stay the night, but all they did was give me the name of a meditation app &amp; tell me to call my doctor. I dont know what to do"
1794,What are some tips to overcome my social anxiety?,"I (24f) have struggled to make solid friendships for quite some time now. I’m very shy and introverted upon first meeting someone, but once I’m comfortable I have no problem being myself. 

The first phase of getting comfortable with a potential friend takes much longer than I would like it to. This results in the potential connection dying out and thus I’m back at square one trying to find new friends. 

In addition to those long periods, most the time I self sabotage and think I’m totally awkward. Other times I’m always worried I won’t say the right thing. 

Now that my city is beginning to open again (my state’s coronavirus case count is steadily decreasing), I would like to start on a fresh foot and begin making solid friendships instead of acquaintances. Any tips you can give me to overcome this would be so appreciated"

1796,I can't stop counting things.,"I don't now what this called or if it even has a name.

I can't stop counting things.

Everything around me...

- Outside I see 7 people walking and I have to count them over and over.

- I turn on a movie made by Paramount and I have to count the stars in the opening sequence every fucking time even though I know the number of stars based on the time period the film was released.

- Every piece of art I look at. I have to start counting weird aspects like limbs or crosses.

It's starting to drive me crazy."
1797,A poem for everyone struggling out there,"I wrote this as a representation of the struggles of mental health. Maybe some of you can relate and realise we are not alone. 



If you've felt it before youll know words can't describe
The pain and angst that's hidden inside
The worries and troubles that torment away
Making each day a dark cloudy display
Forgive me if I am not acting myself
I'm trying hard but it's impossible to spell
Please don't turn your back or turn away
Maybe just ask me if I'm doing okay
Please be patient, I am doing my best
Being normal is difficult when you are getting no rest
Pills and therapy are prescribed by the doc
To make it easier for me to function and talk
My mind wanders far and takes me away
Often I'm present but absent each day
I may smile and laugh but hidden inside
Is fear and pain I cannot describe
Don't pity or fret I know I will be fine
Every cloud has a silver line."
1798,"This COVID-19 Pandemic, worsens my mental health","I am an incoming freshmen college with anxiety and have suicidal tendencies. 

I failed my college exam test to a free tuition university.. 
We have existing loans (car, house)  and it makes my parents struggle because they both got unemployed due to the pandemic. 
Everyday i wake up to the quarrels of my parents about our financial stability. 
I am so pressured to find a job instead of studying to help them. 
I feel so worthless. 
I feel like i am a failure.
I am an achiever since when i was a child
And having this failures makes me sick. 
My parents doesnt appreciate my effort instead they complain and compare me to others. 

There are no day that i think i want to kill myself
I have no friends to talk about it
Please wake me up when this pandemic ends."

1800,I feel like I’ve gone through a lot and the last year and I need somewhere to talk about it,"Ever since I transferred to University from Community College last fall, things have just been dark. My best friend is at another school and I wasn’t able to make any real friends last school year. 1st semester was especially rough. I spent about every night alone in my dorm room. Everyone in the suite I moved into was already in a close friend group, and they weren’t too welcoming of me. 

I tried my best to put myself out there and make connections with people, but it just didn’t go anywhere. Things started to get a little better when I made a musical I auditioned for, but I still felt so damn lonely, like I couldn’t really connect with anyone. I also got hit by a car that semester, which was surprisingly one of my better nights because someone I knew from the show I was in took me to ER so I wasn’t by myself all night. 

This was also the first time I’d ever been out on my own. I come from an extremely loving family and I’m very grateful for that, but as a result I’ve been incredibly sheltered my whole life, so learning to do things on my own for the first time was such a shock for me. I grew so much that semester in terms of being an independent adult but wow it hurt. Then Christmas break happened and it was wonderful. My family and I were at the beach the whole time and my best friend was with me pretty much every other day and it was so relaxing. The one really shitty day I had was when my best friend and his girlfriend both stayed the night at my house. I love both of them to death and am so happy for them, but it also made me a little jealous seeing them together. They’re so happy together, and I just want to be happy with someone like that so badly. 

When it was time to go back to school, things sucked, but I was better adjusted. I was beginning to meet some people, but I still spent the vast majority of my time alone. I still ate every meal alone, spent every night alone, and walked to every class alone. But not everything was completely awful. I took some really cool classes that I enjoyed a lot. I’ve always been into musical theatre, but at school I began studying classical voice and I loved it. I even got cast in two leads in next year’s opera, which I was ecstatic about. Then COVID happens and I’m right back home, the semester is just cut short, just as it was really getting interesting. And next semester is gonna be half-asses because of COVID, and then I have one semester left and then college is over. I can also probably count on opera being cancelled, which is a bummer. 

So much has happened and it feels really heavy and I have nobody to tell it to. Whenever I try to bring it up to my parents, they pretty much tell me to tough it up and not worry about it. I wish it was that simple. I just feel so overwhelmed right now and emotionally I feel like I’m spiraling. I’m so scared of dying alone. I’m scared I’m going to wake up tomorrow and my life is going to be over, I’m scared I’ll never do anything. I’m scared I’ll never date anyone again, and I feel like this lockdown bullshit is going to last forever. 

I think above all I’ve learned that I don’t do well with loneliness. I haven’t dated in 4 years and I miss intimacy. I feel extremely self-conscious about being a 21 year old virgin. At this point I’m half way convinced I’ll be alone forever, and I hate it. 

And I think what sucks the most about this is this isn’t who I am. The me I know is a happy person, a good fun and hopeful one. And that’s just not how I feel right now. Thank you so much to anyone who has read through this post, it honestly feels so good just to unpack this somewhere."

1802,I have these negative thoughts and I feel alone. Are these thought common?,I love my family. I love them beyond everything on this earth. But I suffer from negative thoughts that includes them. I would sit alone in my room and out of nowhere I begin to have these imaginations of my family and loved ones being tortured or in pain and suffering. I begin to see them in these unrealistic and scary scenarios and hear their pain and suffering. It kills me from inside and I don’t know what to do. Does anyone experience these thoughts also or is it just me. Injustice feel alone and don’t know what to do. I just need some guidance. Some type help that can trace the reason behind these thoughts and hopefully a cure.
1803,Mood swings,"I’ve been like this for a while but 24/7 365 I’m either really depressed and feel dead and numb or I’m euphoric and am just extremely happy.

I know that most people would say that’s bio polar disorder when that’s not the case and I understand that. I know that’s not actually bi polar disorder. I wanna get that out of the way.

But I first started being like this around 2016 when I used to be extremely depressed where I could focus on anything and just had terrible anxiety about it until I would think of something random that I loved and all the sudden I would be extremely happy for a little bit.

But after a while i would have that feeling bit out of my control, I would be extremely happy then so numb I just try to get on with the day. Over. And over. Non stop. 

I also don’t think the reason I’m depressed has anything to do with it, I think my life’s fine tbh. It’s almost like there’s someone in my head but it’s not me controlling all my feelings.

As a result, I've never really developed social skills, or not any desirable ones at least... I'm finally coming to terms about this. It's particularly noticable with other guys, who seem to dislike me immediately, even if I haven't had a chance to say much. Im very socially anxious and awkward. Does anyone have advice?

1805,I don't know why I'm still going.,"I really don't. 

My sister is abusive mentally, physically, verbally, and sexually. Whenever I don't do what she says she threatens to pretty much beat me. She constantly calls me names. (Ex. Whore, overweight, and hideous.) My sister tells me to kill myself multiple times, which I have thought about doing. I've gotten very close to killing myself at least 3 times. 

I don't have many friends, either. I have a friend that is never home, one that never talks/hangs out with me, and two online friends, but we rarely talk. People constantly make fun of me. 

I just want everything to end. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to keep going for my best friend (the one that is never home), but it doesn't seem worth it. 

She's told me that if I killed myself, she'd kill herself. I don't want her to die, I want her to be happy.

I'm curently 16 y/o. From the day I was born, I was the odd one out, I was the type of kid you would get chills if you would stay too long around me, I find it really hard feeling emotions, almost nothing, just short bursts of anger from time to time that are controllable. Despite all of that, in the present, I feel lost and empty. I can't seem to connect with people and I hate myself for it. Even though I can't have stable relationships with people, I need them, I depend on them and I feel I would go ""insane"" if I would be alone for longer periods of time.  I look around and I see all this love and affection. I tried copying it but i get bored really quick by it, since I can't literally feel it. Most of the times I would sit quietly over analyzing my next move with a cold dead stare, that's why my friends call me funny names because of my expression. Even though this is just childish behavior I know I could get revenge very easily but it wouldn't benefit me at all by doing it. Any thought on what could be wrong?"
1808,"Anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression make it hard to connect...","Sorry if this gets rambly.. And for the bad grammar..

I've noticed for a while now, how hard it is to make lasting connections but even connecting with my family whom I love dearly is hard. Looking at myself from an outside perspective, I tend to constantly walk on eggshells with everyone which was something trained in to me by my father ( which I rarely talk to or see) as he had quite a temper when we did live with him as kids. 

As an seemingly adult person, now have weird awkward habits of trying to be extremely quiet and rarely seen, I constantly feel like I'm in trouble for most things and I have been accused by people and even partners in the past of being sneaky untrustworthy but they never understood that it's just me trying to stay out of trouble, nothing malevolent. Apparently, I act shifty. There's a lot of internal conflict on a daily basis and it's insanely exhausting, I have been in therapy a few times now for mental health issues.

The thing that just really hurts is that I want my family to know and see that I love them but I feel like I'm failing at that. I'm very close to my youngest brother and he along with my mom are probably the only ones that I can really be louder and more carefree with and but my other siblings and I don't get to spend much time together, and when we do I'm usually an anxious wreck for various reasons. I'm not very good at communicating properly or at being super vulnerable. I try to be there for them but I'm not sure how. Some times I feel like I don't know how to be a person anymore.

So, I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions or something that has worked for them to be good at improving their mental health in order to love others? Or, something that might seem more fitting? Please and thank you!!

These ‘thoughts’ often occur at night, before bed. And when they occur, i am usually able to subdue them, though sometimes my fist goes uncontrollably hitting the mattress.
One time i couldnt control it and resulted in me hurting my fist and straining my muscles (I went lifting my bed and table for no reason)
Now that im older these thoughts still happen, though not so much. As a kid i thought these were normal for boys in puberty, but when i asked my friends about it they told me theyve never experienced anything like this.

1816,I'm experiencing severe anxiety and depression thinking of my future and how little I've done in life," I'm entering high school this year and I feel like I should be deciding my career already. I know some might think this is too early but it has been on my mind a lot lately. I've also been feeling pressure from family members who already had everything figured out at my age. I'm not very passionate about anything, to begin with, which is sad in itself. I feel like everyone has something that drives them in life, I'm kind of just living at the moment. Nothing excites me. I don't understand how people grow up dreaming about working, it doesn't sound like much fun. But, I know that I'll eventually need to get a job and I don't want to float from one minimum wage job to another my whole life. Planning out my future is scary and it feels as if everything will be locked in place once I do. I imagine myself going down the wrong path and regretting it my whole life. One part of me knows that these thoughts are coming prematurely and I should focus on the present but another part is screaming at me that time is wasting away and I've accomplished nothing. And by that, I mean literally nothing. I'm not creative or athletic, I don't play instruments, I'm not very smart or anything of that sort. I feel as if I'm blank. Everything is so confusing and directionless. I don't know what to do and I can't talk to anyone about it. Everyday carries a feeling of impending doom. Does anyone else experience this?"

I'm going into my final year of university in late September and although my university is quite small in terms of student numbers, and they've said that they'd prefer for their classes to be in person, there's a chance that my classes could be reduced to online only.  
 Honestly the thought's really making me anxious and upset, because I have 0 control over the situation and I feel like I'm going to struggle with things like my dissertation. The news too is freaking me out because there's so much negativity in the world right now and my brain just *loves* to latch onto it.  
This especially comes in the form of reports on job losses and stuff and I panic that I might not get a job once I graduate. It just all feels like doom and gloom at the minute, and I've not been able to do much to get away from my negative thoughts, I've got asthma and so pretty sure that Covid-19 would potentially be worse for me than some other people without the condition so I've not really been out for the last three months.

How does one find happiness without materialism? I’ve gotten stuck in that trap of trying to make myself feel better by buying shit I don’t even need, in an attempt to feel fulfilled or entertained.

I've tried being the listener and being there for him and tried to make him happy but nothing gives. 

We literally were just talking about how next week he wanted to go to the beach because he's bored and has had it here. So I agree to have us go next week so we can build up some cash and go. Today, while taking care of the kids, I was on my computer working, I can tell he was getting frustrated because our baby kept crying but I was almost done so wanted to finish up my work and then I can take over. Still I offered my help and he denied it since I was almost done. He seemed overwhelmed and again offered to take the baby and asked if he was okay, he said ""no, no he was not okay, that he wasn't happy"". I tried telling him to talk to me but he just stayed quiet. 
I went on to finish my work since he decided to stay silent. 
Wasn't mad but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't a little annoyed. I want to help but sometimes he's makes it impossible.
Also, we've gone to the beach (in California, we're in Las Vegas) like a month ago already and with the whole Corona thing it makes me really nervous to go anywhere but I still agreed to go for the sake of his mental health, now he wants to go again but I can't help but feel I put not just myself or him at risk but also our kids which are under 4yrs of age. I feel like I'm purposely putting them at risk with all of this going on. 

I feel like I'm in between a hard place here 

Why do I feel like he's being selfish for wanting to take care of his mind at the risk of his kids health? It seems so wrong but I worry about my kids. We've literally all been coughing and sneezing and can't help but to think about Covid-19 right away. 

What do I do? I feel so helpless...I've asked him if there are things I can do to help him but the way he gets I see him as being so damn stubborn to the point that I just don't want to help him or deal with him. 

But then I feel guilty for not being there for him as I should.
I understand having mental health problems is nothing to joke around and is HUGE amd we gotta take things serious but what about the other person too? It becomes draining at times. All I hear from him are negatives things about almost everything. 

Please help me either understand more or what to do because he doesn't even know what to tell me and at this point I'm getting desperate because sometimes he won't talk to me and I end up getting impatient with him and can't help but to get mad. Which I get it, that's probably the worse thing to do but what do I do? 
I've tried coming to him with loving and open arms and he just won't say or do anything most of the times."
1821,My best friend and I joke about suicide – I’m starting to get worried they’re actually planning,"Hi there, 

As stated in the title, my best friend and I have suffered with depression for the majority of our lives. They have attempted before, but it has been over a decade since then. We have been friends for a very long time and have always openly joked about and discussed suicide because we both deal with suicidal ideation. I am aware that this is fucked up and morbid, but it has been a source of coping for many years. 

Recently I’ve felt worried that the jokes have gotten too specific and I fear that they might attempt again. Any advice on how I should proceed without escalating the situation or losing their trust? 

Thank you kindly ❤️"
1822,Why do I actively avoid the things I enjoy?,"For a really long time I have actively avoided the things I enjoy. I will actively avoid watching things I know I'd like, if a friend of mine asks to hang out I'll feel bad and think of a way to maybe get out of it, and even if I get a text I'll pretend I didn't see it/was busy/straight up not respond. When I'm stressed I'm known to not respond to texts at all for days on end. It's almost like I feel overwhelmed by things that shouldn't be overwhelming at all. Texting someone feels like a LOT of effort even if I'm not carrying the conversation, and I almost get a sense of dread when I receive a text from a loved one, almost like I feel like I have/I'm gonna let them down so I don't even try to text back.

(some person info below:)

I've struggled with episodes of depression that have come and go throughout my life and a lot of the times it's totally debilitating. I'm young and have already lost so much of my life to it. I also am convinced I have ADHD/ADD or something of the sort and I was seeking help for trauma but couldn't even stay long enough to get a preliminary diagnosis because of COVID (we discussed PTSD or acute stress disorder but didn't come to a preliminary), so I'm not really a stranger to mental illness, and this one trait has basically stayed with me from the beginning of the struggle to the present. 

Does anyone else do this or feel like this? 

Does anyone have an explanation or a proposed one?"
1823,Is this normal?,"Im cutting straight to the point, im 15f and have been contemplating this for a long time.

There are days where I feel a little feral in the back of my mind. It makes me want to act in a rabid and animal-like behavior, and tear things apart. These sort of thoughts are pushed down however, and I never dare or bother acting out on them.

It sort of accumulated in my chest like a second heart, and it feels like it collects there whenever I dismiss the thought. Then I feel that I got this ball of hate in me that just wont dissipate, like its mad at me for not acting on urges and is like “Aight, fuck you. Imma just build up here and cause you to feel vengeful at nothing in particular.”

Honestly fuck that thing, I can’t draw in peace without it crowding my thoughts with MAKE IT BLOODY, MUTILATE THEIR LIMBS, DEVOUR THEIR FLESH WITH YOUR TEETH and like god damn just leave me be.

Im not even diagnosed murder-happy, just ADD, Depression, and ^(most likely autism but it isn’t confirmed.)

So, for the TL;DR: I feel like I want to go mad and mutilate fleshy things despite hating the thought of hurting anyone or anything. Oh, and there’s a ball of pointless hate chilling in my ribcage.

I need to sleep, i’ll check to see if anyone bothered with this in the morning. Nite"
1824,Is it all my fault ?,"I really feel useless the reason is because when i started first year(7th grade)i was extremely depressed and nervous and none of the friends where going to the same school as i was , and i felt the other kids bullying me ,but all that change when i told one of my friends in my class that i had a YouTube channel so they started telling the other kids in the class about it. Eventually i became really popular in my class and then someone commented about i was in there school and wanted me to guess who they were which just flipped everything for me eventually i found out who there where and the person was amazing, we had so much in common and then i fell in love with them after a few months i eventually confessed to them and they liked me back and it was great i was so happy and the conference helped me with my school work because  of the joy i felt but after the Christmas holidays they broke up with me and i didn't take it well since they were my first person i had a relationship with so everything was fucked for me i did horrible in school 
And felt lonely.After a few months we became friends so i asked them why they broke up with me and said they never liked me in the first place and said yes in desperation and I've also found out they found me annoyed which really hurted alot but they keep saying its a lie an they dont find me annoying so i dont know what to believe anymore. Also the things i did during the breakup were not great i bought the same pewdiepie jacket as them but i liked pewdiepie and needed a new jacket anyway,
I bought the same school bag brand as her , and i hate myself for that i ruined everything and i really dont want to go back to school because she's going to pretty to be my friend but was told they aren't my friend so i dont know what to do now is it all my fault they hate me?"

I’ve never completely thought about it, but now that I have I was wondering if it’s absolutely terrible? I’m Gen Z, so one or two self-deprecating jokes is common around those I’m growing up with. I have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety, so I know that plays into a factor. Also, when I’m alone and mildly inconvenienced, I will mutter something along the lines of, “I want to shoot myself,” or something similar.

1830,I'm very concerned about the treatment of my sister's puppy.,"My sister got a puppy, a pitbull just a few months old like 5 months. She and her boyfriend treat it well for the most part nothing more than the occasional light smack on the snout.

It's her kids im concerned over. I love my niece and nephew but I feel like they should not be allowed near any kind of animals.

My nephew who's like 7 is super duper energy filled and is aggressive not in an angry way though. He ""plays"" with her by body slamming her onto the couch and bed. When he gets mad at her HE LITERALLY CLIMBS ON TOP HER AND F#####G CHOKES HER WITH BOTH HANDS. He hits her with shoes and clothes. Me and my sister have to constantly get after him for it.

He lays on top of her and holds her in a headlock. My neice throws shoes at her and maybe a shirt and hits her on her side for misbehaving. The puppy playfully bites sometimes but she really starts biting when my nephew starts antagonizing her. He says ""when I hit her she becomes nice"" she runs to me and snuggles up and playfully bites sometimes. All I have to do is tell her stop like 5 times then she will.

I went fishing recently and my nephew was there. I saw a beaver and my nephew kept insisting me to catch it so he could beat and or stab it. He says these without knowing what those things mean, he has never really been taught what they mean other than super hero's hit people and their cool. My sister has tried teaching him that what he does is bad and I have but he won't listen. I'm worried what's going to happen to the puppy when im gone and not able to stop him from hitting and chocking her."

Hey, this is my first post here and i’m quite nervous so i’m sorry if stuff i say doesn’t quite make sense, i’m a 17M and because of my past i’ve always had this feeling inside of me that i’m not good enough to be on this earth since i was around 7, i witnessed physical abuse and was on the end of it a few times, i have what i would consider bad ADHD and clinically diagnosed anxiety. In march 2020 i lost my grandmother to cancer and had to miss the funeral due to Covid-19, since then my mental health dropped, i couldn’t get out of bed most days for the best part of 2 months, during this time i attempted an OD twice, and have self-harmed several times, then i was getting better, then i lost my close friend to suicide, who i was speaking to the night before trying to stop him and he promised me he wouldn’t and still did, since then i’ve been on a downhill drop again, i’ve self harmed a lot again and considered suicide again, however this isn’t all, i recently came out as bisexual to my family and since then my stepfather has completely ignored me and refuses to speak to me, as well as this i went out with my friends, and they held me down and “beat the gay out of me”, i considered it a joke but the more i think about it the less i believe that, they also know about my struggles and recently told me to get over myself as i “don’t even have mental health issues and making it up to get attention and use it as an excuse so i don’t have to go out with them”, because of all of this i just feel so broken inside and i can’t seem to find a reason to stay alive anymore, i apologise for the long read."

I have no idea if side 2 is healthy for me or bad for me, sometimes it perks me up and sometimes. But recently I have been challenging side 2's belief which  causes more pain.

When I have the emotions if side 2 if I accept them it perks me up, but makes the nights worse. If I deny side 2 it saddens me then but lifts the burden at night

A day ago I have decided after long thought to make a sort of diary of emotions, setting some ground rules for myself and such, enforced by the idea that if I betray them I would be hurting my past self. But by putting my emotions into the diary I proved accidentally that I do have issues.

1836,Need a friend after self harm relapse,"I self harmed for the first time since November, and this is the worst I have in a few years. I just need to vent everything out and if you read this thank you. If you respond double thank you.

I’ve had a poor sense of self image for most of my life (history of self harm, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders). Over the past year, self esteem has been an extreme stressor because my boyfriend is dramatically skinnier than me. I love him more than anything but sometimes just looking at a picture of us next to each other sparks negative self talk. Anyways, this is just one factor that has been contributing to a perpetually low self esteem, which affects my overall mental health.

I always thought that body modifications would make me view myself better because even if I didn’t see myself as beautiful, I could at least cover myself in beautiful things. I’ve been saving up for a tattoo and finally got it today and the artist completely messed up a major part of it. I hate looking at it and am completely embarassed by it. My boyfriend and roommate disagree and don’t think it’s that bad/easily fixable. While I think that I can eventually get it covered up, right now all I can think about is how there’s just one more part of myself that I hate and can’t stand to look at. I felt out of control and turned to self harm.

Typing it out makes me feel like I was being dramatic about it but I really can’t stand the fact that I thought that I was making a decision that would make me happy and help me love myself, but now I feel even worse and all I want to do is tear it out of me"

I've been on 100mg of sertraline for about 2 weeks now upped it from 50mg. I actually started to feel really good and a lot like myself. But at the weekend I got absolutely hammered I mean wrecked and I still feel quite bad even now like 3 days later? Is this normal? I know I've learnt my lesson I wont get so badly drunk again."

1847,"I've never actually been ""happy"" in my 26 years of being alive. I guess it stems from my childhood trauma but the more i look into my life i can honestly say I've never been satisfied or happy with any choices that I've made. How do i get out of this or even heal from past trauma?","I don't have a single happy memory from when i was younger apart from a ""clip"" of me playing in the snow when i was 4 years old. every memory after that up until i was 8 years old is just filled with abuse and violence from my mother.

Things didn't improve much when i lived with my father, he frequently left me to fend for myself so he could either sell drugs or have sex with women. I practically raised myself until i was 11. At this point my mother coaxed me into returning to her and my little half-sister, under the guise that she had changed and was no longer an abusive person. Obviously that was a lie, and within 2 weeks of being back the abuse started. I was cooking and cleaning, getting my little sister ready for primary school. Hell the only thing she did was sleep on the couch.  I had my friends around a lot and in the end she accused them of molesting my little sister. I still believe to this day that she did that because she wanted to sleep from 4pm-6pm and the noise we made stopped that from happening.

Eventually my aunt got involved and told me to live with her and i did. Although once i lived with her it was great, holidays every year and just a nice household. About 2 years in my mother threw accusations that i tried to kill my sister and that i molested her. My entire family got involved and it turned out that my sisters father was a convicted pedophile and put a knife to my mothers throat back in the day. So it transcribed that she was just throwing the same experiences about to effectively bend the truth to whatever situation she could. My entire family black-sheeped her and she was literally forgotten about.

Now although no one believed her, my mental health has just been destroyed, my confidence with dealing with children has really messed up to the point where i feel like can't interact with them because in the back of my mind i think people think i'm a pedophile when i'm most definitely not. This has caused a rift between my godson and my little 2nd cousins which i regard as my nephews. Although i want to be stupid, silly and all loving but this mental wall is just stopping me from doing this. In fact, i find it very difficult to love anyone, it's like i lack the functionality feel that emotion at all.

My sister has tried to contact me on multiple occasions but since she still regularly speaks to my mother, even though shes been sectioned on more than one occasion, i don't trust her or what she has been manipulated to believe by my mother. My family have expressed concerns about her intentions and strongly believe i should not interact with her at all, although one day if i have children i would love her to be an auntie to them, so long as my mother is kept far away and even in the dark.

I think I've rambled on a lot and need to ask the question, can you ever mentally heal from a complete lack of love? has this forever messed me up and i'm never going to be happy or even be able to fully love another human being? People will say get help, but then i'll need a therapist and opening up about this to other people, in real life is scary. Another aspect its almost like i'm like my mother if i have server mental health issues and i never want to be like her. Also I've never opened up to my family about how i feel every single day and i don't want them to judge me, and think i'm a freak, like my mother. "

1849,Advice on how to bring up admitting myself to a mental health ward to my parents?,"I’ve been considering admitting myself to the mental health ward at my local hospital in order to address my mental health and get a proper diagnosis for my issues. I’ve been in and out of counselling for 6 years and I’ve been on and off medication for 5 years but lately I’ve been really struggling. I’ve been off medication for 3 months currently after 12 months on escalitopram and I’ve been seeing a counsellor through my university for 12 months, he wanted to refer me to a psych that deals with trauma in our area but covid happened and that didn’t end up happening. I’m unsure how to bring this up to my parents, they’re very much oblivious to the extent of my mental illness and I’m not sure how they’re going to react to me broaching this subject because my sister was admitted for a few days last year after a major incident and it was extremely stressful for my family. I’m not sure how to bring it up with them without causing them major distress and further complicating the situation. I’m also in Australia so if anyone has any tips/advice for treatment facilities out here I would absolutely appreciate that!"
1850,Birth control and mental health?,"Can anyone here speak to how hormonal birth control (the pill, the patch, Depo shot, etc) has impacted their mental health?

I've been taking the depo shot for about two years. Just got out of a relationship due to my mental health, and I'm wondering if now I'm might be a good time to ""detox."" However, I'm scared the change in hormones will be really harsh on my body during a time when I'm already not feeling super stable... any advice?"
1851,"HELP! How do I talk to my best friend about seeing a Dr.( D.i.d., or schizophrenia?)","There is so much I could put on here for backstory and symptoms, but I'm going to try and pack as much info as possible in a short space. My best friend ( and myself for that matter) has always been slightly ""off"" or ""weird"". Since we were young kids we both have had problems articulating ourselves, explaining things, being understood in our thought process,etc. We've always been able to understand each other though, and at this point I think I'm a safe space for him for his (not trying to sound disrespectful) "" crazy"" to come out. A few years back his father and cousin both passed close in time to each other and he was very close with both. I believe this is when it started or at least when I started noticing a decline in mental health. ( Although in middle of ramblings he's said it was the mirror at Ms Karen's house when he was 14). Fast forward to 2018-2019, a father figure to us passes from scerosis ( his dad also did) and he finds out that his baby isn't his baby( he was only a few months when he found out but still. ) Since then it has just been.... Different, bad,sad, something. When it's just me and him he's usually at his worst, but it's effecting every facet of his life. His family is"" out to get him and want to see him in prison or a psych ward"", lost his job, he can control lightning, he almost always speaks in third person, assumes other persona's. I've figured out 3 or 4 names I feel he is almost always speaking to. Incoherent speech patterns, mumbling to himself,paranoia,etc. A few days back we talked for a while and it felt like a cry for help. The pain in his voice hurt so bad. Like the actual him broke through and said he didn't want to be like this and maybe after enough time they will just go away and he won't be so loud about it. It's really the only time he's eluded to him not being normal kind of. So all that for this question...... How do I convince him to start exploring his options for treatment without scaring him off. I feel like his last anchor and don't want to do the wrong thing and make stuff worse. This has been heavy on my heart for a while now and I need to do it. I'm just praying for some advice or input from someone that's been in a similar situation. What do I do, what do I not do? God bless anyone who actually read all this. And thank you in advance for any help."
1852,The breakdowns are happening during the day now and my forehead is screaming,"I dont even know where to begin but it's like every now and again I start thinking of all the failures behind me and a feeling of hopelessness comes over me.

I dont feel good enough for the people in my life and every now and again I'm reminded as to why. 

I'm so tired and I dont know if there's actually a way out or if this is just how I'm always going to feel"
1853,Through the wind and rain.,"I'm trying to make thing's happen.. but my mind is already struggling and wanting to give up against the odds and circumstances. It's very hard to stay positive and not get sad when you *know* upsetting thing's are happening, and when you wish you were in someone else's place. But regardless I'm gonna try because this is important to me and I want to achieve my goal, I want my happily ever after. Thing's are always going to be more challenging for me because of how I am, so I need to work a lot harder than others, that's the way it's always been. I guess what I'm asking for is encouragement, because I'm gonna need a lot of it if I'm going to endure all the bad and do this."
1854,I’m terrified and exhausted and have no one to talk to,"My 7 year old has severe behavior problems which have become much worse under quarantine and nothing seems to be alleviating them now, even things that once worked. She has a psychiatrist and psychologist and I’m going to speak with a new psychologist today and her psychiatrist later today but 
I’m home with my toddler and I’m a wreck.
The 7 year old is heading to camp again today but her behaviors have been slowly coming out there (though nothing like at home though) and it’s starting to get uncomfortable for her. Other kids and staff are taking notice and I know it’s going in a bad direction but we can’t keep her home right now and there’s nowhere else to take her. At home, she is very destructive and physically aggressive and lately does disturbing things like cut ALL of her hair off in a fit of anger and then drew all over her face and hair with mascara that she found
. She is now almost completely bald. 
I think she has moved from just adhd and possibly ODD to a mood disorder. Maybe even a psychotic break. She is clearly very distressed right now and I’m practically hysterical that
I can’t get her immediate help short
Of going to the ER and maybe we need to go. I have considered it. I think we are at a point where she either needs medication to calm her so she can be at home or she needs a stay in inpatient care and I have read it’s hard to get inpatient care for a child also. My husband is in literal complete denial. He gets mad when I mention it and denies that she’s having a mental health crisis. He isn’t helping at all to find care for her. It’s lunacy and I’m barely functioning today.
I had to decide this morning if she was going to be staying home from camp because she’s clearly lost it or send her because her behavior is much,much better there and that will allow respite for our toddler from her sister’s behavior.
Any words of support would be so, so appreciated right now. I really don’t have anyone else to tell.
Thank you for reading this"
1855,I don’t know what I am but I’m not human nor a monster.... and I don’t know why,"The longest I’ve held down a relationship was 5 years and while I have had many relationships, both that I have broken up with and been broken up with I feel after my current now ex-Girlfriend broke up with me I’m ready to admit that....that I don’t think was meant to be loved......

I’ve always until back in 2015 felt like a monster because everyone, including family, made it very obvious that I wasn’t human.... and thus didn’t deserve to be treated like a normal person..... I just..... was a tool, a fixture, a resource, and a verbal punching bag....

Then in 2015 I realized that even characters in shows and games that are portrayed as monsters can be loved so...... where did that leave me?

Nothing..... I guess

And....... the guy I dated before my current ex-gf kinda broke me and I..... I was truly done with dating.... and then a year later she came into my life....

She was amazing, and I......... I felt so numb for so long and then one day I just..... starting truly feeling the love I had for her.... before I felt numb but I could still tell I loved her it just..... felt extremely distant...

And then, Monday, she.... she stopped saying “I love you” back out of nowhere... she stopped calling me Babe..... and with my history of relationships I.... I started to get severe anxiety (diagnosed with situational anxiety) so yesterday (Tuesday) I asked her what was wrong and.......... and the issues boil down to that she cares about me...... that I embody everything that she could ever want in a SO....... but she can’t imagine me with her when she imagines the future.......

And........ truly........ I have been in so many relationships where the person says that they don’t love me....... but they just......... want to stay in that relationship?..... I..... I am ugly, there is no way around it..... so when I started I... I felt actually loved for the first time and......

And I guess I just......... don’t know how to process my sadness... she just................ 

It feels that the world wants to make sure I knows i do not deserve to be loved in any way shape of form... when I’m a temp, when I’m a forced date, when I’m a crutch, when I’m a rebound, when I’m a literal joke, when I’m a expected fixture, and.... and when I even have the chance of being actually loved and cared for.... and I’m....

Whatever I am...... it’s not worth of anyone.... no matter the circumstances...... and my fear of living and dying alone is something I just need to accept....... I’m........ I’m not worthy of love and that’s okay....

And I’m ready to accept that."

1859,"I used to think I was reaching out for help, but the truth is I just want to drag down everyone down to my level. I have accepted there is no significance to anything, I have lost all drive, I have no passions besides sinking lower and preying on emotional support so I can watch others decay","I haven't slept in 2 days. I just spent hours trying to track down my psychotic mother after 15 years of no contact to stalk and scare her from anonymous accounts. I paid for services to obtain her address and phone number (to no avail).

I tracked down a guy who abused my ex who hung herself in a closet a well after I cut her out of my life and sent him very ominous messages and veiled threats, I've never met the guy, apparently he's an engineer now. I don't feel he deserves any happiness in his life either.

I just recovered from being run over by a truck while crossing a crosswalk which resulted in 1 well in the hospital and a month of being barely able to move. I reflected on the experience tonight and realized I never cared if I healed because my only purpose to exist is to build on other people's dreams because in 33 years I've ended up with no aspirations or goals and barely any friends (which I can't blame anyone but me for).

I've been a despicable person to innocent people who who I claimed and led to believe I loved.

Everything is over. The wave has broken on the jagged obsidian shoreline of bygone dreams where i could've become a person that could live an admirable life. 

I'm no longer drowning, my cardiovascular system now pulls and pumps cold water instead of life.

Thoughts?,"Basically what I mean by this is that my awareness of how my thoughts come about is making me realize how convoluted and irrational that process is. I can’t tell if I’m overthinking it so much that I’m convoluting it further and thus losing my grip on reality or if it’s really so complicated and bizarre that thinking about it so much has made me trick myself into thinking I am. Regardless of the reasoning I feel like I’ve already begun to lose touch with what’s real and what’s not, so I’d love to hear some thoughts from others to compare to mine.

He told me he wants me to check into an ER and get mental intervention immediately, but I turned it down because I don't wear mask so I cant be let in anyway and B I don't want to go to a mental hospital which is just a prison.  He's insisted going somewhere inpatient is a good idea.

My family weren't much better.  My mom freaked out and said she wanted to call a welfare check on me, my brother said I'm becoming delusional and seriously need help, and chastised me for stopping to take my meds (I'm bipolar 1 and take a cocktail of meds) even though he knows I stopped taking it because they made me feel weird and I can't mix them with marijuana, which I smoke.  My mom is threatening that if I don't get back on the meds (I live with her) and start talking to my therapist more often that she'll call our local crisis assessment team to pay me a visit (can I legally refuse those?) and I really, really don't want to go back to a mental hospital.

Before anyone asks, I'm still underage and can't get any help on my own. Ive been harming before and recently started again, and months ago my mother did find out about the scars and even then it wasnt enough for her to get me the right help. Now I know that the virus slowed down everything for everyone, but when i was asking for a psychiatrist they were already working ppst quarantine and my mother easily booked me an appointment but she was stretching it out for absolutely no reason.

She then started comparing me to my friends and cousins asking why I can’t be happy like them. Now both of my parents are in my room embarrassing and yelling at me. They’re asking me why I have so many problems for my age and making me feel so stupid. They’re saying all the things they’ve done for me and how bad of a daughter I am for neglecting them.

1881,I felt like I haven’t do anything “useful “,"I quit my first “proper” job last year at an advertising agency because I can’t survive the stress, rushing project all the time, standing by on weekend eventho is my birthday, dreading my body to work each day like a zombie with a few hours of sleep. Constantly getting idea rejected by client, fuck idk how many changes for one campaign. While I learned my lesson that I shouldn’t quit without a backup job. At that time I was just dying to get out there because I was so so so depressed everyday I wish I could just drop dead and not need to face my creative director and all the stupid client.

Right after I quit my grandma got sick and I’m taking care of her everyday in the hospital back to back. Then she left us.

Then I was doing freelance work while looking for a job right before the pandemic hit, even looking for internships/ part time job. Anything but no luck at all. I went to several interviews and sent a lot of emails. 

When the pandemic hit, my freelance project went poof, I’ve got no any client at all. I’ve try to register on platform like fiverr ,workana, etc but I didn’t get any reply. Now that things are slowly shifting back to “normal” where businesses slowly open up again in my country I was hopeful, yet I still got no reply no matter how many job I applied. I just need a temporary job until I can pursue my degree this September as a mature student. 

I feel like I’m doing nothing. Like I’m waiting for time to pass. I feel guilty that my boyfriend is covering up our rent and my dad still occasionally send me money because he knew I’m not surviving. I can’t even get a job like as a waitress. 

I feel like I should be like getting my shit together at this age (25F). Sorry for the vent. I just feel awful and wanted to let it out. I will do my best to keep looking for job.

Summary: Quit my first job without a backup plan due to how stressful it is. Now I regret it because can’t find any job at the moment. Feels like I wasted half of 2020 being useless.

English is not my first language sorry about the grammar and weird sentence."

I also hear auditory hallucinations more often in the hypnogotic state of falling asleep. While I'm awake I function normally but I notice after waking from dreams my head is heavy.

I have so much social anxiety and sometimes get angry for no real reason. i always wanna cut myself but can't do it and i always wanna commit suicide."
1884,Trick me,Can someone teach me a trick to stop holding my pee every day? Thanks
1885,Anxiety and depression can be the result of your unconscious mind withdrawing it's approval of your life circumstances. Do you agree with this?,"I feel like for me this is intuitively true.

A life that feels mostly out of my control and overly saturated with information that is both unhelpful and inescapable."
1886,I still hate my bully.,"In high school, I had this bully. I'm not trans, but I do have a ""deadname""-my given name which I hate, do not use, and get very uncomfortable if someone calls me by. I go by a different name. This bully's given name was the same as my preferred name. The first day of class, the teacher was reading out our names from the sheet to take attendance, and he said my given name. I politely asked him not to call me by that, and to avoid confusion with the bully, to call us by our last names or number us. He ignored my request, and said that he would just call me by my given name as it was written on the sheet. After this interaction, for reasons I do not understand, this bully would shout my given name from across the room, with no provocation, at any time when the teacher wasn't directly talking to the class. Every day. Of every week. Over. And over. And over. Again. I couldn't tell the teacher to make him stop, since his apathy was the inciting event. I was afraid to tell anyone else (counselors, parents, etc) about it, because I was afraid they would think I was overreacting. For the first few weeks, I would tell the bully to stop each time he did it. When he didn't, for the next 2 months, I tried ignoring him, just like I had been told from childhood-ignore the bully, and they will stop. He did not stop. And, for these two months, each time he did it, I could feel it striking like a chisel on my skull. Each time, my hate for him only grew. Towards the end of the two months, I would often imagine him in pain, suffering, and death, all inflicted by me, and laugh out loud at the mere thought. I truly didn't know how I could endure this for the 3 months left of the school year, and I didn't know what I would do when it became too much to bear. Fortunately, this all happened January through March of this year, and quarantine permanently separated us, so I never had to see hus face nor hear his voice again. But I still hate him. I still want to make him know what he has done to me. I still want to hurt him. I still picture myself killing him, and laugh. I still want to make him hurt. I thought these feelings would go away, but it's been months and they're as strong as ever. I know that I'll never see or hear from him again, but I still hate him. I know that I need help, but I don't know what to do. How do I let go of what he's done to me? To my mind? Should I let go at all? Help."
1887,People without mental illness are SO LUCKY.,"I have rewritten the same lesson like 10 times now because this morning my stress levels are so high my OCD is kicking in and I can't get past the first fucking page of the first lesson, I can't follow today's lesson because I'm so focused on finishing this goddamn page .  

I can't believe how LUCKY people are that can easily go through their day and tasks like sitting in on a lesson without having these struggles where as I am struggling to keep up with this class and we are ONLY ON DAY 2. 

People dont understand how grateful they should be that they dont have to worry about having constant paranoid thoughts or worries, or a bully that follows you everywhere you go to tell you you can't do shit.  

I onced asked my sister if she could relate and help me feel better about getting an intrusive bad thought out of my head and I couldn't even be mad when she said ""I honestly don't know what thats like im sorry"" and I was left with shock that there are people that go about their lives not experiencing things like this."
1888,I haven't self harmed since 2 years,I used to self harm every day. My arms might be scared but they haven't seen a blade for 2 years. I threw all blades away into the trash.

1891,No trauma. Mostly happy childhood. So why do I feel this way? Mind is stuck in almost 2 decades ago?,"*Trigger Warning: Brief Mention of Different Trauma Types, Not Graphic- Merely Listed* 
This is long, be prepared to read.

I’ve had a near perfect life. That’s not to say that I haven’t lost, or struggled, or failed, but the bad things that I have experienced are, to me, the same things that are just the facts of life that many others also go through. I currently feel like there is a dissociative identity bandwagon right now. Maybe people are pretending or maybe they’re being misdiagnosed or maybe my perception of a bandwagon is simply incorrect. Regardless, I’ve never seeked counseling or therapy, but I’ve been legitimately experiencing depersonalization/derealization/disassociation—I’m honestly not sure what it’s called anymore—since childhood. Basically feeling like I’m dreaming, watching myself from above or other point of view, sometimes not recognizing my own reflection. I can’t remember the very first time I noticed it, but I remember being small and sitting in a classroom and all of a sudden everything would seem so surreal and “I felt like I was dreaming,” is how I described it to my mom at 7-8 years old. When I confided in her, she offered advice to me to “wake myself back up,” is how I think she put it. She seemed concerned, but mostly calm and casual which caused me to believe that what I was experiencing was normal and just happens from time to time to everyone. It was up until early adulthood when I think that it finally clicked with me that not everyone experiences this and in fact, not many. I believe that because of the normalization that I developed in regards to my “dream state,” that I was able to create and utilize my own coping mechanisms. It’s something I’ve learned to live with up until recently.

The reason I’m here is because for the past 9-12 months, it has been really intense and nearly unavoidable day in and day out. Except this time it feels different. Instead of feeling like I’m simply just dreaming or watching things from a third person view, I literally feel like my mind is stuck or lost in another time of my life. Lately it’s been first grade, 2000-2001. Other frequent time frames are 2004-2006 and occasionally 2010-2013. Nothing outside of normal life events happened in these time frames. Birth of siblings, a handful of family deaths (only one being significant to me-grandfather), graduating high school , etc things like that. I feel the need to to reiterate that nothing extraordinary has ever really happened to me because I know many or most people that experience what I experience or something similar have experienced trauma, assault, neglect, and things of that nature. I’m staring off into space even when doing tasks that should occupy my attention. My thoughts, words, everything I do feels completely disorganized. Which is strange because my life such as my bedroom, bathroom, clothes are very organized and I’ve always had strong attention to detail yet I can’t seem to get ahold of my own inner self. I just don’t understand why this is happening to me and why I cannot mentally escape my first grade classroom and why my mind keeps getting basically frozen in 2001. It goes beyond simple mental imagery as I actually FEEL like it is a different time, a different year, a different age. But I do not take on the persona of my first grade self or anything like that, I’m always able to acknowledge I’m the same person, but I quite literally feel like I’m trapped in a mental time travel and it also feels like I’m dreaming at the same time. Has anyone ever experienced this or know someone that has?"
1892,"How did I cope with it, I still don't know! Just realised though.","Wow! It turned out to be a long and lengthy rant! Please go through it and tell me how you interpret it. So please go through it, it will be highly appreciated and don't get deterred by the length. Thanks.

I had this account created some 6 months back but it stayed there, just like that. Idk what drove me to reddit these past few days, 6 days to be precise. Came across this sub the very first day and it intrigued me. Never thought that it's a possibility. I faced the horns of dilemma these past few days, drowning in memes and ghost stories, but this sub remained, never ready to say what I should have long ago. But now, I am here, at last.

What are abusive parents actually? I had gone through many a incidents of users facing abuse at the hands of their parents which I never thought possible for a parent. Those are only there for the movies, I thought. A broken child, growing up to be a person of its own. A true surviving story. But here I found many survivors. Am I one? After all movies are based on real lives.

Where do I begin! As far as my memory goes, my parents were very good and loving to me but I was mainly brought up by my grandma. There isn't much that I remember from that period. But I faintly remember an incident, I think it is from my 1st grade. It was the day of the parents teachers meeting along with the distribution of the report cards. I remember father had taken me to school and the teacher had spoken in lengths with him. He looked sombre once we left school school, not saying a word on the return journey but I was okay (didn't understand what results meant as such I guess). On return, I saw my father and mom getting together and speaking in hushed tones that somehow made me afraid, may be the vibes they were giving out. So remember running to my grandma. She stayed with us till her death. But going there later. So, I run into her arms afraid, almost at the verge of tears and ask her, what was wrong? She wouldn't say anything but smiled and gave me candies instead and told me while I was having them, now the thing removed from mind, that my report card was colourful! I didn't get it that time but was happy that it might be something good then. But soon, hell broke lose, as my father marched into her room and grabbing me by my arm, dragged me to my parent's room and locked the door! He then took off his belt and started hitting me with it. I don't remember the pain anymore, just remember grandma's face through the window, crying and asking him to stop. I have no memory of it from there and never asked anybody about it. Apparently I had failed my 1st grade, so my report card was marked with red.

I don't know what changed, but I became a good student from then on. Good in class and at home. Results improved, I mean I was getting almost full marks in every subject till I was in the 4th grade. Now coming to my parents, they were good all along this period! Remember occasional thrashing for my antiques, but it never bothered me that much. My father took interest in my studies and would task and test me from time to time. I never gave room for complaints.

But a thing that stood out, all through my school life, even in high school, was that it was my grandma who prepared my breakfast, my tiffin, getting me ready and everything while my parents slept. I had early morning school, starting from 7.15 in the morning. Till fourth grade my father used to drop me but then I used to take my bike and go. So when I left, it was just my grandma who would see me off. It still stayed with me and it doesn't sit well with me, idk why!

Growing up, I soon started going out on my own to the playground, parks to play with my friends after school, or be it basketball practice at school but everybody knew about the rule I had! My father returned from work (he was an engineer working for the government) at around 6-6.30 in the evening and I can't be out after that. So each day no matter where I was, I had to return home by 6. On the occasions (there were a few, growing in number as older I got) I wasn't home, I was not allowed in on return and has to wait outside the closed doors for sometimes hours (2 and half hour being the longest if I remember correctly) till someone, mostly my grandma forced my father to open the door.

Then I had the study routine, I had to sit down to study by 7 or else a round of either shouting or a few slaps here and there. And God save me if I dozed off studying! But nothing was a surprise as a cousin of mine used to get beaten up for getting 95 out of 100 cause someone got more than her ( her father is a gem, but I even feared her mother).

Time goes on and I go from class to class, year to year, more of less the same thing. But the thrashing or shouting reduced drastically again due to my grandma, who made my father understand that now I am grown up and shouldn't be treated so. Somehow it struck a chord with my father.

My mother all along was somewhat non existent, she too feared my father but he wasn't abusive towards any other person. Never drank, had no bad habits, but still he was this raging fireball towards me. My mother on the other hand never stopped him but would emotionally manipulate me, into doing what they thought best for me. (Now I come to think of it as emotional manipulation, god this subreddit helped me a lot). 

Hitting puberty is a time when there's need for guidance and being the only child had no one. I was sent to a boy's only school, a missionary one. So never came across girls much and it was discouraged even at home (though not directly). So naturally it made me nervous around girls. At this time I came across a girl in an extra class taken at our teachers house. She was beautiful and almost immediately I fell for her. But had no guts even to talk to her and moreover she was Muslim (a big no no in our family). So controlled my urges and thinking about everything, never approached her, not even a hi was exchanged! (She is a good friend of my now and I told her everything but it was too late, as she got married, but that's for another account! I even wrote a letter in blood, stupid teenager, huh!)

I did well in my 10th standard and decided to go ahead with science (my father wanted me to be an engineer, just like him!) and went ahead with it. But somehow I didn't find it interesting. I failed in a couple of subjects in the first term, but soon I put all my efforts in and recovered. But in my senior year I meet this girl and things changed!

I now had started growing a mind of my own (I know it was high time) so when I met this girl (from the neighborhood) I again fell head over heels for her but this time the only difference was, I approached her. Soon we became good friends, chatting over the new phone I got. She was a Muslim too, but this time something had changed in me and I dared. Friendship grew into something special but before it could go ahead anymore, somehow my father came to know about her! (I didn't tell my parents, or even my friends as I didn't want to end it prematurely. I wasn't prepared tbh) Anyways my father engaged me in a conversation about her. I played safe by neither accepting or denying, leaving it open to interpretation. That mad him even more mad but this time I got no thrashing but for a few days my existence was ignored! I was cool with that but what followed, I wasn't prepared for it.

I still remember quite vividly! It was a Sunday evening, winter had just set in and the air had lost its moisture but became chilly. I and my GF, were strolling around a park away from both our places ( she too hadn't told about me), when suddenly out of the blue, a car started honking just behind us. I turned to curse but only to find our car and father driving it. I was forced to get in, leaving her alone ( I won't forget that day, the look on her face, the last look I got of her) to get back home. 
I was taken back immediately and grinding began, this time both my parents! They accused her of being Muslim (as if it mattered) then going on to call her names, till being called a prostitute. I broke down at first then burst out, tearing my shirt as the buttons went flying in every direction, but at that moment a hard and tight slap rang across my face! It was my father, who hit me again after 4-5years! I couldn't take it anymore and left home. I went to the park but she was gone. Her phone has been switched off when I tried calling her. I got tensed!

For the night I went to my best friend's place and told him everything, about her to the events of that day. I asked him not tell my parents if they asked (they surely will visit, I knew). Nothing happened that day or the next. I had skipped school and contemplated my next moves. I tried calling her but again her phone was off! It frustrated me the whole day. I even thought of returning home and go to her place to sort out but I controlled that urge.

With nightfall came my father (my friend's parents had forced him into a betrayal, kid you not, it did feel like it then) and with him the news that my parents had visited my now ex-GF's house to talk her parents out of it so that their daughter doesn't meet me! Now I knew what the switched off phone meant! They knew I wouldn't budge, so they took the matter into their own hands. And everything was lost for me. 

My studies suffered, my mental health too took a toll (all this I am understanding now, at that time I was made to believe that these were side effects of puberty). I wasn't left alone, father started accompanying me to school and mother on the return. I somehow grew distant with my parents this time. 

Soon school life was over and I took tests to get into an Engineering College. (I wasn't sure then, but my parents wanted the legacy to go on). All these years my grandma was always there to support me, my only lifeline that kept me sane.

Now I got the opportunity to go away. It was back in 2006. I left my parents place and took an apartment in the city where my college was, some 150 miles from my parent's place. It was kind of a relief, I'll not lie! I started studying and enjoying my college life. Met, a girl in the 2nd year and everything was going well. But she opened me to art and performance art! I was always a movie buff but now I knew what I wanted to be and it wasn't an engineer! I would talk to my father on a daily basis almost ( understand, I didn't know anything how felt then) but somehow my father started changing. His change started soon after the GF fiasco. But still he was my father.

Now when everything is great my mother wanted to drop in and stay with me for a few months (apparently she missed me but I only missed my grandma, who blessed me when I left) and so she did but soon events take a turn for the sour as I was no longer the kid that left my home town, but somewhat of an independent thinker. Soon we started to clash and it was my turn to burst out but each time I did, she would break into tears, feigning a stroke (sometimes when things went out of hand) and we both lost mental peace. It went on like this for over an year ( she must have thought with time I would again change, but this time they were in for a surprise) but I didn't budge (I had broken up with this girl friend again because mom didn't like her and I don't know how it crept in to our relation, driving us apart) it was her this time she had to leave. And she left and never asked to return, thank god! 

By now I had stopped going to college and started studying about films and filmmaking on my own. And one day out of the blue I dropped out of engineering, pursue a career in film making. Surprisingly my father didn't say much but left it to me to decide, just stating the pros and cons. But for my mother now all hell broke loose. She tried every trick in her bag to get me back to engineering but this time I didn't budge. I sought out filmmakers and started assisting them, first as intern then gradually moving up the ranks. It was in 2010.

My father now seems more approachable than my mother, as she continues to discourage, even till today, using her emotional tactics. Father now gets pissed at her for this attitude but she still does. I would visit them on a bi-monthly visit, mainly to see my grandma, who was happy for me.

In 2017 my grandma died and every attachment I had to the place died with her. Never gone back since and never saw my mother too. But we sometimes talk on the phone. I meet my father every month and he is a totally different person now. But my mother still keeps nagging, the new one being, to get married! Which I will not in the near future.

I will be 33 this July 16th and now have a stable girlfriend of 7 years+, have a few movies behind me, mainly writing and assisting. My own documentaries, ads, short films and an IMDB page with 15 credits to my name.

Idk if I was raised by abusers, still now not able to judge them, so those who went through my lengthy piece be the judge and tell me. What happened to me?
Thanks for reading, Cheers!"
1893,"If I didn’t put in the work when I was younger, this month would’ve been way worse than it was.","I’ve been seeing a counsellor/therapist for about 10 years now off and on, mostly off over the past year. 
When I first started, I was a drunk, depressed and miserable idiot who figured I was just broken and wouldn’t be fixed. Drinking and my attitude were a huge factor in my wife leaving with my son, I was getting in trouble at work life was general hell. 

This month: I not only got injured which busted/aggravated a knee injury but also found out I’ve got a long time chest injury that needs to get fixed ASAP. So my exercising has taken a back, causing me to gain 12 pounds. My partner went through a very difficult week which included self harming that I had to help her through. I was put in a very uncomfortable situation at work which I shouldn’t have been put in and which caused me a lot of stress and sadness.  And on top of that and easily the worst, my son’s 8 month old puppy passed away after he was in bed last night. Something went wrong during her surgery. 

I’m doing alright, although absolutely crushed for my son. He loved that dog and spent most of his time playing with her. It was really easy today to let everything pile up in my head and just shut down, but through practice and a very loving girlfriend I was able to sort everything I needed to mentally and not let them get jumbled into one big mess of my life sucks. To the point where I feel like I’m actually handling all of this better than most people would, and that’s a really good feeling to have that I wanted to share. 

Keep working on yourself. You’re not too far gone. I just had the most challenging month I can remember having in a long time and I’m dealing with it in a healthy way while still letting myself be sad. If I can get here, anyone can. Just please don’t give up and let yourself make mistakes. Failing is only failing if you stop trying."
1894,Needing motivation to do anything hard,"Hi everyone!

I'm over 25, suffering from agoraphobia and, things leading to another, living with my parents with no job. I'm not making much progress because I fear pain and basically have no motivation to do anything causing me pain. Finding love recently has pushed me to see a hypnotherapist and I've made baby improvements, but I unfortunately have bad reflexes of sadness, self-loathing and basically doing nothing when I'm feeling bad.

However, my parents are worried and upset and recently decided to enforce rules for me for my own good (like waking up at a certain time, doing chores, etc.)

Unfortunately, this resulted in me feeling really disappointed and angry at them. I said that I expected them to be kind and helpful instead of punishing, but they simply answered that being kind did nothing and that they're not punishing but helping. According to online ressources, taking your child's things away and giving them consequences when they act in a way you disapprove is legit education, but as someone in a child position, I find it hard to swallow, haha. I am of course aware that it is their home and that I have to submit, but I feel that trust has been broken between us.

This has at least motivated me to try and find a job (so that I can leave lol), and some of my friends are ready to motivate and help me in a positive way. I will start CBT very soon to see if the therapist can help me get any motivation.

Does anyone have tips to motivate me to work on my phobia and on my life in general? Is there an alternative I can suggest to my parents instead of them ""helping"" with childish rules? (Or am I an entitled brat for imagining my parents owe me anything?)

Thanks a lot for reading!"

1896,I can’t stop humming,"Okay so sometimes I hum out of the blue I just can’t stop humming at all it especially happens at night. I don’t know how to stop humming sometimes my voice will stop in the middle of it because it’s so tired of continuously humming, but that’s only for a split second then it goes back to it, I tell myself in my head that I want to stop and that I have to. I have to stop humming because I have a little sister who has autism and she gets upset about my humming (just mine, if my friend hums it’s fine, or if anyone else hums it’s fine, it’s just me) to the point we’re she will cry. One of the times that it got really bad my dad grabbed me by the wrists as tight as he could and kept on asking what was wrong (not in the nice or sincere way he was yelling it, and my wrists hurt like hell) I finally got away by kicking him, and ran into the bathroom and locked the door, he took my phone so I couldn’t contact anyone for help (I was still humming during this whole thing btw) I tried to close the door but I couldn’t, he yelled at me saying “LOOK AT WHAT YOU’RE DOING TO YOUR SISTER!” I couldn’t actually go over and look because he was pinning me behind a door, he eventually let me out from behind the door and picked me up and yelled “NOW IM ANGRY” and walked to my room (I sleep in a room that wasn’t designed to be a room, the literal door is a curtain) and threw me on the ground (I sleep on a futon btw, a futon on the floor) and he went to my sister’s room, so I tried running away by running over to this apartment close to mine, they are a couple and they have kids, I thought that they would help me, but they didn’t answer the door so I snuck back home, he didn’t even notice it, I eventually stopped humming and got my phone back, and texted my best friends about it, once of them ever since it happened has been staying the night with me when I’m at my dad’s ever since. It happened again last night (only it wasn’t violent) and now I can’t go to her house, or have her come here for a while. Last night he yelled saying “(deadname) IS TORTURING YOU FOR (I’m just going to replace it with my pronouns: their) SELFISH NEEDS” and while I was trying to get these papers away from them (because it felt like a breach of privacy) and they ran around with the papers taunting me. I was still humming at the time and they kept on yelling at me for it. I just can’t wait until I’m eighteen and can move out of this hell hole. Anyway about the humming, why am I uncontrollably humming? I will hum for hours on end with no control of it, can someone please try to help?"

1898,Emotional Support Animal,"I’m so confused. My psychiatrist gave me an emotional support animal letter for me to give to my landlord and then I was going to get an ESA when everything was cool. The landlord sent a form to my psychiatrist for more information on my disability, I don’t know what it’s asking. All I know is when I called my psychiatrist’s assistant, I’m told the form cannot be filled out as I don’t pull disability money so I’m not disabled to be able to fill out the form for my landlord... ok, then why was my psychiatrist willing to give me the ESA letter to have an ESA for my mental illness and I thought to even get that letter, I had to be considered disabled to qualify for an ESA?

1900,Need Advice on helping an elder understand her severe Depression,"Hello,

I’m here because I have a very old friend of my family (92 years old) who is suffering severe untreated depression.

Her symptoms are typical of depression in the elderly:

Insomnia

Increased pain and fatigue associated with her regular illnesses like arthritis 

Hopelessness 

Loss of self worth 

Loss of enjoyment in normal things 

Increased perseveration over her mortality 

Withdrawal from communication 

She recently had her beloved cat die and had to move into a small elder apartment (not assisted living)

She has had depressive episodes in the past but none quite like these past few months.

My family is going to call the council on aging in our town about getting her some geriatric psychological support and occupational therapy.

However, she is resistant to treatment and she struggles to understand what is happening to her. 

I have tried to explain to her a few times that while some of this is caused by sad things in her life it is also a chemical imbalance in her brain and it is NOT HER FAULT that she can’t cheer up and receiving medication and counseling would NOT mean she is crazy.

I think this is very hard for her to wrap her head around because of the time she grew up in and her declining mental clarity. 

Unfortunately my grandmother who is younger than her and lives with her also does not understand depression and is chronically impatient with her and while she does her best to help it usually amounts to her saying something like “pull yourself together and come out with me. You have so much to be grateful for compared to some people.” Which I’m sure doesn’t help.

They are both chronically stressed by this situation.

We will hopefully get some good advice from elder services but it has been hard to get appointments with pandemic restrictions and I wondering if anyone here has experience with this 

Or if there’s anyone on here who is older and grew up in a time when this kind of problem was heavily stigmatized who had someone explain it to them in a way that finally made it click for them?"

1902,Is it ok to wait to have sex until I’m in a relationship? I’ve dwelt on this for hours and hours over the past several weeks and I need some advice.,"
So I, (20M) am a 40+ time survivor of rape. I finally started dating about 8 months ago and have dated a fair share of women and was in a relationship with one. I’ve had sex one time with one of them (not the relationship one). I’ve learnt that because of my past, I get very attached very fast and having sex makes me even more attached. Well, the girl I slept with cut it off which caused over a month of pain. Because of this, I made a rule for myself that I will not sleep with anyone outside of a relationship. I am a craver of commitment. I do not and will not do casual stuff. The only time I’ve had casual sex was because I was high on several things. Commitment is very very important to me (because of my past’s affects on my worldview and personality) even though I am a man. I am very masculine looking btw. Without commitment, sex is meaningless and I do not enjoy it. It takes a harsh toll on my mental health because of the attachment. Is it ok for me to have this rule? I fear that this will make me even more undesirable and will cause a great inconvenience to the woman Or cause them to drop me."
1903,so what to do?,"i’m in a big life transition and life is feeling overwhelming. i feel lost at this point.. 
any advise would be great"
1904,My dad is an alcoholic and I can't look at alcohol anymore,"I have grown up as the only child in a toxic household. My dad is an alcoholic, and my mother didn't really do anything about it, and generally just disregarded the seriousness of the issue. But overall is a good mother.

My dad drank every night, more or less, with 3/4 nights going out to drink. From the ages of 11-16 I would stay up late to make sure when he came home there was no arguing. My school work suffered, I never had enough sleep, and this is where my anxiety stems from.There were nights where my parents would argue, he was never physically abuse but has broken items in the house. Definitley emotionally abusive. I don't know if I am ready to write about specific events. 

By the age of 14 I could not eat the days I knew he was going out, I would throw up if I heard them raise their voices, and I strarted self harming. I have had this anxiety feeling since, I went to the doctors around this time and was told ""it would pass"". I felt sick every single morning, physically sick say 30% of mornings. School didn't take it seriously. My friends didn't take it seriously. My mother only half took it seriously. I had to have my own room for my GCSE exams, my invigilator opened a can on coke and the sound it made just made me panic, mid exam. 

My dad bought his own house around the time I was 16 and started to stay there if he went out, which wasn't as often as before. Whilst I would still worry, I knew I don't have to stay up to make sure he comes in and doesn't argue. This was also the age I began drinking with friends, and had fun for the most part.

I moved out at 19 for university and loved having my own safe space, and enjoyed drinking at the start. I started taking antidepressants before my second year of university. I now have a month left at my student house before I have to move back with my parents, and have finished university.

For the past year I have found I can't handle alcohol, I will drink some, but I can't enjoy myself like I used to, and I feel this has been a long time coming. I have drunk less and less on nights out and try to leave early, or if I can not go out at all. 

I have been worried about my parents since the beginning of lockdown, if my dad would drink, would they argue? Would I be able to go and resolve it? Would I finally resort to calling the police? What would the aftermath of that be like? 

And now last night my housemate had two friends down, so them three and me and my boyfriend joined in. They played drinking games and I drank when I found it physically hard to. I was worried about being a miserable person in general and ruining the fun but I really did try. It got too much in the end and they were shouting and creating a lot of banging. One banged on the door as I was in the toilet and it just brought back memories and I broke down. I just don't want to see alcohol anymore. 

I don't know what I want from this post, but maybe similar experiences and outcomes. Any help I can get? I don't know I just want responses I guess."
1905,How do you overcome a sense of intrinsic shame?,"It's like since my teenage years I feel that there is something intrinsically rotten, guilty, disgusting, wrong, hidden inside of me. 

I tried telling everyone my whole life in details and all of my interests and hobbies and quirks... as embarrassing this oversharing is, no one ever found anything shameful or wrong about me, something that can make me point the finger and says ""ah, it's because of this"".

The major problem is that I had made mistakes and still do in hope to be Certified Good (TM). Forcing myself to convert and be religious, forcing myself to care for an abuser, denying myself all sorts of pleasures from food to relax to sex, attempting to be whatever successful incarnation of a good person I think I can be: career, social status, things that mean nothing but will ""clear me"" and ""prove it"" that I am a Goodie... I keep making my life miserable because of this. Everything is because of this. 

People says I'm too concerned with what everyone thinks of me, but that's not it: I am concerned about having my rotten core exposed, I want other people to approve and think ""good"" so they don't see it. If everyone says I'm good maybe it's proof I'm not so unspeakably bad. Unspeakably.

Is there any way to entangle this? I'm living a life that I am not, many lives that I am not, and never leave myself in peace. Do you have a few pointers for improvement?"

1908,I had to ask for a mental health break at work. I feel guilty.,"Everything is piling up. I'm at my wits end. I'm losing it. I'm having anxiety attacks, tiny things are sending me into complete fits.  

Basically: My dog passed in April. I had a complete mental breakdown. Issues at home. Dad is an alcoholic. Broke up with the BF a few days ago. New puppy at home. I am just passed my limit.  

I called my doctor and asked for help. She wrote me a note for a week off, made me an appointment to check my meds and I'm seeing a therapist. I'm taking steps, I just need space and a bit of time to settle and chill.  

I feel guilty. Things are so busy at work but I can't do it. I have to take care of myself ☹️"

1910,The Questions We Should Have Asked: Mental Health Challenges at College,[removed]
1911,Does anyone else feel that the Islamic approach to dealing with OCD (called Waswas) is harming patients?,"Bangladeshi here. 

OCD has a higher prevalence among Muslim populations possibly because of the greater focus placed on the control of internal experiences if I understand correctly. In any case, the Islamic world has a different take on OCD. They call it Waswas (derived from the term, whispers by Satan). Different scholars have different takes on the matter. But from what I understand but the general consensus seems to be two fold: ""Pray it away"", ""Intense, focus on prayers despite the internal experiences (thoughts, images, urges, feelings, sensations, awareness and so on) being there (basically a form of focused mindfulness). 

I have not found anyone who suggests ERP techniques like paradoxical intentions. And ERP is the gold standard based on research. 

I have read a few articles here and there and I am not an expert on the subject so ofcourse I could be wrong. 

So my question is: Does anyone else feel like that this different religious take is actually harming patients and is therefore irresponsible?"
1912,Is it ok to wait to have sex until I’m in a relationship? I’ve dwelt on this for hours and hours over the past several weeks and I need some advice.,"

1913,urge to self harm,"i haven't self harmed in 2 years i think. my left arm is the part of my body that is most scared still. 
the thing is that lately (past few weeks) i've been having the urge to self harm again. i can't identify any triggers, and also don't have the courage to tell my therapist.
i've always been a very closed off person when it comes to how i'm feeling and the things that are hard for me to deal with. i usually wait for the hard time to pass and then discuss it in therapy. i know it's not the most effective way to treat it but it's just the best way i can. 
i don't know how to stop feeling this way. i'm afraid i will start self harming in alternative ways such as smoking a lot, or distancing from my parents. both ways i think it is worse than actually cutting myself. 
what is really stopping me from doing it is that right now i really don't want any fresh scars. maybe in a few weeks i will feel different about it."
1914,Social anxiety in zoom classes,"Lately I have just left during the session in lot of my college zoom classes, simply because my teacher will call on random students or because we are having a discussion. I hate myself for doing it but I just can't help it. I hate being called on so much I am so afraid of embarrassing myself, I can not talk in front of my classmates. I feel like I don't know anything of what we are talking about anymore, and even if I did I am not good at articulating myself. 

Everyone in my class can answer questions and discuss without any problems, but I am just mute during the whole class. Sometimes I want to say something but i spend so much time thinking of how to say it right that it becomes too late and my chance is gone. 

I feel like my teacher has noticed that I keep leaving my classes and i dont know what to do

Sorry this might not belong on this subreddit but i needed to vent, i hate online classes so much"
1915,Have your emotions ever felt artificial?,"What the title says. A year or so ago, I went through a period where my emotional reactions to things seemed like preprogrammed responses, it was like I could see the coding for the first time. I basically felt like a machine that just realized it was a machine, if that makes since. Thankfully it passed, but it was still an odd experience."
1916,How do you work on your goals while feeling awful?,"It’s just one of those day (periods) when all I want to do is to watch YouTube/Netflix or play video games all day and forget about myself and  the fact that I’m feeling down. But I have goals that I want to achieve and I have work on them, but yet, this something is keeping me from doing it.

I’m just feeling down and awful, I have a big decision I’m trying to take and I would love some advice on staying productive while feeling like crap. 

Thanks and love you!"
1917,self harm and break up,"hello everyone, im mainly looking for support right now. 
i just got broken up with after an 8 month long relationship, i felt like he was my soulmate and we were destined to be together and get married but unfortunately that wasnt the case.
i am on the autism spectrum and overhyperfixated on him and depended on him way too much, my mental health was an issue and led to our break up. i have no friends or no support and i relapsed from self harming after a few months. 
i am not sure how ill be able to move on and i have no motivation to keep bettering myself or anything at all im very scared and im so regretful and guilty."
1918,"Everything is apparently fine, but today has been insufferable","As the saying goes, it's as though ""I woke up on the wrong side of the bed"".

Currently, I am undiagnosed so I have no idea what is wrong with me. Today, everything has been bothering me. If I could, I would hide under the floorboards just to avoid everything and everyone. Unfortunately, my family gets the worst of it. Just their mere presence annoys me, even though I undoubtedly love them. I lash out at them against my will because the sound of their voice causes an overwhelming anger inside of me. I feel awful. I feel overwhelmed by my own existence.

I wish everything could just stop for a day or two."
1919,Treatment for porn habit,"Rule compliance: l live in the United States.

I've struggled with a porn problem my entire adult life, but I only realized how problematic it is in the last 2-ish years. I guess the DSM doesn't consider porn consumption an ""addicting"" behavior, but for lack of a better word my relationship with porn is best described as such. Sometimes it feels like a hopeless situation, but I know I have to challenge these thoughts because it's not hopeless. I had a 3 month stretch of almost no consumption, and it was the happiest I've ever been. I want to do even better, but thus far I've failed to replicate that experience.

Nonethless it raises legitimate questions. If porn cannot be the subject of an addiction what treatment options do I have? I've been doing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for a while and frankly I don't think it's going anywhere. I mean how much longer must I stagnate before trying something new? I just don't know where else to go. I'm already undergoing psychiatric treatment and therapy for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I feel like something is missing. For a while I thought transcranial magnetic stimulation might address my depression and maybe give me a leg up in addressing my porn consumption, but I don't think that's an option. I need to solve this problem right now. I'm so sick of this. There has to be a more effective strategy. Is there like an AA for people with porn habits? Any info would be helpful."
1920,this is really stupid but pls hear me out,"okay so i've been listening to travis' astroworld since last year and i have the whole album memorized. i swear i knew all the songs' lyrics word by word.

i just played the album and suddenly i can't sing along except for one or two lines for like 4 songs?? almost most of the songs sounds unfamiliar as if this is my first time listening to them. no bystanders is the only song i actually remember entirely.

has this happened to anyone? i know it's just song lyrics but this is really worrying. am i turning stupid and forgetful??"

Is there any resources or anything I can suggest to help her? She doesn’t have any support system there."
1923,I need help...,"I just joined this sub today. I feel like I’m letting my family down due to my anxiety and depression which just makes those issues even worse. I have had depression and anxiety issues in the past. Mine flair up when things are going wrong or because of things I can’t control. I tend to want to fix everything and I worry about everything when it comes to my husband and two young adult children. Nothing severe has ever really happened. My parents passed, my husband lost a job and he is the main provider and my daughter went thru a very bad breakup. These things range from 2-10 yrs ago. They all resolved themselves (husband got a better job and daughter is with the most amazing young man). I know things tend to usually get better when given time but I tend to feel like I’m in a hole and can’t get out. I’m always waiting for something bad to happen instead of being happy in the moment. I cry constantly and my kids end up comforting me which I hate because I want to be the rock for them. Lately, COVID is my main concern. Will we ever get to live a normal life? Will my kids ever get a world back where they can raise children in a safe and fun environment? Also, my best friend of 40 yrs is moving across the country and visiting will be hard due to lots of reasons. Just found out I have to tear up my basement due to plumbing issues. I work in catering and haven’t been called back to my job. Will I get called back since the food industry will be making huge changes due to COVID? Hoping my husband can keep his job because things are much slower due to COVID. I’m feeling overwhelmed and can’t find happiness right now. I am making an appt to see my dr to get back on antidepressants but I hate to do that because I want to overcome and handle these mood issues without medication. I considered seeing a therapist but don’t want to due my first visit via video visit. I think that would be weird and I know I will break down. Can anyone give me some advice on how to handle my feelings of being overwhelmed? I am desperate for some happiness. I’ve been told to not to worry about things you can’t control but how do you do this when your personality works against you? Words of encouragement or advice is very much needed. Thank you."

1925,Now this is a pretty interesting read,"In the discourse on mental health, do you think a general outlook on the self of the therapist is missing? Like for example, how in training therapists are told not to go to bars, and not display any indication of public sexual relations. No wonder that when we think of therapists, the image is nowhere of someone who might be like us. Thoughts on this perspective?

1928,My [27F] therapist told me I have either too much empathy or no empathy at all. What could cause me to be like this?,"Up until recently I fully lived by the whole do onto others mantra. The golden rule etc... my mental health has gotten really bad recently partly due to a toxic relationship. But a lot of it is to do with me ignoring my issues and problems for way too long.

Here is what my couples therapist sent as we were terminating our sessions:

“I don’t thing you’re a bad person.  I think you struggle with either being too empathetic towards others or not having any empathy at all.  There is no in between.  You also struggle with taking everything as a personal attack (classic BPD trait) and don’t possess the tools needed to be able to process through it.”

Anyone any insight on what I could do to try and get better with these things? Is this empathy thing common? It’s really scaring me, I don’t want to be a bad person. Is it all related to BPD

Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated!"

1932,My sister is mad at me because I didn’t acknowledge her toddler,"I’ve been living with my sister (who is going through a divorce and has a 3 year old) ever since I’ve been furloughed bc of COVID. There are mornings where my depression is so bad i simply don’t have the energy to talk amongst most things. we made plans to go running in the morning the night before. This morning I woke up feeling completely empty (great another episode) heard my sister getting ready and getting dressed (even jingling keys) she’s a Virgo so she’s always very prompt and clean and organized and etc if you know what I mean. I’m a sad Capricorn artist who just got out of a 6 year relationship. Anyways. I’m in the kitchen getting my water bottle and her daughter (whom I love and adore) was just slamming me with their normal toddler questions. I simply could not answer her. I simply couldn’t find the energy to be the “cool” uncle I usually am. I literally retreated to the dark bathroom and talking out loud I said to the likes of “i really can’t talk right now I just woke up I’m in the zone” it wasn’t anything bad I didn’t have an attitude while saying it. But my niece was following me and my sister reallly took offensive to this action of mine. She grabbed her kid and said let’s go. She went to her room and didn’t come out for a while. So I was like are we still running? I thought my sister was saving me from the toddler grilling me with questions like Paparazzi to an heiress leaving a club at 3am. So I poked my head in and said “are we still running?” She said “I am
So angry right now, this is my kid and you do not talk to her like that! She is a toddler!” She started crying and was very emotionally involved in this. I explained that me walking away and not vomiting rainbows and butterflies to her child was nothing against the child I needed to go away. I love this kid to death and I do everything for her. I literally was just having a mental day but still wanted to go running. All I was, was silent and my sister was so pissed off at that. She said just be more mindful of my kid when you’re feeling like that. I just need some advice on how to continue my day. Thanks and sorry this was longer than expected. I truly never really reach out to anyone."

1935,Should I get help?,"I'm not here for a diagnosis or anything, I just want to know wether or not I should go to a professional.  


About a year ago, I noticed I didn't enjoy videogames as much as I used to. I was a little bummed out since its most of what I did, but I thought it would go back to normal soon. It didn't and I started doing other things, archery, video editing, skating, VR, anything else. Those were fun for about two weeks before they got stale. In total, I probably spent about $700 and I feel guilty for ""wasting"" that much. I tried video games again and started enjoying Terraria, but since it was the most fun I've had in a while, I burned myself out (100 hours in 5 days) and get instant boredom from just the title screen. Nowadays, I spend my time listening to music, watching YouTube, browsing reddit, and sleeping.

In school, I've been doing ok, Average B's and C's with a D in Math and Science. Before, I'd have A's and B's in all subjects with a dream of being a chemist. Now I have no aspiration or long term goal. I have friends and acquaintances but I don't have anyone to really talk to about this kind of thing. That might be because of social anxiety though.

I haven't told my parents about my problems because they've told me before that everything will be fine and its just because I'm a teenager, so they feel next to useless in that area. And I believed them, but now I feel stupid for wanting to reach out because I keep telling myself ill waste the therapist's time. I keep trying to convince myself that ill be fine, but it feels less and less likely each day.

1938,Potentially Mis-Diagnosed Sister Wreaking Havoc on Family,"A rather long-winded post so please bear with me. 

My younger sister is in her early thirties. For years we the family have labored under the assumption that she has a diagnosis of both ADD and OCD. She began seeing a psychiatrist when we were in middle school for aforementioned diagnoses. However, we can't help but feel like more is amiss. Prior to that, she was an out-going, gregarious child. I was the quiet, sullen one. As we hit puberty however, we began to slowly swap roles. When she hit college, she moved in with an aunt the next city over to attend the school there. She seemed to be doing fine or so we thought. After staying there for a few years however, she was suddenly kicked out by our aunt and forced to move back in with our father. The reasons for this unceremonious  departure were not immediately revealed to us until some years later when we discovered that not only had she been failing her classes, but she  behaved slovenly and rarely picked up after herself while living there. 

Why did it take so long for this information to reach us? A majority of it is the simple fact that my sister hardly communicates. With anyone. At all. About anything. She next to never volunteers information about herself and any questions posed to her are met with very clipped, abbreviated answers. Occasionally, she'll even become defensive. Which leads me to the next issue: she rarely displays any overt emotion. I don't think I realized the extent of this until our grandma who raised us with our father and was the one constant mother figure in our lives passed away some years back. At the time, I was consumed by grief and so didn't give it much thought, but looking back, my sister did not display one iota of distress when our grandma passed. No crying, no nothing. Everyone in the family says the same thing. They never saw it. Instead, she projected the same facial expression that's come to be her trademark: a wistful countenance with this odd little smile. I haven't seen her really angry or really happy since we were kids. The most you can expect to get is exasperation/slight annoyance or little chuckles. That's pretty much it. 

That's not to say she's a heartless person. She routinely visits our bio mother who was diagnosed with Schizophrenia when my sister was two. This woman was only sporadically in our lives as small kids and I made the decision around the age of 10 not to communicate with her anymore because of her bizarre and chaotic lifestyle. My sister continued to communicate with her here and there via phone mostly for a number of years until just recently, she started seeing her in person frequently and going out to places in public with her. Sometimes I think she has more empathy than I do. But then one day, she disclosed to a family member that the reason she (my sister) thinks she has all these problems is because our bio mom placed her in a microwave as a baby. Bear in mind, there is zero evidence to support this and I won't even go into the logistics of how this is not possible, but just the fact that she entertains these types of notions from her bio mother is disconcerting. 

She has also been attending community college for over ten years. She claims the reason is because she's changed her major a couple of times. However, she swears that she has enough credits to get an Associates. No matter how many times we've told her to just grab it and use it to be more competitive in the job market she won't. Which has led us to believe that the credits she's accumulated is another lie. That's the other thing: we started discovering just how much she lies in the past couple of years usually to cover up things like lost jobs of which there have been many. She's been fired for everything from perceived indifference, to performance, to attendance. I think the maximum amount of time she's stayed anywhere was a little over a year. The average is about 90 days. She recently was fired from Amazon for failing to clock in and out one too many times. Or so she says. We can't be 100% sure because again, she pretended to keep going to the job a week after she lost it. Even after our father received a severance email because she had initially used his to apply for whatever reason. 

Perhaps most alarmingly, she's been in a five car accidents in the past five years all of which she's been at fault in. Most are rear-ends. The last one she turned in front of someone causing them to clip her back end. She attempted to cover this up for a period of time by parking far away from the apartment where she and my father live, but he eventually caught on.

We just don't know what to think. While we do feel like something is definitely wrong with her mentally, another part of us can't help but feel like maybe she's taking advantage of the situation with my father. In some ways, I think he also unknowingly enables her because he largely avoids confronting her about her many issues. He'll have a serious conversation with her initially, she'll ""yes"" him, and then it's seemingly brushed under the rug by both of them, not to be brought up until the next calamity. Nothing is accomplished. And it's tough because he is pushing 70 and does have some health issues. At one point, when he sold his house a couple of years ago, he finally attempted to exercise some tough love and told her she could not come with him when he downsized to an apartment. Predictably she waited until the last moment, solicited almost everyone in the family for a place to go, was let in for two months by the aunt, and then kicked out again for pretty much the same reasons. The general consensus seems to be that our father should be the one dealing with her and sad as it is, he wouldn't be in this situation if he hadn't ignored it for so long. I think he's also in denial and no doubt scarred to an extent by our mother's diagnosis. 

One thing worth mentioning is how contradictory my sister's behavior is in part. She regularly indulges in bars (before COVID obviously) and does associate with a certain circle of people. So she's not completely anti-social. We find it odd that she won't miss opportunities to attend parties, but when it comes to cleaning and taking general responsibility for other areas of her life, she predictably falls short. She'll spend what little money she typically has on frivolous things like alcohol, hookah, and hobbies and won't give my father any money for rent despite him asking countless times. She reminds me of me at age 16. 

It's gotten to the point where our father is now telling her she may have to lose her license and go into a group home because he now wants to move in with myself and my husband 300 miles away. You would think that a truly lucid person would seethe at the idea of essentially being committed, but she shows really zero response or concern. We're honestly thinking she may have borderline Schizophrenia that's gone undiagnosed, but so far the doctors she sees only prescribe her things like Fluoxetine and Buspar. 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."
1939,Lost everything. I struggle to see the point,"I guess I just need to vent to somebody. At the end of March, me and my ex were put under an immense amount of stress while her mom had a psychotic break. At the same time, her grandpa was dying. Her mom caused us to lose the pretty good living situation we had and also caused us to break up(6 years). I was struggling with a drug problem and was very distant. I immediately got sober but I had to move back in with my parents and she moved in with a ""friend"".  

The heartbreak and being sober for the first time in years was unbearable. I've never felt anything like it. I decided I needed a vacation so I took some time off work and went out west. Before i left, I smashed my laptop and found out my ex was with somebody else. Things were bad but i was able to manage. Long story short, after a week and a half out west, things got crazy and one split decision later, I'm turning myself in to the police. I can't say too much but I have two felonies pending against me with my face all over the news in two states. I spent a another week and a half locked up but my ex worked tirelessly to help bond me out. 

Because of the news coverage, I lost my job and had all sorts of terrible things said about me. I may have a chance at getting let off somewhat easy but the DA is definitely trying to make an example out of me. I've learned a lot since me and my ex initially broke up. I'm no longer the person I was but im filled with so much guilt and embrassment. Ive been put on meds and will štart counseling soon but ive partially relapsed because of the intense anxiety. Me and my ex have talked a lot and she said she still loves me very much and if we are meant to be together, things will work out. 

Im not sure what the point of this is but if you made it this far, thank you. I'm clinging onto a strand of hope that things could be better on the otherside. I have lots of support but im also not sure how much longer I can push forward. All I want is to say fuck it and end everything but I don't have the courage"
1940,You guys my therapist is SO GOOD,"So freaking good.  I just wanted to come here and say that.  I feel like I’ve been in and out of therapy for so long and mostly it just felt meh and like it was really just a place for me to vent.  This therapist gets deep, and is getting me to do that work and just rocks.  I actually feel like I’m accomplishing shit in there and on my way to healing.  I think part of it was my readiness to be open and really take a look at myself internally but she is just totally the right therapist for me.  

Anyway if you feel like you haven’t gotten that much out of therapy don’t give up.  First you do have to be willing to confront things and do hard messy work but also not every therapist is the right therapist for you so don’t be afraid to try a new one."
1941,How do I get away from this narcissistic nonsense and start living?,"Not being ""the best"" is so triggering to me. Trying to impress people constantly drives me insane. Life feels like a stage play, where locking down alone in your apartment is the only way to relax. That's why I've never had any close friens or romantic relationships - I just can't relax around people. Average feels like a failure. This wouldn't be much of a problem, if I was some kind of a genius. But I'm not. And it makes me inexplicably ashamed. Shame is what I feel 90% of the time. I wish I could drive this energy into being a workaholic. But that's not the case either. I can't work properly. The sheer thought of work makes my heart beat faster and my palms sweaty. There're so many things I can get called out for, so many things that can make me look stupid - it's easier to just not do anything at all. Sometimes I think about just offing myself. Can you imagine how much easier it would be? No one puts high expectations on a dead person. I understand how rotten my thoughts and desires are, and I'm deeply ashamed of myself. But I just can't help it. The only time I feel truly happy is when I'm drunk. Like, really drunk, can't reach my bed type of drunk. I would just drop my body on the floor near the entrance, look at the giant mirror on the side wall, browse my reflection and think: ""I'm alive and healthy. Is there really anything more I could wish for?"", - and then I'd just pass out. I always hope this mentality sticks, but it always goes away the next morning.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the ratchet English, I'm very emotional. How do I get away from this? I'd love some ""exercises to do"" types of advice, not just abstract: ""stop worrying about what others think, fam"". Thank you in advance."
1942,Young family member having really disturbing thoughts... how to cope?,[removed]
1943,All alone,"Sorry this is going to be pretty negative so maybe don't read if you're struggling right now. 

I just wanted to have a quick rant about the thoughts I've been having lately.

I've been having a really rough week, like really rough. And basically I feel so damm lonely! I'm lonely yet I have a family and a friend, and a boyfriend.

My boyfriend is really understanding and he's been great. I lived with him last year and it was lovely and when I had a bad time there he'd always be so good at helping me lift out of it. Yet now I'm at home and because of covid I don't see him often at all. And it's been like a punch in the stomach.

A punch in the stomach at the realisation that my family are there for me but they don't understand my pain. My boyfriend does to an extent but I can't keep calling him so upset and then ruining his mood and his day and not to mention that he now feels he can't share his hurt with me.

Even when I speak to people there's nothing they can do is there. Let's be real, this is all in my own head and I don't know why it's took so long to realise but omg I have to deal with this all by myself. Noone else can make the anxiety go away, no matter how many nice things they say or how calm they try and make me.

Noone can put my life back together for me and it sucks. It sucks that I'm battling this horrible illness, or these illnesses and appart from the times of happiness with others, when I'm in pain then it's all down to me.

This makes me so angry at my mind, at my life and at everything in general to be honest. It's not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.

Thanks for listening"
1944,Help me (trigger warning),"Lately I’ve been thinking about blood on the walls and floors and some times white butterflies but mostly blood idk if it suicidal thoughts also been self harming and having mood swings but not extreme ones, I just wanna know what’s wrong with me I’m scared."
1945,I don't know what to do anymore,"tw // mention of s*icide and s*lf h*rm

A while ago, my doctor suggested I may have agoraphobia and he put me on zoloft. The first few weeks were great, it felt like I was finally getting better. It didn't work as well for a little bit after that, and so I asked for my mom to call in and up the dosage. It helped a little, and it eventually stopped doing anything. My doctor said I should go to therapy but it never happened. 

A few months after that initial doctor's appointment, me and my mom were fighting and she ended up calling me crazy because she 'needed to take me to the doctors for being too nervous'. And after that, I just stopped trying to reach out for help. I always think about it. And maybe she didn't mean it, maybe she said it in the heat of the moment, but it hurt me a lot. It made me feel horrible, especially with all I went through to try and get help in the first place.

My anxiety has been getting worse, I can't talk to people I'm not close to without feeling like the wind is getting knocked out of me. My presentation anxiety used to be bad, but it's gotten even worse. I can't speak in front of a group without nearly crying or having a whole panic attack. And even when it's not in front of a group, when I talk about my feelings aloud, even for a small portion of the conversation, I'll just burst out into tears and I have no idea what the hell is going on. I could feel fine in the moment but appear to be 'In a mood' and if one of my parents asks if I'm okay, I just feel like I'm going to start sobbing in front of them.

I've been having trouble taking my medicine anymore, and I've been self harming. Usually it's only a couple of times every few weeks when everything bubbles over and I want to hurt myself, but it gets even worse on my period. I'll stay in bed and hardly take care of myself and I'll just lay here and feel horrible and think about what it would be like if I could off myself. I've never made plans, but whenever I get too stressed out, I always find myself looking up painless ways to go, just incase I can't take it anymore.

It feels like everything is just a mess, and I don't know what to do. My sister used to have extreme mental health problems, but she never told our parents, and I feel like if I try to keep getting help, it'd just be really unfair. She deserved help too but she didn't get it when she needed it most and that makes me feel so fucking horrible.

I don't know what else to say honestly. If you're reading this, thank you. and I hope you have a nice rest of your day"
1946,I feel worse when I don’t hear the right words or what I think I need to hear.,Does anybody else get this? When I talk to a friend about something that’s bothering me. I notice I feel worse as it continues but the sadness is generated by myself. I usually notice this and try the steer the conversation in a way so they know what i need/want to hear but it feels forced at that point so I say I’m fine. Then I feel guilty for feeling worse just because they didn’t say what i wanted to hear. I don’t want to tell them what I want to hear because I feel like that gets rid of any sincerity and would be ignorant of me.
1947,Therapy is really frustrating when it shows you the problems are real and it's not you being a pussy.,"I started therapy in the expectation I'd realized that actually things were not what it thought, that the hole was not that deep and I could get out of depression by resignifying life. 

I was wrong. All the conclusions we came to are affirmations of the problems I have, and most of them have no solution. I'll be carrying this for life.

Therapy put me closer to suicide as I've never been. It's a constant, daily search for the chance of effectively stopping the suffering I find myself in.

Therapist is a good man, but he can't solve my problems, neither can I. 

In the last months I dig another hole, getting hard into drugs and exiting a comedown with another one. Tbh staying sober is not something I really want anymore.

I feel alone as fuck and I'm always surrounded by people. Feel like trash as I get compliments and I'm recognized among friends. I live the life people (and myself) dream, but simply can't enjoy it.

It's not about them, but me, and this is overwhelmingly annoying.

I'm not asking anything, just sharing some thoughts."
1948,How do I stop being so Condescending and Manipulative?,If I sense a form of weakness or I see that ur emotional hurt or something like that I’ll use that to my advantage and get what I want it’s just a overwhelming urge that I can’t help i blackmail people manipulate why how can I stop this like sometimes I do it without even trying plz help
1949,Why can't I stop crying at night?,"I'm trying my hardest not to cry as I'm writing this. I suffer from chronic loneliness and depression since over a year now, I try to not let anyone know about it but at night when I'm on bed trying to sleep I just can't stop crying, I try to stop myself but it just doesn't work I end up shedding tears faster than before. Throughout the day I have my ups and downs, a few anxiety attacks, a few suicidal thoughts etc but I don't feel the need to burst out crying, then why does it start happening now? I sleep next to my mom and so I remain as quiet as possible trying not to wake her up and I guess it hurts me more to realise that she can't hear me struggling. I need help, I can't keep on doing this for too long now it's driving me insane. I'm 17 btw."
1950,Please help me,"Some days I feel great and others I just want to harm or sometimes even kill myself and I have a feel a deep hatred for myself and everything I do. It goes with self confidence too, sometimes I feel like I can make friends and talk to strangers very easily and then others I don't even want to leave my room because I'd have to have a social interaction and when they happen they feel incredibly awkward. If anyone has been/ is in a similar situation, how do you cope? Or even how could I stop it from happening?"
1951,Depression,"I get so angry at people thinking I can just become happy by thinking positive  when I'm so down and depressed everyday, feel like there isn't a point to my life,  I was literally mentally tortured in school, bullied physically and mentally that I pulled my hair out and developed nervous  tics, stopped talking then bullied in college too and work places too. Just needed to rant...how can I just erase that part of my life is why I'm mentally tortured by my depression, anxiety  , paranoia everyday. Fucking sucks"
1952,Is something wrong with me?,"So this may be long and drawn out, but it is simply because I don't actually know what is wrong with me or if anything is wrong at all, I'm going to be 100% honest and transparent and welcome any input whatsoever. 

\- I have a **stutter/ stammer** and have done since as long as I can remember. It's not severe but I feel it hold me back massively in all avenues of my life (Socially, dating, professional). Recently I've developed massive **anxiety** because of it; I overthink simple social gatherings with friends I've known for a long time, I am absolutely petrified of going on dates with girls and struggle with things that could possibly get me further in life.

\- I can't **concentrate** on things for a long time unless it's Netflix, Youtube, Instagram etc. I try to limit how much time I spend on these platforms as It's in the consciousness of society now that consuming too much of these things is obviously bad for you. But I used to be so ambitious and determined to put in the work that would make my life better but I find myself just wasting time and procrastinating on things so much.

\- My **discipline** has dwindled. This may link in to the previous paragraph but I've noticed I just have no discipline anymore. I never go to bed on time as my free time is very limited but it bites me in the ass the next day as I'm exhausted and work 12 hour days at work. I never sit down and do anything productive anymore as I find it mind-numbingly boring.

\- I've recently feel like I have had an **existential crisis.** My 27th birthday is 3 weeks away and I'm petrified of it as I work a mediocre job that is going no where even though I have so many things I want to do and accomplish in my life but I feel I am held back by the above. I don't know what my purpose is anymore. I used to want to be rich and constantly thought about it all the time but now I feel like it's an impossible thing to achieve with such a low rate of success and, again, the above holds me back somewhat.

\- This may not be relevant or could be extremely relevant but I also **drink and take drugs**. I feel it's necessary to mention this for obvious reasons. I would say I drink every week, some nights it's literally a beer after work at home, sometimes I do go out with friends and I end up drinking a lot and taking cocaine with my friends, not a huge amount (half a gram max) and I do it maybe once every 2 weeks - a month. I find coke makes me depressed the next day (common) as well. I know it's easy to say ""say no"" or ""you're hanging out with the wrong people"" but I've reluctantly been taking it semi-regularly for around 5 years now and when you're drunk it is so hard to say no, it's like my body sniffs the line for me without me being able to control it and after wards I'm left to think about the ""decision"" I've made, furthermore due to my stutter I don't feel like i can go out and just make new friends easily. I mentioned this in case anyone else has had a similar experience with long term drug use and can offer advice on this.

tl;dr: I feel like I have problems with the following: My stutter which causes great anxiety although never used to, I can't concentrate, I have no discipline, I've had an existential crisis and I use alcohol and cocaine occasionally.

Any help with any one or all of the points I've made would be greatly appreciated."
1953,Am i beyond fixing,"So some backstory is when I was 5 my father died in front of me and my sister which means my mom raised us by herself.She wasn't the worse mother but she has mental issues of her own and my sister would fight with her constantly throwing fits like she was a toddler.Im a 16 year old male ive been diagnosed with depression and ptsd my younger sister is 14 years old.For most of my life my younger sister abused me by hitting me,throwing razor blades at me,telling me to slit my wrist(I've struggled with self harm from the age of 12). As ive gotten older i finally became stronger then she is.She hasnt bullied me as much as she used to and when ever she tries to i stick up for myself but my mom tells me im such a horrible person for holding a grudge onto the abuse. I've had thoughts about hanging myself or lighting my room on fire and running away faking my death. I think my mom is catching on with noticing I've been different. She always talks to me like I'm slow or a child. I'm afraid she thinks im beyond fixing. My mom always talks about how glad she is that I'm not in the hospital anymore. What do I do?"
1954,Feeling really demotivated,"I started working out recently so that I could try to feel good about myself and my body. I ordered a scale and just got it today. I weigh 20 pounds more than I thought I did. I know that doesn't sound like much but it makes me feel like shit. I'm eating healthier and I'm working out really hard but I can't see any progress. If anything I feel like I'm gaining weight. I recently got stretch marks on my back, arms, and sides and it makes me feel like fucking shit. It makes me just want to fucking give up"
1955,How do I know if I'm engaging in self harm?,"I bite myself (and some random stuff like clothes too), hit myself with a ruler, punch shit including walls and use clips on my skin. Not that it hurts me, but to calm myself down, when I'm too excited, anxious or down. I'm confused whether is this normal behaviour. I live in Chittagong, Bangladesh."
1956,avpd?,i just heard about avoidant personality disorder and i feel like it sums me up perfectly. i'm so fearful of  starting college soon and however much i promise myself i'll try to break out of my comfort zone and talk to people i know i'll always be socially inept and struggle making friends. i don't want to see the very few friends i have easily go on and make new friends. how do i get over the inability to speak to strangers?
1957,My mom is sending me to my dad and looking through my texts cuz I'm not eating,She said that she has had enough of me and is sending me to my dad cuz she cant handle me anymore now I'm just sad here playing gta

1959,"My BPD, anxiety and depression is awful and I don't know what to do.","For more context why I feel so bad and my situation with friends, I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hn0br9/cant_get_on_the_same_page_with_emotionally/). Yet to receive any answers, but don't want to coax anyone into helping, it's just disappointing...   


I don't have access to therapy at the moment and I've been feeling awful lately. My friends don't listen or ask how I'm doing really much less talk me through tough times, my cat passed away last week, I'm still not over it, working is a nightmare with this state of mind and overall everything is just shit. 

I wanted to look for online counseling since covid is in the way, even considered BetterHelp but I don't think paying for someone to just chat is worth it. It makes me sad, I have no one to talk to and to be able to I should pay almost 300$ for a whole month... That's just depressing. I'm not suicidal and I'm so proud I don't self harm anymore, but existing didn't become any less empty and pointless, especially with all my friends feeling bad too, and every relationship of mine just declining and everyone keeps closing off more and more. I feel like I'm losing them, especially the one friend I mentioned in another sub, one who was like a sister to me now she blames me for everything and doesn't acknowledge anything wrong on her part. 

I don't see where to go from here..."
1960,Do I sound like a person who might be on the autism spectrum?,"I am a 26 yo female. For a long time I had the feeling that I am not normal, and I think I might be on the spectrum and never diagnosed, but not sure? My parents never had me see a therapist or anything as a child.

Here are some reasons why I think i might be on the spectrum:

* difficulty understanding what others are thinking and feeling
* anxious about social situations
* difficulty making friends/maintaining relationships
(have no friends, people call me weird/ always walking on eggshells)
* seem blunt/rude/uninterested without meaning to
(people have called me arrogant, condescending, because of my tone of voice. I also say things that are rude/inappropriate without thinking/realizing)
* anxious/uncontrollable emotions when my routine changes or things don't go as planned
(ex. shutting down when plans get cancelled, small inconveniences like forgetting to buy rice when I intended on cooking it that day made me shut down and not able to do anything for the rest of the day, hiding under my desk in my office at the end of summer before the new school year begins (impending routine change), etc)
* don't understand social cues/etiquette
(wrong inflections in voice, talking over people, offending others, avoiding eye contact. People often think I am upset)
* sensitive to sounds/smell, notice patterns often. I often can notice sounds and smells that no one around me notices
* need carefully thought out plans ahead of time
* prefer to be alone, anxious with social gatherings
(examples from childhood: hiding in my room every time i had a birthday party, running away from family during gatherings. For example, I ran away once at a family picnic because I didn't want to play with my cousins. Another time I ran away from our house during a thunderstorm because the noise scared me, I was found hours later at the nearby park hiding in the playground area)
* can't control volume in voice (inappropriate volume, I am very loud, and often seem like I am yelling even though to me it feels like my normal voice. I am told often to quiet down in public places by friends/family, and have been told at work that I am too loud)
* very good at music/math, but not good at anything else. (Learned pretty much everything there is to know about piano by age 13, and then started teaching music at my local conservatory of music from age 14. Am now an engineer, my highest skills being math and programming)
* obsessive behaviour (playing the same song on piano repeatedly for hours (sometimes 6 hours at a time, it drives my family crazy), won't sleep or do anything until project/assignment is completed, sometimes not sleeping for days)
* excessive focus on myself (talking about myself too much, been told I always try to ""one-up"" people when being told a story)

I don't think I talk too much or have an obsession about one particular subject though.

I have not really met anyone who I know of that has autism, so I don't really know what it's actually like other than what I've read on google. Maybe this doesn't sound anything like autism? 

Does this sound anything like autism? I just started seeing a therapist because I've been having a lot of breakdowns lately, should I bring this up to her? If this doesn't sound like autism to you, do you have an idea of what it could be?"
1961,"I honestly don't really know, I just need advice","I don't really know how to describe everything, so I'm just gonna start by rambling. I'm an 18 year old (F) and I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety in the past. But I've been noticing lately that things have been getting a little worse for me? Some days, I'll be completely and totally fine. I'll be happy and super super productive at work and wanting to go out with my friends and do fun things and I'll be in the best moods I've ever been in. But sometimes, it's the exact opposite and I want to pull my hair out with how intensely depressed I get. I start having really dark thoughts and sometimes my brain feels like it's racing around and around in circles with these thoughts. I can't sleep sometimes, but sometimes the thought of not sleeping makes me want to scream. I burst out into tears out of nowhere and just have the worst feelings of anxiety, paranoia and deep deep misery. Even just the thought of waking up gives me panic attacks sometimes. But I’ve noticed that there will be periods of time where I feel like I’m on fucking cocaine or something, I just feel so so so so incredibly alive. I'll drive really fast, sticking my head out the window, not caring where my car goes.

I've tried to figure out what's wrong with me on my own, but I know that's stupid. After a lot of research? I started looking into Bipolar 2, and a lot of it sounds exactly like what I’ve been going through. I don’t quite understand the mood swings though, so if someone could explain, I’d really appreciate it. Because I’ll have mood swings throughout the day where I’ll be extremely depressed/tired/unmotivated/suicidal thoughts/staring into the void/unable to move/wanting to be alone/nothing feeling real, to being energized/happy/motivated/adventurous/high spirited, within a span of a couple hours. I’ll be having so so so much fun with my friends and then suddenly its literally like flipping a switch where I’m so irritable and sad and don’t want to be around people in the slightest, no matter how much I love them. And from what I gathered when reading about Bipolar 2, it doesn’t happen that fast? Or maybe it does and I’m misunderstanding something? I don’t want to self diagnose, but I’ve never been to a doctor that has taken me seriously. And I’m really bad at articulating just how I’m feeling when it comes to doctors/friends/literally anyone. 

I’m not looking for a diagnosis here either, I’m just looking for advice. I’d love to hear people’s similar  experiences and maybe hear from someone who has bipolar 2? 

Thanks for everything."

1970,Do you think I have depression?,"Sigh, I’ve been banned from r/depression and r/suicidewatch so I’ll post here. 

I’ve never been diagnosed or checked for it though.

This year I’ve felt much more hopelessness in my life than ever and many days have even thought about killing myself.

But here and there I have days where I feel fine and feel like how could I ever think of doing such  a thing.

I have had hopeless thoughts for about 14 years but some years were better than others. 

I’m just worried if I were to get it checked out that maybe I can’t afford the treatment? Does insurance usually cover diagnosis, meds, and therapy?"

1974,I spent about 8 years of my life in deep dissociative state where my actions did not match my values. I feel terrible.,"I have only lately been able to recover from deep depression and anxiety that plagued my life for many years.

1976,I should have gone to therapy when I was a child,"By doing a therapy exercise I remembered a lot of things from both elementary and high school...

With the memories I felt everything, the shame, the regret, the knowledge that I've always been a lonely and weird person, even when I was a kid...

I'm not surprised that the kid who I used to be grew up and turned into what I am now...

A weird, annoying, inmature and toxic person who'll always lose, who'll always be forgotten and who'll always end up messing everything up, no matter how much I try to avoid it...

Even as a child I was destined to become this..."

1979,I need to go to a therapist (and maybe even a psychiatrist) to treat my anxiety. I just don't know how to tell my parents.,"Hey,

I spoke with another person on this subject and they were the one who is making me decide that I need to do this.

My anxiety used to just be worries about death, but it's progressed more and more. It's anxiety now. Sometimes I'm just chilling and then it's like ""oh s#$t!"" and I feel a wave of anxiety. Then other times, I just feel extremely uneasy and start yawning and shaking. At that point, all I can think about is either death or I can try to redirect my mind to something else, but it never fully goes away because at that state I'm relating everything towards that.

 I need to go and talk to a therapist but my family is religious so I'm not sure how I'm going to do that.

Can anyone help me?"

1982,I Can't Break the Cycle,"I don't know if this is the right place, but atm I have no where else to go. I'm a 25(M), life has been strange for a while. I've been home for 2 years now, in a suburb Long Island neighborhood. Every so often I go through cycles of some kind. Basically right now, and for the past week it's like everything has vanished. I'm floating in the void inside my own head, and as I sit here I can't find the words to explain everything. I'm currently between therapists, I was receiving free therapy from my school that I just graduated from, so I have no one to go to and I can't find anyone to dump this on. The COVID situation is making my job market nonexistent. I'm applying for teacher positions, but everyday I feel like I'm going to have to wait another year and work the job I can't stand, service. That might not sound like a big deal, but I have epilepsy and i take daily medication. In a year (Feb 2021) I am taken off my parents medical insurance, so i NEED a job with medical. Since moving home my social life has taken a nose dive with all my friends moving on with their lives. I had to go back to school for a certification which was a two years program so i threw myself at it with full force (bad undergrad GPA put me immediately on academic probation) and i never bothered making new friends or trying to find a relationship, which is another can of worms. Right before COVID began I was telling myself that this year I was going to change things. I wanted to change, find new people, a partner, a new life I could make my own. The teacher job market looked promising, my grades were stellar, I had lost a great amount of weight and was feeling amazing. Now everything feels like its fallen apart. I can't stand another year at home, I feel stuck here and unable to change. I cant justify moving because I only have like $25,000 saved up and it just doesn't feel like enough to try and start a life with. Even as I write this I feel like I'm complaining about nothing, everyone as issues, I'm no different. I'm struggling to even post this because other people could use the attention and I can just figure this out myself. But when I look in the mirror I just see disappointment. I feel lost and scared and angry and hope feels like its slipping away every day. I just want to break everything and lay in the wreckage, but I know that isn't the way. I dont want pity and at the same time I just want someone to sit down with and tell me it's okay and the fear and anxiety and self loathing is only temporary. I want direction, but at the same time I want to find the path myself. I want to hit something and defend myself, but I also just want to world to cave in and end this horrible feeling I feel in my head and chest. I feel like I've hit a dead end and I can scale the wall to freedom or accept it's over. But it's not over, my life has only begun. 

TLDR: Please help, I need all sorts of life advice. Finding friends, starting a relationship, finding a job, building confidence, blocking out the self doubt, dealing with all kinds of rejection, and finding the brightside in things. Because I just want to be happy and break this cycle of feeling just too shitty to go on."
1983,Feeling really low and suicidal,"Just mentioning beforehand that I have thoughts of suicide, just saw a bridge on the way home and was thinking about something random like how big the sign was so close up (I was in a car) and then my mind just immediately switched to wanting to jump. But I have no plans of killing myself as of right now, I just need some words of encouragement so that I don't go any lower. 

To start off, I have anxiety and depression and have been diagnosed for about 4 months. I started taking Abilify about a month ago, and the first week of 2 mg I felt great, and then it stopped working after a week. The doctor increased to 5 mg, which worked great again but now I can feel the same thing happening and just not working anymore. 

I am currently a pharmacy student and on rotations for 3 weeks. For those who don't know, basically we go to a pharmacy in different settings, hospital for me, and just shadow, learn the job, stuff like that. I'm about halfway into it and I just don't want to do it anymore. This, school, just everything. I made so many mistakes that are probably no big deal but anxiety makes it so much worse. Pharmacists are the last check before a medication goes out to a patient. With anxiety, I doubt my decisions every time and just paranoid that I did something wrong. I don't know what I want to do when I graduate and I have a really bad knee and ankle from a sprain few years ago so I don't know how long my body will hold out in retail (that's where I work at now). 

I don't have my psychiatrist appointment until next week, my counseling appointment isn't until Friday  (and he's pretty bad about checking and responding to emails so I don't want to bother him) and I don't want to bother my friend with my problems. I thought about suicide hotline but honestly I didn't find it very personable. I need some support to get the courage to get through...this thought? Day? rest of the week? I just need some encouragement"
1984,Pondering over things,"I always moved ahead in my life by asking one question- ""what is worst that can happen"".  When I was a healthy, content person, my answer used to be "" worst case scenario I might die!!"". Now when I ask myself the same question, I can only think about my parents being sad. There is nothing else that holding me here... I can't even decide if it is good that I have people who care about me, or is it bad that I can't care about me anymore???"
1985,Really just... confused about my mental health and how I (23F) should heal.,"I started seeing a therapist in December, who prescribed me Trintellix for depression. While I initially felt better, I've now come to the conclusion that that was more or less a placebo. I've never felt more depressed in my life.

Sometimes talking to my therapist makes me feel worse. She's not a bad person or anything, I just don't connect with her. And I really don't like this medication; it feels like there is a live wire running through my brain about to snap at any moment.

I've been having mild self harming thoughts for the past two months or so, but today was the first day that I experienced some serious suicidal thoughts. I'm not sure who to talk to about this. I like my therapist fine, and I do have a lot of friends... but I hate feeling like a burden to them. 

I know I won't act on these suicidal thoughts. I could never hurt my mother in that way. But it's so concerning that they happened nonetheless.

Basically my mental health is trash and I'm literally doing everything someone can do. Aside from therapy and medication, I work out consistently, eat well, sleep well, avoid too much alcohol, go outside... I have hobbies, but lately it's like pulling teeth to force my interest. I'm also at a prestigious grad school, but it's been so hard to keep my focus on my studies....

Help?"
1986,I have decided I need help but I cant,"I really think I am in a troubled time right now, and I think what I really need is help. But all the phone call helplines feel so daunting, especially talking to someone late at night.

1988,"Dopamine Detox/Fasting, does it actually have an effect?","I was scrolling through my Youtube recommended today and I stumbled upon this video ([How I Tricked My Brain To Like Doing Hard Things (dopamine detox)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk)). I was interested in it, so I watched it at 1.25x speed.

In essence, the video talks about how high quantities of dopamine desensitises you to low quantities of dopamine, making it harder to motivate yourself to do more productive things, like studying or learning things rather than gaming or scrolling through social media.

I started to look through the comments where I found this:

&gt; ""Dopamine Detox"" and fasting are not scientifically backed in any way. Dopamine isn't just about happiness or pleasure. It has a lot of more complex functions for our brain as well. It's involved in a lot. Breaks from technology and drugs are always good for moderation and tolerance, but this isn't some fix for productivity or happiness. 

... so I started to do some research on it.

I found a bunch of articles providing somewhat conflicting information, where some say that it works, others saying that it doesn't work at all, then a couple stating that there is some science behind it, but it generally doesn't have as great of an effect as people promoting it make it out to have.

Does anyone have any experience with ""Dopamine Detoxes""? 

Would they actually make a difference in motivation?

Are there any better methods available for increasing motivation to work?"

1991,Drunk or sleep walking feeling with depression,"Does anyone else with depression or on anti-depressants feel like they're sleepwalking or drunk sometimes?

Whenever someone praises me for anything my first thought is that I’ve tricked them into thinking this way and that it’s not actually real. It’s something I’ve done as long as I can remember with things like good grades at school when I was younger and now I (20f) am just learning to drive and I’m putting off getting more driving lessons because even though others tell me I’m good at driving my brain is telling me that I’ve tricked them into thinking this and that I’m a really bad driver who would never be able to pass a test and it’s become a really overwhelming thought. I don’t know if this is normal or not but if it is I’ll delete this from the subreddit."

1996,Help!,"Hello.

I am someone who has never had any history of any issues like this but I think the sooner the better.

I just went through a major family...thingy, and that was when I noticed a change. I started feeling depressed especially with school work piling and life everyday has felt like I was running and there was this really huge thing chasing me. Not sure what that thing is, but I don't even want to touch it.

Now, due to those circumstances, I have to go to my sister's place and I feel like I have no choice. I don't hate it there, I just want to stay where I am, not even sure if I am making sense, but if I said I wanted to stay back or if I talked about how I was feeling, they would chastise me for complaining about ""all the things I have"" or guilt trip me and I will feel even more depressed. They never even involve me, it is always about how they can make themselves more comfortable and never about how I feel comfortable.

Now I feel caged, I have been unstable and I feel like crying because it's not their fault. I could not even concentrate on school with this amount of uncertainty and all I want to do is sleep so that I don't have to think about all these things. I mean, when I tried to hold a pen, my hand started shaking and I wasted my whole day today again. I just want all this to end.



Maybe all this is in my head please, anyone that can help and advice on this matter I would appreciate it. Please."
1997,Opinions about writing characters with mental disorders,"Hello everyone :)
I'm sharing this here because I'd like honest opinions from people that are dealing with mental health issues themselves and are a part of this community. I really hope I'm not intruding your space by asking this question, if that is the case I will delete this post immediately, I just dont know any other way I could ask people about this.
Truth be told I am an aspiring comic book/visual novel artist and I would love writing a story about specific mental disorders and mental health issues in general. Now I do have some anxiety issues but I definitely dont have all of the disorders I'd like to feature. 
And now I'd like to ask if you think it is my place to write a story like this or if I shouldn't because I dont have first hand experience?
Now let me clarify something first. The idea to do this came from me having an interest in psychology and while researching started to learn all the stigma and misinformation that media has led us to believe about mental disorders and realizing that there is not one good character people with these disorders could relate to. So I thought hey, maybe I could?
But of course if I really were to write this I'd put my heart and soul into the research that goes into this to absolutely make sure I can portray these disorders as best as I can. I will just never know completely what it's like. And even though I have the best intentions, I can imagine if by this point having any media covering these issues could be problematic for the community already.
So if you took your time and read through this whole thing and have an opinion, then I'd really appreciate it if you could share it with me in the comment or through dms.
I hope you all have a nice day :)"

2000,Chronic self-doubt,"Hello all.   


I've never posted here, and even this post is a bit of self-therapy just to get my thoughts out there, hopefully I'm posting in the right place.

I wanted to ask anyone who has lived long periods of their life with self-doubt, how you ""fixed"" it. I have always known I do not give myself enough credit, but it has come full circle and I can't run from it anymore, not without ruining a life-defining opportunity I've been given. I've worked for the past 8 years of my life building my career, and it occurred to me today that I do not digest criticism and adapt well when the criticism relates to a core attribute of mine. I am convinced this is because I assume that nothing I've done so far in my life has given me a reason to believe in myself.  


Sure, I've made good decisions that have made my life easy, but I believe this to be entirely luck/opportunity - based. My friends and family, my privilege, the opportunities I've been given, that stuff isn't given to everyone, and my baseline belief is that I'm not a person that could be anywhere close to where I am now without it.

So the problem is that I'm faced with a situation where I must fix this and perform at the level my career requires ( I can't fake confidence at all, and its obvious when I interact with people I feel this way about myself ). If I do not, all the support/love/opportunity my friends and family have given will be wasted, and I will have squandered not only time and money, but I'll have disappointed everyone.

This ties into the fact that my motivation is driven entirely by being valuable to other people, which feels like a big problem. Why can't I live for myself? I feel very lost. I'm approaching 30 and it feels like I've believed this for so long that I don't know how to break out of it.  


TLDR - If any of you have had similar problems living for yourself, what did you do to fix it? I don't have any insurance/money to go to therapy and I assume that's probably what I should do.

Thank you anyone who read all that, it means a lot"
