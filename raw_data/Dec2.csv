0,"I made an animated summary of ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck"". I hope this is useful to you.","Link to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOImyOGN9UE

I've made over 80 summaries of the best self improvement books, here’s a full playlist of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOImyOGN9UE&amp;list=PLaNTB6oQAa0AYuul0tqUscg1ZLj_arZga

I release a new video every other day, if you’re interested in subscribing here’s a link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfbLDMh6uGOZePAfqqjVZ-g?sub_confirmation=1

If you’d prefer to read the script instead of watching the video, here it is:

In this video I’m going to teach you the best lessons from the book the subtle art of not giving a fuck by Mark Manson. I’ll show you how to become more confident, how to have more purpose in your life plus you’ll learn the quickest route to happiness. 

But before we get into all that I want you to imagine something.

Imagine you’re 90 years old and on your deathbed, your grandson walks in, he’s 21 and asks for your advice about what he should do with his life, what he should care about and what doesn’t really matter in the end. What would you tell him?

You might say things like: 

“Go for your dreams you only get one life.”

“Don’t worry as much”

“Enjoy the small things”

If you take some time to think and decide what you would say this gives you a real insight into what you actually care about. Take your own advice.

In this video we will go through 5 lessons to help you feel more confident. This example leads onto the first lesson from the book.

1. We all die anyway.

Most people do not like thinking about their own death but I think it is a useful thing to do. 

Another great book is The 7 habits of highly effective people and one of the habits is to begin with the end in mind. Think about your own death and it really puts things into perspective. 

One day all the things that you worry about will no longer exist, nobody alive will care so why are you letting it bother you now? Why are you letting it hold you back?

If you have a hard decision to make just ask yourself how you’d feel on your deathbed about each of the choices, would you regret not going for the more exciting choice? 

Mark Twain said: “a man who lives fully is prepared to die at anytime.”

So use the thought of your own death to drive you forward. Don't put things off and to stay at a job you hate or in a relationship that is bad for you. 

2. It’s not about not giving a fuck, it’s about choosing what to give a fuck about.

The author says maturity is giving a fuck about things that are fuckworthy.

Most people are afraid of rejection, for our survival we naturally want to fit in. 

So in any situation we try to avoid all pain of rejection or someone saying we are wrong, the thing is you will never avoid all pain of rejection. 

What you should do is decide what pain you actually want to go through choose what you want to suffer for.

Before starting this youtube channel I thought about the fact that people might mock me 

but for me the pain of someone laughing at me is miniscule compared to the pain of regret I would have felt if I never went for it.

I would have always been thinking what if. 

I am so passionate about helping others that being mocked for doing what I do doesn’t bother me at all.

so, Give a fuck about things that are fuckworthy.

3. Failure and criticisms are good.

Imagine a sales firm.

Their aim is to make a many sales a possible. 

If you said to all the staff that rather than aiming to get as many sales as possible they should instead aim to get the most rejections. This is a concept called go for no where you aim for noes rather than yeses.

What happens is the person who gets the most number of noes is nearly always the person who also gets the most amount of sales. 

This is because they are no longer limited by their fear of rejection.

Thomas J. Watson who served as chairman and CEO of IBM said “If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate”

Stop trying to avoid criticisms and failures. You will always have people who want to be negative about what you’re doing. That’s actually great, it means you’re putting yourself out there.

Remember people usually only criticize people who they feel are above them, they think by doing so they will be able will bring you down to their level.

I think of the people who I look up to and ask myself if they would criticize or mock me for doing what I am doing and obviously they wouldn’t. They are more than likely say what I’m doing is great and encourage me to keep going.

An opinion is the cheapest thing anyone can give you, the value comes in deciding who’s opinion you’re going to listen to.

so, go for no’s and be grateful for each one, they are helping you towards the result you want and show you’re putting yourself out there.

4. Happiness and confidence comes from caring about something greater than yourself. 

Here’s a great lyric by the rapper Mack-le-more which is based on a Banksy quote 

“I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave and the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name. So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave, did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?” 

What is he on about then? 

He’s saying that you will only be remembered if you do something great with your life. By doing something great for humanity you will be immortal because people will talk about you well after your death. 

So a quick question, are you living your purpose? It’s a difficult question to answer but a great one to think about. 

As we said before we all die anyway, the only people who actually get remember are the people who did something that was bigger than themselves. 

It’s pretty overwhelming to think about your life purpose but a great place to start is to begin on a small scale helping people.

Just do something for someone else.

It can be something simple like baking a cake or taking them out somewhere or even just paying them a genuine compliment

Search a website called one kindness .org. They explain the power of doing just one act of kindness per day - it’s an interesting read.

On a bigger scale you can use your life to build something huge to help others and make a change. 

Bill Gates said “Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” 

Start thinking bigger, think outside yourself. 

One of my life aims is to completely change the education system so it will teach people more about happiness.

I’m not sure exactly how I will do this yet but that is why it’s such a fun aim to have. Aim huge. 

If you’re not sure where to begin search round my channel or other self improvement channels and begin working towards something you’re truly proud of. 

If you’re working towards something for other people you almost don’t have time to worry. 

When you do this you will become much happier because true happiness comes from helping others.

A great side effect of this is that you will feel much more confident, when you have a true purpose you’re working towards you won’t be stopped by small things anymore. A great quote from the book man’s search for meaning says “Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.” 

So if your why  is to change the world you aren’t going to stopped by someone mocking you because changing the world is simply way more important.

so, work towards something bigger than yourself and you will be much happier and feel more confident.

Lesson 5. You choose who is in your life.

When I was a school I really did care about fitting in and trying to impress pretty much everyone. I always looked outside myself for approval and confirmation that I was good enough. 

What a load of bullshit. It’s funny to me that almost all the people who I was so bothered about impressing are actually no longer part of my life, I don’t ever see or talk to them.

It’s easy to forget how much control you actually have over your life. 

You have full control over people who play a role in your life. 

So be who you want to be and the people who truly like you will stick around and anyone else you can just choose not to see them. 

There’s nothing wrong with people not liking you, stop getting caught up on what everyone thinks about you. The more important thing to think about is what the people you actually like think about you and what you think about yourself.

Here’s a good question.

“From your perspective what is the difference between someone who you no longer see anymore and someone who is dead?” 

Odd question but bear with me.

Each has no input on your life and you have 0 interactions. 

IT’s a pretty odd way of looking at it but you basically have the power to kill off characters you do not like in your life. 

so, rethink the way you see your world, be confident and be yourself because the only people that will be in your life long term are the people who like you anyway.

So to summarize: 

1. We all die anyway so go for it.

2. Give a fuck about things that are fuckworthy.

3. Failure and criticisms are good things, aim for them.

4. work towards something bigger than yourself and you will be much happier and feel more confident.

5. You choose who is in your life, be yourself, the people who don’t like you wont be part of your life anyway.

1,"I started self harming again, but I am too afraid to tell anyone","Hey all.

I am a \[M,17\] and I recently started self harm again, after stopping for over two months. I just couldn't deal with my suffering anymore. My wrist is completely bruised.

I want to do something about it ASAP, before it gets out of hand, and I go completely nuts (again), but I have so many uncertainties:

I haven't told anyone, so nobody knows about it, and there is a reason. My friends have heard of me the past 6 months, and I am so afraid they will drop me, if I tell them I started again or get tired of me.

There is a girl I like, and she seems interested in me as well. She knows my story, and what I deal with, but I haven't told her either. I am afraid she will lose interest in me, see me as weak and/or crazy.

I want to tell them how I exactly feel and how awful I am actually doing mentally, but I am simply too afraid.."
2,suicide,"is it okay that i want to end my life, but i’m scared of the idea of death? i wish i could end everything but i’m scared of what comes after. it troubles me, but it’s what’s keeping me here i suppose."
3,How to stop dissociating zoning out,"Ive spent 90% of my days zoned out. I have bad memory cus of this. I have a good friend, a bf and a brother that watches my back. I don't have a typical 9-5 life,  i work a different job every week so im not bored. My anxiousness to be financially secure is never gone. No matter how much i do i feel unaccomplished therefore no mental peace."
4,"Art,,","Art is the only thing that is even a little meaningful right now

Share your favourite poems? Or paintings or movies, whatever. Preferably about mental health, or other related issues, but anything you've seen that resonated with you.

My favourites are bluebird, suicide kid, alone with everybody, all by Charles Bukowski. Alone by Edgar Allan Poe, and lots of Tove Ditlevsen, and a variety of paintings :)"
5,Can I get some input on this?,
6,Breathe In You (63),"We All have things that make us nervous because they are different, ""weird"", ""unusual""........breaks the status quo, thats where our Happiness Is. It takes time, everything does. We must continue to go Inside and focus on what makes us feel ALIVE, the Universe will Guide Us, God will Guide Us.

  
Growing Up in the suburbs outside of a major city, it always made me feel so curious about life in the big city, the city of dreams, the city where something from nothing can come to life, with hard work, dedication, patience, community and self love. Up until 2 and a half years ago I didn't know what I wanted to do, rather I never really thought of my life ahead, only living in the present moment. Going to school an hour the other way from my hometown to a rather big town but small as well, it gave me the sense of freedom I needed, freedom for myself, freedom on my own, to BE. Those 3 years I learned everything I needed to learn about myself to then come back and **GET TO WORK.** Those years at school were filled with fun, new experiences, ups and downs, stress, anxiety, seclusion, inclusion, self awareness, allowing my self to be, as I said. I am so grateful for those 3 years of my life.

  
Now the Sun Shines Outside on this crisp December day that we are all living. Its amazing to  think that today is December 14, wow; What a year. It feels like I was just celebrating the new year with my family just yesterday and now, here we are, in a totally different time that we have been given. I am aware that this time for our world has been difficult, with lots of hardships, pain, anxiety, sadness and dwelling but we have to push on. WE must, I know we can, I just **KNOW IT.** 

  
Life is filled with many unexpected moments, moments that change our lives forever but thats how our lives were always going to be. This was always apart of our plan and our destiny, so we must use it to the best of our ability, to once again, change our lives forever. I Believe in Us, I Believe in You. We Can do it. Keep Working Hard &amp; Do Your Best. Give yourself the time and space needed to relax and have fun when needed but know that the best comes from the hardest times with HARD WORK. Get to it.

  
I love you.

7,Does anyone know of any mental issues that cause hallucinations that might be stopped by marijuana?,"I hallucinate (visual, smell and touch sensations)occasionally, not due to sleep deprivation or dehydration - I've tried, but not if i smoke marijuana."
8,Insomnia help?,"I’m a 16yo guy and I haven’t been able to sleep at a normal or healthy time for as long as I can remember. When I was around 13 it got really bad- pulling all-nighters 2/3 times a week and not being able to maintain a regular sleeping pattern. 
I have tried all of the usual methods; sleep hygiene, relaxing music, exercise, herbal tea, herbal medicines etc etc. You name I have tried it all, but I just can’t seem to get a good night of deep sleep and 7+ hours for more then 1 day in a row, before reverting back to insomnia.
I currently have some family issues going on, which has been the case for a few years now, which you could say triggers some stress and anxiety. But I’m unsure if this is the main cause. However, now it is my exam year and I really can’t afford to be running on no sleep consistently and maintain my grades. 
I have spoken to adults about this in the past, but nothing was ever resolved. 
I honestly don’t know what to do with myself anymore. Any advice?"
9,Lost my virginity and I’m traumatised,"TW: sex, suicide 

After multiple failed relationships and situationships I decided that I didn’t want to lose my virginity to anyone I was emotionally attached to.(I’m 21F) BAD IDEA.

I reconnected with a boy from highschool over a dating app and we hit it off and things started out really well. We hooked up once but didn’t go all the way and this is when I told him I was a virgin. He was a little bit dominant- eg instructing me on how to kiss but because he was so nice I didn’t think much of it. He was so sweet and understanding about everything, telling me to make sure I’m 100% ok with it. 

Then he turned our hangouts into 3am booty calls- all of which I would decline. However I was so insecure about walking out a virgin that one night I called him. He delayed till 3am but I still went for it. He was really drunk.

The moment he had me in his room he started being mean to me. Taking everything I said in the wrong way and getting angry at me for little things. But I still hooked up with him. I should’ve called it a night but I was so hell bent on losing my virginity I crossed every boundary I had, and disrespected myself.

He was really mean and dominating during sex. He kept telling me to calm down when I showed that I was enjoying it or getting passionate. Criticising the way I kiss and demanding I either use my tongue or don’t use it too much- even though I’ve been complimented on this before or never had a complaint from any other guy. Lecturing me on how to make out. I’m so receptive and gentle with my kissing I don’t know what he was wanting. Is there a universal way to kiss or something? I felt stupid and insecure about it.

Then I asked him to go down on me because I needed that to loosen myself up to be able to take him and he refused. He said he only did that to partners. This whole time I had been going down on him. It felt so unfair that he didn’t tell me this beforehand. 

Then he changed his tone to very sweet and very softly asked if I “wanted him to fuck me” and if I’m sure. I said yes both times. I feel so bad that I did that to myself. Why didn’t I walk out? Why didn’t I say no? 

First of all it hurt really badly. He was receptive to my pain but he kept putting me in different positions and trying. It was the most dehumanising experience ever. I felt like I was just a body that he was using. No intimacy- nothing. Just him pushing it into me as much as he could until I would tell him to stop. And he did- it wasn’t rape I’m not going to make a false accusation or anything. I tried to enjoy it but it was such a bad experience it felt like I left my body. Like I had no control- maybe somewhere deep down I wanted to stop but I couldn’t because it would be a bad thing to back out. I was trying to enjoy it but he had torn me down to the point where I was defeated to just laying there and letting anything happen.

Then he came. And lay there smoking as I got up, got dressed and left. Then I had to go to work in an hour. 

This experience has traumatised me. I’m more suicidal that I already was. I’m more suicidal thank I already was. I breakdown at random points in the day. I already had OCD and my compulsions now consist of rethinking and reliving this memory, constantly seeking assurance as to why I wasn’t good enough for him to start criticising things.

Feeling worthless because of this. My mind tends to fixate on one thought and I come to the same conclusion- that I’m worthless because I wasn’t good enough to make him feel good. For example: That I will never be pretty, or worthy, or attractive because I’m not good enough for him. I’m insecure about myself in so many ways. 

I feel so bad for the girl that I was before this. I want to give her a hug and save her from this happening to her. She was so innocent she had no idea what was coming for her.

I don’t know how to heal."
10,My brother almost killed our parents and is now being let out of a psychiatric facility a week later with no apparent improvements,"I really need help, I worry my brother (27 yrs) is in a mental state where I fear his delusions will end up killing someone. He lives with my parents and I worry about their safety.

My brother is a very stubborn and antisocial person, and has been that way for over 7 years. He has recently developed delusions that a group or people are out to kill him. A week ago, he fired rifle shots at my parents sedan as they came home from grocery shopping, mistaking them for the people that he believes are out to get him. Nobody was hurt but my parents were left traumatize. My bother apologized but is now brushing it off as “nobody got hurt though”.

He was checked into a mental hospital and he has been diagnosed with a thought disorder. He still insist that the non existing people are out to get him and that nothing is wrong with him. Today they told us he will be released this Friday, even after we told them he still insist on his delusion being real. The doctors are telling us he will need to continue his medication the rest of his life.

My parents are terrified of him but they feel that if they let him out on the streets, he will hurt someone. They plan on maybe forcing him to stay home and forcing him to continue his medicine and therapy. I have never known my brother to agree on getting help and I doubt he will change. 

I am not entirely informed on his medication but I fear he has convinced the doctors that he’s ok. If the hospital fails to treat him and he does not take his medication, what will be our options? What can I do to help him? Does anyone have any similar experiences with this? Any help is much appreciated.

We live in United States, TX"
11,my friend is leaving,my best friend is going across 10 states to attend college and i cannot cope. it feels like a huge part of me is dying and things will never be the same. i’m afraid she’s going to forget me amongst all the amazing people she’s going to meet and experiences she’ll have. she never let anything stop her from achieving her dreams. i’m the complete opposite. i made excuses and let my laziness get the better of me and now i’m stuck in this shitty town.
12,im tired,"tw// mention of suicide and self harm

I cut myself today.

Im not proud of it, it kind of just happened. Im no stranger to self harm (hair pulling, starving, etc). I haven't felt any emotions in weeks, it might be the new meds or it might be me either way nothing is going to change. I feel hopeless. I just want to run away but everything is too cold and I dont have any money. my family stresses me out, my brother is only going to grow stronger, my mother more angry. I just want to see him (Aidan, if your out there just know I f\*kn love you). being trans is hard, especially if ill always be a girl to them, im not even sure if anything is real. &lt;3"
13,Will this ever pass?,"I've been through so many med changes it's ridiculous, for years I've been fighting my depression and dellusions/hallucinations and they just keep at me. Especially the depression. I hate the idea of another med change because what I'm on now helps my hallucinations but not so much the depression, I'm on a routine and everything and just, nothing helps. I honestly feel like I'm about to land myself in the psych ward again because I'm about to break down emotionally if I keep feeling so empty. Nothing is interesting to me right now as much as I try and enrich myself with video games or shows or writing or art or anything I enjoy the good feelings just don't come. I'm so, so tired of feeling so empty."
14,Ugh. I’m so tired.,I just feel like crying so much. At first I thought my boyfriend found out all the Christmas gifts I got him (due to sharing Amazon Prime) and I screamed for 5 minutes straight and was just weeping and weeping. I’ve never reacted that way to any situation in my life. I just feel like gift giving is my one confident way in showing my love for people and just feeling like that was taken away just drove me absolutely insane. (I found out afterwards that he only knew about one gift which is good) I just wanted to prove to him how much I love him because I have a feeling that he thinks I don’t love him since I’m honestly a simple person and I’m not the best at showing love. I just feel so sad right now and I feel humiliated at myself that I allowed myself to scream like that. Whatever I guess...
15,how am i supposed to focus on any online school stuff????,"im trying im really really trying to focus on online school stuff but its hard. I've been trying to read this vox article for school but I cant get past the first couple of sentences. I'm really freaking out bc I have a meeting with debate group people in thirty minutes to talk about the debate and I have no notes. i want to be school I really fucking do but I cant. I've tried meditation and cleaning my desk and fidget and drinking water and not drinking coffee and eating the right food and exercising and putting articles from text to speech things but I cant focus. i don't know what to do. its junior year. I'm not going to be able to go to college. i don't know what to do. i suck at note taking. I'm crying over not being able to read a fucking article right now. what do I do? (I've posted this in r/advice too but idc, my theraist isn't responding to me)"
16,Always feel like something bad is going to happen ?,"Basically i always feel like something terrible is going to happen such as losing complete consciousness, control of my mind/ going insane. I’m particulary afraid of being in that state of mind forver, even after death.

i’m always thinking of how to prepare myself for it. Sometimes i get super anxious about it and actually start to experience some of those symptoms. i start panicking and slowly start to not think straight also i start to lose my memory and my vision goes weird and my head goes all numb. it’s like i’m losing myself. 

i’m really bad at explaining stuff but i don’t know how to deal with it. even when i convince myself that i don’t care about it something triggers me and i fall right back into that terrified place. I’m diagnosed with OCD and bpd but unmedicated. 

I’m 16, and i don’t know how to tell my parents as i feel like they won’t understand, or think i’m doing it for attention etc. They already think i’m unstable as it is and i am afraid of them seeing me as an insane person."
17,I've been thinking I might have depression. I'm not getting responses.,
18,Struggling to find meaning/ self worth,"I recently graduated and a lot of family issues have popped up. There have been a lot of great moments that have popped up since graduating, but its mostly sucked. My job isn’t bad but who makes it shitty every day is my creepy coworker. But he has seniority in the job and I don’t see him being fired. Outside of working, though, I have no life. Before I got really sick I was seeing a guy but I messed it up and I feel too embarrassed to reach back out. Since I did get really sick recently I have to stay in my apartment 24/7 that I share with my brother who is very emotionally and physically abusive, but I wouldn’t be able to afford an apartment by myself and I have very little friends I would consider reliable enough to move in with. It feels like everything is stacked up against me right now and it really sucks. I’ve never been a crier but a lot of what I have been doing recently besides sleeping and cleaning is crying. I suppose this is the harsh reality of real adulthood and independence. The worst part is that I had a very rosy idea of what existence would be like after graduation, going back to school and jumping straight into my career. Moving in with the guy I was seeing."
19,What’s the difference between feeling stressed and feeling burnt out?,"I’m feeling on of these things and I’m trying to figure out which one it is. 

I put a lot of time into projects because I want to be extremely prepared and want to plan for any worse case scenarios. I’m somewhat of a perfectionist and tend to be hard on myself. I also really suck at taking breaks. The other day I forced myself to take two days off and just felt worse than before.

I need to identify what it is so I can do something about it and feel like it’s stress or burnout. Does anyone else know?"
20,"BPD, attention seeking, creating chaos, make it stop!","I have a major issue with attention seeking from men. It started a few years ago and I know it derives from my lack of self worth. I keep splitting personalities and going back to acting like a slut. Starting an OnlyFans, posting things on a secret Reddit account, and not telling my fiancée the whole truth about it. 

He’s convinced this is who I am and I will never change. I don’t know how to explain to him that I just want the acceptance and validation. I don’t want to meet any of these guys, I don’t want anyone else other than him. I put my worth in the approval of random people on the internet and it’s so unhealthy.

Advice on how to fix this? How to explain that I can change I just need some help? I want a family. I want a happy marriage and I want children. I can’t keep splitting and acting like this.

I explained it’s almost like a drug to me. I get a dopamine hit from the likes and follows and comments. And when I start to get a small hit I go overboard and have numerous social accounts to solicit different men to tell me how beautiful they think I am but I don’t want to talk to them with small talk, never want to meet them, just want the compliments. 

What is wrong with me? Why do I keep destroying my relationships by needing attention? I have to stop or I will completely destroy my entire life. I’m going to really push him away one of these days and he’s all I have."
21,I miss it,"I miss being a kid, I miss going to my grandma’s house on Wednesdays, I miss watching Tom and Jerry with my grandpa on the couch, I miss my frog lunch box from pre-school, I miss swimming in the pool and having a picnic with my mom in summer with no worries."
22,Spending Christmas alone,"So I'm late 20's living in the GTA, Ontario. My family is from northern Ontario. I moved up here for school several years ago and fell in love with living close to the city so I never went back. It does make visiting family pretty difficult especially during the holidays but normally I've been fine. In school I would just fly up for the holidays and stay a week or two (it was pretty much my xmas present since flights are very expensive) 

Now that I'm working it's much harder and I have a much shorter time over the holidays off. Last year I just decided to stay with my partner's family which was okay. A little awkward and stressful and I missed my family terribly.

Now it's 2020 were admist a global pandemic and I live in a redzone close to one of the areas in a lockdown. A few months ago I found out my mom has breast cancer and is going through chemo. Since I live where I live the doctors have told us I'm not allowed to see her as we can't take the risk. Okay it sucks but I'll do what I can from here call and send gifts/support. 

Now last week everyone in my partner's home starts getting sick. His mom takes a test for covid and it's positive. Fucking great. I haven't seen my partner in a week as I knew he was getting sick and didn't want to risk getting sick myself. Fortunately I feel fine but I still need to get tested as I have roommates and can't risk their health. I've been trying to isolate in my room and wear a mask if I do need to use the kitchen until I can get tested (not sure why but tests are incredibly hard to book) I'm going stir crazy and sore from staying sitting in my room in the newsrooms

On top of all of this my partner's family has to quarantine for two weeks now. This means that since I'm not sick I'll be spending Christmas completely alone.

This year has been bad, it's been bad for everyone. I'm honestly fucking done but still need to figure out how I'm going to get through the next few weeks alone till my partner is better."
23,Lost &amp; Alone,"I’ve been dealing with my depression For almost 10 years now. No medication. My parents didn’t know till probably last year &amp; still don’t really acknowledge it. They don’t go through many mental problems themselves though so they don’t really get it anyways. It blows my mind how strong minded they are. My girl always tells me to go to her, but I absolutely hate sounding like a broken record, and putting my bullshit on others. Especially to the girl I love. I don’t have many friends anymore basically cause people can be on bullshit, or fake, so why would we vent to people like that? &amp; with my actual friends, it’s not just this usual topic we discuss or like with my girl I refuse to put my problems/ranting on them. I basically just fight it most days of the week. This year has obviously been rough for a lot of people including myself. I also hate venting or ranting cause I feel like there are much worse problems out there instead of mine or what’s going on with myself. Been out of work for a while now, but don’t stop looking cause I want to find something that can get me on my feet again &amp; I can hopefully even start looking into medication. I am a little hesitant about meds cause I don’t want to just feel like a zombie more than I already do. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone simply cause they can’t relate or won’t understand. I’ve tried discussing it with some people, but you can tell they don’t understand how my head works and how it is on a daily basis. Or some people have given me looks like I’m basically not even human so more reasons why I don’t like to. I self harm by starving myself cause I put it in my head that I don’t deserve a meal. That only happens when it gets really bad though which lately it has.. I can encourage people to keep going, &amp; keep their heads up for days, but once it comes to myself I could give a damn. I’m not looking for sympathy from anyone. Just wanted to get some things off my chest. In these shitty times, I hope anyone else going through a struggle can get through it, &amp; hope I can get through it myself. I could go on, but these are just some main things. Like the title says, I just feel very lost &amp; alone."
24,Anxiety and Motivation,"How do you find motivation? I have really bad anxiety and been prescribed lexapro(haven’t taken it due to very “vivid dreams.”). I find myself lacking motivation and my brain seems to be foggy. I can think clearly, but I feel I’m in a fog and can only think in the moment. I’m sorry it’s really hard to explain."
25,If you're experiencing a crazy wave of stress and/or anxiety learning how to Center is a tremendous tool. Here are 5 steps I've outlined.,"I call it Centering because we take a mental and sensory inventory of our current environment and Centering ourselves within that precise moment.

Step 1 - Safety: Get yourself to a safe place of comfort and security.

Step 2 - Breathwork: Begin focusing on breath, walking yourself through a breathing exercise while counting, (5 seconds inhale, hold 5 seconds, exhale 5, hold 5 - then repeat). Try and breathe with your diaphragm and take an account of the movement of air going in and out of your lungs and watching your belly ebb.

Step 3 - Sensory Inventory: While doing this, try and perceive your immediate surroundings in as much detail as possible. Think of it this way, you will have five/ten minutes to try and remember as much detail as you can of your current place, (car, bedroom, bathroom, office, outside (which is the best))

\-Try to visually see everything as much as possible, what are the tones of the colors, the depth of detail in a texture, the shape of everything, the devil in the detail if you will.

\-Sense or physically feel everything too, the breath fluting in and out of your nostrils, is it warm or cold, is there a breeze, or some sun warming your shoulders, or an energy in the room?

\-Any smells or aromas, the sea, a forest, a lingering candle scent, food, a pet, dirty clothing - it doesn't matter what it is, good or bad, you're merely taking an account of it like doing inventory. You don't care what you're counting, you're just counting.

\-Hearing, this is my personal favorite. Find and listen to, attend Everything. Bird song, critters outside, the washer/dryer, people's chatter in the distant or muffled convo beyond a wall, a pet breathing, the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, traffic. Like sonar, take your attention to each sound as it resonates with you.

\-Taste won't usually be too helpful here so concentrate on the other senses.

Step 4 - Mantra: Mentally or out loud repeat a mantra or prayer which resonates with you. Repeat this as you continue with the previous steps, replacing the counting with a mantra. I like;

""I am safe, secure, and loved."" or ""My breath is steady, my mind is clear and settled, my body is calm, my heart is pure, I am tranquil, safe, and loved.""

Step 5 - Memory Recall or Visualization: Recall a special memory of yours, one in which you felt safe, loved and had fun or it. Try recalling all the exacting detail as well as you're able; where you were, who if anyone you were with, how you felt (this is vital), the scenery or environment, etc. Some of us cannot do this however because the anxiety is too much, so I lean on a visualization technique instead. I recommend speaking out loud here as it will help your mind step away from the dreadful thoughts as it's tasked with speaking out loud. Paint the most perfect place to be, beachside villa or stroll or a forest sanctuary is great too. Walk yourself through the experience; the palms or pines and how they sway, barefoot walking on warm sand or cool earth, the forest canopy and the sun breaking through it and warming you, or big puffy white clouds sailing over the ocean, the sound of a stream or the ocean tide, the smell of sea water of the fresh air of the forest, etc. Paint out this place but as you do sprinkle statements such as, ""I feel so safe and loved here,"" or ""This place is my sanctuary, I feel free and my mind and body is serene,"" or ""I am loved, and I am love.""

Hope this helps, I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and the most torturous state of grief after the passing of my wife in 2014 but through a choice to live in a different way and do whatever was necessary to end my suffering. I was able to rise above it and now live a life of abundance, peace, manifestation, and love again. I teach this now to others and have dozens of videos explaining all the steps and I have some fun too trying to make people laugh.

I have a couple videos based solely on stress and anxiety which detail out what I've shared above in greater depth with a much better explanation and visuals. DM me if you'd like the link or check out my page and go from there.

There is hope for you and your struggle... there is a place, a version of you which is out there waiting for you two to merge. this future version is a person who smiles in public and it's authentic. This person laughs too, and doesn't have angst while going out in public, or speaking to another, or dread anything whatsoever. This person is confident, and secure with themselves, even proud and in love. This person helps others navigate their anxiety too!

Please lmk if you have any questions and my heart goes out to you all.

26,How do I get tested for ADHD as an adult?,"I've asked my doctor and she pointed me in the direction of counciling, I tried that and got absolutely nowhere since all we do is just talk about my day. I've always assumed my... problems? Where all linked to my depression. Honestly they still could be. But I feel like my brain just doesn't work like it's supposed to. I've read that females often show more inattentive symptoms and go undiagnosed, and I relate to a lot of those cases. I can't seem find anything locally that isnt for just children, or requires a referal. 

TLDR; My doctor gave me useless referals. How do I get tested for ADHD as an adult?"
27,"People, esp. women who were diagnosed with ADD in their 20s, how did you get diagnosed?","I've been seeing a pyschiatrist rcently and she just gave me antidepressants, yes it helps with the depression but i still feel very distracted and helpless. I just cooked food and i don't even want to eat it. i still impulse buy things that i don't need. constantly pick my face. i feel fitdgety more than ever. idk what's wrong."
28,i don't wanna take my meds anymore,"started taking sertraline in September this year, so far it's helped, eased my symptoms of anxiety, and the depression symptoms are starting to lift now as well
but every night before I want to fall asleep I get such extreme paranoia about these tablets thinking that they're gonna kill me, that I'll die in my sleep, that they're slowly damaging my body, and the brain zaps make it worse, I start feeling dizzy because of the tiredness and all
I'm just sick of it I don't want to live with the paranoia anymore I'd rather go back to how I was before the tablets than deal with the paranoia of ""my tablets are gonna kill me"" every night 
im tempted to call my doctor and ask to start lowering my dose and eventually coming off them
i can cope without them I've proved that to myself before even if my emotions/mental health were shit
i feel like it was a mistake for me to go on these despite them easing my anxiety

i can't do this anymore"
29,Should I tell my friend’s mom about his depression?,"For context, my friend has always had suicidal tendencies and is diagnosed with depression, he recently had a nasty breakup and has been incredibly depressed about it, I’m scared he might start hurting him self again, but he insists he’s not suicidal and he’s been honest with me about stuff like this in the past. Now even then I’m still scared for his mental state, now my question is would it be a good idea for me to tell his mom about how I’m scared for him? I’m afraid he’ll be mad at me or she’ll be mad at him but it may be important."

I’m new here)"
31,I need confidence,"so within the next few days i plan on telling my parents abut my mental health. i have to, there’s no way i’m ever going to get better without their help.

my only issue is i really don’t want to even though i have to because i am close to having a nervous breakdown and if i don’t tell them then i will probably do something that i will regret. and the other issue is menial but the last time i opened up was to my mother and her boyfriend at the time. he was an arse and emotionally abusive. when i opened up to them (i was suicidal at the time) they laughed and told me i had no reason to be depressed.

i’m not opening up to them this time. this time it’s my dad and stepmum who i’m opening up to and i know they love me and i know they will take it seriously but i’m scared. they know something has been off about me recently but it’s scary and i hate opening up about my feelings.

i just need some confidence to do this basically. pls send positive vibes my way cause imma need them to get through this. i’ll update after i tell them."
32,i need help im lost,"I'm not sure where to even start with this,  I will just start with this lately i have been creeping myself out.  lately i have felt so manipulative i always have been manipulative but its been getting worse along with the lying its just very bad.  i have always had anger issues very bad to where i have gotten physical with my own family, and calling my mother very horrible things.  when i get angry killing people comes to mind just the thought of it makes me feel better and i don't wanna think like that i would never hurt a fly.  I'm such a caring amazing person and i feel like that's fading away.  my love for people is slowly fading even for my own family.  I'm starting to not feel love and its scaring me so bad.  i told someone I'm close to and they said what everyone else has that i have ASPD i guess that is like sociopathy.  but i just don't think that's right.  I'm only 17 i need help before it gets worse and i do something worse then i have.  i have gotten in trouble with the law twice that's not the path i wanna go down at all..."
33,I'm having intrusive thoughts and it drives me crazy,"I had only recently learned that what i've been experiencing are intrusive thoughts. I can't go into detail about what it is about, but it makes it difficult for me to like things like pokemon.

I don't want to think these thoughts, it's about the same thing and I fucking hate it. It pisses me off, and  sometimes it makes my entire body itch to the point where it hurts if I don't calm myself down. There has been one instance where it manifested in my dream, and I woke myself up because it bothered me that much.

How do I stop this? This thought pops up many times per day and this is not healthy at all for me."

She explained that it was selfish and that is just puts pain on \*other\* people. Which sounds really crazy to me. What do I do? I would feel guilty if I get angry she said this but I can't just let this pass by me."
37,I feel like I'll just fail at some point,"It takes so long to do homework and shit. I get started, get distracted, lose focus, do a little bit, lose focus again. Repeat the cycle until 3 hours have passed. I can't concentrate on things to save my ass. Right now the work load's not too heavy but when I get to higher grades I feel like I'll just fail. Sometimes I can't even start things even if I have to. I know I have to do it, I want to do it, but my brain doesn't cooperate. So I'm just browsing reddit while I'm screaming at myself that I'm so stupid. I'm a failure. I constantly lose interest in projects and hobbies and I feel like I'll never truly be satisfied with myself. I'll never truly succeed. I feel like a space alien in human skin. I take 4 hours to do shit that should take a hour and a half at most. How the fuck am I even managing to get A's and B's? It's impressive, honestly. My head's constantly moving. I can never commit to one thing. I constantly abandon hobbies. I'm sure that at some point this is going to screw me over."
38,"Is it bad that the most apologetic thing I've heard from anyone in months is ""I know I'm rude and I call you a fag but it's ok because I'm pansexual""","I haven't heard a genuine ""I'm sorry"" from anyone I know in so long, and this is the most apologetic thing I've heard from anyone in months. I barely even know the guy, I only periodically see him in public and compliment him on Instagram, the only thing he mostly responds with is ""shut up faggot,"" and yet HE was the only person who's been semi-genuine to me in any way. I'm just wondering, is this normal or something?"

40,I think I realized my problem.,"I am not ready to get better. I'm not even ready to think about that yet. And maybe that's okay. I've spent my whole life acting like I'm okay in real life. And no matter how much I'm okay with expressing this side of me online I don't even react to what I type. I've never been able to be unwell, I've been forced into this box of toxic positivity and it's stopping me from actually getting better. How am I supposed to feel like I can get better when I'm not even able to feel like things are bad? I can know they're bad but I never feel it. I'm kinda just writing this to get it straightened out in my head as I mean to bring it up to my therapist tomorrow. But I guess the best way to explain it is that you can't fix a broken glass you won't admit is broken. No matter how much it stabs you and cuts you you just sit there and say ""it's not broken, it can still hold water"" as you mop up the water that's spilling onto the floor and refilling it. That's how I feel. That's what I've been doing."
41,Recurring Panic Attacks after Traumatic Experience with Significant Other,"Hi, I (F18) really need to write down everything I'm feeling, and would really love to hear some advice if you'd like to take the time to read. 

You can call me Gem. 

So this past month has been a real struggle for me. I'm breaking up with my partner who I live with, which has brought some really difficult emotions to the surface. 

I guess I should get into why my relationship is dissolving. Essentially, my partner and I got pretty into detachment theory, and thus decided to enter into an open relationship. After a month or so of discussion about boundaries and harm reduction, I met a guy; we kissed, and I came home and told my partner immediately. I was excited, and I expected him to be too. What followed was one of the most vile shows of anger I've seen from a person. At one point he was getting physical, and so I told him I wanted to leave. Instead, he cornered me, which triggered the first of many panic attacks (more on this later).

I have a history of depression and anxiety, and have an ADHD diagnosis as well. My last rough spell (depressive episode lasting longer than a couple weeks) was four years ago, and during that time I was immensely suicidal and an active self-harmer through cutting. Since then I've been relatively okay; I've been able to deal with difficult circumstances in a healthy way - even other breakups - and have felt generally ""stable"". 

My childhood/adolescence is also an important piece to understanding this puzzle. My parents divorced at age two, and my older brother, Max and I were ""shipped"" back and forth every week for 11 years. We were very close, as we were the only constant in eachothers lives. My father remarried and had a son, just as Max was entering into high school. Dad had struggled with his anger, and so we never got along, but he and Max were close. They played hockey together - my dad was the coach, and he pushed my brother, hard. After a couple serious concussions, Max decided hockey wasn't for him, and so he started having more fun with friends, going to parties and doing regular stupid teenage things. Things that, in a better situation would have ended up being harmless. My step mother, whose own brother struggled with addiction immediately forced him out of the house, thinking she was protecting her newborn son. So my brother and I moved in with my mother - I was happy with this, Max was not. Since he wasn't able to deal with the hurt of being rejected by his father, he started using heavy drugs (cocaine, opioids, alcohol). I remember nights where I wasn't sure if he'd ever come home. Max's hurt mixed with substance abuse caused him to get very angry, specifically at me, since again, I was the only stable person in his life. I think he also hated that my dad still wanted me around. This resulted in years of relentless emotional and occasionally physical abuse, which only stopped once I moved out. 

So anyway, since that night with my partner I've been having some trouble. My ADHD symptoms started to get a lot worse (mainly executive dysfunction) and so I started back up on Concerta. Since then, my highs have been really high, and my lows have been terrifying. On one hand, I've been taking really good care of myself and my surroundings; cooking, taking time to meditate, doing yoga, being creative. But on the other hand, I will be hit with these episodes, where I feel as if I fully leave my body. I'm paralyzed, and overwhelmed with the urge to hurt or kill myself. My ego/sense of self is gone at this point, and I just go blank. My memory will also become very foggy, and I'll find myself ""teleporting"" from room to room, unable to remember how/when I moved. 

My self harm started again with a pounding on my chest whenever I felt one of these episodes creeping up on me. It was like it pulled me out of the void for just a moment, like it was something to grab onto before I fell into the abyss. From there, it moved to my throat, where I'd choke myself until I lost consciousness, or at least the ability to see. Since then it's just been my legs. I'll go blind with rage and just start beating myself. I feel no pain in the moment, but my legs are all bruised now. As soon as I'm back in my body, I have no urge to hurt myself, and am saddened at the thought. 

To be very clear, I do not support the romanticization of self-harm in any way. It is NOT something I want to be carrying with me, and I acknowledge that it isn't a healthy coping mechanism in the slightest. I'm not ashamed of my scars anymore, but this isn't something I need to be doing now - I just don't know how to protect myself. 

So yeah, that's where I'm at right now... thanks for listening."
42,"Stable, but what now","Outlook hasn't been all too bad lately, relatively speaking of course. Less emotionally exhausted but generally just delirious from the lack of sleep and headaches caused by lack of sleep. But I know this is just a resting point, the very top of a graph that while not guaranteed, most likely will dip into ""the red"" soon enough. What now? I'm still not happy or content, I'm just not suffering heavily right now. It feels so empty. Right now I'm just anticipating the next impact of whatever else this farse I hesitate to call a life will arbitrarily throw at me. Is there nothing I can do but to wait?"
43,I don't know what to do,"I feel so hopeless and lost. I've done nothing this past year except mope around like a loser. I've been struggling a lot especially with my home life now that I have no where to go. My parents make me feel like shit all the time. I feel like such a huge disappointment to them and they're never happy with anything I do. Honestly, I'm never happy with anything I do. I was just getting on track with my life before this pandemic and then everything got messed up. I feel like such a failure especially as I'm nearing 30 and still living with my parents plus never having had a real job. I'm so sad all the time and my memory is failing. I have such a hard time remembering anything. I put off the simplest tasks and then forget them too. All I wanna do is cry all the time. 

I finally got insurance this year and I've been wanting to get some mental health help but I can't do telephone or online appts. I have such a hard time just talking about my issues and being home and doing that online or in phone with someone while my parents are home stresses me out. My parents dont take me seriously when I say I'm depressed and they don't believe in therapy. I'd prefer in person visits but it doesn't look like that's happening. 

I'm just so depressed all the time. I spend so much time wondering if I should just kill myself. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm literally crying while typing this."
44,It feels like I am not passionate about anything.,I am a student right now and I have changed my major twice. Wasting many semesters. I’ve changed multiple jobs because I would get hired to work somewhere where I am only working because of the pay and it will truly feel purposeless. I would get money but not a sense of creation or purpose and then would either mess up at work and end up being fired or leaving the job. I feel like something is wrong with me. I cannot find motivation. It just feels like I am into everything but not passionate about anything. I still haven’t found my career yet. What is wrong with me? How do I change?

Okay, I genuinely think something is wrong with me. For background info: I have been diagnosed with ADHD, and my former? therapist told me I had symptoms of Anxiety. I also have very frequent panic attacks and mental breakdowns and I cut myself a little bit for a while. I have had a good life though, and I definitely have it much better than a lot of people.

-Whenever I cry I can’t stop flailing my arms and kicking my feet. Even if I try to stop it, my torso just flails around instead.

-When I get even slightly mad or annoyed, I get the urge to throw a tantrum like a 3 year old in the cereal isle of the grocery store (whining, kicking and screaming etc). I can control it, but the urge to scream like a baby is almost too strong for me (I am a teenager).

I asked around and I’ve been told by my friends that it might just be a sign of immaturity. I am fairly “immature” as in I can act a bit young (clingy) at times. I don’t think it’s to the point of regressing, as I have no emotional or physical trauma, and have had a perfectly happy life. I don’t know if there is a problem with me or if I just need to get over it."
46,I’ve so disconnected with myself since February,"Literally one random morning in late February I woke up not feeling like myself at all. It feels like my brain isn’t mine. I feel so disconnected with myself, it feels like there somewhat of a buffer zone between me and my brain. During this time I was being bullied in school too not physical but I feel like it might’ve mentally fucked me up. More details can be emotions feel harder to process, time is very hard to keep up with, focus is terrible, and I have brain fog. I talked to a doctor in July all I was told in it’s because of quarantine just fellow a schedule you had before quarantine. Even though I told them I’ve felt like this before quarantine even began they didn’t care. This whole thing is starting to feel like the norm now since I’ve tried ignoring it for so long but it fucking sucks. Idk what to do."
47,"God, I don't know what's happening with me.",Just I'm really not feeling life right now y'know.  I'm somehow both emotionally numb and extremely emotional/sensitive and I don't know what's going on.  Im both striving to better myself and losing the will to do so with each passing day and it's just fuck it's taking it out of me.  I don't know how much I can keep this up. (I god is it bad to feel super guilty saying all of this? like there are people out there going through so much more than me why should I be complaining y'know?). I feel like my world is collapsing around me and I feel like I'm losing control of my life and just my mind can't take it.  I none of this makes any sense but who the hell cares anyway I just need to get it out I guess and I don't know where else to talk about it fuck this might not even be the right subreddit for all I know.  None of my friends care fuck I haven't actually talked to any of them in days my parents are stressed enough with the virus and I hate being another stressor and my brother I fuck he lost all my trust a long time ago i just if you read through this mess thanks for well stopping by comment dm me whatever ill be laying in bed having a mental breakdown if you need me.

(for reference my mother is black and I am mixed)

I honestly can't decide if it is worse to have to interact with my parents (my mother tends to trigger quite a few of my childhood issues) or no one for the next 5 weeks. Let's just say I am very fucking unhappy about this situation."

53,Why do I feel ashamed for being LGBTQ+? And fear of copying others?,"TW

I realized I was a lesbian/gay 4 years ago and it has been a long battle for me but I have come to the point where I know this is me and I cannot change who I am. Only a few of my friends know, but why do I feel so much shame? I am too scared to tell my therapist if they change their perception of me or think I am weird. I just get so sad about it sometimes. I have a family member who is LGBT+ but I have this weird anxiety thing about ""copying"" and that I cannot copy someone if they are doing it too and I have a fear none of my family will believe me or think I am silly or I will not live up to their expectations. People are always asking me if I have a boyfriend/ husband without even thinking that I could not be straight :/ I am happy being gay in private but I am so scared about it when talking to anyone - it was even really hard to tell my friends who are really accepting. 

Anybody else feel/ used to feel this way? Anybody else deal with the fear of copying thing?"

When I’m extremely frustrated/sad I feel like my body needs a release or to be slapped in the face. I know I could ice dive, but I wanted to self harm instead. 

I have an extremely supportive boyfriend friends and I can’t tell any of them. I don’t even want to tell my therapist. I’m even in a partial hospitalization program right now. I just can’t believe I’m back here."
55,"This is super obscure and idk if anyone else can relate, but I need to ask if this is an anxiety symptom or something.","So ever since I was very little, I have had pretty bad anxiety. And I would get these little episodes where it feels like my bones (especially in my fingers and my teeth) are like.. ?getting thicker? idk how to explain it. They just begin to feel unbearably heavy and thick and even as an adult it gives me panic attacks. I feel as if everything I touch becomes super thin and could snap in a single second.

In fear of being sent to a mental hospital because of the way my parents described it, I have sort of trained myself to release all of my anxiety at night when everyone is asleep. This results in a panic attack and I get numb, I cry, I get dizzy, I can't talk (when I do it comes out as a whisper and I can barely form words), and sometimes I pass out. Sometimes, I slip up and my anxiety comes out during the day time, especially when there is a lot of stressful stuff going on, and my family sees it. I also kind of trained myself to hide it in front of people. My family has only seen me have a panic attack one before today and when they did they got mad at me for having one and still get mad at me when I look like I'm going to have a panic attack. Today, my brother was arguing with my parents about him not wanting to exercise. At one point my mother got mad at me because I told him it was good to exercise (apparently I wasn't supposed to""butt in""). After this she started yelling at me and pulled my hair and I started to cry. After a few minutes of her yelling at me I started to have a panic attack. She noticed and asked me how old I was and I had to answer five times. I'm sixteen. She yelled ""That's right! You're sixteen! So, stop acting like you're a three year old baby that always cries over everything! Stop crying and knock this shi* off, do you hear me?! I swear one of these days I'm just going to drive off for the entire day because I'm tired of this shi*""! I felt even worse than before. My dad (who just moved back into the living area a month ago after being kicked out for four months) came home and she yelled at him that I had been arguing with her and crying for no reason. She told me not to speak so I couldn't tell my dad what actually happened. He told me that if I kept crying in the future that someone or even my future ""girlfriend""(really boyfriend but I'm technically not out to my parents yet) is going to rape me, or beat me up, or both, or kidnap me and kill me because I would be so vulnerable. I already have trust issues and love issues because my mom says that good couples (married or not) who REALLY love each other argue harshly at least more than two times a month, kick one another out for more than four months, and even stay with them even if one of them cheats for more than two times a month for sixteen years. I fear that my parents are right. I've been trying to tell myself that that's not what real love is. I fear that my anxiety and panic attacks are going to get me raped or killed. I feel hopeless. I feel like everything is my fault. I feel like I'm going crazy. I feel scared of the future. Please, someone help me."
57,Taking time for myself," I got devastating news today. I won't go into detail, although the last 3 years of my life seem wasted.
 
 I don't want one person to define who I am unless that person is myself. I graduated college by myself, I didn't give up on myself when I was having harmful thoughts and thinking to just end it or when my suicidal tendencies almost got the best of me in my reckless abandon of self.

 I am and always learn, grow, and change, all for myself. So I grabbed a light meal, some loose tea, I put on calm music and lit a candle. 

 Sometimes you have to show yourself love in order to feel like everything is alright. Don't ever give up, things will look up one day at a time.

Feel free to message me if need be."
58,"Got denied disability again and too scared to keep pushing for it, don’t know what to do","
Got my second denial for disability(SSI/SSDI) and I’m just convincing myself I don’t deserve it . I’m too afraid to do court even if it is over Zoom. And I am too afraid to get a lawyer. Too afraid to represent myself. I can’t really leave my house anymore due to my anxiety and I’m depressed that I’m becoming helpless and even more dependent on others now that I can’t leave. They keep saying I’m not too disabled and I’m starting to believe that I don’t qualify or deserve the help. I know if someone read my journal they would understand my life is torture. But I don’t know how to move forward, I’m frozen. I don’t think my back pay will be enough for a lawyer to take my case btw."
59,Does therapy really work?,"I don’t mean to sound offensive asking this cause I KNOW it must work to some degree, I guess I’m just nervous to throw so much money at something and possibly still have to be put on an SSRI or some other drug.

I had what I now realize was moderate to severe depression in high school and some of college. It may have been more than just depression though, looking back I used to hit myself if I couldn’t get a task right. That didn’t last for so long but it definitely sticks out as “wow maybe I had/have more mental problems than I realized” But the depression in particular really trashed my memory and problem solving skills. I can remember hardly anything of high school, and not much of college either. I have a lot of difficulty remembering interactions with people as well.

I don’t really have depression anymore, everything leveled out a LOT in comparison, but I still deal with memory problems and I don’t know if it’s fixable or if depression permanently damaged the part of my brain that writes memories..

I’m more so dealing with moderate anxiety now. Like pretty consistent mild anxiety with some periods that it seems absent, and then occasional awful anxiety attacks. The problem (other than my coping mechanism being “always keep brain busy”) is that these anxiety attacks happen when I make a mistake at work, even if the mistake is minor and I KNOW it. My brain can’t help devolving into “you have to tell someone, it doesn’t matter if you fixed it. What if they find out? What if you get fired for it? What if ..” X Y Z etc.

I guess other than this being a bit of a vent and trying to write all this out and just face it I’m above all wondering... can therapy really work for me? My dad mentioned he did EMDR but he doesn’t seem to have changed very much. A general google search suggests psychotherapy for anxiety. Will I just end up on a pill? I guess my biggest fear is the side effect of losing my sex drive or becoming depressed again as a side effect, which is why I’m willing to try paying for therapy. I just want to know it might actually make my quality of life better..."
60,I want to just disappear.,I have this plan where I take a spontaneous vacation somewhere out of the country and spend every last dime and just end it. Not sure how or where let alone when. It sounds selfish but I feel lonely but I want to be alone.. I have a decent family and partner and I just want an exit strategy. Not sure why. I try to enjoy the little things and practice self care but it always just temporary or that I'm distracting myself and for what? I just don't feel like I'm living life and that I'm just existing because I have to.

## Immediately, learn to implement a scientifically proven technique that teaches you 5 simple steps, to help monitor negative thoughts, while replacing them with healthy ones. In addition to providing amazing coping skills, incorporating this into your daily routine will ultimately restructure your neural pathways, changing your default thought pattern from negative to positive (for example: You may hear 10 positive things about yourself, but 1 negative comment will negate those 10 positive ones because it grows the seeds of negativity. The opposite occurs when your default thought pattern is positive). Overall, when you become aware of whats hidden deep inside the unconscious, only then can sustainable changes be made.

### ABOUT ME: My name is Lisa Bergstrom, a single mother to a strong-willed toddler, work as a therapist and recently launched my own Life Coach practice. As someone acquainted with mental health system for a few decades, I have always been intrigued by various styles of therapy. I earned a Master’s Degree in Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (CUNY) and started working in the mental health industry in 2011. When the pandemic started, I began and completed Life Coach training from 2 seperate IAC approved academies becuase of the results-driven, goal-oriented approach in coaching. My goal has always been to help others after having gone through childhood trauma (see my story: www.lisabergstrom.org). However, I noticed that too often, people attended therapy for 20-30 years , which concerned me. 

Finally, I discovered neuroscientific research, including tons of data evidenced by brain scans imagining, and simple instructions about geting to the root of people's issue on an unconscious level prompted an epiphany, thinking, ""How can any other psychological school of thought provide anything but superficial results if the root issue is not addressed?"" Naturally, I applied this approach to myself and the results were shocking! I had givenn up at this point. However, becoming aware of my unresolved issues, applying the steps daily caused the intrusive bouts of anxiety, worry, fear, etc. to dissipate! In addition, I received so many other benefits. Sadly, according to society, we are victims to our biology, mental illnesses, family history of medical issues, which absolutely can cause us to feel like we have little control over our own lives, which could not be further from the truth. In fact, we are encouraged to avoid our emotions, which not only prevents us from healing but, in fact, creates more damage! 

**Awareness is key to making change**

1. Build healthy relationships.
2. Develop amazing coping skills.
3. Cultivate mindsets of successful people. 
4. Learn how to learn from uncomfortable experiences, such as change.
5. Manage anxiety &amp; other emotions. 
6. Mind-management tips. 
7. Create balance in your life. 
8. Increase self-esteem. 
9. Plus much more!

### Keep in mind, I am providing you with the tools that can create life-changing habits. Depending on how much effort you choose to put into self-growth, will determine the benefits. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A QUICK FIX! deliberate effort is the answer, which builds wisdom and character. I recognize that change is a painful process because your brain is actually restructuring itself during the rebuilding process, which feels uncomfortable, so instinctively people take the path of least resistance. However, self-help is a multi- billion dollar industry because each of us have a desire to improve and achieve our greatest potential we just need the motivation. The answer:

### These skills teach you to self-regulate and self-evaluate, which is needed to develop your true identity. Once you gain clarity and embrace your unique identity, you also gain the motivation necessary to move forward.

62,Attachment issues: I eroticize my relationships with male authority and then feel devastated and worthless when they withdraw. I am in so much pain right now. I just want to be held.,"It happened again and can’t stop crying about it. 

FYI: yes I have daddy issues lol. My dad molested me when I was little and even though I don’t feel consciously *that* traumatized by it and it really wasn’t as bad as it sounds I probably do have boundary/ attachment issues from it. My mom was even more abusive but i. A different way but this is not about blaming my parents for my own issues. It’s about my insatiable and unrealistic need for affection and approval from authority figures.

Anyway, the last four years it’s been centered around my favorite professor at uni. Today I just talked to him on zoom, and now I feel so awful. He didn’t even do anything unusual or wrong I’m just so hypersensitive and needy. I have been looking forward to this meeting for weeks. He seemed bored and distracted and I feel like he wouldn’t care if I died. I thought he liked me and he just seemed bored and cold toward me. His laugh was flat and fake and he gave absolutely no indication that he was even remotely enjoying himself. I just kept apologizing and sounding stupid. This always happens. I planned for this meeting so far in advance. I haven’t seen anyone other than my grandparents in months and was so excited for this but I bombed it and received confirmation that he doesn’t really care about me. And why should he? 

What is wrong with me? why does this matter more than anything in the world to me? Why do I feel like a pile of bricks has been dropped on my chest? My cheeks are flushed. 

I’m desperate for his approval. I swore I had it at one point and now it’s gone. It was probably all in my head. I’ve been secretly obsessed with him for four years but clearly couldn’t care less about me.... I can’t handle this. 

It was so absurd and pathetic, I kept trying to drag out the conversation. I feel so isolated and crazy I need him. 

I’m inconsolable and it doesn’t make sense to anyone else. I can’t stop crying I feel like I’ll never stop feeling this way. I don’t want sex or a date I just want him to care about me. I just want a sign that I matter. A smile or something. Anything."
63,Don’t even know what to feel anymore.,"I think this post goes to parents.. specially single mothers.. looking for advice.
I’ve been a single mother since I’ve been 17. I’m 24 now. I don’t know how to quite enjoy life. I’m a pretty outgoing person, in the sense that when I’m around people I am not timid and I am “fun” but never really have, kind of had to grow up very quickly work 2 jobs for about 6 years. This past year I finally felt comfortable enough to go down to one job.
But I’m so miserable. 
I have always struggled with depression.. 
but I don’t even feel allowed to be depressed?
I’m a single parent. Lol.
Does anyone else feel like this? 
Like when can I sleep in? Cry it out? Dance it all away? Act a little bit reckless? 
What do you do? How do you deal with your depression and your feelings with out affecting it your child."
64,Bipolar disorder,"Hello, anyone with bipolar disorder here?"
65,I managed to scare myself last night by reasoning to myself how my suicide would probably be a good thing. (TW Suicidal Thoughts),"TL:DR I came to the conclusion that it would probably be best to end my own life at some point because it isn't going anywhere and that I can't change it and that that thought scares me.  

&amp;#x200B;

I (M 31) don't currently feel like I want to kill myself , I'm not feeling particularly miserable, my life isn't great but it could be a lot worse. the issue is I know that this isn't going to last forever.

I'm living off of an ever shrinking Inheritance and my mental Illness (Anxiety, Depression, PTSD and possibly more that is diagnosed) has made it impossible for me to work for the past 13 years, I tried to get a job for 5 years and got rejected by every single one of them, then I had to stop looking because my father got sick and I had to help take care of him. Also during this time I met a girl who I started dating who ended up making my life miserable and is a huge part of the cause of my PTSD (It's a very long story that I don't want to tell here right now because it is a bit of a trigger for me).

After my father passed and I was able to get out of the relationship I was miserable for a couple of years and had planned to take my own life a few times but never went through with it. After a couple of years though I was able to improve my mental state, I met some friends who helped me out a lot just by being there for me without even knowing about how serious my mental health issues were, a couple of years after that I was able to move out on my own and get my own house which you would think would be a good thing and in a way it is but it feels like a hollow victory because I didn't earn it, I bought it with the money I was left and I've not been able to turn it in to the kind of space I want because I don't have the money for it and when I do have some spare cash my anxiety keeps me from acting on my ideas because I know I'll just fuck it up and unfortunately those thoughts have been proven right more than once in some of my attempts.

I feel like despite the fact I have a pretty ok life right now it is on a knife edge and if something goes wrong there may be no coming back from it and even if that doesn't happen I don't feel fulfilled, I am basically living day to day, only just surviving and when I do try and do things to change that my mental health issues take over and I end up back where I am, I find it impossible to follow my dreams of being a writer or an artist because when I try I panic. I know that I'm probably never going to fall in love with someone because of my fear of being in a relationship caused by the horrors of my last one and even if I am able to get past those fears I'm not going to fall in love with someone I truly want to but that I am just going to end up settling and I just do not want that. I also Know that eventually the money I do have WILL run out and I'll not even be able to survive like I am now and so, laying in bed last night my brain reasoned that with my life going no where and that once my mother and my dog are gone I'm probably not going to have anything left to live for and that it would probably be better for everyone involved if I were to cut all my ties and end myself and honestly that thought scares me because for some reason it makes too much sense to me and I am worried if I can't change things soon that that is going to be the outcome.

Sorry for the long post, I had to get all of that stuff off my chest and I realize that most of what I said seems like ""first world problems"" and there are a lot of people out there with worse issues than me on this subreddit but I just really needed to get this off my mind so I can at least try and put some work into the things I enjoy and not have this looming over me. Lets hope it worked and thank you to whoever had the patience to read all of this and an extra thank you to anyone who has any advice"
66,Work Guilt: Depression + Anxiety 30F,"Hi all,

Never posted but ... why not!?

Been in a job I’ve known was not the fit I was looking for since I started summer 2019. 

Is was a career pivot in a very competitive, seemingly glamorous industry that I’ve been in for 10. Wanting to take a shot at the dream.

Could give you all the details but suffice to say that sketchy contracts were disputed and after a year and a half I settled on getting a lawyer to review. They agreed it was not a good offer. I researched competitive rates and the value of my experience and drew it up - finally got back my company’s response and they’ve budged on nothing.

Feeling completely exhausted by the emotional and financial toll of this whole exchange. I am making 40k less than my competitors and now have legal costs and the slap in the face of them saying it was good to get a lawyer only to give nothing. Why have us both go through this expense if they weren’t flexible on anything? 

The awful part is of course so many people are unemployed and i ‘should’ be grateful to have a job at all but it feels just awful to work for these people - they claim it’s the pandemic but we’re in a booming industry and our workflow is overrun.

We’re a tiny team but it’s all through lawyers so everyone just acts like it’s normal and the texts and emails about the job continue into the night.

Can absolutely relate to those feeling tired all the time yet unable to sleep or get out of bed.

I dread figuring out what to do next and feel myself turning this into some test of will when maybe I could just use the time to try to get myself better? Feeling lost and knowing that I can’t be looking to others to tell me what to do - to make me feel less ashamed and spoiled - and yet here I am. 

TL;DR seeing my therapist on Wednesday and instead of taking pause and trying to figure out how bad bosses make me feel and what *i* want to do about
It... instead venting here"
67,PTSD?,So I have kind of guessed that I have ptsd from my moms old boyfriend they dated for 6 years after my dad died but last night just kind brought back bad memories so I went to tell my mom goodnight and she was on the phone with someone she’s seeing and then he said he wanted to talk to me I was like why but talked to him and what scared me first was that his voice sounded just like my moms old boyfriend and I froze but still talked to him then when he asked A question and I said no but he asked no sir and that’s when I freaked out right when I finally got to leave all I could imagine was my moms old boyfriend touching me telling me he loved me and forcing me to tell him I loved him back and his breath that smelled like beer I’ve never felt like this before I don’t even feel safe.
68,What is this feeling called/what could this be alluding to?,"When I feel guilty, I don't really have a healthy boundary between ""I did something bad, but I'm still a person,"" and ""I'm a horrible person and I deserve to feel terrible forever."" Basically meaning when I'm guilty of something I start hating myself even if it's over something small. What could this stem from or possibly be a symptom of? 
(Note: not sure if this helps, but I'm also autistic and I have anxiety)"
69,I think i might be fucked up.,"Im in the Phoenix area. I dont feel anything. I see friends and family struggle all the time, and I give all the money and help I have. The issue is that I have no feeling towards or against anything. Unless im in trouble, I dont feel any sorrow or sadness. Empathy can be there, but mostly I only keep my mouth shut, because I only laugh at inappropriate times, or cry over nothing. Im so apathetic of real issues, but sensitive over a piece of road kill. What is happening?"
70,My anxiety gets so bad that I will wear my coat fully zipped and hood up all the time to make myself disappear but I also know it makes me stand out as odd.,"I won’t wear my hood up at work, but I will wear my coat 24/7 fully zipped up, and anytime I’m outside of work I will wear my hood up as well. At home, in the grocery store, at the gas station, wherever, even in bed. Even if I feel warm. But I mostly feel cold all the time like I’m shivering all the time. Is this partly due to my anxiety or is there a chance there’s something physical going on as well? Part of me doesn’t want to be seen, but I also know that wearing a bright yellow raincoat fully in the middle of the grocery store makes me stand out. Can someone here explain what’s going on?"
71,I'm scared i'm gonna kill myself.,"This is a genuine fear that's spiked tonight. For the past few hours, all i've thought about are the easiest ways to die without inconveniencing anyone else. I'm afraid for my safety, but also too stubborn to seek genuine help. I feel like i'm gonna put myself in a dangerous situation. I need you guys to convince me to get help."
72,If anyone's willing to listen I could really need it.,"Apologies for the long post if anyone reads this 

As I'm writing this I don't know what state I'm actually in.
I went drinking with some friends to celebrate the end of our last exam but instead of feeling good, I just got back to my suicidal thought's, and I haven't been at that stage for so long.
I know I'm struggling with my mental help but now I'm just right back in the slump of just not wanting to exist anymore and I don't know how I go from here.

Big part of my insecurities and struggle comes from how I was raised and born, my mom was raped and I'm the outcome. Growing up I always felt some distance between us but never understood why despite her doing everything she could as alone mother but after she told me when I was 13, I instantly realized why.
She struggled a lot and always put my needs infront of anything, but yet she'd say things like ""my life used to be so perfect"" and basically blame me for everything. She was overworked and worked 2 jobs for many years and all her anger and frustration for her struggles were probably projected to me as an outlet, yet I feel singled out because it's never with my brother.
And I'm happy for it because I practically raised him, considering she worked 8am to 10 pm, I want him the best in the world and beyond. There's an 8 year difference between us, yet I couldn't help but realize the difference in behaviour, never distance between them and never any projected anger.
This continued until I moved out, and there was a lot of arguing and again projectiled anger. 

Yet I'm a rape baby, and the biggest part that screws me over is the thought that if the world was just, I wouldn't be here. I'm an outcome of an unfair world. 

There was also an issue because my brothers father, was married to my mom from i was 6-10, and he was abusive both mentally and physically.

So all of that obviously has made me very insecure, yet I somehow still manage to speak a lot, I really speak too much and sometimes I can't shut up. 
I've made many friends of that. 

A part of me knows how it feels like to be rock bottom, and that's why I purposely go out of my way to help people as much as I can. 
I always put people ahead of me, and it's the one thing of my personality I like. 
As long as the people I care about have it good, I can deal with pain, or so I thought. 

In my teens I felt really around despite having many friends, and due to everything and my home life I developed a suicidal mindset, yet I thought I beat it after I got a job at 18, but I didn't as they kept coming back from time to time. 

I shouldn't exist, in a fair world you don't exist. You're ugly, you're nobody all thoughts i kept hearing from time to time 

I remember I went to a party some weeks after I turned 19 and I ended up being taken to ER because I had drunk too much, my friends and I joke about it now however my biggest and darkest secret is that I didn't pass out just because of alcohol. 
I had taken a lot of pills earlier and my plan was to drink and make it seem like I had died of alcohol poisoning. 
I tried committing suicide.
What still haunts me is that in the moments before I completely blacked out, I didn't feel a sweet realese, I just felt pain. 
I just remembered all my pain and feelings and why I came to the point, I didn't feel a realese at all. I remember wanting to just jell and cry because this pain was so much, but my body couldn't react and then I blacked out. 

I was apperantly lucky I didn't die and somehow the doctors never found trace of the pills in my blood. 

I made a promise to myself that'd I'd beat this, I wanted to prove myself wrong and never ever feel like that again. 

However the battle seems forever upwards but it I kept getting better i thought. 
Earlier this year I applied for university and got into my dream field of study , a bit late since I'm 22 but it felt like a massive progressiol. However after moving completely out and being more alone than ever, I finally could think over my past and I had a weak second of a suicidal thought

So I decided to get help, and the help has been nice but I just started realising a feeling I had suppressed. 
I have never been happy with my life. 
I have had happy moments but nowhere at any point in my life have I been actually happy.

Which brings me today, I was going to socialise have fun yet all I could think about was ""I don't want to exist"" 

In all reality I don't want to die, but it's just that if I do, I won't have these feelings anymore, I just want my pain to go away. 
It hurts, it hurts too much, I don't want it anymore, and I don't know how to deal with it. 

I just want for once in my life smile and say I'm content and I'm happy 
My only dream is to one day have a family, a wife who loves me and kids. 
I don't need to be rich, or make it big, I just want a happy life. 
However each day I get less and less motivated, and each day I feel like I get closer and closer to me just ending up alone, just like it feels like I am. 

And the crazy part here? Because of the blood in my veins, because of who and what my father did, it's that evils persons blood running through me 

It feels like I deserve it. 
Because of the comments my mom has made it feels like I deserve it 
Because of my step dad it feels like I deserve it. 

I don't want this anymore, I just want someone to rip the pain away, I can't handle it. 
22 years worth of pain, I don't want it anymore. 


It hurts too much 

Sorry for the long post if anyone actually reads this"
73,Nothing good going anymore,"As is the case with most people 2020 has been a really bad year for me. technically the spiral started 2 years ago when my mom and stepdad divorced and i moved with my mom when i was 18. I now live 45 minutes from all my friends which isnt too far to see them but definitely puts me in isolation being far away and not having the social skills to go make new friends. since then its just been a shitshow with my nutjob relatives and being alone all the time. my dad (bio father) is suicidal and my beloved cat died young in a traumatic way. I didnt graduate high school. ive failed my driving test twice. on top of all that my relationship (which i guess i jinxed by calling it the only good thing in my life that came of 2020) seems to be failing. i got pet rats just so i could have something good going but im having problems with that even. my self esteem issues and anxiety are at an all time high and at this point just being awake and having to think about everything is exhausting. i feel like a useless piece of shit whos too sad and scared to do normal things people my age are doing like driving and working and going to college or doing anything at all reall and at this point im just randomly bursting into tears throughout the day. i keep burying myself in comforts like cartoons and youtube and discord but im feeling really really down. id like to note ive never had suicidal thoughts, im just sad and tired"
74,Why do the smallest things make me so angry?,"A few years ago I never used to get stressed or angry. I very much had a ""do I look like I give a f***"" attitude.

3 years on and the smallest annoyance, off comment of complexity in my day sends me in to a flying rage. To be honest I saw it getting worse and worse as it started off as I started to get more stressed which turned in to anger which turned in to a hair trigger.

The likely cause is 4 years ago I had my first child, now I have 2. I'm also in a career which I don't like and it leaves me no time to pursue a career change.

Now I'm not worried about delving deeper in to the issues, id just like some advice on how to not go from 0 to 100 in a split second."
75,Questions about diagnosis and therapy,"I've got quite a few questions, so I'm sorry if this is annoying. I'm 13, if that helps.

What if I know I have a mental illness, but I don't know what I have? How would I be able to get diagnosed like that?

Am I going to be able to find a therapist if I don't know what's going on in my head? 

How much money would it cost? (In the U.S.)

If I am able to find a therapist that I can afford, are they required to tell my parents what I told them? 

These questions will help a lot. Thank you!"
76,I’m finally getting help.,"After years of hopelessness  and months since my last therapy season, I have finally found the one who can actually help me! This morning, I had my first zoom session with her. Unlike the previous 4 therapists for the last 13 years, I was able to be more open and expressive of my depression and trauma. For some reason, I was more comfortable despite crying so much. I am actually looking forward to have my weekly sessions with her."
77,Does this feeling/state of mind have a name? (22M),"TL;DR: Sometimes when I'm upset/overwhelmed, I become semi-verbal, slow, kind of empty-feeling, and stim more. Thinking, speaking, and moving require a lot of effort. I can recognize when it happens, but I have no control over it. Does anyone have any experience with this? What is this called?



Sometimes when I am anxious, depressed, uncomfortable, or overwhelmed, I have this feeling.  I feel slow, distant, and kind of empty. I can see what's happening around me and hear what people are saying, but I feel like it takes so much effort to process things and respond. I just grunt, point, or shake/nod my head instead of speaking. I can say single words softly if I force myself, but it requires a lot of effort when I'm like that. When I think, the thoughts are slow and simple. I also don't like moving around in this state, if my partner is around, they will lead me around by the hand. I also stim more in this state, and can become focused on small things, like staring very intensely at a gecko on a wall.


I can't shake myself out of this state, but it wears off once I've been able to calm down a bit. Back in highschool, I thought I was just doing it for attention so that my friends would take care of me. But it still happens when no one is around, and even when I don't want attention. I have no control over it. It doesn't happen too often anymore, but its annoying when it does. 


Is this a shutdown? Just dissociation? Something else? I don't know if I am on the autism spectrum or not. I haven't seen a psychiatrist for 5 years. They used to talk to me about depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and ADHD but never wanted to be upfront with me about a diagnosis because I was a minor at the time."
78,Contamination OCD - any advice on stopping compulsions?,"contamination OCD is slowly taking over my life. i'm starting to go every single day, multiple times a day of over-excessively washing my hands, my bedding, disinfecting my phone, my laptop, my glasses, my hydroflask, everything. EVERYDAY. it takes up so many hours of the day and my hands are cracking and drying from all of the soap and disinfectant wipes and chemicals i'm constantly touching and using.

for example, i walk by my older brother's dirty clothes hamper in the hallway with my phone in my hand on the way to the kitchen to grab water, and i automatically think my phone is dirty from walking by it (not touching the hamper btw). maybe it's because he's a guy and i think of like cum rag socks and shit idk?!!? btw i'm a female. and then if my phone touches my bed, now i think my bed is dirty and idk it's just super fucking exhausting and debilitating, but i can't NOT clean my things without feeling my shit is contaminated.

pls help. any and all advice would be appreciated.

and no i cannot afford to see a therapist and get meds. currently unemployed bc covid. 😭"
79,"Experiencing absolute random panic attacks, can’t even leave the house...","Hi everyone, 

Context: I’m a 20 y/o male and I’ve been on 20mg of Lexapro for just over 2 years now. I’m also taking 10mg of Abilify. Before meds I used to have panic attacks often, tons of anxiety and mood swings constantly.

I haven’t had much of a problem as long as I kept on schedule with my meds for over two years. No panic attacks, no bad anxiety, no heavy changes in my mood. 

Out of nowhere I had three panic attacks all consecutively within 10 minutes of eachother while shopping in a mall. I had one completely randomly for the first time in two years in H&amp;M, Aeropostale and then on the line for Hagendaaz. I’m assuming the amount of people walking around and talking must’ve subconsciously triggered something... but I’ve been around large amounts of people in the past with no reaction. 

Ever since that day I’ve been having non stop panic attacks. I’m on medicine, I’m with people who support me, I just don’t understand, I seriously don’t :( 

My psychiatrist said they’re most likely linked to what he calls are hypomanic episodes triggered by environments factors. I feel like I lost control of my mental health, and I feel hopeless now because I can’t even go out without having to worry I’ll have an attack. 

(My personal PA symptoms: heart palpitations, short of breath, scalp/face numbness, my knees lock up, shaking - they usually get to the point where it feels like I might faint but end up not) 

Has anyone gone through something like this or have advice? If so please feel free to share only if you’re comfortable :)"
80,Has anyone managed to seperate work from anxiety?,"Out of habit, I notice that I use anxiety as a way to keep me motivated to do my work during the day, I don't know if I'm able to work without it. But as you can imagine, it makes for a really tiring day. Are there people who work without being anxious? What is that like?"
81,How do I get diagnosed for a mood disorder?,Tried to set up an appointment for a psychiatrist and told me they only take patients on medications. It’s very clear to me I have some sort of mood disorder and just want to know WHAT I have. What professionals are capable of diagnosing me? If you had a bunch of symptoms was it after one appointment? Google actually didn’t help this time.
82,Separation sleep anxiety???,"I’m a teenager and I’m close to being an adult. I still sleep with my mom and it’s quite embarrassing. She had to stay overnight at a relatives house as an emergency and the first thing that popped into my mind was “how am I going to sleep tonight” and here I am on Reddit at 2:43am I am a early sleeper I usually got to bed around 9:30pm or 10:00pm and I fell asleep at midnight only to wake back up 20 minutes later. I don’t understand why I can’t sleep alone! I live with my family and I’m not alone in my house. It’s so frustrating to me because It feels like I physically can’t do it. 6 months ago I was not like this. I could sleep on my own and actually got better sleep when I did sleep alone but I’ve developed such a bad habit to where I can’t sleep tonight. I have such an attachment to my mom and I really need to get over it because it’s preventing me from sleeping. I tried doing research but it was all about young children having sleep problems and kinda a separation anxiety kind of thing. So if anyone who has experienced this could please give me some advice this would be greatly appreciated :(
- someone who just wants to be able to sleep alone"
83,"For me, one of the toughest things about being an adult is not having anyone to talk to when I am struggling.","I feel like if I just had the chance to talk out some of my anxieties that I would be able to move past them, however, I feel like if I were to tell people about my fears that they would get annoyed by me, or use them against me, or see me as lesser because of them. So I keep it all inside and act like nothing is wrong while those struggles become much bigger issues. For example, I get afraid that my relationship with a person has turned sour, so I won't answer their texts, or I am afraid that I will get a bad email, so I don't check my email. In both of these cases, I fear something and try to avoid that thing only for what I fear to transpire. If I could just tell someone ""hey I am scared of what will happen"" and get it off my chest then I wouldn't dig these holes. If I went to a counselor could they help me sort some of these things out or is that not in their job description? Do you also feel this way, and if so how do you work through it? It has really felt good to finally get this out."
84,"I Feel Terrible, but It Feels Like It Doesn't Mean Anything","Compared to what all my friends, family, or anyone at all are going through, I feel like my troubles are insignificant. I hate talking about issues with my friends because they have even worse mental health and I'll just make them worry... They don't need to be concerned over me and thinking they did something because I'm having a little bit of a rough time... 

I've been trying really hard to get over what happened at my last job. I've talked about it before, and I've been told I'm over reacting and that my past experience is nothing compared to 'the real world'. The managers used to talk down to me constantly, talk and laugh about me behind my back, and talked to me like I wasn't as smart as everyone else. Everytime I would be eating during break and they passed by, they would make comments like, ""Are you gonna eat all that"" or look at me weird. I was even called fat by two of my managers the day before I put my two weeks in. No matter how hard I tried and how much effort I put in, they only talked about everything I did, or was doing wrong. I was pushing myself so hard it made me sick every day. I stuck with them for over a year but it wasn't enough. I was never enough.

I quit and started my new job four months ago. I love the place, but we're so understaffed that I ended up having to take over closing shift long term last week. I never got proper training on how to do it, I've just been going off what I've seen from other people. I have to go through dinner rush with two other people and one of them is even newer than I am and hasn't grasped onto everything yet. I get so overwhelmed every day trying to keep everyone productive and on track, while also pushing myself to my limit. I'm being thrown into work having to take control while my manager is out smoking or chatting with coworkers-- only to come back half an hour to a whole hour later, disappointed that our times are bad and asking why we didn't call for help. We do. It hurts not being good enough. I'm always not able to do something before I leave after because I'm already there an hour past my alloted time trying to get all this shite done. I'm under constant stress for 7 to 12 hours every day, six days a week with the pressure of myself too.

I can't do anything without being disappointed with myself. My self-esteem is very low, both with my physical appearance and my work ethic. I stay late every day to do extra stuff. I try my hardest to seem happy to keep morale up, but at the end of the day, I'm just exhausted. No matter what I do, I feel like I wake up with a low battery, ashamed of the work I did the day before. I've lost interest in things I loved, I'm irritable, and I still feel like a waste of time and money for my workplace. I eat, sleep, and work.

I usually get told, ""This is what real life is like."" and similar things like that all the time. I get brushed off because it's not important, I'm really starting to believe that it isn't important, that no one cares, or I'm probably just a total wimo. I'll get used to it at some point, but right now I feel like I don't deserve to talk about it, or have the right, because so many people are going through much more than me. I'm afraid I sound too complainy here as well, but I really  wanted to vent. I know this is what life is gonna be like, that everyone feels like this. I just want to be heard. Thanks for taking the time to read this."
85,Really insecure about my hair and eye color,I was born with blonde hair and blue eyes witch I get from my mother and maternal grandfather and grandmother (german/nordic) but during puberity my hair and eyes became brown witch I got from my father. I really REALLY do not want to end up like my father (Italian) he has black hair dark brown eyes and I have always seen blond hair and blue eyes as very beutiful features. I really do not want to end up like my father I have seen the men on his side and they do not turn out pretty for example my father is overweight has bad skin black hair and is not something I don't want to be. this is really messing with me and I don't know what to do.
86,Embarrassed with my Therapist,"I feel like after all this time and I haven't gotten better, I've started lie to her (I guess to make her feel relieved) about me being totally fine, if I admitted that I'm broken more than ever I'm afraid I'll have failed her somehow?

DAE feel this kinda way?"
87,i wish my friends understood just how bad of a state i’m in,"i have nightmares about being killed or being forced to escape nearly everytime i fall asleep if i even get to sleep. i vomit acid almost daily. i struggle with wondering if i should keep living or if i should continue making plans to commit suicide. my mind feels like it’s in a fog that’s only getting thicker. the only thing i enjoy now is staring out the window. i feel shame in myself for being this way. everyday i’m just thankful that things aren’t worse for me. but i just wish they realized that i’m not just down in the dumps. and i’m not just a little stressed. 

they’re good friends i think, and it’s not their fault that they might not see what i’m going through, but sometimes it really sucks to feel like my pain is being undermined."
88,do i have bpd?,"Hey, I am not sure if i am doing the whole danning kruger thing but I see some of myself in some of the BPD stuff i have read, like the feeling diassociated or simply lacking in emotions. i can feel happy and often do but go through long streches of the day where i just dont feel.  I find it exceptionally hard to build bonds with others."
89,I'm 90% sure I'm a sociopath. what next?,"ok so, im pretty sure I'm a sociopath. I follow almost all of the symptoms, and looking back, I hardly notice or care abt when my friends are upset or let's say, had a pet fiend recently. I try to comfort them, but inside, I really dont care at all. I feel pity in very rare occasions. I know this makes me sound like a asshole, but it's the truth

I really dont know how to tell my friends this. how should I? my old friends which I dont hang out with anymore would probably be a bit weirded out but accept it. my new ones will probably be skeptical and think I'm lying for attention or something. help?"
90,I’m going to fight as hard as I can for my parents.,I have scared them before and I never want them to have to worry about me like that again
91,Can I please get some advice,"Hi, im currently a junior in high school and I wanted some advice. I recently came to have everything that I wanted, but I’m still not happy. I have no problems left unsolved, and I just got on winter break, so I should be feeling great. But I’m still not happy. I cant remember when this feeling started, since I was always joyful when I was younger. I always make dumb jokes and talk alot to stop myself about thinking of certain thoughts. But when I’m alone, I tend to break down. I initially hide my constant sadness with humor and other distractions. Does anyone have advice to get rid of this feeling. I don’t think I’m depressed, so does anyone know what is happening to me?"
92,"Cute, vulnerable things make me sad?","I don’t know exactly how to describe it. Just when I see something cute or vulnerable I get such a sad feeling. I start to think about how they are probably going to die a death they don’t deserve or even understand. I wish I could protect everything from the harsh reality of mortality but I can’t and it drives me crazy. It’s bad with my own pets, I can’t bear the fact that they are going to die and not even fully understand what’s happening. I see videos of cute animals and I can’t even feel genuinely happy because my mind is like “yeahhhhh they are going to die tragically, so get very sad about it and maybe even cry” I just want it to stop, but I don’t even know why it happens."
93,A problem that's never been solved,"I don't know how to start this off because I rarely speak about my actual past or health issues so here it goes. I have a huge fucking problem on my hands. I met someone and fell in love with them and she has helped me along our three year journey by talking me through these awful experiences I had. Which led me to realize that there is something really fucked about me. She is the only being on this planet who knows the honest me, the person I've been presenting to the world is a fucking sham. In our relationship I would let thinks slip about my life and experiences that would raise her eyebrows. I didn't think they were such a big deal... but come to find out the shit really fucked me up.

I grew up with my mom dad and brother. Father is the police, and mom is in the medical field. My childhood was rough. Molestation from a cousin. Physical and verbal abuse from my father and a silent mother. My parents sent me to primarily white schools because ""they were the best"" news flash they fucking weren't those kids and teachers made sure to make me feel like the odd one out, on all occasions lol it was fucking rough. I was labeled hostile since I was 6 from a teacher at a meeting with my parents. I have been lonely all my life no real friends and a brother but a brother with a mental disability so we still to this day never really connect the only thing he knows is that if anyone touches a hair on  his head I will bury them alive. In his eyes I am tough big mean and angry, his protector no one fucks with him or you'll fuck with me. I have done terrible things to people for messing with him.. i have choked someone until they nearly passed out for being extremely rude to him(which now my wonderful fiancé has had many discussions of why I was wrong and now i agree with her). All this anger i have i can trace back to my father. HE has huge shoes to fill you know? HE's 6 foot, he has muscles that can shame the rock and everyone in my family is weary of him. He has always been a problem to me... from beating me with belts.. choking me a foot of the ground on a wall, throwing me across a room, getting in my face in front of my fiancé... this is a real good one if you get triggered easily please don't read further.       I was going through a really tough time the fist high school I went to so I cut myself... bad move on my part because when I got home i was placed in a push up position and hit every time i completed a push up. Where was my mother during this? in the house but fucking silent. She makes me upset because I feel like I am a strong woman so why can't she be strong for once and stop letting my father walk all over her and my brother. My father is a loose cannon he uses his size to his advantage, his screams shake the fucking walls that is how big this man is. I have caught myself in many situations where i thought i would need to grab something to hurt or kill him before he hit me.  I can go on and on about how much shit this man has done but that's for another day. The point is I realized later on this affected me so much to the point where I feel lost now. I have no real sense of self, I cant focus, I can't sleep, I also abuse marijuana often(i think weed can be good if used but not relied on..im not a weed hater just wanna leave that there) I just quit two days ago though so yay me. I think the lack of self, came from my parents isolating me(I wasn't allowed to go anywhere or leave the house without them present) I grew up just watching tv and playing video games.. I learned mannerisms form tv characters because I didn't have any examples at home(tyler durden, wolverine, e.t.c.) I know it sounds silly but if no one is around you and your father plays video games all fucking day, its hard to get to know yourself because you can't really talk to anyone and work through ideas you have or experiences you've had. So i grew up alone basically at home as well.

  In my second high school I really capitalized on this idea of a cool, bad ass, version of myself a girl who was not scared of ANYTHING... so everyone thought i was the shit and for once i felt very good about myself..until i met a woman. this woman was like me in the sense of how she grew up (isolated, and family trauma although hers was probably worse then mine) so you could imagine the raging toxic energy that brought forth in me. I would show up at her house late at night, we would fight, we would make up, we would do drugs together, we were not a couple but we were  intimate with each other but i made it clear i wasn't ready for a relationship at that time. I ended up liking her very much, but I know myself, I can be bad and terrible like my father, manipulative and uncaring at times so I would try to stop talking to her and ignore her but she had her own issues (ocd, anxiety, depression)  so it was hard to let go of someone who felt that they needed you and i at the time  felt so callus i wasn't thinking about her feelings at all, i regret this heavily today she did not deserve this. I have nightmares about my behavior towards her (to clarify I never put my hands on her i just wasn't nice or empathetic sometimes) its been a few years, I've wanted to apologize, but I doubt shed hear it. After all its been some time so i hope she has moved on and is happier now. With me in her life i would've burned both of us out. 

I am getting off the point with all this backstory. The problem is, that I am in my very early 20's I live with my fiancé but I fucking feel lost and shitty, STILL!!! I am not sure why because I worked out all my child hood trauma with my fiancé, I have changed things about myself that needed changing but something still feels wrong. I feel disconnected from everything I still feel numb to everything, i have been in a funk since i was a wee baby, and I don't understand how to win this mental game with myself..... there are days where I think to myself if my brother wasn't autistic and if i didn't promise to take care of him when i get older...I would blow my fucking head off. To see that sentence typed out is devastating but its true. I want to get better for myself, brother, fiancé. Especially my fiancé she deserves the world and if I have to move mountains for that woman i will. If something were to ever happen to her Id break. I don't understand what I  have to do to get better, I've talked through my issues, ive tried weed, mediation, journaling, nothing brings me peace.  I fear that one day im going to lose it and get worse. What should be my next step?"
94,Healing neglect and trauma,"I`m in my late 20s and have a lot of trauma due to childhood neglect and toxic family members. My mom is the worst one. She repeatedly nags other family members and raises her voice (which is very irritating to listen to). She is Asian and Christian which is a bad combo IMO. She has made me refuse multiple jobs I was hired for because they weren't good enough for her or my brother's standards. My job developer has told me to stand up for myself and do what I want but it is hard when I am dependent on my family and my mom starts arguments when I try to be assertive. My dad is ok, but I believe my mom's behavior has traumatized him a lot as well. My brother tries to be on my side sometimes, but he doesn't understand my trauma and thinks that I'm lazy and I need to work harder. He is also strict about what jobs I can and can't work. Also my friend believes he is being gang stalked (but he isn't currently worried much about it) and I worry about it happening to me. I am seeing a psychologist but I also need to find other ways to deal with my situation, other than people telling me to take meds. I need advice on what to do, thanks for reading."

I’ve been skipping meals lately, though I’ve always had a healthy, low fat diet. What’s up with that? I’m always afraid of gaining weight, it’s been this way for a couple weeks now."

98,Internet trolls won't stop sending me hate for defending children against their bullying,"I'm super tired and its really late so I'll be shortening the story somewhat. I also abstain from using names here but sure most of y'all can figure out who it is, the only reason why is being that i don't want ppl to get unnecessarily involved in mentally draining drama online and approach w a bias before hearing my point :( Tldr at end

 this YouTuber who I quite enjoy has come under attack for faking videos recently, and I went thru the facts and figures and made the informed decision that yes, that is probably true. Let's hold them accountable! The problem is the fanbase is hella young, like 12-16 being the majority (but there's also a big community of adults who usually interact w only each other for several obv reasons), so this created a problem where the YouTubers haters (who they have a lot of since w/all successful ppl do regardless of how good of a person they are, which for reasons too long to explain I still believe they are) saw this as a chance to like HOUND (i mean like send threats and spam whole accounts) their super young fans who are blindly defending him (again, wrong to do but jesus chirst they are like 10, think abt how stupid we were all as 10-year-olds esp with our idols/ppl we look up to). 

When you look under the creator's tags regarding this """"scandal"""" it's all spam hate accounts created for the purpose of trolling and getting a reaction out of these young children knowing that many of them will and do defend the YouTuber from hate (being human nature right? again not excusing them for not listening to the unbiased factual people trying to defend the integrity of the community in which this YouTuber, by cheating, is tarnishing, but reminding you of how people esp children inherently want to give their idols the benefit of the doubt). Like open the tag and boom 40 tweets from the past min all w accounts w bios like ""stay mad / account made to start beef"" w like a fake pfp GUARANTEED. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly I saw this comment that really irked me so bad I gave in and tried to reason politely, I said like yes what they did was wrong and horrible but please don't be toxic, keep in mind these ppl you are sending piles of hate towards are like 10-year-old girls, unable to mentally get over 50 of you telling them to go k\*ll herself because she replied to one of your hate tweets. I could go on forever about how creators w/a large demographic of young teen girls are targeted by these 45 y/o men foaming at the mouth to wait at their computers all day w the notification on just to spam posts with ""cringe"" and ""stan culture go die"" and how a creators work is inherently diminished as less than due to that but that's a convo for later..

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the end of the story is that since I replied to that (1) tweet! (and he stopped answering since i countered literally everything he said, also after using memes to try and make me angry and divert myself from fact to emotion) like a billion of this YouTuber's (who I have called out on my account several times to take accountability and for his fans (me included) to accept things objectively!) intense and very large anti-group has repeatedly filled my notifs with hate😞Usually I'm pretty thick-skinned working in retail and all but i've never received SO much like negativity at once and it's keeping me up w anxiety nights and nights (during university finals). I'm constantly shaking now hearing the notif sound but cant bring myself to delete Twitter because I genuinely don't see anyone calling these dipsh\*ts out for bullying these young fans who don't (but should) know any better. Anyone can help me out here or give me some sort of way to find peace? I already struggle w/intense depression and anxiety and only recently got twitter, not understanding that it was a basic breeding ground for toxicity and anti-culture. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: I called out toxic hate on twitter since I can't just watch children get hounded by hate messages and now the trolls are after me, provoking angry reactions and flooding my notifs, which due to anxiety i can't turn off. I already suffer from bad depression and anxiety and they are keeping me up for nights in a row, causing my mental health to hit the floor. I'm constantly shaking whenever i hear the notif sound and can't even focus on uni finals w/0 hrs of sleep and anxiety at an all-time high. How do i find peace in this situation? :( sry if wrong sub reddit"
99,Please help me! I don't know what to do!," Right now, I don't know if my/our name is on our undergraduate research.

As you all know, I am a graduating student. Because of the Covid-19 Pandemic, I cannot entirely give my hundred percent focus on our undergraduate research. And I am struggling with my mental health. Since March, I am in the province, and my things - laptop and notes - were in the city. We don't have a personal computer in our house, and the computer shops are closed due to the pandemic. For five months, I only relied on my phone, which is not also in good shape. It was last August when I went to the city to picked my things. I found out that my laptop was not working. I tried going to the repair shop, hoping that they will fix it. But they told me that I should buy a new one since the parts they need were like the price of a new laptop. We don't have enough money to buy a new laptop. But my uncle (my mom's sibling) spent his salary on buying me a new one last month (November).

If you're wondering if I give help with our undergraduate research. The answer is yes. I still manage to provide journals and articles that can help in our study. I can edit a little since I only used my phone. Last month, I assisted in our research, revising the manuscript. But one of my group mates got angry and yelled at us. She said that we're not helping with our research. I wanted to tell her that I don't have a laptop, so I just started editing last month. But she's too angry that I GOT SCARED. After the defense, revisions came. We were revising our paper, and she got mad again. She cursed at us, telling us that we are **STUPID**. **""If you're stupid, do not  compare yourself with \*\*\*\*.""** Our promoter said that it is **our fault for teaming up with someone who is smart and that we need to think if our effort is comparable to their effort.**

And it hits me, **I AM VERY STUPID. I AM WORTHLESS. ALL THE THINGS I DID WERE NOT ENOUGH.** I started to feel depressed and question my self-worth. I've been traumatized because I am not comfortable when people cursed me."

101,"My mom hit my brother, what the actual hell do I do?","My family is pretty dysfunctional. My dad is just silent, and my mom and my little brother often fight. They usually scream at each other and say really terrible things. I, as someone who also has anxiety, think that this is really hard and usually tell them to stop screaming. I’m the one who gets myself involved in everyone’s shit hehe.

Today me and my brother actually started fighting because I said something. Basically I told him that I wanted him to be quiet when I was in online class because he had screamed at my mom REALLY loud. He basically said that he doesn’t care and that no one asked for my opinion?? He also said like what are you gonna do about it and shit💀

Basically he then proceeded to kind of push me because he needed something behind me, it wasn’t very aggressive but it was like very rude and he stepped over the line. I starred into his soul and said fuck you and walked away.

My mom, who saw this, got really mad that he had pushed me and kind of hit him on his back??? Like she hit his back? It wasn’t very aggressive and I don’t think it was very hard, like I don’t think it hurt that much physically. But my brother was like omg you do realize you just hit me. And idk my brother has anger issues, was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I think he’s very mentally broken. And I’m always worried that he feels left out in the family just because he’s kinda gotten into a lot of trouble the past years (he’s 15 and I’m 17 btw). And I sent him a text saying how sorry I am that mom did that, and he has apologized to me actually, and my mom is very very sorry.

But I just don’t know what the actual hell im going to do now that my mom really went THERE. Like even tho I’ve wanted to move away from home for years, everything has always been verbal. I know it won’t happen again but the shame I feel, the guilt feeling like I caused it and how terrible I feel for both my mom and my brother is so hard on me. And my anxiety has gotten better this year but I feel like it’s gonna get bad again after this. Does anyone have any input like I don’t know how to act?"

103,Have you ever felt unable to feel things?,I come from a history of anxiety and panic attacks that are moderately under control. But on the past few weeks I’m in a state where I can’t feel things or I’m unable to show people I’m feeling things. At the same time anything that will get on my nerves makes me cry a little. So I’m unable to feel and yet I guess I have lots of feelings just hiding in here??

105,We put my dog down at 9:38 PM last night and I need to cope somehow,"I miss her so much, we had to put her down because of her kidney+heart problems. she was such a little size even though she was 16, I hated to see her looking like it was time for her to go. She didn’t even know where she was or what was happening. It was horrible to watch because she would look at you while squinting and it looked like she didn’t know who you were. I’ve got no sleep because I’ve been up crying all night and I can’t stop thinking about it. I need to cope somehow."
106,For the 3rd year in a row I couldn't finish my last year of school because I'm afraid of school and people,"20 years old m,  I have been diagnosed with depression 4 years ago and I have had it for longer ( in my opinion) and back than it was awful, I self harmed in the school bathroom and was a mess so it made me isolate myself from everything,  when I was first diagnosed I starter taking meds but I hated taking them ( I kinda enjoyed feeling down)  and I was going to a psychologists every week, I lied constantly at them that I felt good and I was talking my meds ( I couldn't control my lying) and as soon as I stepped outside of the psychologist I went back to my depressed self, that went on for 2 years until covid hit and it made me feel worse, I wold not leave my house at all for months and just made me want to self harm again ( I stopped self harming in 2018 and did it again this year). When classes started again I got another chance to finish some assignments I had left but I can't mentally leave my house because it makes my anxiety and depression go on overdrive, I feel soo guilty of my behavior, and I miss my old self, I was a responsible person and super happy and helpful to others, now I'm just a ghost, I want to fix this but I'm stuck, I'm scared and have been contemplating suicide every day now, even writing this makes me awful, I just want to delete everything and go back to my bed, I'm sorry for waisting your time reading this, I just don't know what  to do and I'm scared.
Love you all, be safe."
107,"I can't connect, I feel like I'm slipping from reality and I don't know why or how.","Quick Heads up; 
I'm a 20F and I'm in treatment for CPTSD and Depression, I'm consider a Highly Sensitive Person  and live in a (now) stable family enviorment, and am attending college to be an Assistant in Media and Design.

I've been regularly attending 1-on-1 Therapy sessions with pretty good success and generally consider myself on a great road to recovery.

But for the past two weeks I've had the strangest expirience that has thrown me completely over again.

I feel like I am slipping further from reality each day - why am I feeling this way?

Everything feels so strange all of a sudden and I don't understand why, I haven't done anything wrong as far as I can tell, I was doing alright.
I've been taking my meds, getting sleep, doing chores and talking to people.

Yet I feel so disconnected from the people around me, like I can't click with them on more than a basic level.
It feels shallow and I feel awful for it.
But I want to connect so badly.

All at once my life feels performative, I keep asking myself what I'm doing and why I'm doing it even though I know those questions don't lead to anything.

I suddenly feel afraid that I might never be able to express everything I want to, nothing, no medium feels sufficient.

I have this feeling of a deep dread and anxious hyperactivity in my chest, almost like a supressed panic.

The imagery I come up with to describe what im feeling to friends seems stranger each day and I feel like it keeps growing more cryptic.

Today for example I described my Migraine as making my brain feel like four disks spinning rapidly while swinging in and out of each other like pendulums,
And though I can't explain to you how that made perfect sense to me I know it didn't to anyone else because it's so far removed from actual sensation that it's a pointless image at that point.

 What the hell am I even trying to get across?

I feel like I'm loosing my self in my thoughts."
108,I’m scared of what I see in my nightmares,"I’ve had nightmares for probably a year or so and I’m these nightmares, I watch from the third person as I kill and rip apart every single person I care about. It’s gotten to the point where I’m afraid to touch anyone out of fear that the version of me I see in that nightmare becomes all too real. My friends all tell me I’m a good person but the nightmare is making it hard for me to believe. To the point where now, I’m afraid to even meet new people out of fear that they’ll start appearing and dying."
109,CoViD Has Helped Me Learn How To Stand Up For Myself,"I grew up with a psychologically and emotionally abusive mom, and a dad who rationalizes not standing up to her, casually acting like it's just something we have to grit our teeth and bear. The insidious part for me, is that my disability complicates things. I’m paraplegic, but it only affects me in terms of infrastructure. I’m intelligent, hard working, and accomplished, but a lot of inaccessible systems in society can make it difficult to have a life without a little bit of help. There’s also a common trend with disability where you have “the team” that supports you. So you’re discouraged from doing anything that the team disagrees with. I think on some level my mom knows this, because her biggest threat is to pull her support from me unless I accept her behavior.

In the last year I managed to get away from them, move out of the country, work, pay rent, get through an abusive relationship by myself, and survived 6 more months stranded in the country during a pandemic, with no stable living situation. I’m coming back home next month as my visa is up, and it’ll likely be more difficult in my home country, which is less accessible than my current one. But I’m just not scared of her anymore. Want to corner me in the car and threaten to kick me out on the street because you don’t like me standing up for myself? Kick me out of the car. Want to threaten to kick me out of the house? Kick me out of the house. I’ll be fine."

113,Tips on How to Get Therapy the First Time? (USA),"Hi guys, I'm sorry if this is a super common kind of post, but I'm a college student senior (USA), and I genuinely do not know where to start to get therapy. I'm also having a hell of a time getting myself to look things up to figure it out. 

I'm in a weird situation, because I'm split between 2 cities (college vs home towns) and I also only have one semester left of school until I graduate. I'm still on my parents' health insurance too, but I've generally not wanted to talk with them about mental health things much for various reasons - but I'm also not fully against involving them.

I was wondering if any of yall had any tips on what to do for my particular situation?"
114,Extreme change in food preferences,"Has anybody ever experienced an extreme change in food preferences? 
I don’t know if it’s being stuck in the house all day or what but covid has made my relationship with food rocky.

I used to adore cooking and trying new recipes constantly. I was excited and it tasted so good. March - I got covid and lost my sense of taste for a month. I no longer enjoyed cooking. I eventually got my taste back. In July - my taste buds changed. Most things I cooked tasted like a stuffy cupboard.. needless to say I didn’t enjoy food again. And maybe I’m just bad at bounce back but since then I barely enjoy eating even though most things taste normal to me. And I cannot stomach meat. I gag at the sight of so many things now and I just don’t want to eat.

I am not depressed. My taste has returned to normal. I can eat meat if we go out to eat (which is why I think it’s mental and not a physical doctor thing). But I cannot cook it. But it’s not just meat.. I feel like the only things I eat now are sugar, bread and cheese. This is vastly different from my previous diet which was rich in veggies and fruits and meats and complex grains. I want my old diet back! But... I’m gagging/not in the mood for any of it. 

It’s been over a month."
115,I just don’t know what to do,I’ve been anxious and depressed for years now. Just when I think I’m making progress it feels like I retreat a few steps. People keep telling me that “things will get better” but what if they never do? It’s been 2 years since my last mental breakdown and honestly since then my life is still terrible. How do I not just give up? What’s the point in waiting for things to “get better”?
116,He thinks self harm is funny...,"I accidentally cut my finger and when I told my parents it was on a shaving razor, my step dad laughed and said ""oh no she's self harming now hahahah"" I sarcastically said ""yeahhh of course"" but this has really discouraged me in telling my parents that I have self harmed in the past. Not sure what I should do."
117,here we are now,"Hi i don't know whether or not this is the right place to post this, but i'm feeling so fucking weird i want to start hurting people soon. Every single person looks at me like i'm a fucking animal, anyone who i ever interact with is so judgemental  about anything i do. I try to be friendly and helpful to people but at the end of the day they still look at me like i'm the weirdest and most disgusting person on the planet. They may not say it but i can always tell what they're thinking about me. Pretty ironic that i'm asking people online for help but maybe someone has similar feelings or whatever and can tell me what to do cause i'm getting sick of thsi shit"

# -My Current Life-

I've   never before talked about this in this kind of depth and buried a  great  deal of what happened for many, many years. There's likely more  that I  cannot remember / have pushed into the recesses of my brain. I  often  blame myself, or my lack of perception, or &lt;insert excuse to  somehow  make this all my fault&gt;. I'm aware that's very common and  that it  isn't my fault, yet those thoughts still persist despite this  knowledge.

I've  also been through  consoling, therapy, drugs, alcohol, etc etc all of my  life (I quit the  illegal drugs and alcohol in my early 30's. I'm now  39.). None of it  has really helped and my life has been reduced to that  of a hermit. I  have severe agoraphobia with panic attack disorder (as  well as PTSD,  ADHD, insomnia and I highly suspect a little bit of autism  somewhere in  there), so I only leave my house when absolutely  necessary.

I  had started teaching  myself programming several years ago but the  anxiety has gotten so bad  the last year or so that I simply cannot  concentrate for any length of  time. I've been on disability for the  last 5 years due to the severe  stress/panic/anxiety/shaking/etc. that I  get whenever I had to  communicate with folks for any length of time.  The ""plan"" was that  someday, I can make enough money with solo game  development to finally  get off of disability and ""make something of  myself"". This still has yet  to pass and seems hopeless at this  particular moment of my life. The  depression from all this, and the  need to depend on the government, has  left me in a dark place that I  simply cannot find my way out of. I'm in  no danger of self-harm or  anything like that but my life seems  increasingly less meaningful and I  really don't know the answer to this.

Anyhow,   I wanted to give you a little background on where my life is now  before  diving in to where my life was then. I guess I'm writing all  this  simply because I don't know what else to do with my life. Perhaps   someday, somehow this will help someone and bring some meaning to my   existence.

# -My Biological Father-

I   was born in Cleveland, Ohio a premature baby of 9 weeks back in 1981.   At this time, I was in real danger of not surviving, as a few organs   (most notably my lungs) had apparently not fully developed. I spent 3   weeks in an oxygen tank (which ruined my eyesight, from what I've been   told) without being able to be held or any actual touch. They had those   glove-things that you could stick your hands into the tank with... this   was the extent of my human contact for those first crucial weeks. I   often wonder how much of all that has attributed to my social failings /   overall mental health.

My father  I  know only by name and very little else. I have several half-siblings  I  don't even know the names of, let alone any way of contacting them.  He  (my Dad) left my mother a couple of months after my birth. Details  are  very sparse about what exactly happened. My mother doesn't talk  about it  and I've not been able to find out much from anyone. She  moved, with  me, to a very small Pennsylvania community where she grew  up and I spent  the first 7 or 8  years of my life there. I obviously  remember nothing  from those first several years and don't have a clue  what my dad even  looks like. It could be worse (and it did get worse)  but this all still  haunts me.

# -My Adopted Father-

This   is where the trouble really started. When I was 5 or 6, my mother had   married her high school sweetheart, who had then adopted me. I very   vaguely remember being in court for this and telling the judge I wanted   him to be my daddy. Afterwards, he had got me a toy shotgun that fired   nerf pellets (I remember it being very realistic... strange gift for a   5-6 year old).

Some length of  time  after all this, my first solid memories, things had gone to hell   quickly. My dad (I'll just call him ""Steve"", not his real name for the   record.) became (or had been all along, I'm not sure) an alcoholic. I   remember vividly him yelling and hitting my mother all the time. These   beatings often came my way too. He had a leather belt with studded holes   he often used. Steve also liked using a 2x4 slab of wood he had  hanging  in the stairway leading to the basement with the words ""The  Peacemaker""  carved and burnt into the wood. I still remember how it  smelled. I  remember the sound of the basement door opening. He'd call  me and my  mother all sorts of things and the beatings were relentless. I  was told  to tell people I had fallen down the stairs (no one once had  questioned  the near-constant bruises I had).

One   particularly bad day, Steve had been beating my mother as per the  norm.  This time was a lot more violent than the previous ones I have  memory  of. He ended up grabbing his favorite shotgun and threatening my  mom  with it. I ran to her when I saw this and (I still can't believe  this  part and it still terrifies and disgusts me to this day) seeing  me, she  grabbed me and used me as a human shield to put between her and  Steve.  The shotgun was pointed between the both of us, being loaded  moments  earlier. Things are really fuzzy after this all happened. I'm  not sure  how long passed before my memories resume.

After   this event and &lt;insert length of time I'm uncertain of with  whatever  happening that I have no memory of&gt;, she ended up divorcing  him. We  moved into a small studio apartment, her and I. This would be  the  happiest moment of my life. It's all been downhill from here. We  used to  stay up late watching MTV and VH1 (back when they actually  played  music), Wrestling matches (Jake the Snake Roberts era), crappy  action  movies, and my first taste of horror flicks. She would laugh,  sing, and  was the happiest I've ever seen her as well.

This   went on from the time I was 8 or so until I was 12. She returned to   Steve very briefly somewhere in there, getting pregnant with my   half-sister in the process. My sister and I don't speak. She witnessed   the proceeding abuses but never was a major part of them. I'm thankful   for that much. Steve spoiled the living hell out of her, turning her   into a spoiled, money-grabbing, vengeful and spiteful person. She   reminds me so much of Steve's worst personality traits that we don't   communicate whatsoever.

A year   ago, Steve went into the backyard in the middle of the night, shotgun in   hand, and ended his life. This was 30 years after the abuse and   everything that transpired after. To this day, I don't know if I'm glad   or if I'm sad that he's gone. I feel nothing. The only emotions I have   is wondering if he thought of us... if we were the reason he killed   himself. I guess I'll never know the answer to this.

# -My Step-Father-

My   mom eventually married another abusive asshole. We'll call him ""Tony""   (again, not his real name). Tony was an ex-Navy vet, having served for   20 years. He was a hard-ass, no-nonsense, you do what I say or you will   get smacked down kind of fellow. The only nice thing I can say about  him  is that he wasn't an alcoholic. Interestingly enough, he also  sported a  belt with studded holes (must be an abuser thing? odd,  that.).

I  was 12, I think, when  she married Tony. She remained with him long  after I had evicted myself  from all that, I think she divorced when I  was 20. I wasn't speaking  with her during this time and didn't for many  years after. I blamed her  for a lot of the abuse... with Tony, she would  often participate and  encourage him to continue the beatings after he  was ""done"", prompting  more. She woke up drinking and didn't stop until  she slept. She still  drinks like this 20+ years later; I'm fairly  certain this will be the  cause of her death.

Not  much to  say here except for a repeat of the same type of beatings I got  from  Steve. I'd still make up excuses in high school to explain my  marks  from them; I was only asked twice the entirety of my schooling,  though  the marks were nearly ever-present.

The   beatings would occur if I farted the wrong way; there was always a   ""reason"" for them and they happened at least weekly. When I was 15, I   stood up to him once. This was a bad idea. He smacked me full-force   across the head/face, knocking me on the ground. He punched me in the   stomach, threw me into the wall, and choked me, lifting me a good 8   inches off the ground while he did so. I must have passed out; I don't   remember much of anything after this.

# -Drug and Alcohol Abuse-

I   started smoking cigarettes at age 12. I started drinking at 13. I   smoked pot at 14, and it went downhill from there. The moment I turned   16, I went to court and emancipated myself from my mother and Tony. I   quit school that same day and moved in with a gay man in his late 50's   that I worked with at the local grocery store.

From   here, my drug use spiraled fast. I had a direct connection to a  chemist  in Pittsburgh and would get LSD for ""cost"". This ended up being  between  $1.50 and $2 a hit. It was some high-grade liquid geltabs,  often a  green color, and towards the end of my LSD bender I was doing  between  12-15 hits at once.

I  would roam  the streets, alone, in the middle of the night and think my  LSD  thoughts. I once tried to write them down. I wish I still had those   writings, the ramblings of a mad-man with eyes too far open.

My   friend, whom I introduced to this chemist, ended up dealing the LSD   locally. Seeing a few hundred to thousands of hits of acid became   commonplace. I became ""respected"" by the other druggies getting their   hits to escape reality for a while. These were actually good times.

My   friend had unknowingly been selling books (hits in the thousands) to  an  undercover cop for a year. Most likely, I was also under  investigation,  though I never actually sold anything to anyone besides  my very closest  friends. They eventually arrested him and he went to  prison for 10  years. I lost track of him after that and stopped my LSD  use.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the drugs.

I   started doing cocaine and, on several occasions, smoking crack. I did   lines upon lines of pills; uppers, downers, pain meds... it didn't   matter to me so long as it fucked me up. I smoked PCP once. I smoked   meth once. Pot was there from waking until sleeping.

Honestly,   I don't even know if I was working or not during this. I only remember   the drugs. I passed up SO many meaningful relationships, had a few   around me die from suicide and overdosing. One of my very close friends   had spent the night; he seemed very happy and I would NEVER have   expected the next day. He hung himself in a public park from a support   beam in a covered bench area. I know exactly where it is and when I   lived there, would visit the spot often and smoke a bowl in his memory.

I'm often very, very surprised I didn't overdose myself. I remember many, **many**   instances of being so fucked up I'd pass out... the edges of my vision   going black and slowly tunneling in until there was nothing but  silence.

Alcohol  was also a  constant from age 16 to my late 20's. I'm not entirely sure  when I  stopped. I don't remember a lot towards the end. Bit and pieces  of  stories that stood out, things that happened, people I met. Not much   else.

At 18, I had a DUI. I drove a   Saab 900 Turbo, stick shift. I loved that car. One day I had lost my   job at Radio Shack. I don't recall why; either the social anxiety,   panicking, or the drugs/alcohol. Possibly all. Details aren't known. I   decided to drive to a dam I used to hang out at. This was around 10pm or   something. I had a friend with me and we drank a case of beer and a   bottle of... something? I can't remember what now. We were both **very**   intoxicated and decided to drive back to my parents house as I didn't   think we'd make it back to mine. This was only a mile or so away.

I   took a dirt road that I always used to drive on and knew it like the   back of my hand. Unfortunately, they had recently laid down gravel on   one of the (sharp) turns on the road, unbeknownst to me. The police   report said I was going approximated 95 miles an hour around the curve,   lost control hitting the ditch on the right side of the road, then over   correcting into a steep bank on the left side of the road. This sent  me  into a roll, which ejected my friend from the sunroof. He broke his   sternum from this. I remained in the car during the wreck, flipping at   least 6 or 7 times by my estimate (the distance was around 200 feet)  and  smashed the drivers side hard into a tree, crumpling the car into a   mangled mess. I don't know how I survived.

A   period of time later, I emerged from the car (I'm not sure how long I   was out). We both tried to walk back to my house... I didn't get more   than a few dozen feet before realizing how badly I was injured. We   stopped at the nearest house, pounded on the door until someone answered   (this was at least 2am, if not later), and got an ambulance called.   This whole time, blood is gushing my head, covering my face and my eyes.   I still remember my sight as the blood continued to get in my eyes no   matter how much I tried to wipe it away.

I   passed out somewhere in here. I remember waking up for just a few   moments in the ambulance, apologized to them for the trouble I was   causing them, and didn't wake up again until 2 days later. I had severe   head trauma, 7 broken ribs, a chip off my kneecap (which later would be   operated on), and covered from head to toe in cuts and bruises. They   weren't sure if I was going to make it, from what my mother told me.   There was a distinct possibility I was going to be brain dead.

I   remember waking up, seeing my mother at the foot of the bed with her   weeping, and I was completely unable to say anything. My mouth was   trying so hard to form the words I wanted to say but nothing came out. I   passed back out again after this for an unknown length of time.

When   I finally regained consciousness fully, the doctors wanted to keep me   there to run more tests, etc. They refused to let me go outside to have  a  cigarette, so I (very stupidly) checked myself out and walked out.

For   a very long time after that (again, unknown but I'm guessing at least a   year), I had to re-wire the way I thought. I can't really explain it   much better than that. I don't have many memories of this, minus bits   and pieces (a running theme in my life). I just remember having a very   difficult time forming clear thoughts; not like I wanted to anyhow at   that point.

The drugs and alcohol continued after this event, if anything making it all spiral faster.

I   barely ate. I barely slept. I remember only bits and pieces from these   years. I'm not entirely sure how long this lasted. Well into my 20's.

A   part of me misses this. The sweet release of realization that my life   is what it has become. I miss the people. I miss the girls. I miss   laughing at nothing with them, listening to trance music with a blown   mind from the LSD and ecstasy. I miss the naked, pure moments where   nothing mattered but the touch of one another... the whispers... the   free-spirited love that passed between us all. It should be noted that   all this very rarely involved sex; this was more of a mental-fucking. I   miss the smells, the sights, the delightful bliss of a world perceived   through the lens of heavy drugs.

I'm   not proud of any of this. It still has it effects on my life, even   today, 10+ years after quitting that lifestyle. Eventually I stopped   because people I loved were dying from all this; **\_I\_** was dying from all this, a day at a time.

# -Sexual Abuse-

Which   brings me to the darkest and most-hidden-from-myself aspect to my life  -  the sexual abuse. I only remember bits and pieces of all this. I'm  not  sure how long it went on. I'm **VERY** certain there is a lot more to this that I have buried deeper than I can see.... call it a hunch.

The   first instance of this was when my mother was married to Steve. I used   to go to my grandfather's house after school when I was too young to   look after myself (from age 12-14, I think. I'm not entirely sure about   the time-frame). My two uncles also lived there, one of them younger   than me and one of them a few years older.

I   hated it there. It was a half-mile from the house I lived in, in the   absolute middle of nowhere with only two homes on the way there. The   house was derelict, decrepit, smelly, every possible inch of it had   cracked, peeling paint. The yard was covered in junk, old tractors that   no longer worked, motorbikes and bicycles long-rusted from the rain, a   junkyard dog that my uncles often ridiculed and, on more than one   occasion, kicked. I hated the second floor; junk from many years of   god-knows-what crammed into 3 rooms up to the ceiling. I hated the   smells, something I can still smell even now as I type this.

They   had cattle they raised for a slaughterhouse auction every year. My   uncles (and my grandfather, probably on more than one occasion but one   that I remember) used to walk the length of the fence and use a cattle   prod on any cows that were around. They would laugh their asses off at   this.

To this day, I don't   remember my response to any of this. I just remember the disgust, shock,   anger and sadness I still feel. Remembering and writing this all down   is one of the hardest things I've done.

\*sighs\*   And now, the hardest part of my tale. The thing that haunts my   memories, makes me scream in my dreams, and has formed a deep distrust   and fear of most people.

There was   a (equally horrible) barn in the back of the property where they would   store hay for the cows. It had a beat-up wooden ladder leading to a   small overhang on the ""second floor"" (if you could call it that. It was   10 feet across, if that, and had no railing or anything to prevent   falling off of it). There were hay bails up there as well, stacked at   least a dozen feet up to the roof, blocking anyone from seeing up there.

My   uncle would take me up there and force me to give him hand jobs. This   eventually lead to him forcing me to give him head. He threatened that   he'd tell everyone at school (again, he was only a couple of years  older  than me) that I was a ""faggot"" if I ever mentioned this to  anyone. He  told me he'd not only beat me up, but kill my other uncle if  I ever  told.

I never did, until  now, with  only a very close few people to me knowing this. I don't know  how many  times this happened. I don't know if my grandfather also had a  hand in  my abuse during these times. I remember so very little from it  all.

My  uncle had a friend. I  remember he had the most piercing blue eyes. He  used to take me into  the pasture, far away from the home, and make me do  the same. I don't  know if my uncle told him about me or if it was a  sick coincidence that  the same methods of coercion were used.

From   what I understand (memories are so foggy from here), my younger uncle   also was abused by this friend. I think he may have told someone as   there was a huge blowout at one point. I don't really know the details   but I know nothing ever really happened from it other than the friend   not coming around for several years.

Lastly, and perhaps most disturbing, my gay roommate in his late 50's....

This   happened sometime before I moved out, I would spend the night there  all  the time at age 14-15 until I moved in at 16. He would buy alcohol  and  pot and get me and my friends completely wasted. He'd hit on me **all the time.** This all started at age 14. I guess, in retrospect, he was completely and totally grooming me.

I   don't remember the full extent of this (sorry, it's so, so far buried)   but during the times he'd get me completely wasted, I remember a  couple  of times waking up in a drunken haze to him giving my 14-15 year  old  self (VERY intoxicated and sleeping) a blowjob. I never let him  know I  was awake... I was too much in shock and didn't know what to do.  I felt  like it was my fault because I didn't stop him. I was too  terrified of  what would happen if I did... would he be more aggressive?  Would he make  me do more things? So I faked that I was sleeping.

I   continued to stay over and eventually move in because the other  option,  getting the shit beat out of me, seemed like the greater evil. I  wish I  could remember more yet at the same time completely blessed  that I  don't.

I don't know much  more than  this... I know there's a lot more but I simply can't  remember; it's too  far buried, likely for my own good.

Because of all this, I **hate** men (no offense to any reading this, please don't take it that way). I can't be around them for any length of time.

I'm   blessed in that I'm not more sexually fucked up than I am... I'm   thankful that I can have a normal relationship with women without all   this fucking me up more than it has mentally.

# -Conclusion-

The   last 10 years have been a downward spiral of another type. I can't   focus anymore on anything for very long. It's so hard for me to find   happiness and when I do have it, it's often very fleeting. I feel   useless. I can't work due to the constant panic attacks and leave my   house only when I need to (although lately, I've been trying SO hard to   fix that. I recently moved to Pittsburgh to a new place where I know no   one and am far away from everything and everyone that caused me so  much  pain.). I don't have hope for the future anymore and just kind of   ""live"".

I've been depressed most   of my life but this is a different spiral that I'm not sure how to   explain. I'm tired. There's things that I want I can't even describe and   there's experiences out there I desire, again that I cannot explain   with words.

I don't know where this road is going to lead me, if anywhere, and I'm just.... spent.

This is my tale, my life, my tragedies. There's been some **great**   people that I've met along the way and so many, many more that I let   slip through my fingers which I regret and think about a lot. I don't   know where things go from here and I'm lost, tired, and scared.

Thank you for reading."
120,"I have bad anxiety and a of lack emotions, I need help understanding myself...","Sorry in advance I am dyslexic but I tried my best to read though it and hopefully make sense:)

So I know I suffer from social anxiety to the point if I am going out for even like 10 minutes to go to the shop or something I have to have a shower and brush my teeth but I feel like maybe I lack emotions too as well so I have been told by my family and friends.

I do not think I am a psychopath or a sociopath, so I am not trying to be edgy or anything just more trying understand my self and if my anxiety or my past has lead me to the way I am now.

I give a bit of back story I always was very sick when I was a child to the point I was in hospital every couple of months from maybe 10 - 20 years old, I was also a very hyper kid until I was 12 and randomly was always tired after that and got diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome when I was 14. My father passed away when I was 15 and I only cried once. I am also extremely introverted as well. So that kind of my back story in short.

So this all started when my friends and I were talking one night and they found it super weird that I said I wouldn't really care if they died and they kind of got mad at me and I explained to them that I guess in my head I be like of damn his dead but I don't think I would honestly be that upset, more like oh shit that happened... I am not a bad person and I am good at getting along with everyone but I have friends who say I just bum lick random people we meet but I think it more jealousy that I can act a different way depending on the person and play of the other person really well.

I love animals more than humans such as dogs I think they such cute and kind animals but even then my childhood dogs we got when I was like 3, got put down due to being old and I am not sure what age I was when they got put down, I was sad but only for like a couple hours after they were gone and I guess that is weird because even tho I had this very tight bond with them, I just didn't care that much after I guess ( it's kind of to explain because I don't even know)

I just feel like something is there I know I should be sad and all but something just don't connect in my head. The best way I can explain it is let say you have wire (which is my emotions) on one side connected to a computer chip (Which is where my emotion process and sends that signal through) and a wire on the other side and it connects to the computer (Which makes me feel those emotions, you power it on and the first wire gets a power through it but the chip is broken and it not sending the power though to the other wire so the computer don't work.  
So in my head I can kind of feel like something is there but it is getting blocked, so I am not feeling that emotion, as I said it's hard to explain and that feels like the only way I can explain it.

I can feel happiness, anger, anxious and that's the only emotion I think I feel that I know of, I don't really understand love and the only person I guess I love or I call it very fond of is my mum and as she has always been there for me. I have to pretend I am caring towards people even tho I don't feel it, more just act to make them feel better.

Anyways there is a lot more I could get into the lack of what I feel and how I found out but I guess that will do and gives you a understanding and hopefully can give me understanding of why I am like this...

Thanks for reading:)"
121,Is this OCD?,"A friend of mine who works closely with kids in a psych hospital recently led me to believe that my understanding of OCD might be wrong and I think I exhibit the symptoms she describes:

To put it into context, I struggle not being an “all my eggs in one basket” kinda person. When it came to deciding on a college, I was hell-bent on going to the one I wanted to go to, and it made me uncomfortable and annoyed and angry when my parents would make me tour other colleges. When I was applying for my first job, I became hell-bent on a certain company until I got in, and apply to other companies and interviewing at them seemed like a distraction and again it annoyed me and made me uncomfortable. I was later laid off from that company due to covid and fell into a depressive state, largely because I was not ready to leave and my life plan was thoroughly interrupted, and even though it’s been months since I was laid off I struggle to motivate myself when it comes to applying to anything simply because I am not enthusiastic about any prospects - nothing jumps out at me the way my college or first job did. I think this pattern could apply to the women I’ve had crushes on in the past as well - so head over heels for one particular person that I lose sight of anyone else, even if they’re making advances toward me, and unfortunately I’ve always been rejected and it usually crushes me. I think I also see this pattern when it comes to projects, especially my software engineering - there’s always a best way to approach a challenge, and if there isn’t then something is wrong. 

But in hindsight, I don’t think I exhibit other symptoms of OCD. While I absolutely prefer it when my home is clean, I gave up on trying to make it clean because my roommates weren’t helping and it’s a lot to tackle all by myself. I have a tendency to place my things and items carefully but I’m not too bothered by them being out of place - everything has its place, but if I move it and don’t put it back it’s no big deal to me. That said, I don’t lose things, I know exactly where everything of mine is at all times even if it’s out of place, so long as I have moved it. If someone else has moved something of mine and doesn’t tell me, it bothers me, like just let me do it."
122,Help with my 2 daughters who have suicidal thoughts.,"Long story short, I found on my 12yo daughter's phone that she has suicidal thoughts. When we were talking about it (she was pissed I found out) her 10yo sister said she has thoughts too. I'm floored.

I'm working on getting them help, but how do I do that with my oldest, who said she doesn't wanna talk to anyone? Normally they are home doing online school until I come home for lunch, but I haven't gone to work since I found out a couple days ago. 

I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think my oldest has a plan, she's just thinking about suicide. My youngest said she doesn't. How will I know when they're in an ok place and how can I feel it's safe going back to work?

I feel like it's online school and isolation from friends/activities that's doing this. I don't know what to do and getting help seems to be happening very slowly. I know my older daughter will pitch a fit when I tell her she has to talk to someone. I tried explaining you go to the doctor for a broken arm, cancer, etc, so you go for mental health too but she's not having it."
123,I cycle through hobbies continuously.. currently can’t stop researching/thinking about drugs.,"
I know what you are probably going to say, but no I’m not addicted, not yet anyways. 

I always go through weeks/months where a particular hobby will take my interest and none of the other seem to interest at that time. 

I guess I’m kinda going through that in the last two weeks with drug use, none of my other hobbies stimulate me they just kinda don’t feel like enough right now, whereas drug use (Ketamine, edibles, lsd, nos) does. 

I’m being as safe as I can about everything, doing my research on frequency of use, testing before use etc but I know that it’s So easy to get carried away with this as I probably have done in the past due to depression/anxiety. 

I have always been the person that is most extreme, when out with friends getting high I always feel the need to do more than others seem to and I have a difficult time stopping compared with others. 

Should I be worried? I probably should shouldn’t I.."
124,My best friend is depressed and I don’t know what to do anymore,"Hello everyone. So, my best friend has been depressed for as long as I have known her - which is 6 years and a half. The issue is that she doesn’t want to acknowledge it, even though she has almost all of the NHS symptoms for clinical depression. I love her, and I wish I could help, but we have been going through this endless cycle of her saying that it’s just “her brain being a b*tch” or “It’ll pass” or “Everyone feels down every now and then.
But lately it’s gotten to the point where she has lost a lot of weight, refuses to eat more than the minimal amount everyday, and she feels nauseous because of her mental health. She thinks she’s just being a self-centered, ego-focused drama queen, and that (I quote) she just “tends to overthink so everything takes too much importance”, and that “It happens to be sad and it will pass”, or that “It’s always been that way”. 
I don’t know what to do anymore.
I’ve tried being angry, sad, begging her again and again and again, offering empathy, a shoulder to cry on, an ear to lend when she told me that she slept with people just because she didn’t want to be alone. She instantly closes down everytime I try to approach the subject and she doesn’t like to share things at all because she believes that ranting is a “weakness”, and so is talking about one self.
Please, help me. What do I do? How can I just finally help her and stop watching her destroying herself gradually?"
125,I want to die before Christmas comes,"I hate this time of year. Christmas is the worst fucking holiday in my eyes. It's that time when Im practically forced to do all this stupid crap because everyone else does. I don't want to give or receive any presents this year I just want to be left the hell alone. It's bad enough I'm forced to be around religious fucking nutjobs but I'm literally forced into their traditions their celebrations them them them them them. Fuck them. Fuck Christmas. Fuck everyone who perpetuates this stupid fucking holiday. I hate every culture, I hate everyone. I want to stay the fuck away from all of this but am belittled for it and have all their shit forced on me. I'm not even alive by my own choice anymore. I can't die, I can't live in my own way, I can't fucking do anything anymore. Just let people like me leave this world they don't want to live in for fucks sake."
126,Going back to my ex,"After moving on for a whole year i went back and did contact my ex who was toxic as hell for me.
Wr had a conversation for a month and then he showed up his real color again. I'm regretting this a lot and it's eating my head. Why on the earth i did that.....
That's my weakness i showed him and satisfied him"
127,I desperately need help but it would make everything worse,"2 months ago, my alcoholic dad crashed my car in an attempt to kill himself. Then he did it again. 2 days ago, my dad choked me while I was doing math homework on the couch. My school semester is over in a few days and I’m failing everything. I’m in complete survival mode. I can’t form a coherent thought, let alone write 3 essays. 

I wish I could tell my teachers so they would understand, but even then, they’d still fail me. And they’d just call CPS and have me thrown into the hell of foster care. My whole extended family would hate me for telling on my dad. If I get removed from my household, I can’t go to college. 

I can’t stop crying. There is no way out."
128,Are people actually nice for the sake of being nice?,"I don’t think I’ve ever been nice for the sake of being nice. Even to my closest friends. I say compliments and help them out for show in hopes that they tell others that I’m a nice person...To build up my reputation I guess. I don’t often feel guilty for being mean to someone either unless that person tells another and people start ganging up on me. I definitely would say I don’t feel bad unless I got caught.. especially for things such as shop lifting. 
I don’t believe there is such thing as a completely selfless act and I also don’t think that there are people who are truly nice for the sake of being nice. 
I feel like everyone feels this way, even if it’s only to a certain degree, and no one just admits it."
129,Fuck 2020,"Fuck Alzheimer’s, fuck 2020, and fuck Covid. They can suck on the biggest dick and choke. 

I know this year has been hard for everyone. But fuck it, I feel like it has been particularly worse for me and my family. Especially recently.
I guess now thinking about it these past 2 years have been rough for me, but especially 2020. 

My aunt has an oxygen tank she has to bring with her everywhere, but because of Covid she has been home all day. 

As for me personally. I had ups and downs. A lot of downs. 
1. I broke up with an emotionally abusive boyfriend who was controlling and manipulative. He called my best friend a cunt and her boyfriend at the time a faggot. He told me I had too much stuff and how I didn’t need my monster high dolls. I love monster high. He got in my face to find out who I had sex with during the time period we were broken up. And he asked me “why are you depressed? You come from a nice middle class family” and said “your parents throw pills at problems”. He also said I play the victim and made him out to be the villain when I tried asking for advice from a mutual friend or two. I was stupid and got back together with him for a brief while and then I broke up with him again. But some of the bullshit he said haunts me sometimes. 

2. My friend stood me up on a date and ghosted me for a while. We talk again as friends tho. 

3. Dating sucks ass. And two of my “friends” blocked me after I said I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship and after saying I wouldn’t date them. One guy in particular I tried to date but one day he freaked out on me saying how if. I didn’t reply in 15 minutes he guessed it was goodbye then. 

4. I was upset after failed dating attempts and a random guy at a stoplight said how I was cute and wanted my number. Asked me to pull over to exchange numbers since the stoplight was gonna change soon. I was dumb and did that. He claimed to be originally from Spain and said how when you ask someone on a date you kiss. He pressured me into letting him into my car to make out. And said how you only live once. Next thing I know he’s pulling out his dick and trying to get me to suck it or to have sex with him. Saying how it’s been so long. Wouldn’t leave until I jerked him off. Sort of was my fault for this happening, though, because I let a stranger in my car.

5. My “friend” and coworker (she’s not anymore) turned the people I played dungeons and dragons with against me (she was friends with them too). She spread rumors and lies about me at work and told everyone my business. And said some bullshit about how me and her made out and made 6 people trying to fit on a couch to watch movies sound like some kind of weird orgy. 

6. One of my closest friends was in and out of a mental hospital for a couple of months. Broke up with her long time bf claiming he was bad. But then she got out and then ended up getting pregnant by an abusive pos who is bipolar. I know people can’t help having their mental health issues, but what bothers me is that he doesn’t take medication, he abuses drugs for all I know (like takes cocaine), and isn’t getting help for his issues. Plus, one of her sisters blames me for my friend’s life being ruined. That one sister told me that I was manipulative, a liar, that I play the victim, and how I ruin lives. She did this after I messaged my friend’s ex apologizing for acting like a bitch towards him because now I know some of the things she said might not be true. (Note she lied about her parents not paying for her medications and about her parents going to throw away her stuff she left there). Oh yeah and now she is giving me the silent treatment because I spoke the truth and is still friends with that one coworker I talked about.

7. I can’t get an interview for a job for the degree I got. 

8. A “friend” I had known for about a year ended up being not good. We had drank together before. But one night I fell asleep after drinking with him and some people. And then I woke up to him groping my leg and trying to finger me. I kept moving his hand and said no stop. He was saying how “you know there is a bedroom” and “we are alone right now”. He then passed out and I was going to leave but I must have been so tired that I fell back asleep. I woke up thinking it was just a dream but then I realized he was right next to me on the couch and then he said how if I was more cooperative he would’ve totally fucked me.

9. I was gonna tell his gf but got scared. I eventually told her after she said she was upset that I was telling him stuff she was telling me when I hadn’t talked to him for months. I told her what happened and she got upset saying how I should’ve told her sooner and that I said before that nothing happened that night. She ended up asking him about it and of course he denied it. So she went psycho on me saying how I was manipulative and a liar and how I tried to ruin their relationship. And then threatened to beat me up. 

10. Covid and not being able to go to concerts or see new movies. 

11. Biden is probably gonna forgive $10k in student debt. I should’ve gone into student debt but I guess I was dumb for not going into student debt. 

And finally something that sucks. For me and all my family. 

12. My grandma had not been doing well. She had Alzheimer’s for about 4-5 years now. And it’s painful seeing someone going through that. She thought my grandpa was still alive for a while when had been passed away for like 16+ years. She thought he was cheating on her. Anyways, we hadn’t been able to visit her really because of this Covid stuff. The last we saw her was this past summer or fall. I guess one of the caretakers ended up getting Covid and it ended up spreading. My grandma ended up getting Covid. And that was the tipping point since she already had Alzheimer’s and couldn’t walk anymore. She passed away yesterday morning. My mom has no more living parents. And she was the one grandparent that would spend time with me and my brother and took the time to get to know us and our interests. My other grandparents don’t do shit with us. And don’t take the time to know us. I miss my grandma terribly. 

My therapist had already said I was struggling and suggested I do outpatient treatment for my mental health issues (I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, and adhd since middle school so for about 9-10 years now. I was getting better and then all that shit happened) and Covid made it worse. And now I’m like ope yep I’m Definetly gonna need that after my grandma passing. 

I hate these past two years but especially 2020"
130,I failed my 2nd year of uni and I just need someone to tell me it's okay,"I'm doing so bad after getting better for the past year. 

Jesus fuck I'm trying so hard but I feel like no matter what I'll keep failing. I am genuinely interested in what I'm studying, but I'm so behind and have such bad work ethic now, I don't understand even the basics. I feel like an absolute idiot. 

I had this grand plan when I left highschool. I wanted to study outside of the US. It was really difficult to find a way to do it, but I had a dream and I was so determined to accomplish it. But depression hit me bad and I almost didn't graduate highschool, my parents didn't support me and I wasn't able to go to college because of it so I was forced to take a gap year. I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd. I'm basically at 0 credits and 3 years behind where I'm supposed to be. My twin brother is almost graduating and I'm basically exactly where I was when I left highschool. I feel like I'm losing years off my life and for some reason I can't just live it.

Not to mention there's a lot of shitty things going on on top of all this and I just feel so fucking alone. I feel a loss of motivation to do anything. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel alone and unsupported, and so so afraid. I have no idea what my future holds, and I no longer have a dream. I just want to be happy again."
131,Depression or more? Also if you read this thank you!,"I have been struggling with my mental health for over 5 years I'm 19 i just wanted to talk about everything and get someone else's opinion. I believe it's just depression but sometimes I worry it's something different. I spend the majority of each month very depressed. Feeling worthless, empty, and loosing interest in just about everything. Along with having suicidal thoughts and self harm urges. I try hard to help it I journal, try to workout, eat healthy, and I have managed to stop most unhealthy coping mechanisms but I still feel just as bad. I try very hard to love myself and I think a part of me does but when im in this place i'm constantly combating a negative voice basically just saying im a piece of shit and lying if I tell anyone different. This makes it hard for me to form relationships and I wonder if it's from depression or maybe the fact that my step mom verbally abused me from basically my earliest memories to 14. Sometimes I feel like I have moments of clarity i can get a bunch of stuff done. I feel like I know I'm not a shitty person. I have a lot of energy even if I don't get much sleep(I do have sleeping problems off and on) and just generally feel good. I feel like I have to constantly be doing something which does drive me slightly crazy but at least I don't feel depressed. Depending on where I'm at mentally in that cycle my answer to are you a good person or can I trust you look very different which once again can make any relationship very challenging. Quite frankly the way I feel is driving me insane. Also sometimes I get very dissociated and everything just feels like a dream, like I can quite connect, and sometimes like I'm not myself. All of this is very frustrating and I don't really know how to handle it anymore. If you took the time to read this thank you so much I really appreciate it."
132,How can I go to a mental hospital without my mom knowing,"I'm currently in Miami Florida, I am a sixteen year old, and I feel terrible, also currently have a broken arm. 

I feel like a danger to myself, I can't control who I am. My friends have told me I need help but I don't know how to get any.

I don't have any mental illnesses other than ADHD my mom doesn't let me go outside alone, and we're just in the USA to visit.

I feel so bad, almost insane at this point, I can't take it anymore, please help me."
133,Medication.,Has any of you ever taken Sertraline? Can you tell me something about the positive effects?
134,new short film app raising awareness about mental health,[removed]
135,Husband and issues,"So IDK what my husband has...but he definitely has something... I don't know if it could be Asperger's or bipolar...but he WILL not get help...like flat out REFUSES! I feel if I could find whatever it is and almost word for word have symptoms besides just the definition of prick then I could maybe convince him that this disorder does exist and he could benefit from help because I'm at my wits end with how he acts sometimes. 

1. He hates driving because he just gets angry and bitches at any one and anything...even it is it normal situations you deal with when driving. He usually makes me drive and will yell at me about how I need to watch this car or that car (I totally see it a mile away but I get yelled at for it) I tell him to look down and keep his eyes on the phone because I myself have mental issues and anxiety and it adds to mine which isn't good for me either. 
2. ANY MINOR INCONVIENCE means TANTRUMS on the level you've never seen before happen...Examples.......A.Had to stop to grab something from my mom...huffs and puffs sighs and yells about how he just wants to get the hell home because he never gets to do what he wants to do...me I take him home and make a whole other trip to avoid it because its so mentally exhausting to put up with it.......B. his monitor broke...result? he threatens to quit his job because he has had enough if he always has these problems he can never get to do what he wants to do with his time and life is coming to an end....solve the problem? yup ordered a new one...was supposed to be available the next day for pick up...they cancelled the order because it was not in stock and I had to order a different one that would ship it to our house and arrive a week later..what happens? melt down ""fuck this shit""  followed by a major melt down! C. Something breaks or stops working....""God D\*MN IT MF SON OF A B\*TCH"" Stomps around the house...will take it out on me some way....Its like walking on egg shells and sends the instant dread over me. 
3. He states over and over whenever he is depressed how he just wants to die...he has crying fits daily. 
4. He is the nastiest meanest human being i have ever known when we are fighting..usually over literally something that happened a month ago and it has just planted itself and has been growing...I will get woken up at 5 AM to huffing and puffing to him grabbing his hair in his fits telling me hes done with us because this this and this and how he is moving back to his home state etc. He will get into my face nose to nose and press his head against mine and yell at me in the face...omg its so horrible to deal with...he will tell me he hates me and I hold him back...only to apologize for being an asshole after hours later me in tears and mentally exhausted from the whole episode. 
5. He is stuck on conspiracies about the government and aliens... I literally just wake up and sitting down having my first cup of coffee and he wants to have an in depth conversation about how the government is hiding the fact they could provide free electricity to us but that would be free so they keep it from us and then goes on to quote a ton of people and I can't even mentally handle the conversation because im not awake enough to get it...he gets frustrated because I don't want to pay attention or just listen with out having questions...because you know just 5 minutes ago I was sleeping. 
6. Hes extremely sensitive to certain noises...annoying repetitive noises of any kind...even his sister has this problem..she literally wears headphones in public places that are meant to shield out the noise from an aircraft. 

Usually this is only 20% of the time...the other 80% is the only reason I am still here...the only problem is the 20% has turned into 35-40% and its getting to be so often this year I can't barely stand it any longer...I can love someone with issues... I have some of my own (ADD, PTSD, ANXIETY DISORDERS) so its getting to the point im a wreck always having to be the strong and forgiving one because what he does sometimes is just unacceptable. Not only do I need to know what you think he has I need advice for myself because I can't continue..We have been together for 10 years..I have yet to have a baby and I'm 37 he is 43 with 1 son from previous marriage...my sister in law is no wonder you're not pregnant you're always so stressed from him...and I am...I love him but my God I don't know what to do."
136,my exams are finally over,after weeks and weeks of stress my exams are officially over and results are out. my average is usually 60 ish but it was 76 this year (this is an A off the grading system my school use) so I'm proud of myself.
137,Lingering anxiety but pushing through i guess,"So how I grew up kind of put some odds against me. Most my family are in the northern US and I’m in the south. So i mainly saw cousins over the summer as a kid until I hit double digits. I moved schools and locations several times (apparently 5 different preschools??). The longest I lived somewhere was probably 6 years. Teachers would tell my parents how i was quiet or just wouldn’t talk. Authoritative parents with the whole do as i say mindset. And a dad with anger issues who worked all the time when i was little. He and my upbringing wasn’t all bad of course. But he had choked me when i was 9 because my hamster pooped on his bed and a cousin told him the day after i cleaned the little nugget up. Apparently i was trying to be a man by that accident so he choked me until I couldn’t breathe for several seconds and i was 9. Aside from getting smacked and whipped hard for things like him thinking cops and robbers with friends was me letting them bully me, he sucker punched me in the gut and smacked me in the face before starting to choke me out because i accidentally knocked down an overloaded shelf. My mom just watched as if i deserved it. 

I got crippling social anxiety from that and never fitting in or being too weird. It’s not so bad anymore and joining the Air Force helped me build social confidence and doing things that make me anxious even if im scared. But i still have mood swings i hide and am just hyper alert of how others might be feeling and assume they want to harm me subconsciously while knowing they don’t. Even just being in a crowd I’ll get slightly shaky hands. My hands already permanently shake slightly but it just feels like this probably isn’t normal. I can talk to people now and girls too even if i feel shy, but it’s just harder for me sometimes and nobody really wants to hear all this. I should probably see a therapist as everyone i tell suggests but i end up telling myself I’m fine and people have it worse. 

When i told my parents what they did they just denied it and told me how ungrateful i am. And even today they act like we’re fine yet nobody ever calls to ask how im doing. I guess because i was quiet and brooding around them. Anyways, im far from them now and am on course to make 6 figure salaries in the next few years. I also am working towards my dreams still. I’m not drinking like i used (yet) too or punching holes in the wall. I’m starting to make buddies though still struggling with the dynamics. It still feels like im so used to isolating and being disconnected that it’s supposed to be normal. But yeah, thanks for coming to my ted talk"
138,Tips for Calming Down During and After A Panic Attack,"There are several ways to calm yourself down during and after a panic attack. Here are some that I find most helpful:

1. Focus on your breathing - Most panic attacks cause breathing to become erratic and difficult to control, even hyperventilating. One of the BEST things you can do during a panic attack is focus on your breathing. Take a deep breath in, hold for 5 seconds, then let it out slowly. Repeat this process until you can feel yourself calming down.
2. Ground yourself - In the moment, you may feel scared. Instead of focusing on this fear, focus on things around you. For example, your shoes, clothes, how the air smells, etc.
3. Relax your muscles - [During a panic attack](https://claritychi.com/7-tips-for-calming-a-panic-attack/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=7-tips-for-calming-a-panic-attack), your muscles may get very tense without you realizing it. Concentrate on relaxing your muscles starting from the top of your body and move down slowly, relaxing each muscle group separately.
4. Keep in mind that the attack will pass and that you will be ok!
5. Exercise can help blow off steam and anxiety that has built up as a result of the aftermath of a panic attack. This can help calm your body down after the fact but is also great to incorporate into your routine for overall benefits of decreased anxiety. A short walk each day or a few times a week could make a difference. No need for strenuous exercise to achieve anxiety relief!
6. Speak to a therapist. Therapists can walk you through a time of crisis or increased panic and give you tools and professional advice catered to you specifically."
139,My family takes everything out on me and makes it impossible to heal what do I do?,"My family isn't exactly a healthy one. I'm the youngest daughter (18) in the family yet I feel like I'm being treated as a therapist. No one in the family communicates properly with each other and they always expect me to be a mental support for them while also trying to make me pick sides. Their fights get pretty intense and sometimes they take it out on me even if I completely stay out of it. It gets physically abusive too. I myself am not mentally stable and I don't have the energy for any of this. I frequently get suicidal thoughts and occasionally end up self harming out of frustration. I have my own issues to deal with yet they make me feel like it's my responsibility to relieve their mental health issues and keep them from killing/hurting each other. I just need any sort of advice because I can't go to a therapist for financial reasons.

Btw sorry if I made any mistakes posting this here I'm really new to reddit."
140,can you relate?,"it actually suprises me that it's not normal to have suicidal thoughts this frequently and that other people don't really think about dying often. do you ever think about it that way?

My most rational conclusion is it's just a good jam. And that, quite possible we all inspire each other.

I think that should be ok. What do you think?"
143,Been dealing with on/off depression for years and am at the point where I don’t know where I’m going.,"I (23M) was diagnosed depression 2 years ago, but I realize the symptoms were going on for at least 3 years prior.

Most of those three years I’d indulge in weed and/or alcohol for even the tiniest amount of pleasure. And some days I wouldn’t even be sober. 

Since then I’ve cut out all weed/alcohol, and I’ve definitely had some better times where I felt like to could do anything. But it was an exhausting struggle to climb out of my depression to get there. 

In the last few months I’ve fallen deeper into my depression than before.. I have some relative goals for my future, but my mind is so foggy and overwhelmed with what is going on day to day that I just shut off and don’t know what to do. 

It doesn’t help that I’m feeling unmotivated to do much of anything. The things i was excited for just don’t excite me anymore. Even the things I really enjoyed doing became boring. 

My emotions are like a void, I rarely feel much of anything. I’ve bottled my emotions since I was young (not healthy I know). But I never really knew how to let them out, in a healthy way, without drawing attention to myself..  (I don’t like being in the spot light) I’ve often heard that crying is a good way to feel better, but I’ve tried anything to cry. From watching sad movies, listening to sad music, etc. and I physically am unable to cry. 

I haven’t really talked to anyone about this since the initial diagnosis. I don’t really have any close friends, and I don’t want to bother others by venting to them.. Anyways, I appreciate you if you got this far. It makes me feel a little better that someone’s listening."
144,how do you actually know you have depression?,"that's basically the question, to be honest. i've spent the past 6-7 years struggling to be happy, smile and appreciate things or even be motivated to do anything at all. im not interested in anything. i don't feel like i actually want anything in life because everything seems pointless to me and it's like im not living for myself but for my family only. i always keep doubting myself and tell myself that i don't have any problem and im normal and that i should just stfu and not whine and complain about stuff all the time (which i mostly do in my mind). 
there's a lot to say or.. rant about, you could saqy but the point is.. i can not just tell if im depressed or have any kind of mental problem. 
can you even tell without having to go to a doctor or a therapist (because i can't really afford it at the moment)? 

bonus question: when do you even know that you need to go see a therapist? my constant argument is that if i can even think that i need therapy, i probably am capable of dealing with the problems on my own. i can't help it."

147,How can I tell my parents that I want to see a therapist?,"
Hey Guys,

It’s my first post ever on Reddit and English isn’t my first language so I apologize for any mistakes :)
So, I’m a 14 years old girl from Germany and I encountered bullying, cyber bullying and some other things in my life. Since i have been 11 the thought of suicide and just leaving all behind has crossed my mind. I had a time where I self harmed but I am clean for 3 months now. Those things started when I was cyber bullied for 2 years straight. Comments, people hacking my accounts and hate pages. For an 11/12 year old girl this wasn’t very easy so I’ve been starting to develop certain symptoms early. A years ago I opened up to a good friend of my mine and my teacher. She was very understanding and I told her everything, that I think i might have depression and that I wanted to seek professional help. She agreed to talking with my parents so the next week me, my parents and her met up. She told them that I wanted to see a therapist and that she would be glad to help us out. My parents, obviously in slight shock, didn’t understand at first because to them I never seemed to be in „pain“. My dad said that I didn’t need a therapist and that I just need to get more confident while my mom was totally supportive and asked her where she can find good therapists. When we got home I felt like a weight has been lifted of my shoulders and sat down with my mom. She told me that she would be there for me and if I really want to, than she will contact a therapist. I thought about it some time and then thought that I didn’t need it anymore. I was 13 at that time and this really was a mistake. The last months I have been getting worse again (the virus, family, school and doubts in myself and my future) and I have been thinking about talking to my parents again, but I’m really scared to because they think I have gotten better. I don’t wanna disappoint them in any way or make them feel like they did something wrong.

Sorry for the length of this post 😅"
148,I just need someone to talk too. (14f),"It’s back the not wanting to do anything. Not wanting to get up. Brushing my teeth, take a shower or brush my hair.. do my classes. I’m failing and I told my twin brother (14m) that I (14f) was failing and he told my parents.. it not like it didn’t know he was going to do it. But I there was still a chance that he wouldn’t tell. My brother the smart twin. Well that’s what my parents thank. It’s not that I’m not smart it just there’s no motivation to do my class work so I’m the end I end up making bad grades because I’m rushing to get everything done. But my brother don’t have any mental health issues. Honestly nun of my siblings do. Just me. I’m literally got all of my familys mental health issues. And it sucks when my twin brother doesn’t. So I’m just the f*** up one..

149,I feel like I don't belong to anything and don't have any friends. How do I deal with this?,"Quick background; I come from a Indian family and go to a school that is like 95% Asian. The problem is because of this every parent at our school are friends except for my parents. My parents are from India but they're not very into the Indian culture and things.

This makes me feel detached from both the Asian community at school because me and my parents are not Asian enough and our American friends because technically aren't American enough.

It kills me within to know that the phone I am typing this in can connect me to anyone but I have no one to talk to and get support rn. Things are not getting better despite everything I do. And I feel that nobody values me, no matter what I do for them. I have been in therapy , taken medication but only get temporary relief. And currently I can't afford long term therapy which is why I need support from people who know me. But there isn't anyone I can talk to at all. 

I feel so lonely and helpless at this moment. Can't see anything bright on the horizon either. Have wished endlessly go hibernate so that I waie up when things are slightly better. At this point, I even want a serious illness to get a break. Maybe people will notice when I am gone ."

154,A dream about incest..... (And I hate it),"(Serious) A dream about incest...

So I am 16 (m) now and struggle with anxiety and one night when I was 12 my sister and her friends (who were around 14) were having a sleep over and I had a dream where I went into the room and had sex with them (well not really sex but more like kissing) I woke up and felt incredibly grossed out!!! I should note I love my sister but we have Avery standard relationship and I am grossed out by incest at all!!! I still feel gross about it as it was my first dream about sex ever!!! I should note I have a problem that I don’t know what it is called where I am really scared that I am into having sex with inappropriate people and it grossed me out as I know I am not attracted to those people and would never do it but there is a voice in my head telling me that I will and that I’m gross because of it!!!

Does the dream mean anything?
Does it mean I want to have sex with my sister and don’t know it yet?!?!?

Please help!!!"

So recently my husband and I thought it would be fun to figure out his old fb log in and read through our super old messages from before we dated 8 years ago. (Messages i had were deleted) I just wanted to feel nostalgic and so did he. Well we saw a lot more than we hoped. His exs messages, an old group chat from when he cheated on me and all these awful memories came flooding back. Now we've both been super down and be dramatic toward eachother. Were having petty fights. But now I feel as though I'm becoming my teenage self again. I decided to message the group chat where the girl he cheated on me with was in, which bothered him a lot. I felt so stupid. I then had an urge to message my friend that was super flirty with him years ago (I stopped myself thankfully) and then we got into a stupid petty fight and I self harmed for the first time in years. What the hell is wrong with me?? I feel a bit better today but why am I acting so childish all of a sudden..and why does a part of me feel excitement from the drama? I don't want to hurt our relationship because I feel like we're so fragile right now :( im.embarrased by my actions. I did this stuff when I was 16, im 25 now with 2 kids this isn't what I want."

160,Ex boyf abused me verbally and mentally.," 

Hey Reddit;

My problems began on July 4th, 2020. My then-boyfriend told me I was fat and told me I should go on a diet because then I would be and I quote ""Perfect"". So I did. I didn't eat much for 2 weeks.. and I lost 20 pounds in 2 months. I was so proud of myself. He was so proud of me. And; in contrast.. he rewarded me. Everytime I lost some weight, reward. Reward! It was either affection or tiny gifts, I made it a goal to make him proud; and I conformed to his ideas.

I was 80 pounds in July. Now, I am almost 50. I have painful headaches everyday and my period length has decreased significantly (from a healthy 1 week to 4 days. Everyday, I wait for my stomach to growl before I get up because I feel better. I eat 1 meal a day. Everyday; and there terribly small.

He broke up with me 2 weeks ago; and i've been miserable. I can't eat. I can't breath somedays and its hard. I lost 5 pounds in two weeks, gained 2 this weekend and broke down. If we were together... he would have punished me. By not talking to me. For a day. And, in response to what my thoughts were, I punished myself. I didn't talk to any of my friends for the whole day and cancelled my plans, and I didn't eat that day.. and I got a sense of pride for myself. Maybe, if maybe.. this guy would come back to me and he would tell me that everything's going to be okay; but its not.

That night for dinner, I ate 2 burgers. Later that night, I forced myself to throw up. Because guess what? Even if my friends were proud, My abuser wouldn't. My abuser would stop talking to me for a day.

I need help, but I don't know what to do.

TDLR: Boy called me fat on 4th july and kept abusing my weight afterwards. Lost 20 pounds in 2 months and keep loosing weight. Dont know what to do.."
161,Family for the sake of family at Christmas,"2020 has been nuts.  I have worked the family business throughout Covid and now our state has open back up to the hustle and bustle.  People's lives have changed, mine hasn't.  It has been one track and still is.  Work, sell, go home, rest, work, sell.  My parents are retired but receive money from me each month as the business is at the back of their property.  My sister is in her mid 30's, gets everything catered for her, doesn't pay board, doesn't have a job, goes holidaying frequently and gets all the accolades.  My family aren't the Kardashians but we do ok.  Keeping up appearances gets a major push this time of year and unfortunately my mum and sister and even my dad to a certain extent gossip and tell someone's business to somebody else.  My wife and I were going to make the effort to show up for Christmas lunch but have picked up on ill feeling vibes towards us, like someone has said something they weren't supposed to.  There was a family gathering that escalated into a situation after it came to the surface that information about my wife and I, that the other person had no right to know found out weaponised that info and then killed off that relationship.  
Can you please share an idea of how to politely exit from this situation?
Do you think it is normal and ok to share private information with somebody else without the person it concerns consent?
What is the point of family if loyalty doesn't come first? 
Why take part in an biased popularity hierarchy, labelled as family when all you've ever tried to be is diplomatic?

If you can answer some of these your insight is appreciated, thank you 🙏"
162,Please,"A lot of the time my anxiety acts up and it feels like a thousand thoughts are going around in my mind at once but I'm not thinking and then it makes me feel better to listen to music but then I imagine moments that I COULD be living in my life if I wasn't stuck here and then I get really sad and hate myself and think I'm fat and ugly and feel so, so alone not knowing if I'll ever find someone and all of my friends don't care about me my family would think that I'm being sensitive and school is overloading and I can't I can't do anything about it even with my therapist it's not working and I had one of my worst suicidal thoughts today while I was doing the dishes I wanted to get the knife and slash every part of me but I put it down I've never cut myself or done anything and don't want to and that scares me and I don't know what to do"
163,How can I open up to my therapist?,"I've been visiting a therapist for about 8 months and I have a very hard time opening to her about my problems. Since I'm not 18 yet my parents have to be with me in the room. I waste every meeting talking about school and my day instead of talking about the actual problem. I go to her because of my suicidal thoughts, so it's understandable that my family has to know about my mental state, but I really don't have the heart to tell my parents that I actually attempted to take my life, that I've been self-harming since I was 13 years old, that I was never rejected, and I was actually the person who ghosted all my remaining friends until I had no one. I feel like an ungrateful brat because I have no reason to feel like this. I have grown up in a very loving family so why do I hate myself so much that I see death as the only way I can finally run away from my thoughts and reality. My life is shit because I deserve it, but my family gave me everything, so why do I feel like this? My next meeting is next month cause I lied and told my therapist that I feel great and I don't need therapy. How do I open up to everyone? (excuse my grammar English is not my first language)"
164,"The person who sexually abused me as a child, mailed me a $200 Amazon gift card for Christmas.",I'm so glad to know this the only I get for getting fucked in the ass in a sleeping bag during a boy scout camp when I was 12. I wish he would just die already. That's the gift I want. I want him to kill himself and apologize for everything be did to me and for raping my aunt from the age of 10-16. I can't believe I lost everyone in my family but 3 people. My family truly believes I lied and the sex he had with my aunt was consentual. What a sick fucking joke.

167,Why don't I want anything,"I feel like I'm a failure. I guess technically it's not completely accurate from a career standpoint. I got my a level and I got into a uni. The problem is, there is no job I really want. I mean I want a job because it's necessary but there is none that doesn't sound like soulcrushing boredom. I suck too much for anything interesting. I don't have dreams. I don't have any motivation for my current studies. I'm a firstsemester and I'm already dragging along. My parents don't trust me to live on my own which is well, understandable. Their concern is. I think they should support me a bit more in that because I have to learn somehow but I get it. I don't have any drive. I don't really have friends, not to mention a love life. I don't have that sort if feelings. Also I have a mental breakdown every couple days. Let's say every two weeks. The week in between my life seems to be going great and I have hope and feel in a weird way spiritually connected (to whatever. I don't friggin know). It's been like this for over a year now I think. I don't know what exactly is wrong with me.
If it gets bad I my suicidal ideation often comes back. Not that I actively consider doing anything bad, my philosophy is I'd rather bear the bullshit that is my life than make my family bear my loss even if it isn't that big. 
The only thing I really enjoy is singing. My voice isn't terrible but I have never had lessons and so I won't get anywhere with that either. If we're talking about looks I don't have that much going for me either. I'm painfully average looking. That part doesn't make me a failure but it doesn't help me either.
I don't even really enjoy food anymore. I eat, but it never really excites me. Even when we get pizza. I eat too much sugar for sure but eh. Who cares. 
I'm not very smart or interesting, my memory is shit and I often talk before thinking.

Sorry for rambling. I thought I was going somewhere with this but it just turned into a rant. I know I should probably get help and I'm planning to, once I can without my parents knowing but yeah. I suck. K that's it. If you read this far I'm kinda sorry for waiting your time. 
Take care."
168,Should I quit Therapy,"Right now I'm seeing a therapist twice a week as an alternative to an intensive outpatient program with the intention to get more personalized and individualized care. (mostly as a response to being administratively discharged from a PHP program because it wasn't serving me). however it seems that every session, all I do is vent about the shit that I get triggered by and how I think it's really unfair. I'm dealing with narcissist abuse and childhood neglect and unfortunately living with my parents who have not really improved any from those behaviors and now outwardly, emotionally criticized and abuse me. I've been trying to move out but because of this economic crisis there's really not a lot of affordable rentals available. Obviously I'm also unemployed and have been to two different mental hospitals this summer. I specifically chose this therapist because she specializes in EMDR which is one of the most recommended types of therapy to heal childhood trauma. (I've done it twice with other therapist and it's helped and I know I need more of it) Yet we haven't started it and it's been probably six weeks because she says I need to get more grounded and figure out what my emotional baseline is but I'm still having these manic rages because I'm being triggered daily by my parents. I'm 37 highly-educated have a fresh master's degree and can't get a job that's part of the reason why I hate my life right now. I've tried a lot of alternative careers and lifestyles like teaching yoga, farming, child care, working in a plant nursery --they all filled my heart and spirit but not my bank account in so one by one I had to leave what I love and take an office job to survive. I've driven across the country, lived in Paris, seen the Grand canyon, hiked up a waterfall in Jamaica, blah blah blah... basically exhausted my bucket list of shit I want to see and do in my life. which also kind of led to suicidal thoughts cuz it's like what the fuck else am I even trying to do on this planet. and that's why I'm really struggling to make any progress in therapy cuz there's nothing else that feels good to try to do because our society is so fucked up. like one of the three directions in my life that I'm discussing with my therapist is to become an expat and actually leave the United States and move to a Caribbean island and run an Airbnb with a contact that I actually know and has invited me to do this. But that's not the point the point is I'm showing up to therapy high on drugs because it's joke to me. my therapist called me out on it last week and now I'm super pissed about it and that's part of the reason I want to discontinue working with her. This whole time, even before I felt suicidal, I had the thought that may be working with a personal trainer would be more effective than talk therapy. but since I live with my parents, and I was suicidal, I gave them permission to be included in my treatment plan and they've been helping pay for a lot of my doctors and they will pay for therapist not a personal trainer. I kind of like what's therapist I feel like she emphasizes with me alot when it's hard to find elsewhere. but I guess I feel like she's not really challenging me or pushing me to change I feel like she's enabling me to stay stuck. I should also mention that this is not the first therapists I've ever worked with I've been majorly depressed and seeing therapist and psychiatrist and been on medication and pursued spiritual healing for the past 17 years. I guess I have one of those conditions that's classified as treatment resistant. I've pretty much tried everything short of Ayahuasca because I think that's a cheap shortcut. Actually got really triggered recently when a guy I met in a dating capacity said that he cured his depression with one hit of LSD. I know it's really popular to talk about psychedelics as part of mental health treatment and cannabis has been part of my treatment for a long time but I've also experimented with mushrooms and LSD and MDMA recreationally have taken probably more than a dozen doses combined and I'm still depressed. I'm getting off topic though I know therapy is important and it's helped me stay alive for 17 years but I'm in a pretty different place than I've ever been in and I know that my ability for logical thinking is maybe impaired right now. \[I know this is really rambly, so if i missed any important details, ask and i'll try to get the story clear so you can give the best advice\]"
169,Best part of the day?,
170,I feel like I shouldn't get to feel better,"When ever I have a good day I'm rarely happy about it.

I get maybe a day or two were I  function properly and I immediately convince myself that I was lying about everything. I feel extremely guilty and I start to self destruct.

I'll start contemplating sh again, avoid my friends, ect. 

just because I felt good. I think I don't deserve to feel happy. And If I do feel happy it means I'm all better, that there has never been anything wrong with me.

It means that I was faking everything for attention or to follow a trend. I am a selfish asshole for even thinking there was something wrong with me and if there is something wrong with me, I'm still a selfish asshole for thinking I deserve to feel better. 

I'm so spoiled there are people who are actually suffering and I'm complaining about my stupid ass problems that aren't even actual issues at all. I feel guilty for even posting this on here but I don't have anywhere else to vent; so I'm sorry."
171,How are we supposed to not feel empty,"I really don’t want to wait until 2022 for things to be normal when they won’t even be normal, and I don’t see the point in things going back to normal if everything we once enjoyed has been taken away for so long, and we have zero mental health, well normal isn’t going to fix that. 

I feel like all the friendships and relationships in my life have been permanently affected by being in isolation. There’s only so much purpose you can find in looking out the window of your house every day. At this point I feel like a different person and I cannot find much joy or excitement in anything. 

Every time I complain to anyone like my parents it’s the same answer of stop complaining. But I’m not complaining about being sad, it’s about feeling numb. Talking to friends doesn’t bring me the same joy it used to and nor does anything else."
172,Is it weird to wish you were physically sick?,"Of course, I don't actually want to be physically sick, but people respond much better to ""I have a cold/stomach bug"" than ""I have depression/anxiety and can't fully articulate why I'm not functioning today"". I've been having a rough time and was feeling nauseous earlier and the thought crossed my mind ""If I'm visibly sick I could actually get a day or two off"" then I immediately felt bad for thinking that way. Are those thoughts normal and can anyone else relate?"

174,How can I get the best psychiatric help possible?,"For starters, I'll give you some context regarding my personal situation so that maybe I can receive relatively specific and tailored advice. Thanks for your patience through this post! :)

I'm in my mid 20's, am currently unemployed, am living with my parents and they can't help me much at all as they are intellectually dull and are also illiterate technologically and with the English language, and I have Medi-Cal, which is California's version of Medicaid, (so ""free"" health insurance due to me and my parents' relatively poor-modest living circumstances). My mental state (what I believe to be OCD, ADHD, anxiety, cognitive issues and who knows what else) makes it difficult for me to sit down and spend good time doing thorough and insightful research and contemplation when it comes to looking for information about health insurances, looking for a good psychiatrist, learning more about psychiatry and mental health, and etc., so I hope I can get some direct, purposeful, and insightful advice here that can save me time and help illuminate me.

So, how can I get the best psychiatric help possible? Ideally I would like to see a badass psychiatrist with great credentials, good years of experience, an abundance of great and verifiable reviews, and who can also spend the time with me to authentically help me in my journey in getting the best of help, but is this even possible without breaking the bank and without doing a plethora of research (which as I already alluded to is like torture for me)?

In my research so far of psychiatrists that accept my Medi-Cal (medicaid) insurance, they generally get bad reviews in places like ""Healthgrades,"" ""Yelp,"" Vitals,"" ""Google,"" ""Zocdoc,"" etc, and along with those reviews come horror stories of so called psychiatrists who, based on the reviews, come off as greedy, negligent, incompetent, corrupt, and even sociopathic fraudsters who don't take the time or care to help the myriad of patients they get from Medi-Cal, which in itself seems like a very subpar type of health insurance.

Should I simply bite the bullet and pay 600 dollars+ a session to see one of those ""star"" psychiatrists who do seem to get a lot of good verifiable reviews? (notice that I say ""verifiable"" reviews as i've noticed arguably fraudulent positive review spamming in places like ZocDoc.com for example) Am I being ignorant to the fact that maybe Medi-Cal (my provider is ""LA Care"") can help me pay part of the bill? Is there some sort of insurance out there that I should pay for that can probably help me in a better way when it comes to mental health care?

See how complicated this all gets when you realize that you have to analyze health insurances, psychiatrists, life context, economics, and who knows what else to high heaven just to have a glimmer of a chance? I understand that at some point I may just have to bite the bullet and push through this decision paralysis and go to a random LA Care Medi-Cal psychiatrist but imagine I end up coming across some incompetent who prescribes something to me that ends up ruining me. As an example, take a look at Jordan Peterson (he's a sort of celebrity public intellectual), someone with money, who many would consider to be brilliant, and he's a clinical psychologist to boot, and despite all of this he still almost died (and is now maybe permanently impaired) because of problems with Benzodiazepine use that in retrospect he was arguably grossly stupid with. What chances does your average joe who may be intellectually dull and who has little resources have if he/she is not vigilant?

Lol, there's my question/rant, hopefully some of you have the patience and good will to provide some insightful advice. Thanks!"
175,Constant hypocritical sadistic thoughts,Very often I have sadistic thoughts that seem very hypocritical to how I normally am. Like... one minute in my head I think about how I like women and then a few seconds later in my head a voice will tell me to make them all miserable and relish in their terror. That's just one example. It can be about a lot of different things. It's like this constant war in my head. Different feelings and voices going on. Does anyone else get this too?
176,Just wondering,"Would you be comfortable attending a Wellness event in February of 2021?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kdu3z5)"
177,Uncomfortable with feeling excited/happy,"I rarely feel very excited or happy about things. I guess i got used to being depressed and being pessimistic with everything. But when excitement actually does slip through it makes me feel so uncomfortable and torn. Its like i'm so happy i can't believe it so i have to be scared, something bad might happen. Or like being in pain and want the situation to be over soon because i'm not used to it. Am i the only one with that problem? Like i can't even explain how it feels or how i'm supposed to feel in that moment. Should i just ignore that i'm happy and distract myself or work with them by using tools like with bad emotions? Or maybe do nothing at all because its supposed to be a normal thing to feel? Are positive emotions even supposed to make you feel that way? To me negative emotions screws with me just as much as positive emotions so i'm kinda lost what to do at this point"
178,Cry for help,"I know it's long but it would mean a lot to me if you read this and suggested what I can do cuz honestly idk what to do with myself. I am 16 btw. :D

Ok, I'm not trying to self diagnose or anything. I just need to get this of my chest since in my family we don't talk about our emotions. There are times when I cry like 5 times a day and constantly think about killing myself but there are also times when I get random rush of happiness and I start thinking about that I faked everything from the ""depressing phase"". And these bursts of emotions are so random, most of the times there is not even a reason. I am also extremely numb in some situations. Recently a friend of my parents passed away and when my mom told me I didn't know how to react and I almost accidentaly smiled because I didn't care. I dont care about anyone unless it's my friends or family. Everytime I try to give away a hint that I don't think I'm okay my dad and his gf always say that it's just a phase and my mom always responds with something like:"" I'm sad too."", ""Yeah well I'm more depressed."", ""Don't say that."" Speaking of my mom, there's another issue. She's extremely emotionally manipulative and can't control her emotions. Which tears me apart because I love her so much and the only think she does is constantly being unsatisfied with me. She obviously love my sister more and that's the reason why I hate my sister. She constantly steals my attention, even on my B-day party, everywhere. When I talk to my mom she suddenly starts talking about herself to steal the last bit of my attention. She doesn't understand the worth of money and she's an ungrateful little seeking-attention bitch. She is also the main reason why me and my mom argue, bc my mom can't stand me hating my sister. I just hate my life. I get bored of everything easily and I just think there is no point in living if we're all gonna die anyway. I feel like my life is so fucked up and I would like to get some professional help but I can't do that without my family knowing. And if my family found out they would probably think that I'm just making everything up bc emotions don't exist, right? Did any of you had similar experience?"
179,I dont feel christmasy at all this year. I relapsed a month ago in drugs and my depression is crap. I have a 5 year old son and I feel guilty im not excited.,"This year has been full of ups and downs for everyone

But man im just not feeling it at all this year.
I have bipolar 2 disorder and was hypomanic over tje summer months and my son and i had a great time during lockdown... We went to parks and paddled in rivers and streams and even went camping when lockdown restrictions were eased (we live in England).

My mood crashed at the end of october when my son had to stay off school as we had come in to contact with someone with covid. I lost the plot, i hit burn out and hit the fuck it button and used drugs.

My mum stepped in and has been looking after my son since whilst ive been using on and off since. Im so cross it got to this point, i didnt see it coming at the time but when i look back my behaviour was extreme... Ive lost both grandparents this year and have lost a lot of my support groups and the things i would do for self care. All my energy was just to get by each day looking after a 5 year old and also complete assignments for university. I know a lot of people have had it worse, im actually proud i got this far. But now ive made myself poorly and depressed from using and the pressure of being all happy bubbly and excited for christmas is just another thing getting me down.

I wish i was excited... Im just not. My son is so excited, going to school, opening his advent calendar, seeing santa. My mum is doing all this with him because whilst ive been clean a few days, im still not strong enough mentally or physically...

I feel like a failure.

TL;DR mental health bad. Not excited about Christmas and feel guilty especially as i have a 5 year old."
180,How do I stop snacking?,"I probably spend ~£20 a week on snacks, using ig as a coping mechanism and I can't afford to keep doing that, but also can't stop.  Any advice or suggestions on how to cut down please help"
181,I need to talk to someone,"I want to speak to someone, not a mental health professional, just any one that will talk to me, i am always very sad for no reason and dont want to talk to any family members cause they will say im just attention seeking, i havent got any friends and so cant speak to them."
182,Family for Christmas?,"2020 has been nuts.  I have worked the family business throughout Covid and now our state has open back up to the hustle and bustle.  People's lives have changed, mine hasn't.  It has been one track and still is.  Work, sell, go home, rest, work, sell.  My parents are retired but receive money from me each month as the business is at the back of their property.  My sister is in her mid 30's, gets everything catered for her, doesn't pay board, doesn't have a job, goes holidaying frequently and gets all the accolades.  My family aren't the Kardashians but we do ok.  Keeping up appearances gets a major push this time of year and unfortunately my mum and sister and even my dad to a certain extent gossip and tell someone's business to somebody else, regularly with anybody.  My wife and I were going to make the effort to show up for Christmas lunch but have picked up on ill feeling vibes towards us, like someone has said something they weren't supposed to.  There was a family gathering one year that escalated into a situation after it came to the surface that information about my wife and I, that the other person had no right to know found out weaponised that info and then killed off that relationship.  

Can you please share an idea of how to politely exit from this situation?

Do you think it is normal and ok to share private information with somebody else without the person it concerns consent?

What is the point of family if loyalty doesn't come first? 

Why take part in an biased popularity hierarchy, labelled as family when all you've ever tried to be is diplomatic?

If you can answer some of these your insight is appreciated, thank you 🙏"
183,Brain reboot?,"TW (abuse, holiday blues)

I'm having a day. I have a question for others mostly because I am trying to put a name on whats going on with me so its a little bit of a read before the question

 I had a therapy appointment today and my therapist asked me why I don't really like the holidays. I explained to her that my abusive ex used to make me feel crazy for every social interaction I would have ""wow I can't believe you said that"" or ""you know everyone hates how you talk to them"" ""that was really embarrassing what you said"" so I hated going to family functions because no matter how well I thought a party went I would get the lecture on the way home.

Anyway this conversation caused me to shut down. I was wondering if anyone else experiences the feeling of what I like to call ""rebooting"" for me it's like my brain is short circuting and I can't get the right words out. I will hear certain sounds and it repeats over and over in my head. I get stuck on one sentence that I want to say to my partner and it won't stop repeating till I say it. It feels almost like a dream while this happens with moments of clarity. Its extremely fustrating. My partner and other people that have seen this happen all say that its like I'm not there I'm just nothing and slowly they can see me come back. My therapist says I disassociate but this is a little bit different then me just spacing out or not focusing like I said it reminds me of when you reboot a computer and the different functions start working again. Anyone else experience this?"
184,Is it possible to have a panic attack without realizing it?,"Last week, when I spent time with my friends, I suddenly felt like I had to lie down. I lay down on the floor. I felt nauseous and like I was about to faint. I think I was hyperventilating because my hands were cramped in that typical way. (Trousseau sign)

I guess I felt stressed out and quite anxious before but I didn't feel that level of anxiety that is often described. Like, I didn't think I was dying. Could this have been a panic attack? Yes, I know, I should probably see a doctor about it but it didn't last long and I felt fine afterwards."
185,Living Has Just Lost Its Flair,"I don't know what happened. I have a great life. Of course I've had my hardships, but it's okay right now, but I just don't want to live anymore. I can't shake this feeling that id be happier dead. That if everything just went away I could finally clear my mind. I've had suicidal thoughts before but not like this. This feeling of constantly wanting to die no matter where I am. I just want to die. Plain and simple just like the title said living has just lost its flair, and I don't know how to stop it."
186,Seeking Advice,"I have been having trouble at work. I've known I've had sensory issues for some time but they haven't been a major problem until recently. Before, I just couldn't handle concerts and high stress situations. I would develop a headache and feel nauseated after a busy day. Now with Covid, procedures have changed and now it's really effecting me. I work in a drive through and I need to keep a headset on me as I cash out orders. However, my brain just can't process someone else taking an order over my ear. It hurts my head, I significantly slow down, and my emotions get out of hand.
I have attempted to talk to my manager about this but it doesn't appear to make much of a difference. I am still placed there to cash out even though it's difficult to concentrate on orders let alone do other tasks as well. I know I'll have to find a new job but what should until then? I don't have any kind of proper diagnosis for anything and I don't have health insurance. I feel like I am at my wit's end."
187,How to be happier with an inability to masturbate?,
188,melioration,"I can't seem to understand who I am anymore and what I want to be. I have so much fear in allowing myself to open up about my thoughts. I want to spend time with people and talk freely but I find myself constantly overthinking. 

I've come to what feels like a standstill in my life where I have isolated myself and no longer allow people into my life for long. A dark thought in the back of my mind tells me it's not worth it, that they'll always leave me behind. 

I don't know what I want exactly, but I do know that what I currently have given myself is not what I need."
189,The nurses made me feel more like a freak,"I know I wasn't behaving good. I tried to run away from the ED because I wanted to leave by myself and not have my parents called (I'm an adult) I yelled at them when they wouldn't let me leave. I asked them why they wouldn't let me die.

The whole of today I've just been thinking about it.

How they told me to stop behaving like a child. They told me to grow up and act like an adult. They said they don't understand why I'm mentally ill because I'm not an addict, my parents are nice, I'm young. They said I'm just too sensitive. The death threats, the bullying and all that that was just light hearted jokes that I was too sensitive to. Apparently I don't actually want to die I'm just doing it for attention and to get help like the hundreds of girls they get every single day. Apparently if I really wanted to kill myself I'd be dead already. Trust me, I've tried."
190,Why am I always sad no matter what I do,"I’m sad and unmotivated literally everyday. If something really good happens I might get happy for a few days, but soon after that happiness goes away and I feel sad again no matter what I do. I always feel empty, help"
191,I Don’t Want To Be ‘Wise Beyond My Years’ Anymore,"I’m still a kid yet everything feels so horrible. Sometimes I don’t feel anything at all and I don’t like it. I always used to see people saying that and I was like “oh, that’s really upsetting” but now that I know how it feels I can’t describe it. I don’t want to become a teenager soon, I think I ruined my own childhood and I want it back. My parents and my teachers always used to tell me that I’m wise beyond my years. I used to love the attention, it made me feel special. It’s crushing me now. I don’t want to be wise and I don’t want to feel hurt anymore. I used to think it was so cool to be someone who had a better vocabulary than the other kids. Someone who was better at Language Arts and wiser mentally. No. No it is absolutely not. Kids shouldn’t be wise in that way. I just want a teddy bear, a hug from my mom without thinking she’s something horrible. I just want to be happy and have motivation to do something with my life. I’ve wasted the past years as a kid and I don’t want it to end so soon. Sometimes like now it makes me bust into tears. Other times it makes me feel nothing and I can’t take it anymore. I hate myself without having any reason to and I just need to write it somewhere. I talk to my friends but what can they do? They can give support, but there is some heavy stuff I need to vent and I can’t do that to them. I don’t know what specifically made me this way. My parents are going through a nasty divorce and I hate my mom, although the divorce hasn’t really effected me that much. My dad always says I’m his best friend and I love him, but he vents to me. He tells me what a cheating bitch my mom is, he goes on about how she’s bothered him that day. That doesn’t effect me, no. Every other vent from him about his mental health does. This sounds rude but I just want a hug from him. Hugs don’t give the effect I want them to have anymore. I just want cuddles and love. I want to be there for my dad but I don’t know if I can be. This may sound over dramatic but it’s too much. Sometimes I feel nothing and sometimes I feel everything. I can taste food but it doesn’t feel like I actually am experiencing it. It’s a disconnected sort of feeling and it’s just frustrating. A huge part of all this may be something that happened to me a few years back, but I can’t comprehend whether it is actually so bad or not. It’s made me feel things I don’t want to. I honestly just don’t want to grow up, I hate already looking like a teenager. My brother says I’m depressed to mock me and makes me uncomfortable with some things he says, it’s just frustrating. I’m not diagnosed with anything, and I’m most certainly not depressed. I don’t want the attention but I just needed to write this somewhere that’s not a journal."
192,"Girlfriend is very unwell, suicidal ideation, won't see a doctor","What do I do? She's convinced herself that I hate her, everyone hates her, everyone's lying to her about the amazing person she is. She curls up in a ball in her bed, cries, and tells me ""you don't understand"" and ""I'm sorry I can't make you happy"" and I can't convince her otherwise. She insists she's working on ""being better"", but 2 months into several-weekly crying sessions she's just admitted suicidal ideation. I'm at a loss of where to go. Doctors and therapists are out of the question every time I try and broach it with her. I'm at a loss."
193,"I have GAD, and I can’t tell if I should take medications, or just need to switch to a less stressful job?","I currently work in a trauma treatment program in mental health. I get very anxious when I hear about how clients have attempted suicided or self-harmed in the past. I also grow anxious when clients are upset, or especially if they overdose and self-harm. I then irrationally blame myself for their actions. I feel so nervous that I can hardly speak in work meetings because it’s a stressful job and several of my coworkers and bosses are toxic. My boss once threatened my job because I made a criticism of our program (even though many other coworkers agreed with me and it was a fair point), and since then I feel like I can’t speak in work meetings. It’s frustrating to feel anxious at work because it makes me less effective for clients: I can’t focus at work, or on what the clients are saying. Thus my racing, obsessive mind makes it hard for me to to my job well.

My therapist recently prescribed Lexapro. I picked it up from the pharmacy and felt obsessive about whether to take it or not. I grew worried that the pharmacy “crafted the medication wrong” because the pharmacy seemed disorganized. Every time I looked at the Lexapro sitting in my room, I thought of a client unconscious on the sidewalk after they overdosed, and then felt paranoid that I would overdose too, even though I have no suicidal ideation. I learned how to destroy medications, so I then soaked the Lexapro in detergent in a plastic bag, and threw it in the trash. (Which I know sounds a little bat-shit crazy). I feel like I have some secondhand trauma from my job, and I don’t know how to deal with that either. I’m not sure if I want to stay in this job because while it is so meaningful, I was a lot happier when I was a teacher or worked in museums and libraries.

I think I can survive with my anxiety so long as I am creative and going to therapy. I am currently working on writing a book, and when I write, I notice that my delusional anxiety becomes imaginative, and my anxiety transforms into excitement. I can focus on my book, and when I do write, I find I am more strong at work. A barrier is formed between my clients and I, and I can give them better support without getting so anxious about their state of mind. It’s like the creativity protects me and energizes me in some way. However, it’s hard to find time to consistently be creative outside of my job.

TL;DR I want to relax at work because it’s hard for me to function when I’m so, so anxious. I have not been this anxious at other jobs. I have tried breathing exercises, but they don’t help me calm down at work. I function fairly well outside of work. So, I can’t tell if I need a different career, need to take medications, or if I can continue unmedicated while being creative in my free time. Do any of you have advice on this?"
194,I'm gonna give up on this sub,"I'm sick of asking for help or a single soul to say something nice or anything and I just get left out and others get all the fucking help and attention they want ( don't get me wrong I'm happy for them), I'm tired, i have no one to ask for help so i try here and nothing, and I know I'm not the only one who feels like this, I'd probably get a reply or help if I  said I was a female or single because of thirsty people. I'm done with all of this bullshit,"
195,I am tired of feeling not enough.,"I cant continue living like this. My entire life is a mess. My mental health is messed up. My physical health is down the drain. It feels hard to even breathe right now. My parents are assholes. My extended family just wants to make comments about my weight. The worst part is I am always doing something about my weight and still it's not even reducing. But it is only increasing. My body has given up on me. I have concepted gluten allergy. My digestive system is broken. I have major acid reflux. My right shoulder is extremely weak which causes me immense pain. And I am on my period rn. My parents blame me for things I am not even responsible for. My dad has been cheating on my mom for like a decade. He has never even made me feel like I am his daughter. He is always behind his son and other people in his life. I just cant live like this. It's too hard. My boyfriend is not of any help either since we are in long distance. My best friend major back stabbed me. If losing in life was a game, I am fucking winning at it. I always think that there no more going down hill from here but my life keeps surprising me. I genuinely dont know how to help myself."
196,What is wrong with me? How do I fix myself?,"So I decided to open up here a bit since I'm too poor to hire a real therapist. 

So in a nutshell, my life is full of abandonment issues. My mother didn't care much when I was a child and I have seen my father maybe 7 times in my life. The last time I show him was some 10 years ago and when I met him he told me that he didn't really want children but my mother pressured him into it, so that was his way of saying he doesn't want to have anything to do with me.

I have three sisters and one bother, but I have never seen my third sister nor my brother, because they are my half siblings (we have the same father). The two sisters I do have used to live near me, but the first one moved to 620 miles away (1000 km) and the second moved to USA (I live in Europa), so I pretty much don't see them anymore. Like I haven't tried to meet these other siblings of mine, because I just figured that they have better things to do and it would just be awkward to them. 

My dating life isn't great either - I have had four girlfriends but they all more or less left me when they found someone better, who had a better job than me or was just more educated. Before the last girlfriend, I lived my invisible life pretty content, but when I met her she was just something exceptional and I really fell in love. She was just perfect, smart, beautiful and little bit weird like me. Well, she ended up taking another guy who made more money and was more educated than me. 

At the time it happened I was studying in university but than I just couldn't do anything anymore. I quit the school and just more or less sat at home all day windows covered having zero motivation to do anything. 

Strength training has always been a big part of my life because I guess it provided me an escape from reality or something, but to be honest, I think it might have something to do with me using strength and muscles to seek approval from others. Well, be it how superficial or dumb the only complements in my life that I have had have been about my physique, so as an introverted guy, it feels really good to get complements, so there's no way I want to stop that. Well, shortly after this girl left me I had an accident when I fell on my shoulder and broke my AC joint. This resulted in me using an arm sling for two months while not being able to do anything. 

When that happened and I had my diagnosis I really started considering suicide a lot. I felt like when I was never good enough then in my physical prime I had no change now as a cripple. I just wanted to disappear and die. Well, because I'm more like a fighter than a quitter I decided to fight through this lame life and only end myself after I have really exhausted all the options. I started to research what could help the healing process and I found PubMed articles on Nandrolone. The only problem was that my doctor didn't want to give it to me, because it is an anabolic steroid. 

Well, I read online that pharmacies in Eastern Europa might be somewhat corrupt and might just sell it to me under the counter. Well, since I had nothing else to do while having the arm sling I took my car and made a little adventure into those countries. Sadly they didn't have the drug, being ill equipped little poor pharmacies as they were.  

After that I just drove back home and ended up ordering the drug from the dark web, and after a long deep breath pinned it on my ass. Well, the stuff was anabolic for sure since the moment I pinned it my mind sensed completely. My mind was totally stuck in an aggression mode and I didn't care about anything. I had to use all my mental power to prevent myself from doing anything totally insane. As an example, couple of times when driving I just passed a car when cars were coming to the opposite direction just thinking that they will dodge me and if not than I will just return to my lane forcing the car I'm passing off the road. Well, the cars did dodge but after the effect of the drug started fading I was quite terrified of what I considered totally normal behavior when on the drug.  

Well, the drug did serve one good purpose, I got over that girl that I loved so much, but the negative side effect was that I never stopped taking steroids after that. I just kept ordering new ones and trying them out because I loved how they made me feel - strong and indifferent. I felt that because God had made my life into an one big Monty Python sketch it was also okay for me to fuck around a little, and so by I just continued using the drugs. I finally found a drug that didn't make me go insane so I'm not insane right now when writing this.

And this all leads us to today. Here I am sitting in my room ass full of steroids and head full of existential questions about why I'm here in the world, wasting my life and suffering in nothingness without meaning. 

I feel like life is abusing me but I can't complain because it's life. Life is hard to everyone so I have no right to complain, nor does complaining solve anything, so I should just focus on the solution, but what's the solution than? Should I just soldier away, just doing what everyone else is doing, hoping that it will all be okay at the end? I just don't see it. I see zero satisfaction in the traditional model of life - I just can't make myself believe again the lie of love nor the illusion of friendship. Those are all lies our biology has set for us so that we would perform out evolutionary duties of procreation and parenting, but if not that than what? 

Well, if I project my life into future I see no light for me - just meaningless existence and futile philosophical ramblings. Even if I find an answer to this question, it will only open two new ones, and who am I to be solving the questions of life when much smarter men before me spend their entire lives trying to do so without getting nowhere? I will be just wasting my life, but is there anyway to escape it? Like do I this or that, my life will be wasted, so is there even a point to live to see tomorrow? Same shit same shit - all I do is marinate in my thoughts and feelings, not having anyone to help, nor wanting people in my live. 

I think I might have developed a condition where I yearn intimacy with people, but at the same time, I don't want people near me, because my experience has been that they always hurt me with their worlds and actions. I also have come to believe that this intimacy isn't actually possible, but just a remnant of my mind still wanting the thing it would have wanted to experience when I was a child. This isn't possible now as a adult because you can't ever thrust anyone. You need to keep your eye on the boll, because if you don't the other person might see you for what you really are and leave after realizing they could do better. 

So that is my dilemma and that is my situation. If someone has words of wisdom or guidance it would be very much needed. I feel so mentally haggard right now."
197,I just found out my problematic childhood wasn't exactly my fault and now don't know what to do.,"Sometime after my mum left my step dad (never met my real dad) and we basically straight up moved with her new then boyfriend, now husband my mental health went down the hill. Everything I knew changed, I lived with a person I met only few times before - still a complete stranger and my mom, the only strong point in my life wasn't exactly interested in me anymore because there was someone new.
My grades went down and I started fighting for attention in the only stupid ways a kid can think of. I was only told that what I'm doing is not good enough (I was always the golden child that had to be best at everything) and that I need to start doing better. I was left do deal with myself alone.
That lead to me finding people who paid attention to me. People who used me and introduced me to drugs and alcohol. I also found (or he found me) my amazing boyfriend who abused me both mentally and physically and also raped me. I was ""screaming"" for help hoping that people around me will see but all I got was ""deal with it, it's you problem and start doing better because we can't show off with you anymore"". Everytime my family got together they were talking about me, not with me. And usually it really wasn't nice.
I got myself into lot of problems which lead to my third phase. I stopped caring I just couldn't anymore. I wanted to be alone and do nothing. Literally nothing. Just sleep, stare in the wall if I couldn't sleep and then sleep again. Sometimes, not always I went to eat something. I started drowning in my own mess as I didn't see point in cleaning. I was just throwing everything next to my bed. Sometimes even food I wasn't able to eat. Soon I was literally rotting in my own bed. All I was told? ""You are disappointment, we are ashamed, do something with yourself"".
Only after I run abroad to start a new life I started to be able to live a bit of normal life. I found good friends and boyfriend who helped me to get much better and helped me realise (even though he don't know about it) that what happened before wasn't my fault as people around me made me think.
But right now I don't know what to do. I'm still dealing with great anxiety and my apathy and tiredness is sometimes coming back even though my life I great now. I'm ashamed of myself and my past. I want to talk about it with someone but I'm just afraid .. what should I do?"

In memory of a good friend who lost his way this week. #RIP [https://twitter.com/AzfarRizvi/status/1338978858956181507](https://twitter.com/AzfarRizvi/status/1338978858956181507)"
200,IM NOT SAD I JUST DONT WANT TO BE HERE,"
So I’ve been looking into how people feel when they’re suicidal etc. And it all seems to be about wanting to end the endless pain and suffering blah. But I’m loved. I’m loved yet I don’t have any interest to be here at the moment. All I want to do is sleep and lately I have been thinking about ending it. I know how I would do it too. The way I see it is that I’m not happy in this life so I’d rather just move onto the next one as crazy as that sounds (even though I don’t know what would be next).
I’ve suffered with bulimia since the start of the pandemic and the past few months I haven’t had a relapse, I’ve felt to urge to fast/purge but I haven’t done it. Because truthfully, I don’t really care anymore. I have so much love and appreciation for my friends and family, but I don’t want to be here and I don’t feel guilt for if I left them. I’m really selfish and I understand that from someone else’s point of view about this but I don’t know how to prevent it right now.

I’ve been on sertraline for the past month and a little bit which seemed to work but now I’m not happy or sad, just nothing."
201,"I'm not doing well, and I need help.","I've finally approached my doctor about my mental health issues and how quickly I've been deteriorating as of late. Issues at work, financial issues, Covid, lack of friends, lack of direction in life, feelings of uselessness and worthlessness, feelings of never being good enough. I'm just being crushed by all of this.

I talked to my doctor and she determined me to have severe depression and anxiety. I managed to talk my way out of being admitted, but she took me out of work for a month as of now and is setting me up with a therapist.

I've been coming home from work, sobbing for an hour a day, staring at a wall, and then going to sleep and doing it all over again the next day. I've cried for help at my job but the mentality is ""suck it up because I had it worse when I was your age"". 

I'm losing myself. I don't feel like me anymore. I don't even feel like a person anymore. My union and my company consistently breaches the contract that we pay to uphold, I clean human shit from stairwells STILL after being denied four promotions and not even getting an interview for a fifth. It's not for lack of hard work and loyalty, it's because they're slipping all their little friends and family into higher positions. I am forced to perform the job duties of the incompetent fucks that got the promotions over me.

Now here I am, sitting on my couch next to my wife who is worried sick about me. I find enjoyment in nothing. I keep buying games and other cool shit just for little hits of happiness. And I can't even be bothered to take a fucking shower. I'm not going to work for a month and even though that should make me happy - it doesn't! It makes me anxious and makes me feel like a bad worker.

Sorry for the vent. This was actually originally meant to be an inspirational post about how if I can work up the courage to seek help than so can you."
202,How do I stop being afraid of failure and also stop being a perfectionist?,It is ruining my life.
203,I need advice. I don’t feel that I can do much more to help my friend.,"Whew so this is going to be quite long:

I have a friend that I have known for while, and she had to move away because of circumstances beyond her control, so she would no longer be at the same school/city  that I go to. Probably two months after they leave, I contact them. Boy I did not know how much things can happen in less than a year.

She says she is now trans, and that she wants us to use she/her pronouns. This isn’t an issue of course. Then she starts talking about her new school, and how she is purposely getting into physical fights for the adrenaline rush. This is a pretty long rant mind you. I am just sitting here looking at my phone screen like... what the hell. I am very uncomfortable now and this is the last time I talk to them in a long time.

Flash forward to last week, and I reach out again. Things are worse. She says that dysphasia sucks and that, along with other circumstances, are ruining her life. Things get heavy from here. She says rather casually that she is thinking of ending it all, and she asks my advice on if she should do it. I say NO! Obviously, she responds with “good advice” and then starts explaining that she has to go to a boarding school after this semester. She says that it’s because she tried to do something VERY BAD. I don’t really want to say, but I will say it involves fire, and a house. She says that it is in retaliation to an assault she was victim to. This is her own house by the way.

So this completely came out of left field, and I feel like such a piece of shit for saying this, but I’m not entirely sure she wasn’t the aggressor in the first situation. You see, she isn’t the most reliable reteller of events, and she frequently lies, bends the truth, and omits events. She has done this a lot in the past as excuses for not getting work done or something. Once again, I feel bad for having any sort of doubt about this, and considering I don’t know the end goal of their retaliation, I am pretty uncomfortable with asking for clarification.

Anyway I tell her that I don’t really have the emotional intelligence  to give her any advice about her dysphoria, but there are plenty of communities online where she can find someone to talk to, and they can help more much more than I would be able to in this situation. I tell her that I am concerned and she replies with: “boi why are you concerned”. Um... whaaaaaaaat?!?? Do I even have to explain why?

A few days later I ask her if she has tried reaching out to anyone, she says she hasn’t because she would probably forget, and that she has to build up trust with someone before talking to them, but she hasn’t even tried yet. She says that she will find people to help her when she goes to boarding school in a couple of weeks.

I feel like I am in the wrong  for no longer feeling like I can help, and essentially giving up on doing so. I tried to help and tell her to talk to her school counselor but her excuse is “people are shit”, and when I didn’t know what to say to something she told me, she said “wow (insert name here) was right, people are shit”"

205,"I’m trying to work up the courage to tell someone at school about my mental health issues, day 5 of talking myself out of doing so.","So I’m in my last year of high school and the ever approaching exams are looming over me. As well as a sense of worthlessness and being casually suicidal occasionally- I’m not stable mentally. I also have a real feeling of being disconnected from everyone around me- almost delusional. It’s hard to explain, almost like I feel myself losing my ability to think straight and make good decisions. 

I told my parents and a doctor about my mental health issues last January but I’ve lied through my teeth to my parents since then, and the health care system is clogged up with Covid stuff. 

I’m starting to feel a little better, which means I have about 2 more weeks before I’ll probably shut down again. I want to tell my school’s equivalent to a counsellor and I was so close today, but I didn’t. Oh well I’ll try again tomorrow. Good night internet."
206,"I think I understand why I suck so bad at school, how do I overcome this?","TLDR at the bottom for those who don’t like reading

I am in my fifth year of college and have struggled with school for most of my life. Because of it I constantly feel as if I’m letting down my family and am a colossal failure. 

Recently I’ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, which is no excuse but it caused me to question why as I’ve always believed I’ve had a pretty trouble free and happy childhood, Despite our financial setbacks that my parents were able to hide pretty well from my siblings and I. 

But I digress, after doing a lot of thinking and self reflecting I think I understand why. It seems kind of obvious but I guess I just never put two and two together until now 

In elementary school I got great grades and was a good student, until about fourth grade when I thought I could get out of doing my homework by just... not doing it. I didn’t think the teacher noticed because she never said anything to me. I thought that was that until my teacher sent the student’s parents a paper listing every student’s missing assignments. After a few weeks of avoiding my homework, I had 16. I showed my parents as instructed by my teacher, and after they saw how much work I was missing they were furious. First my mom screamed at me, then when my dad got home from work he screamed at me and swatted me with his belt 16 times, one for every missing assignment. It was the first time I had ever gotten in serious trouble because of my grades. 

This became a monthly routine as the teacher started doing sending out this list every month. I inevitably had a few missing assignments every time that paper got sent home, and would get the same response from my parents. I’d get yelled at then my dad would hit me for every missing assignment, telling me to “just do your fucking homework, it isn’t that hard” 

The following year, my new teacher did the same thing except every week instead of every month. Every week on Tuesday this stupid piece of paper would get sent home that made my parents yell at me and hit me, when they never really did before. This is when I started avoiding school because I became scared of it. I was scared of getting missing assignments, scared of failing, and now scared of my dad. 

Now I still hate school and even thinking about school makes my heart rate go up and makes me want to avoid it like the plague. Because of this I have a hard time even signing up for classes let alone actually going to school and doing the work. Then when I inevitably get bad grades it makes me feel worse and even more like a failure, sort of like a viscous cycle. 

How do I overcome this fear? Is there anyway to change my mental correlation of school = get hit and yelled at? How can I attribute school with something more positive, so I don’t dread every second of being in school? I want to graduate college and I won’t stop until I do, I just want to get better grades and actually enjoy it like other people seem to. 

TLDR; my dad hit me as a kid because of bad grades now I hate school, how do I like school again?"
207,please I need someone,just tell me everything will be okay. tell me that I can hold on until tomorrow. please help me please
208,I am done.,"I can't handle it anymore. 

I don't even know where to begin. I don't even know if I care to finish this. It makes absolutely no fucking difference. 

Literally my entire life has been a struggle. I was born with brain cancer, and have several disabilities as a result. I have waxed and waned between being actively and passively suicidal ever since I was about 11. I have a piece of shit job that doesn't pay me enough to actually live. 

Now, many years later, I dated this woman who absolutely ruined my life. She attacked me in my own home, and then played the victim when the police came. I was taken to jail and charged with second degree assault. Meanwhile, she got a protective order against me. Furthermore, she was allowed to stay in MY HOUSE for three or four days while I was not allowed to come home. Finally, I got her out of my house and was allowed to return. This was almost a year ago and my first court date is coming up. 

I have never been in trouble with the law in my entire life. Now, because of some bullshit lies that she told, I am facing losing my freedom, my job, my firearms, everything. 

I am FUCKING DONE. I can't handle this stress anymore. I'm seriously considering ending the shit right here."
209,Does anyone else experience this?,"I feel like I’m just losing motivation to do anything at all in life even things I usually enjoy. I will think of doing something like a basic task and I go to do it then just think what’s the point and just not do it. Like I can’t be bothered with anything and I just want to do nothing forever. I’m behind on college and I’ve got rent to pay but it’s not even bothering me like I just can’t be bothered thinking about those things. 

I’d also like to add things are actually going better in life right now. My parents are doing much better with handling their drug addiction which is something I’ve wished for my whole life, but even that’s not making me happy."
210,I think I am so devastated by aging because young young is a part of my core identity,"I am a 32M and I have been constantly freaking out about aging for over a decade now. There are certain times(more ""transitional"" years) where it intensifies, but in general the idea of no longer having the image associated with young people never sat well with me. I've also always been hypersensitive to the fear that women find younger guys more attractive. 

What I've realized is that I think the core issue behind this is that I consider being young a core part of my identity. Not only do I strongly identify with the undifferentiated ""still exploring"" lifestyle associated with young people, but I also find the physical appearances of young guys to be more relatable and aesthetically appealing. I've noticed this is reflected strongly in which types of characters and media I tend to prefer(e.g. I have a soft spot for anime, largely because of this I think). I've also noticed that I always feel very uncomfortable hanging out in social groups where I most others are younger than me but totally fine with groups where most others are older than me. I also feel uncomfortable with the idea of dating someone younger than me and more comfortable when they are older than me. This causes a lot of anxiety, whenever I come across women I'm attracted to I find myself obsessively worrying about their age and the older I find out they are the more happy I am.

This being the case, I feel like aging is an existential threat to my identity. Like, the prospect of losing my hair is horrifying to me. Up until now, I've managed to look like I'm 24-25, so I think that the persona I project is that of someone younger than my actual age. But when I lose my hair, my age will be visible and my persona will likely change. It feels like I will no longer be myself. Can anyone relate to this kind of feeling? I am wondering if this is a similar feeling to that of people whose gender identity doesn't match their biological sex."
211,"A girl,12, told me she wanted to commit suicide","A girl,12, told me she wants to kill herself

A girl,12, wants to kill herself

She told me this on Omegle, and now I’m devastated. She went on about how she’ll jump off a bridge tomorrow morning at 10:30 (British Time), and I really don’t know what to do about it. I tried so hard to talk her out of it, but she’s still adamant on killing herself. She said her mother suffers from drug abuse, and that she’s said that her daughter should’ve been an abortion. She also told me that her father died when she was 6. The girl also told me she’s been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. 

I really don’t know what to do. I’ll link the Omegle chat in the comments. Please offer me help and advice regarding what to do. How can we prevent her from committing suicide?
I’ve also posted this on r/suicidewatch and r/depression because I want to get her as much help as possible.
Any help is really appreciated. I really don’t want this girl to kill herself."
212,Story of the tea man,"    Tea man had been feeling too lonely but he didn't want to kill himself yet. Tea man just need someone who genuinely rely on him and not out of pity. Tea man happily always accept whatever chore his parents gave him and he knows his parents at least gave him something to do because they really needed it. But it's kinda different from other than the people's that shared his blood. 

     Tea man knows he just used other people to justify that ""someone really needs me"" like volunteering to do their homeworks or things like that, but in truth he feels it was just them giving their empathy. Playing video games and watching videos on the internet makes him feel like he is wasting his time. But he also doesn't know what did he want actually other than filling the void. 

  
    Tea man actually wants to do something and get rewarded as if it is deserved, not because people just gave it because he looked like he tried his best. Now he for the first time in his life he genuinely, 100%ly don't know what to do. Tea man has some friends that he sometimes shares his worries to. But this time Tea man knows exactly what advices his friends going to give him. 

     Tea man may write a letter to himself to distract himself from the situation he currently is in. Maybe tea man will sometime spread his letter to the world for them to see, but he is not ready yet. Maybe sometime when he feels it's the time, way after he finished his letter. Maybe he will write his letter with poor wording and broken grammar's.

    Tea man kind of thinks he know what is the response of the people that read his letter to himself. But after he is ready to just release them he won't care for even the slightest. Tea man also will probably have cringes to his spine seeing his letter he made. But at least  for now he is satisfied with it."
213,I feel like screaming,"I keep going through so many feelings and I mean like, it's stressing me out. Like half the time I'm stressing out because I want to do something, but I can't get the conviction to do something, and the rest of the time, I'm stressing out because I NEED to get something done, but I feel like I can't get up and do it, or else I'll mess it up or something, and nobody I can talk to about it understands.

It's like I can't put it into words, and it's not good like, I can't sit still or anything, but I also can't get out of bed?

It makes me so angry! I don't understand why I'm like this, and then I get all irritable, and snappy, and then I feel guilty for that, and it makes me want to scream!"
214,I guess I just wanna vent? I dunno (excuse my bad grammar),"This is about my mom. I hate her so much. I'm sorry that it has to start off with such a bad mood but it's true. She guilt trips me and gas lights me all the time. When I tried hinting that I had mental issues because of trauma, she said I didn't have trauma because we **""got away from the problem""**. The problem being my abusive step father (thats not the only part of my trauma though). She constantly pressures me about school and I've literally developed a trigger for the phrase **""You're failing""** because of how many times she's said it. I tell her to stop saying that to me because it bothers me, and she just rubs it into my face more. Recently, my depression has been getting worse and I haven't been joining google meets for school and such. This resulted in the law threatening to fine us and now she keeps pressuring me about that as well. She said to me **""Do you want me to go to jail? Do you want your mom to go to jail?""** and then she said something about how its my fault this is happening. She constantly makes empty promises and she lies a lot. She has a smoking and drinking addiction and she tried to stop smoking but soon continued. Every time I try to talk to her about something she shouldn't be doing, she says **""I'm an adult I do what I want you're the kid you can't tell me what to do"".** I know that because I am indeed a kid, that I'm not allowed to have lots of say in stuff but I really only tried talking to her about it. Besides that, she constantly picks on me about being antisocial and stuff like that. My whole family kind of picks on me (I know most of my family is just joking but with my mom it's a different story).  Also, I can't get help because she always ignores me when I ask for stuff like that. When the eye doctor told me I needed glasses, she ignored it and said my eye sight was fine (just an example). I'm scared that if I ask to get diagnosed for depression and I ask to get professional help, she'll just blow me off and tell me something stupid like **""you're fine"".**   


Anyways, I'm sorry if this isn't actually that bad and I'm overreacting and I'm sorry if I wasted someones time. I just wanted to talk about it (I've talked about it with friends but dehjdebebd). Thanks for reading."
215,Thinking about it often,"Does anyone else think about suicide often? Not really planning or intending. Just thinking about how much easier things would be, for yourself and everyone. 
I got pregnant in september with an absolutely crazy guy and terminated 2 weeka ago due to constant suicidal ideations. I dont think i would havs made it through the 9 months alive or at the very least not in the hospital. While i dont feel regret, i do feel guilt. 
This is so heavy to think about everyday. It makes living exhausting. I want to break free from this. How did you guys cope with constant thoughts like this?"
216,Feeling like nothing should be real,"Ever since I was a kid I've occasionally felt an almost unexplainable feeling - the best way to put it is that in those few minutes, nothing feels like it should be happening and I feel how weird it is to be alive. I'm confused as to whether this is normal and want to know if there is any way to stop it because I feel like I'm slowly going mad, believing that nothing is real, that it can't be real. When it starts I feel like I've remembered something I had forgotten that was really important.
Any help would be appreciated."
217,"The vibe in my home has been depressing lately, but I feel like it’s just me.","
Lately, my whole family has been pretty stressed and are mostly in a bad mood. They’re not rude or anything, but family dinners, while they used to be so fun and we were all happy and had conversations, now it’s the opposite. No one talks, my brother is stressed with school and seems very irritable. Little things like the lighting are just making me feel down. 

It’s been like this since the start of December mostly, or maybe late November. I know it’s temporary, and everyone has a reason for not always being in their best mood, I completely sympathize for them. It’s just taking a toll on my mood. Even if I’ve had a bad day, if everyone is in a good mood, it cheers me up. But on days like this, I just feel down, irritated and stressed. 

This is only a problem for me in the evening."
218,Break up Healing is not linear. But has anyone woke up one day clicked with them that they no longer care and just literally moved on?,"It's been months of depression,anxiety, grieving, hoping, fights, tears, and many other low energy self pity life style. I am just wondering if it's possible to wake one day with a shift. Like literally a click that it no longer matters and just not caring at all?

Any similar experiences?

219,My struggles and fighting the stigma,"I suffer from depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and a self harm addiction (though I have not relapsed in a while). In this video I talk about my journey, a project that works to reduce the stigma around mental health, as well as share some tips to talking to others and helping those in need connect with professionals.

220,Is this normal?,"Every time I get on YouTube I see so many skincare and hair care videos and things that I’m interested in and I feel like I should watch every single video. I literally want to watch every single video and if i don’t I get a bad feeling that makes me feel like I’m missing out on life, or I’m not keeping up and falling behind. I feel like everyone else has the information to be successful in the ways that I don’t when I miss skin care videos or anything that deals with bettering my self . The same with Reddit? It’s just too many videos and I can’t watch them all but I feel like I’m failing and loosing at life if I don’t."
221,Do you get headaches from anxiety?,"I’m pretty sure you *can* but idk I just thought I’d ask :P 

And if so, do you always get them when you’re anxious without fail? Do you sometimes get them when you’re not feeling anxious?

Since yesterday, I’ve had this headache that comes, stays for a few seconds, then goes; it’s happened maybe seven times-ish and it’s REALLY triggering my health anxiety (I’m not diagnosed with it officially, though). Anyway, it comes sort of randomly. A very kind user on r/askdocs replied to my post there and suggested i could be having thunderclap headaches but that might not be the case since I don’t have any other symptoms associated with them (and thankfully, too, based on what I read). 

Thunderclap headaches are said, as I read, to not always have triggers but they *can*, physical activity and injury among others. Mine, like I said, sort of come randomly but they could also be from feeling stressed or anxious. I was actually feeling a bit anxious just now and I didn’t get one, though, which is why I’m asking what I asked before. Basically, I wanted to talk to my mum about some health anxiety-related thing, including how I had that headache again moments before, but I didn’t want my dad to overhear and basically I mentioned more on r/healthanxiety. Hgnbghhgg

That’s all I think... I forgot Lol

222,Can depression come back after 2 years?,"Im a 35 year old male with bipolar type 2. Ive been on zoloft 150 mg and abilify 10 mg daily for 2 years. 2 years ago i was suicidal with suicidal ideations. I was in and out of psyche wards several times 2 to 3 years ago.  The last combination of medicines which im currently taking have been really great for me, no suicidal thoughts whatsoever and been going to work every scheduled shift at the dog kennels i work at.  
This morning at work,  i was taking a break and felt an overwhelming sadness,  just a weird mood shift. I decided to find something to do which helped.  I wasnt suicidal or anything just randomly sad. Is this part of bipolar type 2? Im just confused because i don't know how long mania lasts. Ive been dealing with mood swings and stuff for years and always get help. Ive been off and on different meds but now that I've stayed on meds this time i felt saddened like i wasnt on meds.  I had to get used to the tiredness from zoloft but overall its helped.  Should i get a medication adjustment, or an add on medication?"

Anyway he makes me happy, but lately when I'm with him I'm still down, he definitely helps tho but obviously he can't make the sun shine. I really like him but I feel like I'm a bummer when I hang out with him. He says I can talk to him and we have talked about it a bit and he's really sweet but I just feel like a burden. I try to pretend to be happier around him so I don't bum him out.
Any advice? I don't want to lose him, he's one of my only supports.."
224,should I quit therapy?,"Right now I'm seeing a therapist twice a week as an alternative to an intensive outpatient program with the intention to get more personalized and individualized care. (mostly as a response to being administratively discharged from a PHP program because it wasn't serving me). however it seems that every session, all I do is vent about the shit that I get triggered by and how I think it's really unfair. I'm dealing with narcissist abuse and childhood neglect and unfortunately living with my parents who have not really improved any from those behaviors and now outwardly, emotionally criticized and abuse me. I've been trying to move out but because of this economic crisis there's really not a lot of affordable rentals available. Obviously I'm also unemployed and have been to two different mental hospitals this summer. I specifically chose this therapist because she specializes in EMDR which is one of the most recommended types of therapy to heal childhood trauma. (I've done it twice with other therapist and it's helped and I know I need more of it) Yet we haven't started it and it's been probably six weeks because she says I need to get more grounded and figure out what my emotional baseline is but I'm still having these manic rages because I'm being triggered daily by my parents. I'm 37 highly-educated have a fresh master's degree and can't get a job that's part of the reason why I hate my life right now. I've tried a lot of alternative careers and lifestyles like teaching yoga, farming, child care, working in a plant nursery --they all filled my heart and spirit but not my bank account in so one by one I had to leave what I love and take an office job to survive. I've driven across the country, lived in Paris, seen the Grand canyon, hiked up a waterfall in Jamaica, blah blah blah... basically exhausted my bucket list of shit I want to see and do in my life. which also kind of led to suicidal thoughts cuz it's like what the fuck else am I even trying to do on this planet. and that's why I'm really struggling to make any progress in therapy cuz there's nothing else that feels good to try to do because our society is so fucked up. like one of the three directions in my life that I'm discussing with my therapist is to become an expat and actually leave the United States and move to a Caribbean island and run an Airbnb with a contact that I actually know and has invited me to do this. But that's not the point the point is I'm showing up to therapy high on drugs because it's joke to me. my therapist called me out on it last week and now I'm super pissed about it and that's part of the reason I want to discontinue working with her. This whole time, even before I felt suicidal, I had the thought that may be working with a personal trainer would be more effective than talk therapy. but since I live with my parents, and I was suicidal, I gave them permission to be included in my treatment plan and they've been helping pay for a lot of my doctors and they will pay for therapist not a personal trainer. I kind of like what's therapist I feel like she emphasizes with me alot when it's hard to find elsewhere. but I guess I feel like she's not really challenging me or pushing me to change I feel like she's enabling me to stay stuck. I should also mention that this is not the first therapists I've ever worked with I've been majorly depressed and seeing therapist and psychiatrist and been on medication and pursued spiritual healing for the past 17 years. I guess I have one of those conditions that's classified as treatment resistant. I've pretty much tried everything short of Ayahuasca because I think that's a cheap shortcut. Actually got really triggered recently when a guy I met in a dating capacity said that he cured his depression with one hit of LSD. I know it's really popular to talk about psychedelics as part of mental health treatment and cannabis has been part of my treatment for a long time but I've also experimented with mushrooms and LSD and MDMA recreationally have taken probably more than a dozen doses combined and I'm still depressed. I'm getting off topic though I know therapy is important and it's helped me stay alive for 17 years but I'm in a pretty different place than I've ever been in and I know that my ability for logical thinking is maybe impaired right now."
225,"I am never satisfied, ever?","I seem to love the process more than the end result. For example when I really want something I’ll watch videos about it, I’ll learn about it, I’ll be so excited to get it, when I get it the feeling just dies. It’s not as sweet as I thought. It’s like working up an appetite for pizza and you finally get it and it’s cold. I feel this emptiness like I’m missing something in life and I have no clue what it is. I always want to chase the next best thing and usually for me that is finding ways to make more money, I feel like more money will fix everything. For example I hate birthdays and holidays, this time of year my mood is generally on the lower side and I’m slightly more pessimistic, I can’t say I feel full blown depression because I don’t just this feeling of why is everyone so happy? Even Christmas, as rude as this sounds (not trying to be), people will get me gifts, and in my mind it’s just another thing that tomorrow I will no longer care or forget about/have no more excitement towards. I don’t know maybe I’m rambling."
226,Touch,"I have this thing about being touched.

No matter the person I hate to much physical touch. 
My mom trying to hug me or just touching me in general."
227,Just having a rough time (male 15y),"Nothing makes me happy anymore. I feel so lonely and disconnected from everyone and always acting like I’m happy is wearing me down. I feel like all of my friendships and interactions are so surface level but I have no idea how to get close with someone and I can’t open up emotionally to anyone. To everyone I’m just a kind of antisocial but relatively happy kid who tells a lot of jokes but I just don’t feel anything anymore. I don’t hate anyone I don’t like anyone. I don’t even know if I love my family anymore and I don’t look forward to anything in life. Everything that used to be fun to me or made me happy is now at best a distraction to keep my head from tearing itself apart, the funny thing is recently I’ve been laughing more too, I thought laughter was supposed to help but it just hides the pain. I don’t even understand why this is happening and it scares me because my life is fine, I have no reason to be upset, I know people with problems ten times worse than anything I’ve ever gone through so I feel like my emotions are not worth being upset over. I’ve never felt so alone and I feel like if this goes on I’ll just be so emotionally scarred that I’ll never be able to be close with anyone. The thought of telling this to my own family already terrifies me. I feel like just a sheep of a person walking around going through the motions of things that used to make me happy with people I used to care about but now the best I can hope for is to feel nothing"
228,I have finally given up social media (apart from Reddit),"Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok...I have deleted the whole lot. I found myself feeling lower and lower each day, scrolling through social media and seeing 'perfect Instagram models' and people spreading hurtful misinformation on just about every topic. I couldn't cope with the amount of toxic and negative behaviour on these apps, it really affected my mental health without me fully realising it until today. It's a huge weight off my shoulders, no pressure to look 'perfect' in photo's, no negativity, no one fighting over stupid little things. I only kept this app because I can control what subreddits I see and this has helped keep the negativity off my newsfeed."
229,Hyperfixation issues :/,Lately I have been super hyperfocused in mcyt and I feel like I talk about it too much. I feel like I'm getting annoying because it's always on my mind and it always comes up in conversation.
230,The benefits of walking," I'm sure many of you heard the advice ""do some sport it'll help you"". Well,  it will. But it's hard to force yourself to train, especially when you feel depressed. However, there is a physical activity that doesn't require much effort but provides some benefits. I'm talking about walking.

This year was tough for me (because of obvious reasons, but also personal issues). I had a  depression episode at the end of the summer, and I drank heavily through most of the year. I decided to cut drinking, so I stopped this month and didn't drink anything since 30/11. I'm not dependent on booze but still, I became more irritated and anxious. Drinking a lot of beer every evening was my way to cope with boredom, anxiety, stress, and bad mood.  So I started to go for long walks almost every day, something between 4  and 10 kilometers. And it really helps me to deal with bad emotions. It clears my mind, calms me, and makes my mood better.

When  I was depressed in August, it was hard for me to deal with daily duties. I didn't study, left my temporary work (I was paid well but the work was stressful and I just couldn't function). My apartment was messed up. Sometimes I tried to ""get my shit together"", and cleaned the apartment, but it happened once in a while when I had a little more energy. And sometimes I went for a walk in the evening. It was hard because I was tired all the time, but sometimes I succeeded to force myself to do it, and when I did, I felt better. At least I felt less shitty.

Walk, walk, walk. Walk in the city, walk in nature, walk with or without music. This is good for your health, both physical and mental. It won't cure your problems, but it can help you to feel better. Even a little help is help. I know some of you are just not able to get out of bed, but if you're able to, it's worth trying. Good luck and keep care of yourself.

P.S. If you have enough energy, run. Especially if you don't want to spend too much time. 20-30 minutes of running will definitely make you feel a bit better"
231,Finally made an appointment,"For over 2 years I’ve been telling myself I’m going to go and talk to someone about what’s been going on and I finally made the appointment, I never talk to anyone about what’s happening so I’m really scared about going but I keep trying to tell myself that it’s what’s best for me"
232,I’m more motivated than ever to work but it feels like a cloud of tiredness and feeling down follows me.,"
I get 10 hours of sleep on average on average as I have a gene of narcolepsy. So I need it to feel refreshed.

But I feel very motivated to make my life better but while working I don’t feel like how I used to in having as much enthusiasm. And there’s no reason for me to be sad, I just don’t feel well, thoughtout the day I have dead eyes in that there always half open now by default. 

How can I help myself, I take 15 mg of Celexa but I tried 30mg with no noticeable increase in my well being. And I actually don’t think the celexa is doing much for me as I haven’t noticed any improvement, since taking it 3 months ago. My memory is also poorer than it used to be.

I just want this cloud of tiredness to be gone and for the default position for my eyes not be half open and dead anymore."

234,Nobody knows just how much I hate myself.,"I'm always in a state of self-destructiveness. I can't escape it. I think I'm doing right by someone, then I get told I'm not and everyone gets super pissed at me. it's hard for me to learn social boundaries because of this. When people get mad at me, my anxiety gets super high and I self isolate and stop taking my meds. I don't know what to do to get out of this cycle."
235,I’m not sure how to deal with it anymore.,"Most of my life has been hell for me. It has been traumatizing. I’m a 22 year old woman that doesn’t know how to help myself through my anxiety from it all. I’ve lost interest in almost everything I used to love to do..I need guidance and support from someone that understands. The other day a family member told me that my mental health is an excuse and bullshit..I guess it’s hurting more than I thought. I’m really losing myself to this battle, what’s the best thing to do in this situation..?"
236,24M feeling hopeless.,"That’s it. 

It’s crazy how fast life goes by &amp; I really thought I’d figure things out but here I am lost as ever."
237,Why do I feel like everyone around me is fake?,"I am feeling anomic, as if everyone around me is merely “providing good costumer service”, and there’s nowhere to escape from this lingering paranoia. I feel the need now to hold people by their shirt collars and demand “What am I to you? What do you want from me?”"
238,Please help me find websites to vent for my suicidal friend!!!!!,He's really on the edge. He's only fifteen but he's convinces he's a special case and that no one has had it as bad as him. He's so close to ending it and I've heard from others here that there are websites you can go to to talk out your feeling with people who've felt the same way. Does anyone know of any?? Thank you so much
239,I feel I’m going crazy,"To start, I guess I’ll say I’m a bit a depressed. I have not had a medical diagnosis, but I’m sure it doesn’t take an expert to realize I’m really feeling down. I wake up feeling exhausted. Unless I’m driving, I feel emotionally numb and fatigued. I am apathetic. I don’t care for holidays. I don’t talk to my parents even though we live together. I go to work, feign some amusement (think customer service smile), and then come back at 12 am feeling glum and disappointed. The cycle repeats daily except for the days I stay home to browse Reddit and sleep (usually 2-3 days per week).

I like to think this all started because of the pandemic, but deep down I’m sure it’s because of my failure. I’m a failed engineer. Left and right I see people apply for and get jobs related to their career while I sit and wait for rejections. Those people that get jobs are not outliers. Companies are still hiring engineers.

Meanwhile, I’m sitting in my car attempting gig work to pay off all kinds of debts. I make just enough to cover all my debts for the month and a few extra dollars to buy food, pay car maintenance (oil, filters, fluids, etc), and keep my bank account from reaching sub-0 to keep myself from going insane.

Whenever I stay home, I feel anxious. I want to go out and do things. But there’s nothing to do that comes to mind. I want to apply for jobs, but I feel too lazy to do that now. I want to be happy, but I can’t find a thing to cling onto. 

This all goes away after a few hours of being out or working. I get the urge to apply to jobs again when I go out, but there’s nowhere to do that. I can’t sit in a restaurant. I tried sitting in my car, but it gets too uncomfortable and gas burns up pretty quickly. The libraries are closed. The city is closed. Outside is no longer an option because it’s winter and my hands get too cold.

In all, I feel trapped in a cycle of procrastination and mediocrity. Nothing gets done and I feel anxious every time I think about it. I’m beginning to feel I wasted my time by going to college and getting loaded up with debt when I could’ve been working. I feel useless every day and honestly I see no end to this any time soon."
240,I’m new here and I just need to rant for a minute.,"I am 15 and struggling greatly with my identity and just everything. I barely know who I am, and I don’t like much about myself. I self harm and haven’t been able to stop for more than a few days, but I’ve grown so tired of it all that I just might actually keep a streak.

I’m an athlete, so I’m good under pressure. And I’m smart, so I can slack off and still get high 80s and low 90s without trying. I think sometimes I’ll purposely not try just because when I try at things they aren’t ever perfect. I’m a huge perfectionist. I once spent 20 minutes in class trying to do this single cartoon panel, with the deadline to finish it in about 40 minutes. My friend jokingly smacked me upside the head for it. 

I’m kind of miserable a lot... whenever I feel like I need to talk to someone I always think to myself that I have no right to put that on someone. Which, I don’t have. Why should my friends have to deal with that? Especially when they probably don’t like me, and are either pitying me or faking it just because..."
241,6 years in eating disorder recovery...,im doing the hard things and feeling the fear and doing it anyways but it doesn't seem to be any less anxiety inducing
242,Social Media Addiction And Mental Health,"  Nowadays, Social media plays a significant role in most teenagers’ lives, including you and me. A 2018 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 750 13-17-year-olds found that “97% of teens use social media platform such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat, 92% of teenagers go online every day, and [impressively] 50% of teens are addicted to social media” (“Teen Social Media Addiction”). Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, teenagers have got plenty of time to scroll through social media and improve their social media presence. Congratulation to us all! Now we all have our lavish lifestyle online. We are all happy, aren’t we?! Social media addiction damages teenagers’ mental health and boosts their depression and anxiety. 
       Social comparison is the main reason for teenagers’ depression and anxiety. “Social comparisons may seem to serve several positive functions, including self-enhancement. Frequent social comparisons, however, have a dark side” (C. L. Aberson et al.). The more engagement in social media, the more exposure to different followers’ posts that results in more people make comparisons. Besides, Teenagers tend to post only their “highlight reel” on social media to brag about the parts of their lives. So, excessively scroll through these massive followers’ posts and “like” their fake luxuries makes teenagers, including you and me, to have an upward comparison and think everyone is happier or better off than they are. That is why teenagers are depressed, including you and me. (Vries). 
Frequent upward comparison on social media not only makes teenagers depressed, but also they are more likely to experience envy (Monroe, par 2). These envious teenagers, however, are tempted to take away whatever that makes others superior to themselves, whether it is popularity or a unique talent. “And they use bullying as a tool” (Gordon). A new Pew Research Center survey finds that 59% of U.S. teens have personally experienced cyberbullying and 40% of teens have experienced cyberbullying more than twice (Anderson). Unlike face-to-face bullying, cyberbullying stays online forever, and there is no way to get rid of it. That is why most teenagers, including you and me, do not speak up after being harassed online, and they would drive into a deep depression that, in many cases, has led to suicidal attempts. I say, “Social media addiction is not worth a life at all.” How about you?!"
243,"I just got out of a severe depressed ment state. I assure you, it gets better","I was in a very very bad state of depression for a long time. I didn't know what to do, everytime something helped me it would just go away somehow. comfort movies removed from streaming services, headphones breaking, loosing bonds with friends because they have more important people to talk to; it hurt. It just didn't stop.

But eventually things did get better. When your depressed small things feel like massive things. You just convince yourself that everything is terrible and will never get better

That's not a good mindset

You must do good for yourself. Take showers, take your meds, eat; drink water, it will make you feel so much better. Moping around will just make things worse and nobody wants that. You must be happy, you must be cheerful

I want you to be happy and I want you to be okay. I know what it's like way too well, but as long as you take care of yourself things will get better. You'll always have up and downs in your life but that's okay. The pain will go away. The happiness will come to you. But it won't just fall in your lap. You must do something about it. Get help, talk to people. You cant do this alone

You've got this. Okay? You'll be okay in the end. I promise."
244,Sent a referral off for potential therapy,"Today, at 2:57 am, I decided that it was time to actually seek help. I have just sent off my self referral and should hopefully hear back in the next few weeks. 

Things shall hopefully begin looking up."
245,I have often had sucidal ideation and looking at how many attempts are aborted or the failed attempt the person is grateful.,I am wondering what causes this and if there are ways to induce this with different methods.  Ideally safer.
246,help plz,
247,Nausea when eating?,"So lately I've relapsed and been hit again with depression. I've been in my room for 2 weeks, have hardly been taking care of myself and haven't really had an appetite. I feel sick, but I think it's just the depression. Fatigue, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, tummy aches and dizziness. I noticed today when trying to eat, I couldn't finish my food. I just felt this wave of nausea and dizziness when I'd take a bite. Is that normal with depression, or am I physically sick?"
248,Entering my second week on Lamotragine,"I started Lamotragine last week. Today I enjoyed my first glass of wine, okay maybe two. I am still on small doses so I didn't notice any side effects. It was mostly an experiment to see if something light would interact. I don't intend on drinking frequently on Lamotragine since it can have a bad reaction, but I think that if I wait til the buzz wears off or delay my meds a few hours it should be okay. Once in a blue moon of course. Anyway, I was talking with my sister today, and she said that I sounded a lot more positive than I had in a long time. I value her opinion a lot, so hearing that felt amazing. I intend on taking my meds as prescribed and continuing on this new and improved chapter of my life."
249,Moving again to a healthiervplace,"So first off i have to say im overwhelmed with gratitude right now.... Because i had my best and worst day of the year tonight. 

I moved outt on own for the 2nd time in my life this march.  My formal diagnosis are asd anxiety asthma clinical depression and essential tremors(the shakes kind of ). 

I was stuck in moms basement because one of the negative things about MY autism(theres gifts too). Is the struggle to be socialable. 

I literally had to look for 2 years tooth and nail and finally my mom realized i wasnt able to so she helped getvme my place in march. 

At first this seemed like the perfect place for me. I realized fast i cant live in a roim smaller than my old bedroom. Its above a bar. This didnt seem too bad becsuse i dint drink but i play drums so i could go to jamnights but covid shut the jam nite down like a week after i moved in. 
Lets just say its small and one of those the 4 walls are closing in on me type bachelor. 

Fast forward to december i1st. tell social work i need help aquiring a place cause the past gave me anxiety or ptsd prob anxiety. They get me in today.... I meet with a specialized housing worker she brought an lot alot of papers to sign. 
My appt gets rushed cause my dad is supposed to pick me up for a cruise in his semi truck. By the time i was with my dad my anxiety about moving out had taken a grasp of me pretty bad i got kinda manic with my pops but he handles it greatly always tells me its all good no mattervwhat. 

So i get back around 5pm tonight come upstairs and my neighbour is moving first thing i said jealous. Then it hits me his place is way nicer than mine so i pick up the phone and call landlord to see if i can get a showing from him to talk about options. My landlord says i have 2 appts 2moro for the suite but since ive been such a good tenant he would give me 1st dibs i said thank you like 3 times in 30 seconds. 

I text social work do i have the rent to do this and they respond after hours to a voicemail i thought was gonna be heard in morning. Yes rents 650 i get 1100 a month in current place but id get an extra hundred if i moved. Out so 1200. I was struggling with 500 rent and 1100 since march but i didnt aquire any debt thanks to helpful family. 

Keep in mind im gripped by my anxiety this whole time. I just kept pushing and pushing and i snaged the place. 

Got talking with la dlord again and hes says ill charge you the same for dec cause u move tomorrow. I thought like wow this is awesome. 
Ialso beforevthat part talked to him about having tonpay late cause proccessing money dosent happen overnight he said dont worry get it to me whenever. Now that was extra for sure he said youve been a percect tenant so far.

I said are you fucking serious out loud i have impulse issues as well. 

I literally was the one mainly responsible for getting this place and i didnt even reallybstop to think it was all of the top of my head. 

Of course my helpers and luck played a huge role to just come home at exactly the right time when all i day i wascoff timing wise. 20 mins latter i wouldve never noticed my neighbour moving. 

Guess that sums it up just the almagamation gave me one of those amazing but tough days. 

Where im moving is now ideal causecits bigger than my 2 previous homes. 

And stupid im not totally superficial but i despreatly need to house decorate to call it my den cant wait for 2moro i might not sleep tonight til after the move now. 

Ive always been told im very grateful but this day blew that outbof the water. 

I cant believe im being rewrded i burstvout in tears im not a cryer but i broke down when i realized my days over and i can wake up to another top of the line day 2moro havent had 2 good days comsecutivly besids vacay in march afteroving in with mom to help her at her new place 2. And the 11 years of clinical depression moderate. 

Thats all thx any responders or upvoters it goes along way to a guy like me... Take care of yourelves you cant wait for happy to come back you have to chase it like a dog and its tail. Its brutal when where going thru already brutal stuff but i just wanna say i could go darker to prove a point but im not gonna i think its proven already. Thx again see yall around"
250,I'm worried I'm a pedophile and have two young children under 6. Feeling very suicidal and ready to go through with it.,"Just for a bit of context. I'm 29 married and have two young children under 6. I have chronic OCD/Anxiety and depression that is already leading me to consider suicide. I'm worried that I would do something to my kids someday (this may be the OCD though) even though It makes me sick to even think that it would happen.

What I did do once is that I masturbated to the thought of getting caught by my child (however again I've done idea this with many people adults, is this exhibitonism?).

Basically I think that my children would be better off if I died and I'm planning to kill myself in the next couple months after my finances are secured for them. Is this the right thing to do or am I clouded by pre-existing mental issues (namely the OCD)

Apologies in adavance if this is isn't the correct subreddit to post this ("
251,What are little things you can do everyday to improve your mental health?,"Such as drinking a cup of tea when you wake up, doing some stretches/yoga, etc."
252,shitty past couple of weeks (tw),the last few weeks i feel like i'm losing control of my mental health. i'm suicidal but i don't want to die. i'm disassociating a lot. i literally thought i was having a stroke bc i was tired. i'm so done with this. i'm going to therapy soon but it might not be until after the holidays because it's hectic right now and the dr is busy. also i've starting sh-ing more and i'm really mad at myself about it. i wish i could go back like 2 years ago where i was at my peak.
253,Neuropsychological evaluation for mental illness?,"So I was diagnosed with BPD, OCD, and ADHD combined type by psychiatrists and primary care doctor, and currently, on medications for mood swings, anxiety, and ADHD.

I recently did the full neuropsychological evalutaion by a clinical psychologist including numerous questionnaires about asking how I feel about myself, attention symptoms, and some computerized tests, pattern tests, reciting numbers tests, etc over 3 weeks and 6-8 hours.

And basically, for my result, I was told that I have a major depressive disorder with mixed features and traits of BPD and ADHD NOS. Apparently, because I'm an adult and I have comorbidities, even though I meet the criteria of ADHD combined type, she gave me NOS because she wasn't able to tell where the symptoms are coming from.

But, I just don't understand how I can have a major depressive disorder when I don't feel depressed at all?! Or I've never been depressed more than a few hours?

I'm more like a very happy and jumpy person most of the time, I found genuine happiness from little things like sunny weather, or going grocery shopping. And If I get sad or upset it will never be longer than 2-3 hours and I will be happy again. And this was the reason why my psychiatrist told me I do not have major depressive or bipolar disorders but emotional dysregulations (BPD traits and ADHD).

So now I'm confused. The psychologist tried to explain to me saying that I don't have the ""stereotypical depression"", but just a mild one with mixed features, and also she told me something like I have kinds of ""bipolar"" with it. But I just lost words because I or my family would never think I would have depression.

And then the fact that when I told her I've been on ADHD medications and it's working great for me, she told me something like if the medication is working, then I have ADHD, and that probably my depression and anxiety is coming from the ADHD symptoms. (But I have a friend with ADHD and reacting horribly to stimulants)

I'm just really confused. She just kept saying there is probably some underlying issues that I'm depressed, and me being happy and positive is basically the coping mechanism of my depression. And tbh, I don't even know what to say, because how can I be depressed without knowing that I'm depressed?! But if I'm happy, do I still need to find the ""underlying"" issues that cause my depression?

254,Transmigration,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this but I really need some advice. 

So earlier today my buddy told me he wasn’t feeling well. I asked what was wrong and this is what he told me. (I asked if I could post this as he does not have Reddit)

So the other day, one of his mutual friends had passed away due to suicide. After a bit he started to feel weird, like someone was in his brain. He told me that he thinks it’s transmigration, which is the movement of a soul into another body after death. It seems similar to reincarnation. 

My friend thinks that the soul of his mutual friend is now in his brain and is speaking to him. I’m not sure what they’ve said to my friend, all I know is that my friends been having a hard time with this. 

If I could get some advice on what to do to help my friend out, that would be great! 
Thanks!"
255,"Depression, Lack of Social Skills, and Lack of Drive","I am a 17-year-old male in the USA. I do not have any medical issues nor do I have low self-esteem. 

I am asking about what I can do in order to improve my complete lack of passion and striving towards better things, my lack of social skills, my inability to feel empathy towards the majority of people, loss of interest in relationships and activities somewhat quickly, an inability to feel loss or wins (happy for doing good or sad and angry for losing), ETC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

It all started when I was leaving third-grade private school towards public school. In private school, I had many friends with whom I can relate, have fun, and hang out with. I also was a happy person overall and liked to try new things and was very interested in sports. Also during this time, I did have an issue with completing schoolwork and tended to be lazy. 

During my transition into public school, I completely shut myself off from others and made only 1 somewhat awkward friend. I became disgruntled with everything and started to be indifferent to everything and only liked to play videogames. I also stopped communicating with others and often mumble and hum out sentences instead of speaking. My grades were still okay and I was starting to hate soccer and doing anything with my family. 

This continued to this day but with one exception, I am starting to procrastinate extremely badly and failed a marking period because of it. I felt indifferent towards my grades and kept saying to myself you need to do the work but I procrastinated on it. My parents got on me about it and how I basically ruined my chances to any service academy. But I thought idc, I had no chance anyway so I didn't mint it. They also got on my ass about how I don't care about anything or anyone and how I am unable to communicate with others. Along with this, (i quit soccer and many other sports along the way) they noted how I completely lacked any passion for getting better at anything and trying and how I can be okay with losing basically every single tennis tournament I participate in. 

&amp;#x200B;

My current tennis coach is trying to mentor me through these issues but it is not working or leaving a lasting impression that will make me willingly make a change in my life. I do realize that I am basically setting myself up for failure at this point but I just don't care enough about my future."
256,Does anyone just kind of feel like a different person than they did before the pandemic hit?,"It's so hard to explain how I feel, but I just don't feel the same. I feel like I've lived several lives during this pandemic and not necessarily in a good way. Some of it was okay, and I appreciate that I've been able to see the silver lining in some things and learned to not take things for granted. However, there's been a *lot* of bad, and a lot of tears, and a *lot* of anxiety that I feel has changed me to some extent. 

Some things I expect to go back to the way they were eventually. The confidence I feel I've lost while sitting around makeup-less in pjs most of the time and rarely putting effort in will probably come back. Feeling like I'm not really that fun of a person will probably come back. Feeling like I've been quite negative will hopefully not linger too much outside of this situation. I guess I don't really expect this new anxiety to go away because it's not usually so simple. 

I guess I just wanted to see how other people felt."
257,How do normal parents act? Are they compassionate?,"My perspective on parenting is only based on my own, and I really wonder compared to them how most parents act.

How do parents respond to crying? Is it compassionate or is that just a high standard set by movies? 

Do parents give physical affection or try to understand their children?"
258,"Who do I blame: myself, my boyfriend or his mental illness?","I have this boyfriend for almost three years now and I love him to death! I want to spend my life with him and I can’t see myself without him. However, we always run into situations about his mental health. I mean right now we are in this “break” which I learned I really hate and I just want to spend time with him already, but he learned he needs more time for himself. He has depression and anxiety and for the past year it has really been a struggle for him and when it is for him it is for us and me as well. Every time we argue it is because of how he DEALS with his depression and/or anxiety, whether that be not get help, cancel plans with me, skip work, spend money he cannot spend. Sometimes he even hides things behind my back like buying marijuana for example. During these times he lacks communication too so I only get one or two word responses, I never know when he will respond back and I always keep the conversation going. We usually only see each other on weekends and weekends are good for us, we are a happy “Tumblr” couple on the weekends, but weekdays are when we aren’t together, that’s usually where the arguing occurs. We had a huge convo last night on FB about him saying how he is not the right guy for me and how I deserve more and all of this stuff that usually would end with a break up, but he does not want to break up with me because I am his dream woman and I am the reason he persists, I am his world and neither do I want to break up with him. But is this healthy....? Is it healthy for a relationship to be guided by my boyfriends mental health status? Is it healthy that I blame myself for maybe not giving him the patience he needs or doubting that maybe I am not the right fit for him? Is it healthy that I break down because I feel like I can’t share this with anyone because it is so complex? If you read through all of this I just need any advice please.... what do I do...?"
259,Feel like I've hit rock bottom - don't know where to go from here.,"I (18F) have struggled with mental health issues for a long time but recently things have just gotten out of control. I'm doing things I've never done before, like stealing alcohol from my parents and drinking it alone in my room. I've cut for a long time but it's gotten to a point where I cut basically every day, sometimes more than once a day. I've completely fucked my relationship with my mum. She said she's a failure for raising somebody like me, and that she wants nothing to do with me. She said I make everybody miserable, I'm a lying piece of shit, and so on. Even when I go out with friends I can't manage to feel happy. I feel like I'm trapped behind a glass wall and I can see my friends laughing and having a good time but I'm trapped and unable to feel the same way. I just feel so empty all the time. I think of killing myself all the time and it's gotten to the point where I'm constantly searching up different methods online, thinking about what I would write in a note, etc. I don't know why I'm posting this but I guess I just need to say it."
260,I fantasize about leaving a suicide note somewhere and my parents finding while I'm at work it so Id have no choice but to tell them the truth.,"Things like that. Finding a suicide note. Someone noticing my cuts. Seeing one of my to do lists for the day with ""cut self"" as one of the damn bullet points. Something so that I can be relieved of all this pressure. I guess I don't know if it would really help though. Honestly I just fantasize about telling them or my sister face to face how badly I want do die. To stop suffering in silence. But I still can't convince myself to do anything about it."
261,I'm not going to die yet,"I wrote a few items in r/SuicideWatch about my anxiety involving a difficult class and the fear of not being accepted into the major. I got an email today saying that I got accepted into the major. I feel at peace now, that I'm able to rest and enjoy my Christmas without being scared of failing. I survived this year and am ready to embrace this major and get closer to graduation."
262,No Sympathy for Superior People?,"My whole life I thought of myself as extremely caring and empathetic. I have spoken many times about how it’s a curse to have “such a big heart” because I constantly am having longing sorrowful thoughts about homeless people, widowed old people, disabled people etc. to the point that it can make me sad at the drop of a hat. However, the older I’ve gotten I have realized that I have a tendency to only have empathy for the situations of people that I “deem” inferior to me. Anytime something sad/bad happens to someone that I see is prettier, richer, more popular than me...I just tend to not feel bad for them at all and think “they’re fine”. What does this mean? Am I actually even an empathetic person at all? Honest thoughts please. Thank you and blessings to everyone out there!"
263,Quarantine Brain,"Is anyone else experiencing a low that isn't quite your typical depression? it's this shitty brain fog and you're losing your sense of self, but you're too existentially tired to completely react to it in the way your typically anxiety / depression forces you to"
264,Does stress do this?,"**Have you ever had abrupt comments creep into your head, like ""Kill yourself"" or frequent images of you cutting off your own arm?**

**I'm just asking if this is a somewhat common side effect of stress:**

I started a new job a few months ago after being off during COVID for several months. The job is the most stressful job I've ever had, but I'm not dealing with life and death on a daily basis or a toxic workplace. I was pretty low when I was out of work, but I am also pretty low now that I am in this job which took me months to find.

Anyway, I worry about the workload, what people think of me, whether I will be fired, whether I am capable or cut out for any job.

I ruminate a lot, so I'm used to negative thoughts swirling in my head, but while I am at work, I will get thoughts in my head like, ""You should be dead"", ""I'm going to kill you"", ""Please, die"". These phrases can come up dozens of times in my day. I don't know how to describe them as different from other thoughts except that they come up suddenly as if not part of a train of thought, per se. They come on unbidden, almost like a song that you suddenly realize is stuck in your head. I'm taken aback, as if surprised when the thought comes up, then I get more depressed and anxious. I will sometimes zone out for several minutes and have a kind of waking nightmare about being fired or being found to be incompetent, and then ""awaken"" even though I was never asleep and find that reality doesn't feel much better. There are parts of the day when it's difficult to focus because of ruminations. I don't have full-on panic attacks, but I have moments when I can't do the simplest things (e.g. Today, I got halfway through zipping up my lunch bag and could not find the will to continue, which made me almost cry, but it hurt too much to cry).

**I know these thoughts and symptoms are by no means desirable, but is this not uncommon? Is it just stress? Does this go away or is this just adult life?**

I don't want to leave the job because I've never had a permanent job before and I want to prove myself, both in a career-establishing sense and in a I-have-never-been-good-enough sense. I want to be good enough to handle this job that other people in my company are able to do."

I could cut deeper than I ever did.

I want it to bleed, a lot, a lot more than it ever did.

266,How can I (23f) help my dad (55m) with his mental health during the pandemic?,"I've been living with my parents again since September (haven't lived at home for 6+ years) and have noticed my dad's mental health getting worse since the end of October. He normally plays hockey with his friends 2-3 times per week and he was able to over the summer, but with the new restrictions here, he had to cancel this. He also hasn't been able to see his friends because of restrictions and a lot of them think zoom is stupid or don't know how it works/don't try to do online things with him when he suggests anything. He has told us he is upset and lonely but I don't know what to say or how to help. It's just the three of us and neither my mom nor I share any common hobbies he has such as playing guitar, making music, or sports. We recently lost my grandpa (mom's dad) and my mom has been preoccupied with that and distracted with the will etc so she isn't really there. I am trying to do more things with him like go on walks, watch some tv together, and go for drives around the city, but nothing I am doing seems to be enough and he keeps saying he misses his friends.

He also is beating himself up for not doing as much as he is used to and gets upset when we ask questions such as ""what are you doing today?"" because he doesn't feel like he is doing enough. Everything seems to be a bad topic and it's dividing us all (even more). Also - him and I are very different. For example, I eat a completely different diet than the rest of my family, but I try to eat with them everyday and I've tried my whole life to connect with him through sports and learning how to make music but it is really not my thing. Last thing - I'm moving soon (January) so I don't know if there even is anything I can do anymore. Any suggestions/ideas would be great!

**TL;DR** my dad is having a bad time and I'm looking for tips on how to help"

I woke up during the night because I scratched my leg so aggressively that it was stinging and distinctly remember having the intent to self harm in my mind when I woke to my stinging leg.

I do not self harm or have any inclination to do so in my daily life, and my mental health is generally good.

279,Advice? Thoughts? TW: Mental illness/abuse,"I am a 20 year old gay male who is about to graduate from college. I live in the same city that my college is in and am currently living with my family again after breaking up with a boyfriend. Me and my ex had been seeing each other for about 2 years before we split up over basically having communication issues. Before living with him I always lived with my family. In high school I was never very social but never had any type of issues that hindered my day to day life. While most of my friends got jobs and seemed to “develop” into adults I was always studying. I had very few jobs and never really was taught about independence. I took every AP class I could take and worked my ass off to graduate in the top 1% of my class. I also passed every AP exam to get college credit. I got into many great schools but my dad lost his job and I didn’t have enough scholarship money to go to those schools so enrolled in the local 4 year in our city. My parents for most of my life seemed perfect. However, they reacted very negatively when I came out. Over time it has gotten better but I can no longer deny some of their toxic traits. One night in high school my mother and me got into a fight. I walked away and said she was acting like a cunt and turned around to be punched in the face. She beat me until my dad pulled her off and she kicked him in the stomach. Like my family usually does they ignored it. Over the years we have all had several breakdowns that were just ignored the next day. My parents always assured me that everyone “ acted this way” behind closed doors and that it was perfectly normal. I met my ex bf at the end of high school. I really fell hard for him and he showed me love that I really had never seen before. He didn’t yell and scream and cuss. Alas my terrible communication skills prevented me from diffusing small situations that led to me resenting him. We broke up right before he proposed. He was devastated and wants to work on things. My parents hate him. He is very introverted/ can be socially awkward and does not know how to talk to them. He also knows many of the things that they did to me that I now realize are not normal. Upon turning 20 I have noticed a shift in my behavior. I have been seeing a therapist who assured me that I have anxiety and that I need to “ take walks”. However, I am starting to feel it’s much more. Upon moving back with my family I have screaming matches constantly. I go into these blind rages where I don’t know half of what I am saying until it is over. I feel extreme guilt and remorse after. The guilt is so bad I just feel that I am a monster. My parents have allowed my 17 year old sister to move her 21 year old bf into our home. They are both extremely nasty and not clean. They bring their animals in the house and let them poop and do not clean it, leave moldy dishes in the sink, and keep our sheared bathroom nasty. I have talked to them and asked my sister to please help as she just turned 18 and should know how to pull her weight. I am greeted with the usuals “ fuck you” that gets thrown around in our house. I started to feel myself changing. Every fight was getting more and more intense. I am extremely ashamed to say that the last few have become violent. I keep trying to explain that it happens and I can barely recall or rationalize the outbursts. I am almost certain that some form of mental illness is beginning to present within me. I feel so much shame and I do not know what to do. Beyond myself, I am becoming convinced that my entire family suffers from untreated mental illness. They all react in such explosive ways that are not normal no matter how they try to claim others do the same thing. For instance, when I had one of my episodes my dad showed himself. He got in my face and said if you hit me I’m going to knock you out and show you what happens. I had not made any moves towards him or anything I was sitting down trying to calm myself. I also made a comment saying I was at the point of having myself committed. My dad misheard me thinking I said commit suicide. He then told me there was a gun in the closet and that nobody would care if I did it. He said I was an adult and could make that choice. I confronted my mother about her punching me and dragging me down the stairs as a young teen and she said that I always try to blame her. They said I’m self centered and just need to “ live my life” without drama. My dad constantly criticizes me about my gay mannerisms. Saying that if I acted “normal” I would have friends. If I complain they claim they are trying to make my life better. I have no money. No job. No bf. No other family members who are any different. I feel very alone. And my dads ruined credit won’t let me take out loans for school/living like others. I am able to attends school rn only bc of scholarships, gov loans, and living with them rent free. I can’t continue to live like this. I don’t know how much more I can take. I feel like I have a serious mental illness that is not being managed and I’m becoming afraid of myself. I have lashed out and hurt everyone who ever cared about me. If anyone has any thoughts, advice, or has known a similar situation I am open to hearing thoughts. Thank you so much"
280,"Grey Skies, Sunshine Shining Through (64)","December 15. Winter is here. The skies are more grey, the sun is still there. The days get darker quicker, the sun is still there, on the other side at that time. This moment is here, we must live present in the moment and enjoy it for us. Enjoy something that has been given to us, a blessing.

  
Its been difficult at times to maintain presence and to enjoy the moment when goals have been set, time schedules need to be met and there are many things to do everyday but what I am learning is that the balance of life is, that in itself. Balance from day to day is what makes up, balance from week to week, month to month and the year in full circle. The calendar year may be coming to end but I truly hope you are not waiting for the switch of the calendar to start your ""resolutions"". You should be starting them right now, to get ready to go **FULLY IN,** once the ""new year"" changes. For me, I believe that the new year starts on my birthday, again you believe what you believe, I will believe what I do. I will still celebrate the change of the year but I am not waiting for the change of the year to start focusing on what I want now. Everything takes time though and within that resilience is where we learn how to manage our day to day, week to week, month to month, leading to the full circle of the year.

  
If you are waiting for the new year to change, start **right** now by writing down some goals that you want to start working on, **right now.** Then either later on today, tomorrow, the day after, start at the top of your list, middle, bottom, remember there is no true **structure,** but solely what structure we allow ourselves to think there is. Start working slowly on your new goals or what we have conditioned to be called ""new years resolutions"", so by the time the year switches over, you will be in FULL FOCUS for those goals and ready to conquer them Day 1. Remember, it takes time to move into what you want to work towards and that starts by beginning to work at them now, clearing space, changing day to day habits and preparing yourself.

  
**I love you.**

So my issue is that I don't really have any as far back as I can remember. My childhood wasn't really stable or happy, like many many people. 

So my question is what should I do instead of this? 
Is there another technique that can be used in place of this? Or is this basically pop phycology they shouldn't be taken seriously?"

I've been struggling with alot of mental, emotional, and physical pain and frustration throughout the year and I've been unable to get professional help lately due to some mishap with a douche of a therapist where he put me on a blacklist that's followed by, as far as I know, all of the therapists and psychiatrists within the capital here in my country (I live in the Philippines, and I live in the capital) and I've come to believe it is a thing after making 20 more phone calls with 11 of them mentioning I'm on the list, and 9 others saying they can't help due to the pandemic... which is pretty much the same reason I was given when I was making plenty of phone calls looking for a therapist before this douche one put me in that blacklist.  


So, lately, my system's been just making me want to vent and/or express it, get it out of my system. I've tried the following, but not limited to:  


1.) Creative expression (it didn't work because it triggers my c-ptsd coupled with the part that it just reminds me even more of my situation)  
2.) Self-help (it doesn't when you know that no one's there for you anyways)  
3.) Trying to be just a lone wolf (it made me miss having company, and made me miss being part of a circle)  
4.) Socializing with people online through Discord servers and other platforms (problem is square doesn't fit the circle)  
5.) Violent expression (limited, and mostly unsatisfied and more frustrated due to limitations... such as neighbors because of noise complaints)  


I've been at it for months, I have no more friends, family and relatives haven't replied to my messages or picked up my phone calls, I'm all I got, I'm suffering from benzo withdrawal (I refused to take benzos after my previous therapist had me on them for 2 months and when I told her it made me more irritable, she had me taper it off... granted I was on just 1/4th the dosage back then...) and due to withdrawal fever that's lasted for more than a month, I can't go outside without being sent back home (I can't even get in to convenient stores because we get our temperatures checked upon entry, and 37c and up are sent home). Hospitals here are overloaded where there's prioritization now where the likes of me are sent home in favor of more serious matters... I've been living on food delivery services and what not... and it sucks my neighbors aren't the type to even want to socialize."
287,Do sociopaths know they are sociopaths?,"Please allow me to lay some stuff out and communicate this as effectively and honestly as I can to hopefully receive some legit feedback.

The main question I have is this:  Does a sociopath know that he/she is a sociopath? 

Stopping there and offering your opinion or others’ research is fine but I’ll go deeper - maybe mainly as a way to lift some of the weight of carrying that question.

On first impressions, in casual conversations, social situations, those types of environments, I’m consistently described as charming and persuasive.  People form bonds with me while I won’t remember meeting them at all.  They are of no consequence to me.  I don’t mean that to come from a place of arrogance, I am weirdly insecure, just to explain that, for whatever reason, I am unable to connect at any level to a large swath of people that feel connected to me.

And honestly, I don’t care.

When I was a child my mother, then 14, gave me up
for adoption to my grandparents.  I was very lucky to be given that opportunity and I was always aware of the situation.

I say this because of something my biological mother said to me a few weeks ago.  “You’ve always been manipulative, even when you were really young.  You’d know a weak spot and use it.  Put people against one another.”

All of that is true.

Even being successful at my job, the few employees I’ve had have gone on to tell others I’m a narcissist.  As mentioned early, I present well but I do struggle with self worth.   I’m not even sure i’m what context they view me as a narcissist.  

In relationships, my abandonment issues have lingered with me my entire life.  

I am sometimes wreckless.  Unworried of consequences and unafraid of others’ opinions.

Or am i?

The trickiest part is this.  Through all of this, I still look at myself as being a good person.  I don’t wake each day to cause pain.  I will respond to it but rarely instigate it.

I am very direct in both my public and private personas and often people misinterpret that.

So there’s my couch session.  Thanks for reading."
288,My mental health is really suffering because of a mistake I made 13 years ago!,"I desperately need advice about a huge mistake!!

I think I made a dreadful mistake 13 years ago!!

I am absolutely torturing myself here and need a way to have some opinions on this scenario. 

I need to give a background story for this to all make sense. 

I grew up in a large family. My dad was wonderful but was subjected by emotional abuse constantly by my mum. My mum was abusive to all of us, including all of my siblings. 

She would call me names daily. She neglected us and didn’t meet our basic human needs a lot of the time. To the outside world, she was an upstanding member of society. To us, she was such a cruel person and I really don’t say that lightly. She was very aggressive towards us and the depth of disgust when she spoke to us is difficult for me to convey. 

As I grew up, her abuse worsened. I managed to earn enough to leave home when I was 19 and I went completely off the rails. I was drinking very excessively and sleeping with lots of men. Sometimes because I wanted to, other times because I was taken advantage of. I felt like this was the only thing I was good for and was what men wanted. I felt worthless but having sex with people made me feel that I had some shred of value to someone. 

I can reel off story after story of scenarios where I was taken advantage of. I didn’t understand it at the time, but looking back it was so wrong. 

On this particular occasion, I am haunted by the thought that maybe I was the one to do wrong. 

My memory of the night or early morning is very vague because I was very drunk at the time and this is going back 13 years. 

Basically, there was a group of men, we were all drunk from what I can recall. There was on guy there who I touched down below. I remember doing so repeatedly but I can’t remember if it was over his clothes or under. I think it was over but I can’t say for certain. I can remember that he didn’t seem to reciprocate. I continued though. What I can’t remember is if he said anything to indicate he wanted me to stop.

I keep playing this over in my mind. Did he say “don’t” and I’ve said “but you like it don’t you” and carried on? Or something like that? The fact I can’t remember for certain really kills me. I’m also wondering why this specific incident is still in my mind. That alone makes me think that something must have been amiss. Then again, maybe I remember it because it was a rare occasion when he didn’t take things further. 

What I’m saying is, I just really don’t know, but something makes that memory jump out at me and I’m not sure what it is. 

I am really struggling with anxiety and depression and seeing a counsellor regularly for that but I’m sitting up on my own, in the middle of the night, replaying this whole thing in my mind again and again. 

Can anyone offer some words of wisdom. 

I want to be a good person and this makes me fear that I’m not. 

Thanks"
289,I’m Stuck in My Paralyzing Thoughts,"Ive (27F) been with my boyfriend (28M) for over 12 years now. Last January we had a little girl who is now 11 months old. I was in denial for the longest time about my boyfriend being a narcissist, and mentally abusive. It has gotten so much worse after I bought our home and had our daughter. He sleeps on the couch by choice every night, I constantly clean up after him and what really gets me is he has no interest in helping take care of our daughter. I can’t tell you the last time he mowed our lawn, dressed our daughter, changed a diaper, or even put her to bed and he calls me derogatory names on a daily basis. Here’s where I’m going with this: I have a plan to leave him that I formed with my family. He’s toxic to me and our daughter. Even though I know I need to leave him and I know I’ll be happier without the burden of basically taking care of a man child, I’m so scared that I’ll end up alone. That I’ll never experience a love where someone respects me, cares for me, or wants to love me unconditionally. What if I’ll end up doing life alone as a single mom? My anxiety about this is so high, like I work hard and I want to find someone who also works hard and matches my efforts. What if I ask for too much or I’m just unwanted. I guess I really need some support, I’ve never felt this way or experienced this in my life, nor did I ever think I’d have to. My daughter will always be my priority and I just want to do the best I can for her. I’m so worried, and anxious and scared. I don’t want to go through life lonely. This whole situation has been hard on me."
290,I (21F) have inexplicable paranoia about my future.,"I (21F) have an inexplicable anxiety about my future and it's not just about my career. It's almost paranoiac in nature. I keep reading about sexual assault and I can't help but think this is an eventual thing that will happen to me. To cope with it, I try harming myself so that eventually when it does happen, maybe I'll be used to it. I feel like I'm the only one so traumatized by it to an extent of not being able to move and just wasting my days away scrolling through the internet in hopes that that might numb the pain. 

Recently, my uncle was almost murdered by his brother (TW: his brother is mentally ill and chopped my uncles hand six times calling himself the Antichrist), and I can't sleep for days thinking about it and how everyone is going to experience some type of big trauma some day. I wake up everyday thinking maybe today I'll get hurt. And it's exhausting. 

I felt really nauseous and weak when I first heard the news, but my other family members seemed fine. However, this scares me because I'm currently preparing to study in a medical college. I feel like a fraud, I'm not strong enough to be a doctor if I am so scared of traumatic events. And I've lost all confidence and self-esteem in myself."
291,Do you ever listen to sad music to see if it brings up any emotion you were hiding from yourself?,"Sometimes I forget to be in my feelings and allow myself to process what’s going on. So I’ve made it a weekly thing to listen to sad music. If I particularly identify with a song about a certain subject I’ll be like “ok what’s going on with me to make feel some type of way from this?”
It’s helped me process my feelings better I feel. Do you guys do this?"
292,If you’re experiencing a crazy wave of stress/anxiety then learning how to Center is a tremendous tool. Here are 5 Steps I’ve outlined.,"I call it Centering because we take a mental and sensory inventory of our current environment and Centering ourselves within that precise moment.
Step 1 - Safety: Get yourself to a safe place of comfort and security.

Step 2 - Breathwork: Begin focusing on breath, walking yourself through a breathing exercise while counting, (5 seconds inhale, hold 5 seconds, exhale 5, hold 5 - then repeat). Try and breathe with your diaphragm and take an account of the movement of air going in and out of your lungs and watching your belly ebb.

Step 3 - Sensory Inventory: While doing this, try and perceive your immediate surroundings in as much detail as possible. Think of it this way, you will have five/ten minutes to try and remember as much detail as you can of your current place, (car, bedroom, bathroom, office, outside (which is the best))
-Try to visually see everything as much as possible, what are the tones of the colors, the depth of detail in a texture, the shape of everything, the devil in the detail if you will.
-Sense or physically feel everything too, the breath fluting in and out of your nostrils, is it warm or cold, is there a breeze, or some sun warming your shoulders, or an energy in the room?
-Any smells or aromas, the sea, a forest, a lingering candle scent, food, a pet, dirty clothing - it doesn't matter what it is, good or bad, you're merely taking an account of it like doing inventory. You don't care what you're counting, you're just counting.
-Hearing, this is my personal favorite. Find and listen to, attend Everything. Bird song, critters outside, the washer/dryer, people's chatter in the distant or muffled convo beyond a wall, a pet breathing, the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, traffic. Like sonar, take your attention to each sound as it resonates with you.
-Taste won't usually be too helpful here so concentrate on the other senses.

Step 4 - Mantra: Mentally or out loud repeat a mantra or prayer which resonates with you. Repeat this as you continue with the previous steps, replacing the counting with a mantra. I like;
""I am safe, secure, and loved."" or ""My breath is steady, my mind is clear and settled, my body is calm, my heart is pure, I am tranquil, safe, and loved.""

Step 5 - Memory Recall or Visualization: Recall a special memory of yours, one in which you felt safe, loved and had fun or it. Try recalling all the exacting detail as well as you're able; where you were, who if anyone you were with, how you felt (this is vital), the scenery or environment, etc. Some of us cannot do this however because the anxiety is too much, so I lean on a visualization technique instead. I recommend speaking out loud here as it will help your mind step away from the dreadful thoughts as it's tasked with speaking out loud. Paint the most perfect place to be, beachside villa or stroll or a forest sanctuary is great too. Walk yourself through the experience; the palms or pines and how they sway, barefoot walking on warm sand or cool earth, the forest canopy and the sun breaking through it and warming you, or big puffy white clouds sailing over the ocean, the sound of a stream or the ocean tide, the smell of sea water of the fresh air of the forest, etc. Paint out this place but as you do sprinkle statements such as, ""I feel so safe and loved here,"" or ""This place is my sanctuary, I feel free and my mind and body is serene,"" or ""I am loved, and I am love.""

Hope this helps, I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and the most torturous state of grief after the passing of my wife in 2014 but through a choice to live in a different way and do whatever was necessary to end my suffering. I was able to rise above it and now live a life of abundance, peace, manifestation, and love again. I teach this now to others and have dozens of videos explaining all the steps and I have some fun too trying to make people laugh.
I have a couple videos based solely on stress and anxiety which detail out what I've shared above in greater depth with a much better explanation and visuals. 

DM me if you'd like the link or check out my page and go from there.

There is hope for you and your struggle... there is a place, a version of you which is out there waiting for you two to merge. this future version is a person who smiles in public and it's authentic. This person laughs too, and doesn't have angst while going out in public, or speaking to another, or dread anything whatsoever. This person is confident, and secure with themselves, even proud and in love. This person helps others navigate their anxiety too!

Please lmk if you have any questions and my heart goes out to you all.

293,"Of Course I'm ""Weird""","Who wouldn't be with everything that happened in my childhood and adolescence? Poverty, state custody, behavioral rehabilitation, medication, group homes, foster homes, electroencephalogram, juvie, and then back to my mom after 3 years. Then it was emotional abuse, physical abuse, verbal abuse, poverty and homelessness all before I was 18.
My sister gave me a puppy that had parvo and worms and then scolded me for crying when it died. I was made to lie to the police after my stepfather beat me one morning because he didn't like the face I was making after I woke up at 6 in the morning. Of course I'm fucking weird. I'm tired of all these bullshit standards for socialising being applied to my person. I don't throw feces, I don't do weird bullshit, I don't fetishize underage anime characters, and I have decent hygeine. I just socialise a little differently and act a little differently. I say weird shit because it amuses me. I don't always say what I should say because I don't always know what that is. I don't ask many questions because I was taught not to. Of course I'm weird."
294,"My dad doesn’t think this is a real issue but I’m getting concerned, any general advice/opinions/etc. appreciated","Ok to start off I’m 16 and have pretty bad anxiety/panic disorder, along with tics associated with those. I’m on Lexapro for the anxiety, which also has the added benefit of stopping my tics almost entirely.

Me and my boyfriend of always joked about me having a bad memory, but in the past couple months I’m starting to realize it’s getting really bad. It’s gotten to the point where besides the one this year, I can’t remember a single Thanksgiving despite knowing that I’ve been to family Thanksgiving parties almost every year. 

I can list a lot more examples, but I’ll let this recent one be the last. So apparently a couple weeks ago my cat died (we had two), and my dad told me about it. I have no recollection of this, and texted him today asking if he had seen the cat recently. 

Is a shitty memory common in teens? Or should I speak with a professional?"
295,Is this sadism?,"Hello to all who may read. I doubt this is actually sadism, but perhaps extreme schadenfreudism? This does fall under mental health.
I by nature am extremely deceitful, manipulative, and persuasive. I don't do it unless needed, if I do it needlessly it's rude to me. I've been a bully before, I used to go online and bully/troll kids online for the intense satisfaction it gave me. It's almost orgasmic to see my teasing get a rise out of them. Irl I've manipulated friends and spread drama for my own enjoyment. Better if I'm the one behind the scenes. Dramatic situations make me so satisfied. Unless it becomes annoying, like people getting physical. I much prefer mind games. I love to see others in pure mental anguish, oh and it's so much better of I'm the one who caused it. I love the sounds of people screaming in pain, I love reading about human experimentation. Scientists can be so creative I love it.
I do have people in my life who do not deserve this, and I don't do it to them. I feel as punishments should be given to those who I don't know or deserve it. If my friends made me mad in some way, they would be a target. So like I said, if it's not needed it's rude. 
Something important to schadenfreudism and bullies is that they are lacking in something or are insecure. I am not insecure, I am very calm, level headed, and polite. I have an innocent outside that can persuade people with ease. To the point people who haven't known me long would believe I'd do no wrong. I also feel important and can definitely come off as egotistical. 
Lastly, I have a very poor sense of care or urgency. Most things are a burden to me, at the end of the day I can spend less energy on something if it's just gone. I have pets, but if they die, I'll be sad, but it's one less thing to worry about. People waste my time, and I hate to say it, but if I was asked if I cared about my best friend I'd have to lie. At the end of the day. I do not care"
296,Feeling weird.,So growing up I’ve had mental problems I’d say I was a “problem type child who craved too much attention” I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar depression and as of recent my friends all say I act different and I need help and I just feel so helpless and a problem. I’ve never really had suicidal thoughts before but I hate myself so dearly for what I’m becoming and I can’t even explain what it could be. I hurt my friends and I’ll even lay my hands on my boyfriend. I just feel like I’m a ticking time bomb. I get so incredibly angry over such little things and then I’ll forget I was angry about it or why I was angry in the first place. If anyone could give me any advice I’d truly appreciate it !
297,"TW: not suicidal by any means, but sometimes (when I’m under a lot of stress), I get this thought that I wouldn’t be mad if I just passed away (car crash, etc.)",Sorry for grammar... tired
298,"Sometime I felt very detached from reality and feel like I’m just a soul in someone else’s body, is this normal?","I felt that I’m not truly living in this world, that I’m just an observer. I felt detached from everyone, and detached from people. Sometime when I woke up, I just can’t recognize my reflection in the mirror, it doesn’t feel like it‘s truly me. Sometime when I looked back in my date I felt like someone else did all the task. I have trouble forming bonds with others, and usually just stay in my own bubble. Is this normal? To be so detached from the world and reality?"
299,1yr ago I was receiving from the most brutal depressive episode I’ve had,"I cannot explain what those months were like. 

Life is still hard of course, but antidepressants have helped me immensely. Prozac + Wellbutrin for me. It has done wonders. 

Thankful for my mother, my therapist, my psychiatrist, and all the professors who treated me so kindly and helped me get through the semesters. 

I’m dealing with 3 major life challenges right now and I don’t know, and don’t want to know, how I’d be doing without antidepressants right now. 

Saying because I tried everything before getting back on antidepressants, I didn’t want to be “dependent” on meds, but depression is a disease like any other, it cannot go untreated. 

Untreated depression can be fatal. 

Take care of yourself. Imagine that you are your best friend, what would you tell your best friend to do?"
300,Is it bad that seeing these videos of people who recovered from suicide and they're all happy now just makes me want to kill myself more?,"I'm not jealous of them, I'm happy for them. But seeing them say to not kill yourself and not cut yourself just makes me want to do it more. It's my encouragement."
301,Does anyone else miss feeling miserable?,"Please don't hate on me, but can anyone relate to this?

It's weird, but sometimes I miss feeling miserable. I miss drinking and feeling like shit and crying and breaking down. I almost crave this shitty feeling. I know that it's bad, but there's this particularly low point that can only be reached when drunk and miserable and I miss feeling that way, because it's as though you've reached the bottom and you are almost certain that you can't fall any deeper. It hurts, you know. It damm fucking hurts so much, but still, I miss it. Why is that?"
302,"Suicidal thoughts and attempts, please help","I am currently in a relationship. \[5 years\] I admittedly have cheated on him once and kissed another guy when we first started dating and have sent nudes before. I have NEVER done anything to be put through what I'm going through. My boyfriend works a4 hours shidfts every other day and weekends. I sit alone at home with my cat and dog all day. I have no friends or anything because he just doesn't trust me leaving the house without him. Let me explain a little more. I am disabled from my brain cancer and treatments, and only get $600 a month from disability. We just bought a house together last year and alll he does is work his ass off just to keep us alive. I've been streaming \[nothing nsfw\] to get a few bucks on the side to help. I've also been selling nudes $5-$10 per pic. He just found the nudes on my phone he flipped, even when I explained why I was doing it. So I literally just took a bath and 1tried to drown myself and 2tried to slit my wrists up but it was too dull to do anything. I am still trying to think of various ways I can just end it all."
303,Feeling Apathetic and scared i hurt others due to it,"So every now and again i could feel myself stop caring for people, especially friends.

As it is right now 2 out of the 3 People i talk with most are depressed and/or suicidal.  
My (selfdiagnosed) depression and anxiety are getting worse again because im beeing a therapist/emotional support for one of them. His parents dont help and he isnt convinced of the idea of therapy because it failed him once in the past.   
At this point i cant just stop talking to him because im afraid of what he would do to himself. Sometimes i think about it, my life would be so much easier and i would be way less stressed but moraly its wrong.

Half the time i also think im just helping to feel better about my pointless life and be ""a good person"" in some way.    
Im telling him im there for him but at times when im tired i would just prefer to sleep rather than having to try to talk him out of hurting himself and i feel like half the things i say are empty. I wish he would get better but there is only so much i can do. Sometimes im sick of even trying because i know it triggers me and stresses me out and i just dont got the energy for it.   
The thing i noticed especially right now again is that sometimes i feel like i couldnt care less, both of my depressed friends are thousends of miles away and technically its not my problem what they do or dont and im feeling horrible for thinking that way but i cant feel empathy at the same time, its like someone turned it off in my brain.

I had it happen before in relationships where at the end i didnt feel sad or happy anymore i just didnt feel anything for the other person anymore.   
Now i wonder what exactly is wrong with me most of the times when im with my friends im joking around and have a good time but at the same time im a emotionless b\*stard and ignore people because i dont want to deal with even more depressed stuff all the damn time.   
It could have something to do with my coping methode of trying not to think about things for to long and trying to distract myself as much as possible and not actually talk about it.

In the end this has gotten into quiet some rambling and i dont know if im really as heartless as i think or not. Sorry if some sentence strucktures dont make sense my head is all over the place."
304,The judgments we receive from the society is not a true reflection of who we are.,"For me, internalizing other people's judgments' myself has been something I have been struggling with. I thought to make a short video about it and share it as a way of taking if of my mind, and also hoping it speaks to others as well. 

Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXqH-dXDCc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXqH-dXDCc)

The judgments one receives from the society is not a true reflection of who they are. It creates a reflection of us like that of a broken mirror. If you use this broken mirror to shape yourself, then the only one ending up broken will be you. Mirror Mirror is a short film about vanity, and the destructive cycle of internalizing people's judgments' of ones self."
305,Everything really sucks and I just want everything to be over,"Hello r/mentalhealth, these probably won’t be my final words but I want to at least get this off my chest because I have been carrying it around for years without telling anyone (well, rather having a LACK of anyone to tell it to) and I am hoping at least one person will read this so it’s at least out there.

I’m almost 21 years old and I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression since I was 16, but I was depressed long before that. Everything I’ve tried has never worked for me, I’ve been on several different types of medication and therapy only works for a day then I regress to where I was in the first place (I have since stopped going because I was just wasting money at that point). What makes matter worse is that I have no support system in my life, my family either don't understand or they always avoid the subject when I bring it up with them, I do not have any friends (not even anyone I could go have a beer with or just talk to), and I do not have a partner (which I will touch on more later). So in other words, I’m completely and utterly alone and it scares me a lot when I think about it too much.
My life is pretty mechanical, I wake up at 3am, go to work, work, go home, attempt to keep up with hygiene,  watch netflix, go to bed, and repeat. I rarely leave my house other than to go to work and go grocery shopping, occasionally I’ll leave and go for a really long drive, but besides that my house is where I spend almost all of my time when I’m not working. Because I'm only an apprentice I make jack shit money and it brings so much stress into my life. I brought a car a year ago and have spent more then double what I've paid for it just fixing it. 
My love life is absolutely pathetic. Couple years ago i was with a manipulative chick that controlled me and played with my emotions, I left her once i woke up to what was happening. For the past year I've been very deeply in love with a girl and we have talked everyday of this past year. About 6 months ago I told her how I felt and that she ment the world to me for her to tell me she didn't feel the same, the following week was pretty tough but after that we were back to our normal selves. but about a month ago we had a very special moment were we slept together and slowly we stopped talking so much after that and there's been this slight distance between us, when I'm with her its the greatest feeling ever and I'm so happy, but when we leave I go back to feeling really distant. I tell her that I miss her and she replys with I miss hanging out with you. This makes me the most depressed and I’m just so lonely and pathetic it’s disgusting. I wouldn’t say I’m bad looking either, I’m not too overweight, I keep up with my hygiene / grooming, I dress nicely, and I try to keep some confidence. I’m also getting to an age where it’s even HARDER to find someone to date that doesn’t want to just hook up. I just want to hold hands and hug and just have someone care about me before I’m gone, but I honestly doubt that’s going to happen.
I've stopped caring about things that I used to love doing and for the past few weeks I've been really struggling as its getting worse. It started when my beloved car starting shitting itself again but really bad this time, so I thought it was about time I just got rid of it and upgraded but I'm having so much trouble trying to get a loan to get a new car and its making me so depressed.
Everything I used to love doing to take some of the edge off is taking long pointless drives and I can't do that anymore because my cars a pile of shit. I can't play games because for some reason I don't enjoy them anymore and it's keeps getting worse and worse.
I don’t see suicide as an optional thing, I’ve always seen it as an inevitability at some point, I really don’t see an alternative. Every time i get stuck in my head its always the one thing on my mind but i guess I'm just too afraid to kill myself because I'm afraid it's going to hurt and I don't have access to anything that would make it less painful.
I hope at least one person reads this so I don’t feel so alone and maybe my story can be a cautionary tale, thank you for reading and putting up with me if you made it this far. Sorry for any spelling mistakes, I just needed to get this out there"

308,Why would someone say that they are proud porn addict?,"I've seen people mentioning ""proud porn addict"" in their bio on Twitter, and not just Twitter I've seen some post here on reddit about the same. Why would someone be proud of their porn addict? What does it say about their state of mind?

PS. I can assure you that they are not being sarcastic."
309,Why am I angry for no reason?,"I [17M] have just been feeling really frustrated/angry today for seemingly no reason. 

I won’t go into it here, but I’ve been through a lot of crap in my life and didn’t get much of a childhood, and this last year has been particularly traumatic for me, and I have a history with depression and anxiety.

I’m normally really good at dealing with anger, I can forgive people and let go of my anger really easily. But today, none of my usual strategies have worked since I don’t even know why I’m angry. 

While this last year has been hell for me, I’ve had some really amazing friends to help me get through it, and these last few weeks I’ve actually been feeling at least close to ok. And I had a really amazing day yesterday, I met up with a few friends at one of their houses for an early Christmas party. I have literally no reason to feel angry, I should be feeling happy. 

I really hate feeling like this. I’m so scared that I might accidentally lash at out at a friend and say something mean.  

The only thing that I like about myself is my empathy and compassion, and this random feeling of anger feels like it’s chipping away at my one redeeming quality.

Any advice or insight would be amazing, please I really need something, I am really freaking out right now.

310,"Trauma, cPTSD, anxiety, depression...ruined potential and the resentment+bitterness I have towards life; cognitive decline, daily suffering, etc. (27male)","I'm not sure how long this post is going to be, but I would really appreciate it if you would read it and just give me your thoughts, if you can relate, or just acknowledge that you know or have experienced/are experiencing what I am talking about.

So without all the details, I grew up in a very unstable and very toxic home. It was nothing out of the ordinary for me to be forced to pack all my bags when I was in first grade, or to for my mother to tell me she hates me, or to have alcoholism and all that comes with that in my household.

Bottom line, I had a lot of trauma in my life, walking on egg shells, living in fear, always worrying about the next crisis or fire I was going to have to put out.

I was the baby of the family. I had an older sister, she had boyfriends who got her pregnant move in and out of my house, there was just always constant drama and turmoil.

Now, at 27 years old, I look at where I am in my life, I look at other people I meet and see how far they are in their lives, and how they never had to even live remotely close to the daily struggles that I have.

While their parents were sitting down with them as a freshman in high school planning their interests and college paths and nurturing them and preparing them for adulthood, I was trying to calm an alcoholic mother down, or punching holes in the wall, or screaming and crying.

I look at myself as someone who is endlessly fascinated by life. I love to learn. I love to engage.

One way I coped with my stress and broken home lifestyle was when I was 18 I quit smoking cigarettes (funny thing to do when your 18 huh, goes to show how much adulting was going on in my world), either way, I had to save myself, and I did, I quit all cigarettes, quit all weed, quit all drinking and partying and became obsessed with self improvement, mainly in the gym. I still keep up with those habits to this day and thank god because it is such an outlet for me to manage my symptoms.

None the less, I still struggle with cptsd symptoms, still struggle with social anxiety, still struggle with dissociation and dp/dr disorders and of course with all this I struggled with feelings of deep numbing and ""what's the fucking point of anything"" depression like thinking and feeling.

I can't help but to feel...sad? regretful? angry? scared?...all of these emotions really.

Because now, I find myself VERY limited, VERY impaired.

Once a kid with ambition, work ethic, confidence, yano? A real force at some point in my life. I feel all the years upon years upon years of trauma has left me fragmented and broken, isolated and outcasted in society.

I'm 27 and I struggle with all these mental health issues daily, and I just can't help to wish and hope that I had a different upbringing and maybe this life could of been something really nice, really beautiful.

It is so hard to admit, but there is no way I am going to be able to do much of anything great, even by my own standards, when each day you wake up, you just do not know where you are going to be mentally, I could stare at a page in a book some days and spend 15 minutes trying to comprehend what the hell it is I am even reading? This is usually when I'm over stimulated which isn't hard to get me there now, and extremely dissociated, like a took an edible brownie.

I hardly graduated high school, and the last 5 years I've been stuck in a dead end job working overnights as a security guard, no health insurance, just enough money to pay my bills, and I can't seem to find a way out. I'm not entirely sure life is worth living at this point...

I look back at my younger years and want to break down and cry.

How did I get here?

I thought, yano, let me maybe try to learn to code, I hear software engineering can be really lucrative and I've taught myself how to draw at a very high academical level, maybe with some effort I can be a good software engineer or programmer, but what I'm realizing, is I come at a SEVERE disadvantage and the way my brain is operating currently, I'll be lucky to be able to just deliver pizzas.

Again, if you looked at me, you'd never know. I'm just under 6ft, most women find me very attractive, I workout almost daily, I stay on top of my nutrition, I take care of myself, ya know?

Yet my wiring, my software, which was programmed by abuse and trauma, is keeping this computer from hardly being able to function.

And that my friends, is my biggest pain, wanting to move on, but not being able to. Wanting to make a life for yourself, like we all should have the opportunity to do so, and I feel like I never got to jump, I feel like a bird in the next that never tried to fly and my wings are broken to shit.

I wonder if any of you have similar experiences?

Full of potential, full of curiosity, then...life takes the biggest left turn and you end up mentally ill, and your whole life, your whole future feels, hopeless and empty..just waiting to die it feels."
311,Is it normal to be seeing things in my periphery that aren't there?,"I keep seeing movement in my periphery of late. I'd guess that this is fine every once in a while, but I think I'm going above my usual baseline so I'm a little worried. It happens a couple of times in a week.

Usually what I see is kinda vague. My brain tends to jump to the assumption that it's insects or maybe my dad sneaking up on me to startle me. I generally just startle or go on-watch for a minute/check around to see if it really was something, then go back to my business.

Just earlier I was playing minesweeper on my phone and saw what I thought was a mouse. But we don't get mice here and it was gone when I looked at it directly.

So, should  be worried or is this just normal stuff?"

I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to keep feeling mentally tip top over the next two weeks - my symptoms are pretty light at the moment (just a cough and sore chest) and I want to make sure I’m coping!

Numerous individuals likewise smoke or use drugs or different substances to change how they feel. In any case, once more, the impacts are brief. Much the same as liquor, the more you use, the more you long for. Nicotine and medications don't manage the reasons for troublesome sentiments. They don't take care of issues, they make them. 

5. Stay in contact :

Solid family ties and steady companions can help you manage the burdens of life. Loved ones can cause you to feel included and thought about. They can offer various perspectives from anything that's going on inside your own head. They can help keep you dynamic, keep you grounded and assist you with tackling functional issues. 

There's nothing better than finding somebody up close and personal. Yet, that is not generally conceivable. Call them, drop them a note or talk to them online all things considered. Keep the lines of correspondence open. It's beneficial for you! 

In case you're feeling distant from certain individuals, glance back at our part on discussing your sentiments and begin! 

""Simply relaxing with companions loosens up me. We enjoy a chuckle and I feel better.""

None of us are superhuman. We as a whole here and there get worn out or overpowered by how we feel or when things turn out badly. In the event that things are becoming a lot for you and you believe you can't adapt, request help. 

Your family or companions might have the option to offer reasonable assistance or a listening ear. Neighborhood administrations are there to help you.

A couple of moments can sufficiently be to de-stress you. Give yourself a bit of 'personal time'. 

""Once in a while when I'm perched on the transport, I let my considerations stream and it truly causes me.""

It very well may be a great idea to have an interest where you're not seen as somebody's mum or father, accomplice or worker. You're simply you.

A few of us make individuals snicker, some are acceptable at maths, others cook fabulous dinners. A few of us share our way of life with the individuals who live near us, others live in an unexpected way.

316,Waking up anxious the last 2 weeks,"Hi everyone, 

So every morning I’m waking up with anxiety and thoughts going through my mind. At night I feel anxious about going to sleep incase the thoughts wake me up or I just wake up anxious and dread facing the feelings that anxiety brings 🙄

Also, my what if thoughts cause me major anxiety especially with the thoughts that I have already had and I feel anxious about getting those thoughts again. Anyone else get these experiences when you start thinking of past scary thoughts you’ve had?

317,Cannot look my siblings into the eyes because I am such a weirdo,"I am 22 years old and male. I don't know what I can do to let go off this feeling off shame. I feel inferior to my siblings because I am ashamed for everything I do. If I see my sister or my brother I think that they believe I am such a loser. It became my identity to be a weirdo around them, I always feel the need to say something embarassing whenever they are near me. I can talk to my parents normaly but not to my sibligs. I feel like they judge me for my sexual inexperience. No matter what I do near them I feel like it doesn't matter what I do - I don t have any dignity. I want to ignore them and show them that I dont need them, I feel angry and embaressed around them. But on the other hand they seem to be a realitycheck and a reminder that I have to change my ways and make more effort in finally getting sex for validation as there seems to be no other way in order to maintain at least a neutral relationship with them. I feel like in order to get dignity I have to become a slave for my parents so I can get more respect from them and find some self worth inside of me. But is becoming a slave really the solution to make those encounters with my siblings more pleasant? I always freeze when I see them, and I look to the ground and I want to cry. My plan is to have something I can feel superior to them, thats what would give me some confidence. Will this help me with the relationship to my siblings ?  Just answer me one question can you gurantee me that my confidence will rise in the long term if I achieve a skill and will this translate in improvement of social situations like here?

318,"Self Worth, Zero","Life has been always so hard on me, I’m 18, and I grew up always as the non important person, even to my family, my friends, my past significant others i’ve always been non special, i was always left in the dust and no one ever said anything good to me like ‘i’m glad you’re in my life’ or ‘you saved me’ or ‘you’ve been through it all with me!’ and.. you get the idea. i have always done everything i could to help people, i was and am selfless to the point i’d die for even a stranger, yet to nobody was i ever special, i was no one’s important person.. and it hurts my heart. if i failed at being important that i wasn’t special even to one person all my life i must have something severely wrong with me. i really don’t want to live like this.. though i’ll probably never do it because i’m too much of a pussy to, i wish i had the guts to just.. kill myself because this isn’t worth it. if i was gone nobody would notice, nobody would give a shit, i wouldn’t make and i don’t make any difference, i dont do shit and.. i want this misery to end."
319,Suicidal Thoughts,"I’m having a lot of trouble finding reason to live. I’ve got a lot of negative and intrusive thoughts and I’ve been through a lot of hardships in the past. The only reason I’m hesitant to end it is because I’m scared what my friends would think, and part of me still got hopes for an enjoyable future. I feel like I’m stuck in the same place, and I have a lot of trouble coming up with a solution. I hate my job, I’m working with my dad and he’s quite hard to communicate without me. I hate myself because I feel like I’m embarrassing most of the time and I have a hard time believing that the people around me actually cares about me. I’m struggling a lot with my own brain and addiction.
And I can’t go to a therapist because of my drugs use. I can’t quit my job cuz I’m scared of conflict with my dad and I dropped out of school so I’m not really educated enough to land a good job. I don’t know what my next step should be. I would like someone to talk with"
320,How do I phase out a toxic/lazy coworker?,"It's a recent thing that I have a coworker on my shift. On nights, before, we had one person working and that was it. 

Now, with recent changes, my ""mirror"" shares shifts with me. Not all of them, but a part of them and it drains me more than a loner shift.

He's always late, he's lazy, he sleeps through the shift, he's reckless (we work with patients and he's not always legit with them) and it's a wonder that he hasn't been fired yet. He argues about stupid things and is hated by everyone on the team.

I am frustrated with my bosses for not having taken action against him, because he truly is an anti-asset.

He's becoming the bane of my work life. Hopefully I'll change jobs soon, because I won't hold for long with him in my path.

However, I still wonder how I can phase him out of my mind. Just hearing him snore (while I do our job) makes me boil inside.

If you have ideas, please write them. :)

Thanks."

323,Need Some Help Regarding Making My Miserable Life A Bit Healthier.,"I'm really bad at describing my feelings, but I'll try my best. I'm a 16 year old male living in a India. Also, I'm not a native English speaker, so please excuse me if my grammar is incorrect.

Since I'm an Introvert, an INFJ-T to be specific, there's a lot of things I go through in my life at a daily basis. First of all, I wanna talk about my anxiety. My anxiety really sucks due to my turbulent nature. I'm really shy and neurotic and hate myself being the centre of attention in any place. I'm a socially awkward person and I get panic attacks while talking to strangers. I mostly like to stay alone in my thoughts or just with a small circle of friends/family members I'm really comfortable with. I'm a really intuitive and imaginative person and most of my times, I daydream about the future or just think about random stuffs just by myself. I also suffer from existential crisis frequently. I don't have many friends, just a few close friends as I prefer quality over quantity. My life is miserable and I often hate myself and my life. I've been the victim of emotional abuse and since I cannot just say ""no"" to people, I've been taken advantage of, a lot of times. I'm depressed, addicted to frequent masturbation, and also suffer from sleeping problems often. I mostly remain within the walls of my house spending hours watching YouTube and don't go outside unless it's really necessary. Since I possess a very rare personality which not many people in the world have, I have a hard time connecting with people. I really crave for a genuine connection in my life, a person who can understand me and listen to my problems and just accept me for what I am. I can understand and read people's minds easily but no one seems to understand me and think alike, like me. I hate small talk and try to avoid them as much as I can. I'm very perfectionistic and often dream of having an ideal life in future, although I know that it isn't possible. I'm never bored when I'm alone as I talk to myself a lot and poesss a vivid imagination which doesn't let me get bored. Sometimes, I feel so distressed that I feel like leaving everything behind and just run away from the place where I live and lead a peaceful life high up in the mountains. I've had suicidal thoughts before but I couldn't make an attempt because I have a fear of pain. My biggest fear is the fear of embarrassment in front of strangers and even the thought of this gives me panic attacks. I consider myself as an empathetic person and my heart goes away for the impoverished children and the helpless animals living on the streets. I often want to help them but my social anxiety prevents me from doing so. I'm a logical and practical person and I plan out and prepare for every task which I'll have to do later. I'm not at all spontaneous. I often make my decisions taking a lot of time analysing everything but often end up making my decisions based on what people around me feel. And also, I belong to the LGBTQ community, so it's hard for me to come out due to my nature and this is making me even more depressed. Further, I live in a country where discriminations against gay people still exist and happens frequently, which makes it even more difficult for me to come out. I know that I cannot remain closeted my entire life and often have panic attacks on imagining what I might have to face if my family gets to know about my orientation. Overall, I just have a very hard life and my mental health is just so bad and, it has actually worsen during this quarantine. I have so many thoughts racing in my mind simultaneously and it's just making me so miserable and dejected that I can't handle it anymore. I just need some psychological help but can't open up to my family because they consider this to be insignificant. They'll just brush it off to be something trifle and that, I'm being dramatic. If anyone is reading this, please help! I just need some advice from you on how to make my life healthier, and how can I stop worrying so much. I'm really stressed out and desperately need some break and relaxation in my life."
324,A never ending battle in my head,"Had my therapy session today and the things we talked about today JUST hit me. For the last few weeks I haven't been feeling myself. Like at all. I had an intense 6 week long anxiety episode. I'm still anxious now, but not as intense as during those 6 weeks. I told my t that I have been feeling really off, like my brain just shut down, when I need to do anything productive. Then my t said the thing I wasn't expecting: I was going down a depressive episode. I've been going for therapy mainly due to my anxiety, but being told that shocked me a little. 

My t said that anxiety and depression goes hand in hand in many cases, and that i can try to consider taking meds if things get worse. 

I can't wrap my head over that. I've always known about my somewhat terrible anxiety. But i've never once thought about depression. I'm now in this constant debate in my head over it. *Maybe you're physically ill? Maybe it's just a terrible burnout period. It's just a phase it'll pass.* 

Before this year, I've never had any depressive episodes. I've had many anxious ones but never depressive. Except for this year. When I try to rationalise in my head, my anxious thoughts kicks in immediately. There's no in between.

I'm really scared. My teachers and peers have so many expectations for me. My GPA is going to get ruined if I can't manage this. I'm getting closer to my internship too. Why can't my brain just let me be? I'm like trying to ""prove"" to myself that I'm fine by forcing myself to be ""normal"" and making jokes. But that spurt of energy wouldn't last long.

What can I do? I'm scared and tired at the same time. Maybe if I watch enough motivational videos online I'll be motivated again. Maybe if I push myself more, I can do things. Maybe if I manage my time well, I can do more things. Maybe I can complete more school work and study if I push myself more and try using the pomodoro method. But I just need the energy and the mellow feeling to go away. I hate having this brain fog feeling. What can I do to make it stop?"
325,Weird anxiety reaction to certain sounds. Not sure what causes it.,"For some reason, whenever I hear the sound of metal forks scraping on plates, it triggers something in me. My heart starts beating really fast and I feel really uncomfortable, almost like I want to get up and run out of the room. I haven't used metal forks in years since feeling them touch my teeth makes me want to throw up, but my reaction to the sound of them scraping on plates has never made me react like this before.

Is this some kind of disorder? Does anyone know what could be causing this?

Thanks for taking the time to read."
326,I nearly hurt someone when I was going through a very bad mental state and now I can't stop feeling bad about it,"During lockdown, my mental health became worse and worse and I started getting frustrated and angry and loads of things that wouldn't normally make me like that. It got worse just before I was about to university because I was so worried. One day, I was with someone and they did something that seriously triggered me. The action itself wasn't bad but for some reason I just lost it. I went to push my leg into them to hurt them but my luckily body didn't 'let' me push forward and even though I was trying, my leg wasn't moving and nothing happened. I instantly started crying afterwards and had a breakdown. I got on the phone to a doctor and I got diagnosed with depression and got prescribed medication. I am doing a lot better now and I feel a lot happier but I can't stop thinking about how if I'd gone through with what I wanted to do in the moment and hurt the person then I wouldn't have been able to recover"

To cut a long story short, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and severe generalised anxiety about 6 years ago due to a number of childhood issues and triggering things happening in my life at the time.

I worked through it at the time and got myself in a really good place. But the last 2 years I’ve sunken back into it. It started with an unusual highly stressful job but even after leaving that job and going to another slightly less stressful if still a highly stressful job. 

I’ve been in therapy for the last 6 months and I’m told that it’s the circumstance and that once they change that I’ll be able to normalise again. 

So I’ve started looking at changing careers completely to an industry and role that should pay better and allow for better flexibility without the same pressures. Basic entry pay is higher then my salary after 3 years and 3 moves up the ladder in my current industry. I’ve started an online diploma and have a second one lined up with training to finish fully this time next year. 

The possibility of an out has given me some energy that I haven’t had the last 2 years. 
I’m just really scared that it’s not the job and that I’ll be as unhappy anywhere else but further back down the career ladder and maybe dislike the industry completely after getting employed in it.

How might I know if it’s just me?"
329,(20 MtF) Sexual anxieties + Hypersexuality. Could it be a sign of ADD?,"Hey guys.

Made a post on here about 6 days ago about how I was confused about what to ask my GP to be tested for.

I spoke to them yesterday. I mentioned that I have an abysmal attention span, bad anxiety and catastrophic thinking, and potentially hypersexual.

I think I most likely have ADD. I was reading into the symptoms and I just relate to every single one. I constantly drift away when talking to people or performing any kind of important task. Can't finish one task before moving onto another. Get preoccupied with trivial things. Obsessive.

It's also an obsession with thoughts about sexual fantasies, and a lot of anxieties that surround them. I find myself impulsively wanting to talk about them with people. As of late just been seriously desperate for a boyfriend. I need someone to share these things with to cope with them

Is there much of a link between hypersexuality and ADD? I just want to get some opinions before I talk to another doctor about this."
330,What falls into a mental state opposing autism in this sense?,"For a good long while falling into the stigma and doing tons of research for potential mental health disorders others including myself may be experiencing, I was pondering a 'high functioning autism' possibility and after what I could ultimately gather from it, it is similar to ADHD but different in some big ways. ADHD is more being able to understand but being unable to focus, and autism is being unable to understand but being able to focus with the correct links.

It greatly hit me that this feeling of not understanding isn't what describes this core issue I feel, but it's having an intense feeling of understanding too much about everything, a perception, kind of like being able to flip switches on command to fit into specific social environments, while typically choosing not to because who cares unless it's truly important?

Everything seems to be linked to a big unexplainable spectrum of compartments that has too many variables for anyone to ever understand of the human perception, yet this understanding that I have is so overwhelming that there's almost a feeling of bleh toward most things but a couple and it's almost borderline nihilistic. I'm not looking to get diagnosed by anyone here, but what is this? 

It's almost like the opposite of autism if I had to explain, I'm trying to hear if anyone else is similar and what they've learned. I hope this makes sense."
331,Needing someone to talk to,"My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me a couple days ago. Said she didn’t feel the same about me as i did about her anymore, and wanted some time alone to try and improve her own life. She wants to focus on school and getting a career, which is good and I’m happy for her. She also wants me to focus on myself a little bit, and wants me to try and get a better job and to go back to school (I dropped out of college in March).

I have no idea what I want to do. For the last 3 years she’s been the direction in my life. Everything I’ve done has been for her, so she can be happy, because thats what makes me happy. I want to do whats best for both of us. I want to get a degree in something and get a better job because I feel like there’s a chance of us getting back together after a couple years. 

The worst part of this is that, ever since I was a kid my home life hasn’t been the best. So I’ve been living with her and her family for the last year (at least). I don’t have anywhere to go now that we’ve broken up. I can’t afford an apartment and I don’t think i could handle the stress of going home. So I’m still staying at her house. I know it’s probably not good for either of us but I don’t know what else to do. 

I just need someone to talk to about it. I don’t know if I need advice or to just express how I’m feeling to someone. I feel like all the purpose in my life disappeared overnight and I hate feeling so useless. If you’ve read to this point I appreciate your time and i would love your support :’)"
332,People finding you,"Sorry if this post has shown up here before. 
But my main fear of suicide is people finding my body after what's done is done. 
Has anyone here thought that and do they have something to say?"
333,Why do I hate acknowledgement of any kind from family?,"This is something I've noticed getting worse and worse throughout my life. I absolutely hate when family members acknowledge me for things/notice things about me in general. For example, if I walk the dog and someone even just brings up the fact that I went for a walk, I won't want to do it again. Or if I do the dishes and someone says thanks, it makes me extremely uncomfortable and I'll feel like never doing the dishes again. I've even become especially stoic, because if someone notices me smiling/frowning/laughing at anything and brings it up my brain gets upset. If I'm browsing a funny app I end up locking myself away in my room because I don't want anyone to notice the expressions I'm making, even if no one is around/paying attention to me. I've always had issues accepting praise since I was a little kid, but now and days I have trouble accepting anything at all, but only from family. Friends, coworkers, strangers, etc etc don't bother me at all. I don't have a bad relationship with my family, I'd say we're all pretty close knit. I just have no idea what this means, or why I'm getting more and more like this. Is this some sort of off shoot of my anxiety? I have it pretty bad, but I feel like if that was so then the same thing would apply to others as well."
334,Quarantine worsening mental health advice,I have been diagnosed as bipolar with extreme anxiety... I moved to my dream city (Austin) but ofc there aren’t many social activities open. How can I prevent my mental illness symptoms from worsening from the isolation?
335,Worried about girlfriend,"My girlfriend seems to be losing interest in everything and lacking motivation more recently. For context: she’s currently at uni having to attend via zoom/ teams calls. She also was recently diagnosed with a mild form of bipolar disorder, which has been a long term thing she’s been on several different antidepressants for a few years and has tried several therapies (all that did not work). So back to the current situation: she is very drowsy and sleepy due to the medication she’s on (currently working on this with her psychiatrist, trying dif medications etc) she wants to drop out of uni (for which she has a scholarship) she just doesn’t seem like herself anymore. Very quiet and sleepy and has no interest in her usual hobbies or activities. I don’t know what to do to help her"
336,I'm failing my finals,I started the semester doing great but as it ends as always everything becomes bad. Why is that? like I seem to be much worse than when I started does that have to do w/my mental health? I'm tired of trying to fix it it never works always the same.
337,Breakdown caused by a weird conversation from many years ago,"Hi, just wanna say that despite the setup of this story, it does not go into some really dark direction but a really uneasy one. So, just straight up, I have BPD and in the past that I will be mentioning I probably had both anxiety and depression, I think that there was BPD as well but the diagnosis is recent. So I was going through some old messeges on FB when I stumbled upon one conversation from the time when I was around 14 years old, with an adult guy. During this time I was fascinated by magic and kinda found it as a fantasy way of escaping my real issues and mental health problems that were not treated whatsoever, because my parents didn't believe in the existence of mental heath at all and severe depressive episodes, extreme isolation and advanced stages of agorophobia caused by anxiety were just *acting out*. That's why I think I had those disorders back then and am not completely certain - much needed mental support was refused to me, but I met all the criteria for the previously mentioned disorders. Okay, all of this was needed to explain why I acted so goddamn stupid. So, I was into magical nonsense and my internet penpal was also. We texted about it and he mentioned that he recently started texting about this shit with a guy who was a painter and REALLY into some New Age stuff and was supposed to be some actual  *magican*. Obviously, a depressed, lonely me at 14 added this dude on facebook and started texting about New Age magic. The dude was saying bullshit about spirit leaving the body, healing with mind etc. The manner he spoke to me with was really off and awkward. Despite that I was really curious so I kept texting him, also about my mental health to which he gave some ridiculous magical advice. I didn't really tried any of it since eating the sunlight sounded funny to me even then. I asked him about new-age magical meditation and tried that but gave up eventually. But there was a time when I hit really depressed bottom when two of my only friends(well, people who at least tolerated me) stopped talking to me, one of them had a mental breakdown and I really wanted to understand them, since I was clueless about any mental health related info and were really awkward. I vented it to this magican clown and he said he could read their aura from their pictures. Guy around 40 y/o asking for pictures of my friends. I was really unable to refuse anything to anyone back then since I thought it would make people hate me, so I said I'll do it later but I never did. But when I was feeling down again he suggested he could read *my aura*. Well, seen nothing wrong with that so I sent him a picture of my iris to get my aura reading and I got it, it was some bullshitty stuff about heaven energy etc, but yeah, I send a weirdo a picture of my eye. I also talked with him about my crush, and he was way too eager to question me about(love was supposed to be giving some powerful energy, yeah). Just to be clear, I do honestly think that the guy was and probably is simply batshit insane, since he also said nonsense about how he can destroy anyone with his mind powers and met God personally a couple of times. That's why I stopped texting him, it was just too ridiculous. Anyway, I found my conversation with this dude today and I was utterly terrfied reading it as an adult that he talked in lenght to a kid, asked for pictures(all be it in insane manner and probably without ulterior motive) and asked a unknown kid many questions about his crush and romantic stuff, it was highly creepy and disturbing, it kinda sent me spiriling today and made me feel terrible about myself. I wonder if I should report this conversation but am kinda afraid to do so, since I'm not sure how Facebook reacts to reports. I feel terrible now remembering it all and I don't really know what to do about it. I spent half a day deleting my messeges in that chat. Any word of support would be much appreciated."
338,An overwhelming perception of understanding things so much that things lose value and excitement leading to borderline nihilism. Can anyone relate?,"What does this sound like? I read up on autism a ton recently based on suspicions and from what was gathered it came to my attention that I have something opposite going on from the idea that autism is a simplified ball of misunderstanding. I feel to generally be a shut down robot who doesn't care what strangers think of me just going through the motions. I do have a couple interests in hobbies, I have a couple close friends, I alienate family vocally but am there when they need me. 

I feel like things are too complex to where we possibly couldn't have a perfect anything, people, things, tasks, it's all beyond our understanding, people are quick to label and judge, and are too easily auto-piloted into a mindset of small talk and doing everything possible to stay within the books of social tradition and acceptance. Not me. I mean, I could, I can flip a switch on command and fit in anywhere with brief observation, but it's all just, empty. 

I don't feel bad, in fact I mostly feel happy but I don't show it besides laughing a lot naturally. Everything makes too much sense, I can see through people's actions and words and link it to a direct reasoning. I want to keep this short, what is this?"
339,I think I have misophonia,"I hate hearing people eating and any sound made from their mouths (except talking, laughing and other communicative things), I can’t ignore it no matter how hard I try, it drives me insane to the point that I can feel the anger boiling and ready to explode. I often have to excuse myself from the table to blow some steam. Even when esting alone, if I accidentaly chew loud enough for me to hear I have to stop and let the anger fade. Sometimes it’s so unbearable that I have to eat with headphones on.

I’ve heard this is because some people can’t block out background noise, wich would explain my next complaint:

If it isn’t completely quiet when I sleep, I can’t do it. As soon as ANY sound is heard, all my progress towards sleep vanishes and I have to restart. I have a clock in my room that ticks, but I often block it by thinking in my head very loudly, to the point that I can’t hear anything at all. It usually takes me ~20-30 minutes to fall asleep, 15 if I’m lucky and no sounds are made.

This is all very annoying and I’m wondering what I can do about it. Maybe this wasn’t the right subreddit, but in that case, please direct me to the right one."
340,"Hi, I'm a healthcare worker and I need to find myself some help.","Work has been hard, I am in a new apartment and financially things are difficult. I need someone to talk to, someone who can help me with all of the issues I'm dealing with. I live in Canada (Montréal). Thank you for all your help."
341,i don’t know what’s up with me,"i’m going to try focus on one issue at the moment, as thats what i’m currently struggling with 

this.. probably won’t be too coherent so i apologise in advance 

i’ve always constantly changed my tastes and opinions and what i like/dislike. maybe that’s normal, but i will have a strong opinion about something and then a few hours later i’m completely changed, then i go back on it the next day. but, in the extreme sense, not just about my favourite colour.

hobbies i like to do change on the daily too, i wanted to get into gardening for a week but now i don’t even understand why, i think it’s boring and i want to throw all the plants i have away because i’m uncomfortable that i felt like that in the first place (i got a ton in the week i was interested in it). but  i won’t because i’ll probably change my mind again and regret it. 

i think my emotions play a big role in it, when i get angry i get way too angry and i always feel guilty about the things i think and want to do when i’m angry. then when i’m the opposite it’s like i am the happiest person alive and i feel completely different, like a different person. then in amongst that i just feel, nothing, and it’s boring, like i’m not even there. i (tw self harm) used to hurt myself, burn myself and inflict pain just to make sure i was here, to see if things were real. 

like right now, i just changed my room around the other day and now i hate it, i don’t know why but it’s like, not my room, i feel so uncomfortable in it. it feels as if someone else designed it. i move and change my space every week because of this. i hate the posters that are up right now i’m not interested in them at all

the stuff i take in and the people i’m around and the tele i watch sometimes triggers me to act differently, super differently, like i take on characteristics sometimes of other people for a few days then change totally after. i don’t know it that’s a testimony to the how i feel about not being a complete and whole person. 

i just, don’t know what to make of it all. it just doesn’t t make sense and i’m so fed up of not knowing myself and not feeling like a whole person, lately it’s gotten worse and i’ve been drinking a lot, whenever i leave the house because i get so paranoid and anxious all the time.

my mind is messy right now, so this might not make sense, i just needed to get it out there. there’s so much more i could say but i can’t think straight right now. i’m struggling with a lot of things but i just wanted to vent this part of it right now"
342,finally got a diagnosis!!!,"

Ive decided to go the route of antidepressants, obv I'm gonna do my own research and consult with my dr but I rly wanted to hear other people's experience with different types to feel more secure in my decision when I chose a medication. (SSRI)"
343,"A message to my family, boyfriend, friends and everyone who texts me here","I'm sorry everyone, for being such a disappointment to you... Had there been someone else in my place, they would've given prompt replies to your texts, taken your calls, texted you first and would've showed you that they're grateful for you being in their life... Please don't think that I don't have any interest in maintaining our relationship or something like that. 

That is absolutely false. I value our relationship a lot... When I'm not as depressed, the love you guys show me is what keeps me going. I understand why you might feel as if I don't care or value you and I know it is natural to think that I don't care about you. 

But, I really care and I really want the best for you and I love you... I know that our society and families don't portray and view depression as a disease and it is not something that is discussed. 

Any depressed person is just viewed as lazy or that they are not trying hard enough. However, this is similar to a disease of the body, like having asthma or something like that. If your right arm breaks, and someone tells you that you aren't trying hard enough, and that if you try you could still use the broken arm, it wouldn't make sense, would it? This is similar to that. I know it is hard to understand, but please try. 

I love you."
344,How do you cope with feeling anxious before you start work?,"There are times when I feel super anxious and restless before my shift for work starts and it's just not a great feeling.

345,I have no idea at ALL how manage college and my deteriorating mental health at the same time.,"**+**Okay so at this moment i am going a advertainment and editing/movie making course. And its hard like maybe college is just not for me but im awalys behind my class i have the hardest time keeping up with everything. And the worst part is i can almost not even keep up with myself and my own thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

**+**If im being honest i find it to be a miracle that i am still trying that i have gone this far with my mental state this bad i dont fear death i could get run over by a car at this moment and i would not mind. And having those thoughts are really taking a toll on my energy and then i also have to battle with getting passing grades and also taking in all the information that is being thrown my way.

&amp;#x200B;

**+**the worst part is that i am not even learning... I only do what i need to do to pass the subject because if i want to learn i take my time i immerse myself about the topic to take in the inforamtion i cant do that if i did i would not make it in time and fail.

&amp;#x200B;

**+**I read stoicism i read self improvement, how to handle my ADHD medicin helps just a little bit i wish it helped more. But still i dont know how to both manage college and my mental health. What i should be doing is trying to heal myself. Like to be honest i am at this moment not in the right mind to be learning at a academically level IM NOT EVEN LEARNING""!!!!!!! I learn more when i read up on stuff on skillshare or linkedin because i can paus i can rewind and i can take my own time to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

**+**Ending: I have no idea what i wanna do at this moment if i drop out where do i go? What do i do? What even is the point like really? What is the point? Always be grinding? Always chase money and a career and when you got it you just want more money? Im just lost. Lost with everything my mind is so scrambled that i feel like i got 10 different people living up there. Also i dont know if this was the right sub reddit to post this on but honestly dont know where else maybe self improvement? Dont know this post is not really about self improvement more about being so defeated that you cant really make your own mind find its focus.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**: feeling lost and defeated dont know how to solve my mental health when i have to worry about college."
346,Why do I always feel like I have a void inside?,"Hello dear Redditors,

I am a woman in her late 20s. I am going through a divorce after an abusive relationship. I feel that the reason I got into the wrong relationship is because I used to feel a void inside me. 

Few days after the separation I was so happy. But now, that void is back. It haunts me mercilessly. I feel incomplete. Again I feel like I need someone near me, even a hug would do. As a child I was so shy and always focused on studying and I made no friends. Now I don’t have friends except one maybe. I hate this feeling - is it the Pennsylvania winter? Why can’t I feel complete by myself?

I hate the thought of going back to my home to my parents - even though I am attached to them I feel suffocated in that house. I feel like I have nowhere to go and just have this feeling of being empty.

I don’t know what this is and why do I feel this way. Please help, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions and thoughts."
347,I can't let go of anger connected to my mother's stressful pregnancy,"Hi r/mentalhealth,

I [24M] am very short (1,62m or 5'3), which always caused me a lot of implicit or explicit rejection from other people, in my child and adult life, in its love and professionnal dimensions. I always have been the shortest of my family, my class, my workplace - in regards to male, and also to females. 

Since height is so tightly linked to masculinity for basically every human culture, this caused me feelings of emasculation and worthlessness, that I always tried to fight. At some points in my life, I felt like the way people perceived me because of my height, and the way I perceived myself, were the fundamental root of the difficulties I was facing. I managed to make it not too much of a big deal, mainly by telling myself that it's an act of nature, a deed without author nor fault, that things are just the way they are, and that I should just get the most out of the ride.

However, 2 weeks ago, my mom told me something she never revealed. For a whole month, during her pregnancy, I did not grow by a single inch. This month, was also the month where my father left my mother and started living with his mistress. My mother was submitted to an incredible amount of stress, yet did not tell any of that to the doctor that was following her pregnancy and asked her if everything was ok. She basically was in denial, and didn't tell the pediatrist either, even though I was abnormally short.

I never got growth hormones, my short height was never discussed in the light of a stressful pregnancy with any doctor.

Now that I know that, I can not cope any more with issues linked to my height. I see human agency behind my issues. As a result, I'm feeling tremendous anger, resent, and feelings of unfairness and injustice.

I have no idea what I can do to get over that anger. It's crushing me and my narratives have collapsed. I resent my mom for burying this issue and never telling a doctor, and of course, I'm angry towards my dad for messing up my pregnancy. This anger should concerns mainly my parents, but right now it feels like I'm ""just angry"".

How to deal with that anger ?

tl;dr: since I know I'm short because of a stressful pregnancy, which prompts a crushing anger and feeling of injustice"
348,Just want to vent a minute,"I've let myself fall apart this year. From completely isolating myself from friends and family to suicidal thoughts. I've had rough years, but this year has been extremely tough.

I've been eating much worse than I think ever have before. I've had days where I don't eat properly, if at all. Nearly every night I'm snacking on sweets or biscuits. Physically, it doesn't look like I do. Emotionally, I can feel what I'm eating affecting me.

I'm really introverted, but when I feel my extrovert side coming out, I feel myself restraining those feelings. All I can think of is how much I'm annoying everyone around me. 

From working in retail during the UK lockdowns, I've seen how absolutely toxic people are. Sure, it sucks normally, but I haven't experienced people like I have now.

I can't tell what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing with myself. I want to get away from retail and put my degree to use, but I can't figure out how. It feels like I'm stuck there.

I'm tired. I just want to feel OK again.
I hate feeling like people hate me and I'm always in the way."

350,When your life is a lie,"My entire life my father was psychotic. 

He'd yell at me daily and tell me I was useless. At school he wouldn't allow me to talk to anyone with the reason ""The teachers were hired to spy on me because some group was trying to ruin our family"". 

The truth is in 2010 my mother was going to divorce my father because his actions were too much. I somehow convinced them not to, and thus I feel it is my fault everyone in my family had to suffer. Things just took a turn for the worst from there on. All these questions come to mind, what if I didn't convince them to not divorce. Would I be a better person, would I not be a loner, would I have friends?

In 2016 I had a existencial crisis where I realized everything I did to waste my time was just escaping my reality. Thus I began truly isolating myself and didn't speak to a single soul for 3 years. Those 3 years were painful because he would have a break every weekend and a really bad one every 2 months.

In 2019 I managed to leave the house for 6 months to go to school. I didn't speak to anyone there either mainly because I was trying to process what I had just lived. The thing is I had to go back home because of the pandemic. Now everything seems just like it was before. It's as if nothing and absolutely nothing has changed.

I can't face the truth. My father is psychotic, lied to me all these years, I used to believe his ideas. There was no need for me to isolate myself all these years. If I would have ran away maybe I would be in a better position right now."
351,Do you feel misunderstood or not understood at all by mental health professionals?,"Sometimes I feel that talking to, let’s say, a drunkard at a pub is better than talking to therapists/psychiatrists. At least I feel that they understand human behaviour and feelings much better than the so-called mental health professionals who were supposed to understand you."
352,How do you talk to someone when you're grieving,"I was wondering about this today. I tried googling it and all I can find is how to talk to people who are grieving but not really anything the other way around. It's not about a death, but I went through a weird sort of bad break-up six months ago. It wasn't a girlfriend either, but still a relationship to a girl that I was very fond of. Some days I find myself missing her very much but I don't know how to explain it. I can't really talk to my friends who don't know her, because I can't really explain what happened, and I'm afraid of imposing myself on the ones who know. I feel like they might tell me that I'm supposed to be over it by now, and that makes me ashamed. Or maybe I'm imposing on them somehow, because they've got their own lives to live. Even though we were never in a relationship it feels like a bad break-up. Even though she's still out there it feels like my version of her died. It feels like this friend I was really fond of died and I can't make people understand because to them she's still out there. I don't know how to deal with it. We go to the same school and I'm afraid of seeing her again because I don't want it to hurt. I'm afraid of doing anything that reminds me of her, because it still hurts. I'm afraid of being myself around her, because that person wasn't good enough for her. It's like my friend died and I'm stuck with this ghost of her, and I don't know how to explain it or make anyone else understand. I don't know if it's okay to describe it like this, because it's not a real death, it's not a real break-up. I don't want to be angry at her. I'm glad that she's alive and I hope she's doing well. I just hate that I don't get to be a part of her life when I miss her so much, and I really don't know how to talk to people about it."
353,Angry outbursts against my older sister,"Before I say anything else, I feel it is 1000% necessary that I say that I am a minor, my older sister is a minor, therefore we both live in the same house with our parents.

I was originally planning on making this a rant against my sister (I might get carried away while writing this though), but instead, I decided that my temper that's shorter than the amount of time people had fun with Fallout 76 and that I had to change it. Whenever she annoys me slightly I end up having a massively huge outburst, screaming, fighting, and yelling. I know for a goddamn fact that this is a terrible thing, but it feels like somebody else is controlling me whenever that happens, you know? Like, that's just not a thing that somebody with my laid back personality would do. Any ideas on how to stop these?"
354,I Need Support From Someone Online. I Hate Talking To Normal People About My Problems Because I End Up Sounding Like an Attention Whore Even Though I Honestly Want Some Help &amp; Support.,"   Recently I've been feeling lost. I feel alone and as if nobody cares. My family claims to care but what have I done to make them care. I just exist in my house. At school, I'm nothing but a failure. I just don't do my work because I don't have the motivation to. Any time I get legitimate motivation, I lose it. It's just because I always fail. Even when I'm motivated, I can't do much. I have an education disorder and it REALLY weighs me down.

   I'm also alone, by myself, every night. I never have anyone to talk to. I live with two little siblings, my step-father, and my mother. I can't connect with them on anything, we're polar opposites. Also, they're always asleep when I'm awake, and I'm always awake when they're asleep. My step-father pretty much shuts me out from the outside world. I can't log onto internet and have no phone. Though my little siblings have Iphone's and all the internet access they could want. I'm just excluded from it because ""He's scared I'm going to do things on the internet I shouldn't."". He claims to be looking out for me, but I know that's bullshit because he literally mocked me in front of the dinner table in front of my family and he had everyone laughing at me. I just feel like I'm not loved.

   I've been losing my friends that I've recently met. I just moved away from all my friends and tried my fucking hardest to make some new ones at this school. Luckily, on the bus I ride there were a bunch of kids who actually made me feel included and cared about. Unluckily, I'm an annoying dumb-ass and they got annoyed at me and stopped talking to me. Some literally even stopped riding the bus. I just wish I wasn't so annoying but I can't help it. It just comes out when I try to make friends. I hope they think I'm cool and shit, so I try to mimic their sense of humor. I wind up failing and annoying the shit out of them.

   Along with all of that, I had gotten out of an abusive relationship at the start of quarantine. Good thing, right? Well, I hate saying this but, wrong. For some reason, I wanna go back. Even though she mentally tore me to pieces, flirted with other dudes, held break-ups over me when she was ""Looking out for me"", etc. I wanna go back to her. I tried getting into another relationship but I literally COULD NOT give a shit about her. Because I knew it was nothing special. I knew she was just gonna play me like every other girl. Long and behold, she did. Just yesterday she admitted to lying about all the good things she said about me. Along with, ""I never actually liked you"".  Which in result, made me want to go back to my abusive ex even more.

   I'm started to feel even worse typing this out, so I'm not going to explain everything else. I just need some support. Please help. If you don't wanna, and just wanna keep scrolling, that's fine too. Thanks."
355,Little things adding up,"Obviously everyone's having a rough time right now. It's so hard when there's just these little inconveniences that add up and make life so hard and feel like it's neverending. 
- verizon screwed up my phone plan for the past two weeks so I can't call or text
-i got locked out of my work account trying to change my password/log into the vpn
-i work a physical job outside and it's getting cold/snowy and I'm in so much physical pain
-the SOS sent me the wrong type of drivers license when I tried to renew it 
-tried scheduling therapy but it won't be covered until I meet my $2000 deductible so I won't be getting therapy
-my family is pissed that I'm not visiting due to covid 
-my significant other is out of work which is putting strain on both our finances and our relationship

Every little thing is frustrating me so greatly even if it's a miniscule problem in the scheme of things. I just want out of this never ending cycle of jumping through hoops on top of my ""normal"" anxiety and depression (of which I stopped taking my SSRI bc I didn't like the side effects which is just making shit worse)

Ugh"
356,Weird question,"Hi there! Bipolar disorder and a slew of other things here, I have a really weird question for y’all. So I’ve always had problems with sensory issues in a variety of different ways. Here lately however, I’ve been having panic attacks over my skin/flesh. For some reason I start noticing how my skins feels around my muscles and bones, like my skin feels too tight, or like I’m living in a flesh prison that I can’t escape and it’s been inducing really bizarre panic attacks that I can’t quite explain. I was just wondering if anyone else here has dealt with anything similar? I’ve asked my friends who also have similar mental health problems but it seems as though I’m the only one who has ever dealt with this."
357,"Not really sure what I should do, please help","Ok. So I've been having a lot of unexplained and undiagnosed mental issues that's been going on for years. I don't know why I have them, I can't think of any trauma that caused it. I don't even know if I have trauma. I grew up with a normal, loving family, I wasn't abused, yet I'm having a lot of issues. I'm certainly not choosing to have these nor am I looking for sympathy or attention. But these issues are really affecting me and my life badly.

Also, my Mom did let me see a therapist but I don't think it worked out too well. Especially considering that I left out a lot of details of these problems due to embarassment. I just couldn't seem to verbalize a lot of them. I also tend to feel really guilty about this because I know that most people with these problems went through worse than I did."
358,My outbursts have taken over my life,"I am seeking help from all avenues I can find, to be honest I'm a shitty person alot of days. My girlfriends been on the other side of my outbursts too many times. I'm looking for coping skills for when things don't go my way. Instead of outbursting my anger. Some times I feel like I'm insane with how bad my outbursts get. I need help but I can't afford all of the options I have. My guilt for this is sickening. I want to make amends for the past but I truely want to change the future."
359,What sort of experience have you had with treating OCD with Fluoxetine?,"I'm specifically wondering what the side effects were like and how significant the side effects interrupted your life.

361,I wrote a poem about how cystic fibrosis effects my mental health and I wanted to share it with you guys,"They’ve got me tied down in a hospital bed.
Gave me a pill . but I want to be dead.

The drugs make me tired ,These white pills aren’t kind .
They say I won’t feel the pain, if I’m out of my mind.

Death peers through my window with an erie grin .
I’ve gotta go to heaven .because ive been to hell with the pain I’m in .

“Let me pop this in your vein , it will only hurt for a sec !“
“Oh and we must do an X-ray, just to check !“

This may make you puke , sleepy and sad.
But just think , others have it worse . So it’s not that bad ! 

You can’t risk infection, you must stay inside.
When you become so frail you can see your ribs, you will loose your pride .

Watch your friends grow up , have kids and get married.
And know you will never have a baby that you carried .

I sit here and think , why did this happen to me? 
This isn’t how I was told life would be."

365,[17f] extreme identity crisis? my therapist also doesn't really help much and idk how to bring it up to her,"this is my first time posting here - have been lurking and upvoting for a while. i don't really have anyone that im comfortable with sharing, even my closest friends, so here goes.

in the past months, i have been losing my sense of self. i lost myself.

everytime i look in the mirror, i dont recognize who i am. that hair, that nose, those eyes, they belong to someone else and not mine. when im not looking in the mirror, i cannot remember what i look like physically. when i think about past memories, even things dating to as late as last week, i do not recognize those activities. like i remember finishing them but no, it wasn't me that did those things. they werent real. someone else did so. i feel like im just staring at myself from a distance and often i catch myself heavily dissociating. its like this body is not mine, this mind is not mine, but when i think, well who am i, i do not know who that is. my sense of self is not big or small, its just not there. i have zero sense of self. i really dont know who i am.

i talked to my therapist and she deduced that this had something to do with a recent move. i was dislocated to my home country back in march from my school in the us because of covid, and life has been on a downward trajectory since. im a tck and experience serious cultural conflict that is only heightened by extreme social anxiety, and i have pretty much been sticking to myself since the move. my therapist mentioned that bc my newer identity was established in and grounded to the states, now that im away from the place, i am disconnected to an identity that ive become comfortable with. it all makes sense. sounds like ive been on extreme survival mode for nine months.

but its only been getting worse. im not a workaholic, but finishing work is the only thing right now that can distract me from dissociation. when im not writing essays and coding and watching criminal minds (my newest avoidance as a coping mechanism), im just there. literally no thoughts head empty. in the past few months, living has become more difficult. i feel like i have no control over where my head goes, and have to ground myself to reality with sound. cooking because the sound of metal clanging soothes me. walking because the sound of my bare feet sliding on the wood is okay. getting out of bed because i want to hear the bed sheets rustling. typing and doing work because the keyboards heap up and down. without those sounds, i feel like i cannot move - my body feels heavy because its not mine.

ik its nothing compared to what has been posted on this sub and this is not the lowest that ive been, but identity-wise, this rly is foreign. im not sure if these all make sense either. my therapist is specialized in cultural psych and working with tck-s, but i dont think she understands that my depression is only escalading worse. idk how to voice how i feel to her because i feel like she always second doubts my feelings. not sure what im rly looking for, just hoping that someone maybe is experiencing the same thing. cultural crisis is rly not the nicest lmaoo"
366,I just want someone to talk to more than once.,"Hello people of Reddit, I’m feeling really bummed out and sad recently. I’m not old enough to drive for context?. But back to the point. The reason why I’m feeling bad is because I believe my dad and his girlfriend might break up soon, the past multiple days they have been nonstop fighting and fighting and almost every time my dad ends up crying and his “girlfriend” leaving the house for the night.

369,I sure do hate this (venting + need advice) {quick summary in the end} *specially for my OCD people*,"_TW for sexual things and violence_


_Disclaimer: I never had any remote interest in hurting anyone, ever. I'm actually very much against any form of torture/violence as it might scar people for life and it is just overall inhumane. Also important to point out that I am quite sensitive to pain in real life._

_Comment if you can, I don't know if I'm just overthinking this or not._


Apologies for the long post, but I needed to let it out. 

Also, I need to point out that I'm not formally diagnosed yet but I'm starting therapy soon, because there are high chances I have OCD. 

Ok so since I (16, f) was a kid I'd get aroused by some torture things on the media. It used to be almost anything as a kid (including pretty gory/explicit stuff) and then I realized that there was nothing sexual about most of those things and so it stopped.
It kept happening but this time usually only if there was anything sexual about it. I watched some videos, saw some pictures, and I never really worried about it because it wasn't something ""recurrent"" and I could easily get turned on by normal things too (bedsides I didn't want to act on these thoughts). 
Also, I never really fantasized myself doing any of those things, it was always other people. 

During the months of lockdown I guess it got kinda stronger because I had more time in my hands and nothing to do with it. 

Then it kinda stopped for a while, it was barely non existent. I had been having my first intrusive thoughts (paranoid ones) and was too anxious too think about other stuff. I still fantasized about normal things during that time, and maybe sometimes (rarely) the more violent ones, but the last ones had just practically went away.

However, some weeks ago I started feeling very anxious about the fact that I had those fantasies, and started compulsively trying to get reassurance that I wasn't a bad, despicable person for having them. At this point, they gave me no pleasure anymore (I refused to think about them), and thinking about the things I had seen made me feel anxious. 
Then it stopped again, but I stopped fantasizing about it completely.
But about two weeks ago I realized that I probably didn't have those fantasies anymore, as they only bring me anxiety and disgust.

The problem? I'm afraid I still have them. And not only that, I'm afraid that if I actually hurt the people I love (or anyone else) I'd enjoy it. Which completely freaks me out. Thinking about the videos makes me anxious. Thinking about the images makes me anxious. But I'm afraid I might still like them, and there are always ""what if's"" running in my head. Bedsides there's the whole ""what if I'd enjoy hurting someone?"". 
And even if I really don't have them anymore, I'm dealing with lots of guilt and shame for the fact that they ever existed. 

Also it feels like this kind of ""eradicates"" the rest of my personality because it really doesn't ""look like me"". 

So basically, I'm afraid:
- I still have the fantasies and am just in denial because I don't like having them
- I'd actually enjoy carrying them out and hurting someone
- This isn't OCD, this time it is for real
- What if I'm not actually against torture nor sensitive to pain and this was just an excuse all along? 
- What if the groinal responses are actual arousal? 

{Summary}: Used to have a sexual fantasy (taboo) that I don't think I have anymore. Afraid I still have it. Afraid I'd enjoy acting on it. Afraid this time it isn't OCD, but a real problem. 

Any advice? And am I just overthinking this? Can it be part of OCD too?"
370,Is this considered suicidal?,"So basically I’m an emotionally detached person, so much so that I’ve become unmotivated with everything to do with life. I find no joy in almost anything and my only form of escapism is reading books and fantasising about being anywhere but where I am. Even though I consider reading a hobby I don’t actually feel much whilst I read, no excitement and barely any joy and happiness. If anything it’s mainly something to focus on as I have ADHD and don’t like being bored. That being said I do somewhat enjoy it just not to the level that I think most people enjoy their hobbies. Because of this incredible lack of motivation I find myself feeling less and less emotion every day. And eventually when asked what I would like to do in the future ‘die in my sleep before I have to work’ became my default answer and has been for years (though people think I’m joking) and it’s not like I choose this just because it’s a better alternative, the thought that when I go to sleep I might not wake up makes me giddy before I go to sleep, like a kid on Christmas Eve, almost every night without fail the thought pops into my head and I feel the strongest surge of positive emotions I can remember feeling in a long long time. That being said I don’t consider myself suicidal, I would never kill myself and don’t actually like pain so I’ve never self harmed. Granted the main thing keeping me from suicide is that whatever happens next has a good chance to be boring as hell (I find the idea of heaven, hell, limbo and eternal peace Boring and only like the idea of reincarnation as it seems like it would be more enjoyable). While I know it’s a bad sign I’m wondering how bad this actually is?

Sorry for any bad grammar, punctuation or bad wording. I have thick mental fog and have trouble getting my thoughts in writing"
371,Can someone explain the difference between MANIA &amp; ANXIETY ?,"I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and I’m constantly anxious.... like just living makes me anxious..
And sometimes I get so caught up in the anxiety &amp; the intrusive thoughts that I feel like I’m going crazy. Sometimes when the anxiety is too much it turns into anger/frustration, but towards myself. Moreso angry about how I can’t just let things go (thanks ADHD..) and how this upsetness keeps happening because I can’t accept things as they are/or aren’t. 

Sometimes I stomp (which I’ve hurt my heel a few times) on my floor or I’ll slam my door, because I just can’t combat my thoughts and a loud noise tends to interrupt my intrusive &amp; ruminating thoughts. As I react this way, I’m quite “here” and acknowledge what I’m doing (like hurting my foot, cracking my door) but it’s just I don’t care during that moment. 
Right after I’ve done it tho (some type of small destruction), I instantly regret and feel even more shittier because I’ve ruined something or hurt myself. 

I’m very emotionally driven in general so emotions seem to really takeover. But again, it’s not like I disassociate &amp; not know where I am or what I’m doing, I 100% do, it’s just I don’t CARE during the happening because the emotion has taken control in a sense.

*So my question is, what’s the clearest difference between mania (which I don’t believe I experience because they are rational &amp; make sense, it’s just as if I’m ‘overreacting’) and just having anxiety/an anxiety attack?"
372,How To Smartly Manage Your Anger," **We know that when feelings of anger arise, the adrenal glands produce stress hormones in response to signals from the brain. Stress hormones speed up the heart rate, sending energy to muscles and other organs, preventing certain bodily functions such as digestion.** [Anger](https://castformation.com/how-to-smartly-manage-your-anger/)  **can cause the digestive system to constrict blood vessels, tax the cardiovascular system and cause high blood pressure, insomnia and headaches.**

**Acupressure releases muscle tension that may result from disturbing anger. Unintended anger accumulated in the body usually accumulates in the muscles of the shoulders, neck, and jaw and also occurs in the mid-upper upper region and pelvis. Capturing acupressure points in these areas can enable the causes of anger to surface and issue unresolved issues.**"
373,Having trouble to motivate myself,"Hello guys. I recently changed country to work and live. I had already lived here but due to some family issues I had to return to my country. I already found a job and I'm living with my parents and my girlfriend at the moment. I have a past of mental issues such as depression and anxiety. Recently I've been feeling like I did when I was depressed, I don't have the will to go to work, can't sleep properly and struggle to enjoy doing my hobbies. Just wanted to know from you guys if you have some advice in how can I change the situation. I don't want to go to therapy because I already did that and I much rather find other options. I would appreciate if someone could just give some advice so I can find the strength to keep on going and to not lose the motivation. Thanks everyone, have a nice one."
374,My mind and nostalgia is killing me.,"I have a serious problem and it's about nostalgia or just looking back. When I do, it hurts so incredibly and I get a feeling that just wants to tear me apart. It really hurts and it's the worst feeling I've ever had. And I get this feeling all the time, it almost does not matter what I think about. Almost every event that I think back on, gives me that feeling and that's what's so weird. These events do not even have to be important or mean anything to me, but just the thought of how it was before gives me this feeling. And then when there are events that actually matter, this feeling becomes really torturing. It hurts so incredibly. Such events can be, for example, tournaments with the team, people I will never meet again or do not have the same relationship with, different events such as Christmas Eve or activities with friends, which I know I will never experience again. Then it is not really that I feel bad or sad now, because then maybe you could understand that you miss old times, and that is what is so strange.I am seriously afraid that I will commit suicide some day because the feeling will tell how it was in my childhood and so on. The more important events, the worse everything gets, I constantly build on small events that I for some reason miss. 

I need help. This is torture and my mind is killing me.This problem makes me just want to sit at home and never do anything, because I know that if I do anything, I will feel this way again because I get even more new events. For example, I can not even listen to my favorite music anymore, both because of this strange reason for missing completely random events, I associate the songs with important events that I miss, but mostly just because I miss these artists who are old and never will do music again (I listen to rock, etc.) It means, for example, that I can not play electric guitar as I have loved to do because I get so bad in my mind that I just want to cry. And what's so weird is also especially Christmas, which hurts me just by hearing Christmas music or just watching videos that are based on snow and Christmas. Then I immediately get this feeling for the 387th time that day and it hurts as much as the feeling of important events. I really do not understand why I get so much pain from looking back in time, even to events that are not even important, and even just from hearing about Christmas.

What is also connected with this is the future. I'm so scared that when I end up in an 8-4 job, I will be overwhelmed by these memories where I look back on my childhood where I had all these dreams of a football player or artist with the guitar. I will miss everything from my childhood so enormously and feel so disappointed in myself that I ended up in a completely normal adult life. I do not understand where people get joy from when it. It makes me push myself so much now and lose all motivation to practice on what I want to be good at, and when it happens I get so stressed, etc. precisely because I do not practise, because I know that I will then end up on such a job.

My friends are not taking my problem seriously, and they seem to not really care to much, I have spoken to my parents but they have no idea how to deal with it."
375,Selank and metylphenidate," Hello to everyone, hope to get some opinions from somebody Who has more knowledge than me.     
10:00 -This morning i tried for my first time selank 2 nose spray for a total of 800micro grams. After 10 minutes not feeling anything i gave n-acetyl semax a try ad sprayed 400 micro. I has breakfast and didnt feel anything.  

11:00 -everything normal Until i got my usual 60 mg Methylphenidate and 100 mg of tramadol, they simply did’nt work anymore.   
14:30 Now i feel like usual withdrawl Symptoms and Any other med stopped working, tried lorazepam for anxiety and amytriptiline. I had other 20 mg of ritalin and 50mg of tramadol but nothing is working. I feel very stressed is this normal? I also have flu like Symptoms but usual li happens with withdrawl.   
17:40- still feel like i have a flu and other meds are useless.  Anybody experienced something like this of can simply tell his experience? When could it stop? Is there some way to accelerate elimination of peptides?"
376,I’m going to stop taking abilify,"I know come at me, but I feel like I don’t need it. I know talk to your doctor! But I feel like he’ll just say the same thing once I bring up the fact it’s doing nothing for me. I’m already on lithium and hydroxcine I want to make this decision. Wish me luck."
377,Escaping the Cycle...Perhaps?,"In my 28 Years 11 Months alive I've been Hospitalised 14 times in my country of origin and about 8 times outside in other places. I've spent about 4 years of my adult life on the streets. This is due to Mental Health difficulties and what I would say amounts to misunderstandings compounded by misinterpretations and also addiction. After years of bouncing in and out of hospitals eventually this year (2020) I was put in prison the reason I was put in prison was because my juggling sticks\[I am or was a part time street performer\] can be classed as offensive weapons. Something inside me died. Or has it? 6 times I have been in prison in 2020. 6 times I was put into COVID isolation which consists of 2 weeks inside a cell no leaving. I'm not sure if its a good or bad thing but something inside me has changed, I can quite grasp what it might be I feel somewhat defeated by incarceration to the point where its like such an inevitability that I feel like I am trapped either way  and that there is no point taking liberties because freedom isn't free and I cant defeat the system as I am a part of the system as it is a part of me. Prison doesn't bother me neither does a psychiatric ward the prospect of either sometimes is borderline appealing though I feel like I am able to break the chain. Maybe the behavioural correctional system works? Maybe I am conditioned / partially institutionalised? No doubt I am in prison mentally due to the many times I've been arrested (40-50) and the amount of times I've been done in and the many head trauma's I've sustained I am an on edge most of the time. I'm not sure what's going on. I've been changing medication for 10 years nothing is working so I am seeing about getting a new diagnosis, we'll see what happens."
378,"We know about intrusive thoughts, but what about intrusive feelings?!","I’m beginning to believe that intrusive feelings are a thing, please someone discuss this subject with me!"
379,I can’t accept this.,"Do I really have anxiety/depression or am I just simply unlucky?

I sacrifice my well-being for the sake of others, while they can’t even seem to reciprocate the bare minimum.

I have so much to say, so much to share, yet my voice is never heard.

I have all this love to give, I wasted it on someone who didn’t appreciate me. 

All of my “friends” are pursuing their goals, getting into relationships, appearing to be happy... then there’s me. 

My so called “friends” begged me to tell them what was on my mind, I uttered the statement “suicidal thoughts” ..and they left. 

I’m trying every single day, I brought myself into a psych ward, I was given medication, and virtual therapy.. yet I don’t see myself moving forward.

I haven’t stopped my medication, I’ve tried all forms of breathing exercises, meditating, yoga, etc.

NOTHING has worked, and I walked into each activity with an open mind and the desire to get better.

I just feel as if, there’s a much bigger issue at hand that I’m not being able to address or overcome, and it’s not being taken into consideration.. yet I was transparent as ever with my psychiatrist. 

It makes me wonder if perhaps I should seek a neurologist, and maybe then I’ll get some answers.

I just want answers, and it’s just biting away at me day by day. 

I had all the energy in the world, I fought through everything that came at me.. now I can’t even get out of bed. 

I’ve lost my joy, and my desire to do just about anything other than sleep. 

Who can I speak to?"

i am posting this with a new account (i dont have one, just a lurker) and with tails os as my Operating system.

My  question for you is: Are you able to live a Life without going off the  grid or isolating yourself, while still not be tracked?

Over the last couple of years i grew very afraid of unkown tracking on the internet and the real life.

For  example i dont like to give people my phone number oder email because i  know on there phone it will be send to the major companys apple,  facebook, google etc.

But  my quality of life suffered a lot. I feel lonely and isolated.  Especially with Covid where i have to use even Goverment Services online  and see all the google analytics and other tracking i feel trapped.

I worry about serial numbers in my harddrive, blutooth devices, wifi, smart tvs and much more.

Worked here for two months after being unemployed for 5 and was told that I am being let go for not learning the job fast enough for taking insensitive to do the work I am not assigned and for making a few mistakes . 
I feel like a failure and this isn’t easy I don’t know how to tell my partner I lost this job with bills being so hard to manage as is . We depend on two incomes but seems like no one wants me and I can’t do anything good at all . 
How can I manage this ? How can I tell my partner and look into his eyes knowing what a failure I am ?"

383,Good news,"I got a psychiatric evaluation meeting scheduled for 4th of Jan. Hopefully I get a diagnosis and can be introduced to schemes or medication that can help me.

384,"I have a friend who suffers from depression and anxiety, and I know if I leave her she will kill herself. What should I do?","I am friends with a girl who suffers from depression and anxiety and some other mental health problems. I have been there with her so much to the point where it’s as if we are in a relationship. I go to see her every week, call her everyday and constantly reassure her that I wouldn’t leave her.

It’s had such a mental toll on me where I feel like I can’t even have a relationship of my own because she would feel so shit about it. I’ve tried to get therapy for her but it’s near impossible due to COVID and when we did get her temporary help she didn’t want to get better.

I’ve told her school but there isn’t much they can do about it, her family is awful and not supportive of her at all but she can’t leave them. She doesn’t really have friends and doesn’t want to make any because her trust issues have gotten so bad.

I’ve also tried suicide lines but they can’t do anything because she’s not in any immediate danger. And whenever I get her to call them she doesn’t want to because she says she can’t open up to anyone on the phone.

She says the only reason why she’s still alive today is because of me, but sometimes wishes I wasn’t her friend so that she could kill herself.

I want to be there for her but it’s really weighed me down mentally, always having to be there for her when she’s crying, staying up late, having to prioritise her so she does get sad.

She knows she’s obsessed with me and that she is low-key toxic yet feels she can’t do anything about it and gets extremely jealous whenever I do anything outside of her. Every little thing I say she always sees negative and then gets upset over and I always feel like I’m walking under eggshells.

I just feel like I can’t do anything with my life and that I can’t get anyone to help her because she doesn’t let anyone in. I’ve tried so much to help her and give her as much advice as possible but she juss doesn’t want to get any better.

The worst thing about it is, that I KNOW that I’m the only person she truly cares about and that if I do leave she WILL kill herself (or at least attempt to) and I really don’t want her to do that. I’d rather go through what I’m going through than her commuting suicide so I’m just so stuck.


Please help me."
385,Scared of my husbands mental health struggles,"My husband confessed to me last night that he has been having intrusive thought involving our 12 month old daughter since she has been born. 

He said when he changes her diaper he “thinks about the thought that he COULD sexually violate her” but he says he is traumatized by these thoughts and doesn’t want to have them. He broke down and said he feels like a monster, he has no attraction to young people and would never harm our daughter or any other child...

I myself am now traumatized, and terrified that he will hurt our daughter. I just don’t know what to do. Do you think I should be scared, do u leave...I’m so lost and scared. He reached out to a therapist and will be seeing them tomorrow. 
I just don’t know what to do"
386,My depression has changed?,"Its been a rough year.  Without going into too much detail, my wife and I agreed to try polyamory, and I had a girlfriend whom I got probably too attached to.  My wife's jealousy pretty much killed the relationship, and caused me a ton of stress trying to keep both of them happy.  My girlfriend got tired of dealing with the constant issues (rightfully so), and broke up with me over the phone while we were all on stay at home orders.  Just gone, never to be seen again.  That led to a month of severe heartbreak and depression, and some resentment for my wife.  That's all cleared up since then, with some depressed days here and there, but nothing too intense.  Still thinking about my ex-girlfriend and missing her even though its been around 6 months, but its gotten less painful.  About a week or so ago, some switch inside flipped.  Before I was depressed that my girlfriend was gone and I wasn't able to be poly, which felt like the way I was supposed to be.  But I think I was depressed because I felt I deserved those things but couldn't have them.  Now I don't feel like I deserve anything.  My wife rarely wants to be intimate, but now I don't want sex or affection at all.  I don't even want to look in mirrors because I don't want to look at myself.  It feels like there's a weight in the center of my chest.  On top of that I've had dizzy spells for the last few weeks, not sure if they are related.  Also in spite of feeling worse about myself than I have in a long time, I've been very functional.  I'm getting tasks done and staying focused better than usual.  I think maybe focusing on getting things done and getting through the day is keeping mind off of how much I don't like myself.  Idk any thoughts?"
387,Dammit...o_o (TW: SH mentioned briefly),"18 to 24 inches of snow coming. Yes...up to 2 FEET.

My anxiety isn't TOO bad, but it is up a little because we just got notice that we are responsible for clearing all the snow that is going to fall from the front steps (and there are a LOT), so that is all going to fall on our 2 teenage boys, 16 and 18. Sigh. 

I want to self-harm, but I am not motivated nearly enough to do it. (Positive?)

I feel restless and dissatisfied with everything and just bored with everything. Grrr.

390,I have irrational anger towards my s/o,"I'm not an avid reddit user so I apologize for any formatting issues or just anything I'm doing wrong.

I'm 19F and I've never been diagnosed for anything but both me and my mom have noticed symptoms of anxiety, adhd, and ocd. Theres probably more, but like I said I've never been diagnosed officially so I'm not sure what is/isn't actually there for me. Some probable mental illnesses I could have, or have been mentioned to me, is depression and bipolar disorder but I really don't like taking those into account because of my lack of research and lack of symptoms outside of manic states and quick mood swings (which I blame on adhd/anxiety).

The problem started when I would get into relationships, have a honeymoon phase for about a month, and then quickly became irritable and annoyed by my partner. All of these relationships were with men, so I assumed I was just a lesbian instead of bisexual and began trying to date women instead. This is my second wlw relationship, and I've been with her for longer than a month (6 months on the 22nd of December,) and I've suddenly just found myself extremely irritated and annoyed even thinking about it. I also began feeling gross and uncomfortable being in a relationship beforehand, which to my (awful) knowledge hasn't happened in previous relationships. I feel really bad because she really hasn't done anything to me, and I feel like a major AH when I think about how it isn't fair to her.

While this might look like it needs to be in r/relationship_advice, I'm actually coming to this reddit because I'm really worried about how quickly my happiness turned to anger and irritability so quickly. Is there any disorders or symptoms of the ones mentioned above that could cause this type of reaction? Or is this just a relationship problem I'd have to slide into another reddit to get answers for?

I appreciate any help you guys can offer. I hope this post isn't too messy or rambly, I really tried to get everything in there. Thank you for advice or help you guys can give me."

I do tell people how happy I am that I've been clean from the blade for so long but I never tell them when I use it again so I don't think it's an attention thing. In fact when I first told my mom about this I had never felt so ashamed or embarrassed.

I'm still ashamed of myself! You could hardly even see my scars anymore! (I mostly took care of them after the fact so that no one could really see or question them) It's almost been a year and now I've failed my mom and my friend again.

I want to be happy with someone when I think I'm getting better but I always seem to jinx myself and fall back down every time I do.

I have access to talk to an online therapist but I'm just uncomfortable talking to someone about these things through a screen and I don't know what to do anymore because I don't want to talk to my mom or friend about this. I don't want them knowing I did this again.

I've recently stopped taking Clomipramine due to the   anticholinergic side effects but I noticed there were people being   treated for OCD on below the recommended minimum doses of Clomipramine   so therefore I've reasoned could it be possible to take 20mg/day of   Fluoxetine or even 10mg/day?

This   isn't a question my general physician will have knowledge or experience   about. She is happy for me to reduce medicines but doesn't want me to   increase.

Have you heard of or do you know of any strategies with lower than 40mg/day doses of Fluoxetine being used to treat OCD

395,Partner's mental health is having a negative affect on mine.,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub. 

We're both in our 30s. Together 5 years.

She has a history of not doing anything about her mental health until it deteriorates to a breaking point (this has happened a few times now). Until we met, she just kept it hidden (and she did a good job of hiding it from me for the first while too),

This means that she lets it go and go, and we're at that point again, where she reached a breaking point, and everything falls apart. Then she finally accepts a (widely and very well known solution) and then she's okay for a while. Meds. Sad light. Therapy. Eliminating the root cause of the problem. etc

I'm supportive, I offer solutions, try to get her to talk thru the problems and come to her own solutions, I sit and just listen, help her see things from new angles, try to get her eating better, drink more water, go see friends, parents, socializing, exercise, (all the things you're told you're supposed to do), but it almost always falls on deaf ears. 

And it's getting frustrating. I'm living with someone who comes home from work, heads to their indent on the couch and buries themselves in their phone, games or TV until bedtime. She says she's fine... but it's very clear that's not the case.

How do I keep myself from getting sucked in? It's really dragging me down, having a partner that won't take care of themselves (when good or bad) and just grinds until breaking. Otherwise, I'm in a pretty solid place overall. Friends, good job, good money, shit more or less together. I've slipped in the past, and I don't want to go back there. I work out, I eat very well, see my friends and family regularly, have some hobbies, go to bed at a decent time and work hard. I do my best to recognize problems in myself and address them. I've worked hard on myself. 

I just need an outside view that isn't ""you guys are so good together tho!"" or ""what are you still doing together then?"" Optics. Something. 

Thanks all"
396,(TW suicide) What do I say so I can get help without being hospitalized?,"Sorry, I'm not sure if questions like this are allowed here. And again, huge TW. I've been almost constantly suicidal for almost a year now. My anchor is my now-diabetic cat so I don't think I'm in immediate danger. I know I have to go back on medicine but the problem is that this is my biggest reason. Ideation is ruining my life. But I'm so scared that if I outright say anything about it I'll be hospitalized and I highly doubt I could mentally or financially handle it. It definitely seems like a big ""game over"" sign. 

I'm not asking for medical advice, I just want to ask if any of you have been in similar situations and if there were ways you could get prompt and serious treatment without them fully knowing why you needed it."
397,what do i do if im a sadist??,title.
398,I think I’m a narcissist,"Hi, this is my first post to r/mentalhealth but I really think I’m a narcissist; I don’t mean in the funny way or the romanticized way on the internet, i mean that i have npd. I’ve seen the way it impacts people firsthand, as both the narcissist and the people around them. I was raised by narcissistic parents, but I didn’t get the full brunt of the abuse, my older siblings did. So i got a bit but they got most of it. For a long time, i idealized my parents. I think that’s where it came from growing up and being told that I was “the favorite” and the golden child.

The problem is, i know that it’s bad. I know it affects all of my relationships (i have one friend and a boyfriend who i think is getting sick of my shit). However, U have no idea how to get help. I’m really at a loss for what to do. I don’t want to become my parents. I don’t want to be anywhere near as controlling and terrifying and abusive as they were. I’m just really unsure of what to do from here on out."
399,Helping those who don’t want help,"So this is a situation I’ve found myself in a lot. But, what do you do when people you care about, very clearly need professional help with your mental health, but outright refuse to get it for one reason or another. 

And as much as I want to support them, I’m out of my depth a lot of the time, I can listen and support them, but beyond that, I have no idea. This gets worse as my inability to help them impacts my own mental health so I can barely help myself while they’re asking me to help them. 

In short, how the hell, do I convince someone that therapy is a good thing and that they should look into it?"
400,I can't remember if I was sexually assaulted or not and it is haunting me," It's a lot, really. So much is overwhelming me.

The first thing is that I moved home for the holidays and at first my bedroom door was broken and would not shut. It would slide open all the time. As much as I didn't want to, I then remembered something that happened to me in Late September at exactly 5AM after a party my roommates threw. I woke up to a guy in my bed. My door was broken at my apartment and would slide open unless I forced it shut. That's how he got in. 

The worst part is that I drank so much (and smoked so much weed) the night before I can't really remember anything. I know I had to move his hand or hands but I don't know where from. I know I was woken up by wet on my face and what sounded like suction on my lips but I don't know what it was because my eyesight was blurry. I know he was white and had blonde short hair but I didn't know his name or who he was. 

I can't remember the details. All I have to go off of is that when I asked him what he was doing he sleepily replied ""resting"" and then said ""Okay I'll leave."" 

I want to think he had a good reason to be in my bed. I want to think that nothing happened. But I can never be sure. And for that I feel so bad. As an egalitarian, I'd hate to be one of those girls who falsely accuse a man and ruin his life. I don't want to ruin any man's life. I feel like absolute shit for even reacting. I feel like shit for thinking he was going to do something else or that he could've did something else and I didn't know because I was unconscious."
401,I finally felt HEARD by my new psychiatrist today!,"Hi. Last year, I went down the long and winding road of getting formally diagnosed with ADHD. After I finished testing and got my formal diagnosis, I was encouraged to consider medication as an option. I've been dealing with anxiety for longer than I can remember. I've been seeing a therapist for over a decade, and it's helped *immensely.* I figured trying medication would be helpful, another tool in my kit. 

I had a panic attack during my first psychiatry appointment, and it was decided that my anxiety needed to be managed better first. Just as I was building trust with my first psychiatrist, COVID happened. Appointments went to video chat, and I was transferred to a different psychiatrist. This second psychiatrist and I didn't gel at all. I gave it a good six months, but after our last appointment, I still wasn't feeling *better* and they seemed reluctant to switch up my antidepressants. They suggested lowering the dosage on my ADHD medication, *the only thing keeping me functional right now,* and I freaked OUT. 

Anyway, after that disaster of an appointment, I screwed my courage to the sticking point and called the office, asking nervously if there was *any way* I could maybe see a different psychiatrist. I talked about it with my therapist, because I felt really bad about making the switch. He said it was good that I acknowledged that I needed a change, and was proud of me for doing it. He said good things about the doctor I switched to, and I felt better about it.

Today was my first appointment with the new  psychiatrist, and she was so kind and patient with me. I was nervous as all get out, and she could tell. But she told me to take a deep breath and tell me how I was feeling. After a few minutes of me telling her my troubles, she smiled at me and asked a couple of follow-up questions. Then she launched into a story, and asked me if I could relate to it at all. Her story described so many of my issues *so well.* I started sobbing when she finished, because it was the first time in forever I'd felt that someone was really *listening* to me and *wanted* to help me. 

So, it turns out it's probably hypomania and bipolar spectrum, and my current antidepressant meds can make those symptoms *worse*. So I'm going to wean myself off of those and try and a mood stabilizer instead. I'm scared about making the change, but I knew something wasn't right with the current medications, and I'm so happy that this person cared enough to really listen to me. So I'm going to try this stuff instead and see if it helps more. 

I'm so tired but today, I felt *hopeful* for the first time in over a year."
402,i need help figuring out my mental illnesses,"this is my first time using reddit so my bad if im horrible at this or mess up. 

but long story short, i have a hard time figuring out my mental illnesses. they came after a long traumatic experience with an ex-parent. 

heres a list of things that i do/ disorders i think i have? 

- i think/pretty sure im bipolar? or have some sort of form of bipolar disorder, because at random times my mood will switch or ill be like, putting my mind into some sort of senario where i can act out the current mood im feeling? and my friends have told me in the past that they think im bipolar.

- im pretty sure i dont have adhd, but at random times ill just like, zone out. i do it frequently in class, or just do something else instead of what im supposed to do, and its been a problem woth me for all my past teachers. and at random times ill just, not be engaged with life? 

- i have depression. dont know how bad it is, all i know is that i have it because teachers have asked + i only got it after the traumatic event with my parental. 

- i know for a fact im hypersexual, result from the traumatic event with my parental + weird sexual stuff i wanna do or stuff ive read or that i sexually pleasure myself nearly every night. and then sometimes the thought of having sex is replusive to me - is that normal? 

- im sucidial + have self harmed before because of me losing friends or me being outcasted hahahaha 

- i dont wanna hurt people but at the same time observing their pain is fun??? like watching peoples reactions to different stuff is just really interesting to me. like sometimes i just wanna create accounts just to hurt people + ive been manipulative before and i fucking hate i dont want to be manipulative and i dont even realise how bad it is until i reflect on my actions after???

- i wanna do bad stuff sometimes??? the thought of killing someone is sometimes fun to me but at the same time i truly dont wanna hurt people 

- i have intrusive thoughts, like getting fucked by the ex-parental again or getting r*ped by a bunch of people because the thought sounds fun??? 

- um, im under 18 so i dont think i can get a diagnosis? the other parental is emotionally abusive and sometimes physical and im like 99.9% sure she believes mental illness is something that can go away like hahaha i wouldnt be like this if you didnt date a pedo???"

404,I need help figuring out what my mental illness are,"Hi guys, I recently found this subreddit while I’m trying to improve my mental help. I live in Asia where no one really care about mental health and I’ve bene every avoiding dealing with my mental health by drinking and smoking, but I’ve decided that it time to take action. I never actually share with anyone about my mental state, all my family members and my friends see me as completely healthy. I never knew what I’m really dealing with and I hope you guys could help me.

I’ve been dealing with mental illness for about 4 years now (I’m 19 atm) and most of it come from being physically and mentally abuse by my father. My parents have me when they were relatively young, my mom was 18 and my dad was 26. My dad is an alcoholic and I recently found out that he use drugs as well. My mom always tried her best but I felt like it was never enough. I was 14 when my parents divorced and my mom moved to Russia to work on her business. I lived with my dad for 2 years, he opened a bike washing business and I was a full-time employees. I really have no freedom, I can’t hang out with my friends in school since I was always working. Working for my dad for 2 years gave me lots of traumas, he was constantly yelling and hitting me during the time. Nowadays, every time I heard someone yelling or a sudden loud noise, my heart would missed a beat. My dad kicked me out at 16 when I had enough and stand up for myself. I had no family to go to at the time since my mom was still in Russia. I ended up living with my mom’s best friend and her family. I’ve known them my whole life and they treated my like family, but I always felt like I wasn’t a part of their family for some reason. I stayed with them for about a year, then I went to Canada to study grade 12. The 1 year I have in Canada was the best part of my life, I have full control of my life and I never felt better, I made some great friends and I never miss home. I graduated in January 2020 and got accepted to a uni in Canada, I have to take a gap year due to school start in September. I have to go home for 9 months, it was pretty fine before the whole pandemic things happened and I’m currently studying at mid night everyday and I can’t comeback until next September. 

It doesn’t end there, despite being mistreated, I was also a bad person from 15 to 17. I been in a few relationship, but I always manipulate my partners and toyed with their feelings, I even cheated on 1 person and she was thinking about suicide, thankfully her friend stopped her. I never forgive myself for what I did, I used it blame it on my parents divorce, but deep down I knew the only responsible for that was me. I been in one last relationship after that, and I got what I deserve, my partner cheated on my with my best friend. It’s been 2 years, but I could opened myself to anyone anymore, I never truly trusted anyone but myself ever since. 

Now, I’m 19 and I hate myself, I don’t have feeling for anyone anymore. I never missed my mom and I haven’t seen her for 2 years, we talk once every few weeks but I can’t really see myself having a good relationship with her, I feel extremely guilty for it. I used to have suicidal thoughts when I was 15 but I don’t anymore. For me, living is suffering, and I want myself to suffer every single day. But now I want to give myself a chance to be a better person and I am going to help myself since there is really no therapy when I am living. I want to know exactly what I’m dealing with as a first step. If you guys could give me any help of tips I would be very grateful 

Thank you for reading. I’m sorry if I made any mistake or it’s to confusing as English wasn’t my first language."

410,Mental Health is Spiraling Out of Control,"Little background: I (19F) am in the United States. My family has a history of anxiety, depression, ADD, and ADHD. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Two years ago I was told that I was at risk of developing an eating disorder. I saw a psychiatrist and a therapist but due to insurance and financial issues I had to stop. 

Recently it feels like my mental health is spiraling out of control. Nearly every aspect of my life is currently causing me stress. I’m worried about school. My home situation stresses me out. I’ve started a new job that I *love* but it also stresses me out. My car is on the fritz. I’m stressed about money. It just feels like everything is causing stress. I haven’t cleaned my room in so long since I feel like I don’t have the energy to do that, because I feel mentally drained, but my messy room stresses me out. 

I feel like I was finally getting a good grasp on my anxiety and depression but it feels like it suddenly intensified and hit me like a truck. I rarely have the  energy for simple tasks. I’ve rarely been eating. I feel like I have a very unhealthy relationship with my body right now. I don’t feel like myself. I feel like my body isn’t my body. Or that I’m not me? I feel very despondent and almost like I’m watching my life play out in third person. I feel like that this point it’s probably safe to say that either I’m starting to develop an ED or that my depression has suppressed my appetite. 

In addition to the above effects, I feel like I want to turn substances to help me. I think I have an addictive personality and I know that turning to a substance will only result in more harm. The past few weeks I’ve been considering getting a vape pen. I used to vape before I saw a psychiatrist and therapist. It felt like it helped with my anxiety and calmed my nerves. I don’t think I did it often or was dependent on it. Quitting was relatively easy as I did it on my first attempt but I still doesn’t want to turn to that as I know it could cause health problems. I’ve also had passive thoughts of self harm and that scares me. I’ve been free from it for two years and I don’t want to relapse. 

I haven’t really told anyone close to me about this because my parents usually act like I’m exaggerating things. My friends all deal with mental illness and they are all struggling pretty bad. It feels wrong to bring it up when they are already struggling. I’m always their rock. They’d worry too much. The same thing with my boyfriend. He’d worry too much and he feels too deeply. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I know that I SHOULD tell someone. I know my friends and boyfriend want to be there for me, but for some reason I can’t bring myself to say anything. Plus I can’t afford to seek help so I’m not really sure what good would come from it. 

I feel weird because you can clearly see the mental battle I’m facing of self preservation and wanting to destroy myself. It makes me feel like I’m just making things up or that I don’t actually have depression or anything because I’m trying to save myself. I guess I feel like a fraud. I’m sure I need to get back into therapy but I just can’t afford it. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for right now by posting this? Encouragement? Advice? Validation? I’m not really sure but here I am."

412,Information Needed,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to find papers and official research into mental health genetics and mental health causes. I will explain below in more detail.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wanting to understand whether mental health disorders such as EUPD (Emotional Instability), Narcissism, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety and Depression can be caused from genetics or are they solely environmentally caused?

&amp;#x200B;

For this next part I shall name the person in question ""Fran"".

Fran is in her mid 40's, married (petty arguments common with husband, never physically violent though), and has 4 children. The Children's sex and age are as follows.

Eldest Child: MALE,  19

Second Born: FEMALE, 18

Third Born: MALE, 15

Fourth Born: MALE, 11

&amp;#x200B;

The Husband (male, 48) has struggled with mental health for practically half of his life. He lost both his mum and dad at around the age of 18 and joined the army almost immediately after this. He met Fran and had 4 children with her. in early 04/05 he was diagnosed with diabetes. In recent years he has been admitted into psychiatric units for his safety (at least once a year he is admitted). In the past year he has lost practically all of his eye-sight and is registered sight-impaired, along with having a double transplant mid last year. He struggles with his emotions as he keeps it inside, and he has been diagnosed with multiple mental health disorders. He constantly has petty back-and-fourth arguments with the female child.

The oldest child (male, aged 19) was diagnosed with diabetes just after his father in 04/05. He has struggled with emotions and depression since the age of 11, from the age of 11 until 18 he would self harm almost daily. aged 17 he was admitted into a psychiatric unit following an attempted overdose. Whilst in the unit he continued to attempt suicide, along with head-banging and frictions burns that would cover his face and arms. He has been diagnosed with: Depression, Anxiety and EUPD, along with possible bipolar.

The second oldest child (female, 18) has possibly suffered with mental health issues for the past couple years, led from witnessing and being around her father and oldest brother whilst they attempted suicide. Admitted into a psychiatric unit mid 2020, she was released with the diagnosis of psychological un-development and adjustment disorder. Eldest child has done some research as well as talking to his physiatrist and both the physiatrist and him agree that it is more than likely she has underlying narcissistic traits.

&amp;#x200B;

The third child (male, 15) acts oblivious to this all but knows what is going on. He has not been diagnosed with any disorders as of yet, however there is a possibility due to the things he has witnessed and heard.

&amp;#x200B;

The youngest child (male, 11) is also diabetic and this has had a huge impact on his life. He is awaiting multiple diagnosis's such as ASD and mental health disorders led on from the trauma of the diabetic diagnosis. Around the ages of 7-10 he would constantly take about death, say that he wanted to die and also head-bang, this has all since stopped since coming out of public school to be home-schooled.

&amp;#x200B;

Fran (mother, female, 45) has never been diagnosed with mental health disorders however has struggled with all of the issues presented in the past decade. She has been prescribed sertraline from the doctors but has been advised only to take it when needed (she is stubborn and says she doesn't ever need it). It has been suggested that she may also have EUPD along with the eldest son. She is denying any possibility of mental health disorders and says she is ""just emotional"".

&amp;#x200B;

Please can i have a professionals opinion and answer, or official papers or research to the above information. I would like to know how likely it is that Fran has mental health issues, along with mental health and genetics.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance to anyone that can help or provide relevant information."
413,My mind and nostalgia is killing me.,"I have a serious problem and it's about nostalgia or just looking back. When I do, it hurts so incredibly and I get a feeling that just wants to tear me apart. It really hurts and it's the worst feeling I've ever had. And I get this feeling all the time, it almost does not matter what I think about. Almost every event that I think back on, gives me that feeling and that's what's so weird. These events do not even have to be important or mean anything to me, but just the thought of how it was before gives me this feeling. And then when there are events that actually matter, this feeling becomes really torturing. It hurts so incredibly. Such events can be, for example, tournaments with the team, people I will never meet again or do not have the same relationship with, different events such as Christmas Eve or activities with friends, which I know I will never experience again. Then it is not really that I feel bad or sad now, because then maybe you could understand that you miss old times, and that is what is so strange.I am seriously afraid that I will commit suicide some day because the feeling will tell how it was in my childhood and so on. The more important events, the worse everything gets, I constantly build on small events that I for some reason miss. 

I need help. This is torture and my mind is killing me.This problem makes me just want to sit at home and never do anything, because I know that if I do anything, I will feel this way again because I get even more new events. For example, I can not even listen to my favorite music anymore, both because of this strange reason for missing completely random events, I associate the songs with important events that I miss, but mostly just because I miss these artists who are old and never will do music again (I listen to rock, etc.) It means, for example, that I can not play electric guitar as I have loved to do because I get so bad in my mind that I just want to cry. And what's so weird is also especially Christmas, which hurts me just by hearing Christmas music or just watching videos that are based on snow and Christmas. Then I immediately get this feeling for the 387th time that day and it hurts as much as the feeling of important events. I really do not understand why I get so much pain from looking back in time, even to events that are not even important, and even just from hearing about Christmas.

What is also connected with this is the future. I'm so scared that when I end up in an 8-4 job, I will be overwhelmed by these memories where I look back on my childhood where I had all these dreams of a football player or artist with the guitar. I will miss everything from my childhood so enormously and feel so disappointed in myself that I ended up in a completely normal adult life. I do not understand where people get joy from when it. It makes me push myself so much now and lose all motivation to practice on what I want to be good at, and when it happens I get so stressed, etc. precisely because I do not practise, because I know that I will then end up on such a job.

My friends are not taking my problem seriously, and they seem to not really care to much, I have spoken to my parents but they have no idea how to deal with it."
414,I feel like I have depression.,Im not sure if Im going trough a phase or if I actually have depression. I used to eat alot and have a big appetite but now I dont have any. Im also gaining alot of weight. I have many headaches and overall body pain
415,Seasonal mania?,For back ground I have a very long list of diagnosis and more that have been suggested so no one is exactly sure what’s wrong with me I experience mania very rarely it’s almost always hypomania but the weird part is it’s almost always in the summer months idk if it’s relevant but my depression does get worse in the winter time I just wanted to know I guess is this a thing that happens to other people or is it just a Coincidence
416,Fear of sitting in certain chairs/compulsive behaviors/should I see a professional?,"I’m wondering if anybody else is like this: there are certain chairs in my parents’ house that I am terrified of sitting in.  They’re completely normal chairs, but I have an irrational fear that if I sit in them something horrible will happen.  They’ve had them for like 15 years, and I have never sat in them.  

I also have been uncomfortable, for as long as I can remember, walking directly behind someone else, like even if they are far away, I have to step to one side of their path because I don’t want to follow in their exact footsteps.  When I was little I thought that if I walked in the exact steps of someone else I would literally become them (that sounds crazy as I’m writing it), I don’t think that now but I still can’t make myself do it.  

I also pick at my skin a lot (until I bleed at least every other day), and I just feel like I don’t have control over myself."
417,i fell sucidel," The biggest part of the problem is that my parents put a lot of pressure on me to be better in school, and that's why I have so much stress that sometimes I think about killing myself. I always have stress because of school but I can't force myself to be better in it. is the last in my state and I feel like I ended my life before I started it."
418,paranoia,"ok so, lately i have gotten paranoid for no reason? ive always been scared of the dark, but recently when its dark i actually feel like someone is watching me. typing it out is even more scary. its kind of silly, but everytime i leave my room at night, go downstairs/upstairs at night etc. , i feel a strong presence near me? when this happens, my first instinct is to run to my room as fast as i can, and when i do; i get dizzy, light-headed and nauseous. when im about to sleep, my brain makes me think that there are people/things in my room that aren't there. its very dark, so its not detailed, but i see a black silhouette of something there. it sounds dumb. it doesnt help that i have had sleep paralysis frequently, but it has stopped lately. is there any way to solve this?"
419,How do you learn how to trust?,"I am in a relationship where this comes up a lot, so I ended up thinking I should ask for advice.

At that point I don't think I am able to see the difference between ""trusting someone"" and ""I don't care what happens because I'll survive""

Obviously when it comes to someone I love, I can't just not care.
When I hear something, my brain will automatically pick every possible outcome that could be harmful to me so I can protect myself in case it happens. I'm always ready to just run away and disappear because I'm used to things going wrong and getting hurt even if everything was previously completely fine, so I try to predict the unpredictable and just because ""someone, somewhere would"" it becomes a valid possibility, it has nothing to do with what I know about the person because I expect that anyone, any second, could do something unpredictable. Even with people I know are good, like my partner, who genuinely loves me. I keep waiting for the moment it'll happen, because I've always been treated that way. I'd like it to change, though


So what really is trust? How do you trust someone or even life? From there on, how do you believe in the positive outcomes?"
420,I feel like a human mold.,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and MDD, but over the years I've interacted with people with different other conditions, and as I interacted with them I started to develop symptoms of their conditions and begun to think that I may have them as well. The moment they moved out of my life, though, the symptoms went away. I don't know what symptoms are my own or what symptoms are me taking them from others. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I dated someone with OSDD, and began to think that I had alters too but when we broke up and cut contact, I never thought about it and the 'symptoms' went away.
* I'll watch videos of people with different disabilities (freshest in my mind - CFS/ME and Tourette's) and get symptoms of those disabilities that I've never had before watching the videos

&amp;#x200B;

So, I guess I'm really struggling with my identity. What if I'm not really depressed, what if I don't really have anxiety and have just faked it long enough to get diagnosed? I've never done any of these things intentionally, I've just always conformed and 'mimicked' the people around me and I don't know why. Is this a normal thing? Is there something wrong with me? I'm very anxious to post this, especially because I don't have the motivation to make a throwaway account, so please don't be mean. I just want to know if this is something other people experience as well."
421,Everyone around me thinks I'm crazy and i started to think so,"I don't know the reason why they call me crazy, i kind of guess it and i don't know where to start. Firstly no one was calling me crazy, when i was in secondary school everyone was telling me i had some unusual behaviours (I don't even know what were they. I was a kid just like them) that's why i had no friends, boyfriends, or teachers admiring me despite my academic success

As the time passed, ""You have unusual behaviours"" turned to ""You're crazy"". From my mom to the cashier of my local market _(ok i exaggerated a bit, I don't even know the cashier of my local market)_ calls me crazy!

__I talked about myself too much, let's talk about the reason made me think i might be crazy...__

So, i fell in love with someone I've never seen in person (aka online). And moreover i thought he was my boyfriend for months till it came out as i was the only one had feelings like crazy, he loved me as a friend and we never became a thing (well he didn't even asked me sth like 'would you like to be my gf', I created everything in my mind.

Forget about that part. It's another dramatic story, now it came out (i think) an old friend of mine has feelings for me and I'm really scared because of the scenarios i create in my mind. [If you're not lazy to read you can check this submission about all the thing between me and him, and my fears.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kdxhe4/theres_a_guy_who_has_feelings_for_me_i_think_im/) I'm like ""What happens if he murders me when i reject him?"" I don't know what makes me think in this way. I see news about the victims of femicides everyday, i think it makes me terrified this much. And if he has feelings for me or not is not even clear!

Every night i first start thinking about the guy who friendzoned me, then i try to tell myself he's gone. Then i start to think about the old friend and the evilish plans of him that he wants to apply on me such as throwing acid to my face or burning my house. Thinking about such things of course don't affect me good

Then i merge those 2 stories in one scenario; _""That old friend of mine confesses his feelings for me, i tell him about my fears while my body is shaking and I'm crying. He looks at me frustratedly and says 'I have loved you for years and you imagined me as a cerial killer seriously?'. I can't even reply him but say 'Please don't hurt me' then he tells me 'No, i never hurt you. Never intended to hurt you, I'll hurt myself' i still can't say anything but 'Please don't hurt me'. Then I learn that he attempts to commit suicide but he's now fine. And tells his family it was something I wanted. I start to feel guilty and tell myself what an insane creature i am. The old friend's family denounces me, so authorities decide to institutionalize me. They tell me I'll stay in mental hospital till i beat my paranoia. By the time they take me there, my best friend sends a message to the guy friendzoned me months ago, she tells him about all the stuff and he tells her he already understood i was crazy from the beginning""_

Don't judge me please. I know the scenarios i create in my mind aren't okay and so am i... How can i beat this? Am i seriously crazy? Even if i am, how can i get over this? I'm just a 17yo girl"
422,"Since my lasik surgery, I feel blank","

Since I did my lasik surgery, which was 3 months ago, I feel like I have no word to say. My mind is just blank and I feel like I am not acting normal. I dont laugh anymore. I am just not me anymore. I don’t know what to do."
423,i’m so alone there’s pain in my heart i feel so empty and incomplete i’m only 14 and homesick for a place i’ve never ever even been to,"i can’t take this anymore it just hurts so much my political view will never happen in my lifetime and i’m suffering from existential dread my sister doesn’t even get the time to hang out or talk to me she’s always at work or with her boyfriend or friends and never brings me along i don’t have any one to be with or talk to my mum brushes it off as me being edgy and my blindly optimistic dad is too ignorant to notice or care i just can’t take this anymore i’m so weak and worthless and i try and cope by smoking,alcohol,caffeine but the pain is always still there."
424,New here,Anybody in Easton PA or close by?
425,I feel like I'm fighting against my emotions,"I just feel so much anger throughout my day and I get to a stage where I'm so hot in the body and so tense and stressed my head feels like its whizzing around and I just feel so much dread and it's so constant and by end of the day I feel so low sometimes feel like crying and sometimes just feel like empty and like wondering if I'll ever function properly my paranoia about others seeing me angry or anxious is excruciating. I feel like everyone tries avoiding eye contact cause they can see how stressed I look. I feel like I have no time for myself shifts are soooo long and i come home exhausted, sad and eat and sleep and have to do it all over again. Like I'm constantly fighting with not showing my anger and hiding myself from others cause I feel like I'm making them stress out. Like I just look so low and out of it. I dont even know if I can do the job but then took me 10 weeks to get this and need money. I just dont wanna fight with my emotions anymore. I'm so tired. What can I do?"
426,Is there something wrong with me or am I just overthinking it,"sorry if this post is hard to read, im tired and dont have a clear head rn. questions are allowed, right? i hope so

I've been having really big urges to do useless stuff (I don't know how to say it), basically stuff that would only have negative consequences. This is especially breaking valuables. Whenever i walk over a bridge/near a high drop I strongly want to just chuck my phone down, and that urge is nearly as big as my logic saying 'that's a dumb idea'. when I hold glass I also really wanna smash it, but knowing the cuts or mess to clean up I can just barely resist

on a bit of a darker note I sometimes have thoughts that sicken me, sexual stuff that I don't want to get in to but it disgusts me and actually doing it would land me in so much shit. I don't want to do these things but the thoughts happen. additionally the n word appears in my mind too much for my own comfort, but I know I have no prejudice against people of colour and id never want to call someone it. I get really worried with these thoughts because, it wont, but what if i say it or what if i act upon those thoughts?? im a very carefree person otherwise but thatd ruin my life and thats terrifying

Are urges like this normal? am i just worrying about this too much? If I am just a simple 'youre overthinking it' would clear my mind and make me feel way more content about it all, thank you

427,Energy is Based on Feeling (65),"Some mornings after my sleep, I wake up and feel tired, I feel refreshed but as well as exhausted from the travels that I did through my subconscious. Some mornings I wake up and feel like I need more sleep, some mornings I wake up and feel fully refreshed and ready to go. All mornings I know that I must follow how my body feels but as well as sometimes push through what my body is trying to condition me into feeling. The life of a human being is very peculiar, always changing, always evolving, always growing, always sharing, always learning, always failing, always realigning; We Pause, for a moment.

Energy is based on a feeling. Everyday is a new day, everyday is a new start but all mornings are a blessing to wake up, rise and start new. Its so interesting to me when I get energy based feelings that are different from what is trying to perceive me, that is trying to tell me, that is trying to scare me, that is trying to say one thing, when I can feel otherwise; God, I Thank you. Everyone and anyone can connect with those feelings, what it took for me was getting to a point where I was over my alcohol and marijuana abuse on my soul, spirit, being and my body. I had, had enough; I knew that there had to be more, there just HAD to be.

It all takes time. Life is about the time we are given daily. We can set goals to accomplish, we can work hard towards them, but most of the time the Universe will guide us differently, we may still accomplish said goals but it will come with many different experiences, learning, self growth that was unexpected; always for our Highest Self. Keep doing your best. Growth and Change comes through day to day hard work; giving yourself time and space from what is being focused on, to maintain grounding, presence and pausing. 

I love you.

428,My mother is my biggest supporter and enemy,"All my life I’ve always had a close connection with my mom,  it allowed her to say anything to positive or negative without any filter or care for my feelings. She taught me that words can be used at weapons, that’s when I started defending myself. As I’m adulting and becoming more knowledgeable I’m seeing that we are having more arguments. My mom looks at me and shakes her head sometimes I catch her looking at my body. She made me feel like I wasn’t good enough and this showed in how I dressed, talked, interacted with people. I love my mom but I can confidently say she is very toxic to me and sometimes fuels my depression. I’ve never been an angry person, but I think something in me clicked and said I had enough. She said I have changed and I say no I’m just growing up and that’s uncomfortable for you."
429,"Im not here for help, just to share, I found out recently i can only write if its about my past, and I've had a bad past.","Id tell you the truth, but the truth would make you tell me to get help

Id tell you the truth if I knew how to let it out

Id tell you the truth, but i cant pull down these walls to let the truth go

These lies are here because it's my fault

Its my fault I stooped this low

I stooped so low I let them walk all over me

I let them use me

I let them

I thought i was free

But there still holding on to me

From the depths of my mind

All those people who hurt me, are still there

clawing their way into my life

Past the people who care 

Past the truth

Those people stopping me are me

They're there becuase of my lies

Because i didnt tell the truth

Now my walls are up and i cant pull them down

When i look in the mirror all i see is an empty husk

a husk of what used to be

That husk was never me

It was the mask i put on day in and day out to fit in

The real me is hidden deep behind these walls

Sleeping in the depths of truth

The truth that i hid behind these walls of lies

Im here because I can't stop pulling myself back down behind these walls

The truth that is hidden behind these walls 

it needs to come out, it has to come out

but i can't hear their calls

The calls of the ones that care

The ones that want to know the truth

The ones that when around me are uncouth

But the only voices i can hear are my own

Those words will always do more damage

then the sticks and stones

Ive been behind these walls for so long

I don't know the truth

But I know is these walls of lies are wrong

I know that there is a truth hidden behind these walls

But I dont know how to let it out"
430,I’m unable to get mad and speak up for myself,"I have two different issues that may or may not be related which I’ve discovered recently due to my relationship getting more serious and hence having to discuss more issues . First of, no matter how bad someone does me, I’m unable to get mad, I don’t even remember how that feels. I do feel rage sometimes, but not more than 2 minutes and just with my sister o mum and I shout something “rude” like fuck off or leave me alone and then I move on to something else or bustt into tears. But apart from that situation, when friends or my bf hurt me I don’t feel anger, I just think I should feel it and sometimes pretend I do. That makes it difficult for me to set healthy boundaries.

The second which I’ve only seen with my bf is that when I’m sad or sometimes even when I try to share things that worry me or that are not positive I feel like I can’t talk. I want to say these things out loud but I phisically feel like I can’t. He usually tries his best to support me and make sure I’m comfortable and within 10-15 minuts I’m able to say what I wanted to say.
For instance yesterday I told him I needed to set new boundaries, I didn’t want him to check my phone or have my insta account on his phone and that I will keep talking to my ex even if he doesn’t approve . It took me 1 hour to say it because I couldn’t even look at him when we meet ( we had previously fought about this) . At first I couldn’t move or look at him, he started to touch my hand and asked if it was okay( him asking always makes me comfortable). He talked first and stated his opinion in a passive-aggresive way and then he tried to get me to speak and i was able to tell him all. Once I start I don’t struggle to keep talking. I’m actually a very honest and talkative person so that is really contrary to my values.

Btw I’m 16 if that helps and I think I’m pretty happy overall."

432,Sectioned,"Hi All
My mood had been very low and after a failed suicide attempt I have been sectioned. 
I did a number on my body too so that doesn’t feel great
Currently waiting for a bed on the normal side of the hospital but I was told it could take up to a week so I’m on a normal ward. 
I will probably still be here over Christmas but I’m not fussed about that, it’s never been a joyful holiday.

So I wanted to ask people who have been in similar situations what to expect, the sort of questions I should ask and things I need to look out for.
Previously diagnosed with bipolar 2 and borderline but honestly don’t know what I believe

433,I'm worried about my brother but he doesn't seem to want help,"I'm not sure if I should or how I should help my brother. For some time now, he's been incredibly low and alone. He has been pretty shut in for most of his adult life, and has struggled to meet anyone romantically. For a whole, he seemed okay, just happy enough in his job and seeing his friends when he could (they don't live in the same city). 

But ever since the pandemic he's seemed even worse. He's always been easily agitated but now it's hard to know if a call or message will set him off. He only goes out to get food, and never sees anyone except occasionally me. He lives alone and works from home in a small flat. 

I'm really worried that he is depressed, but anytime we mention that we are worried or want to help, he lashes out. He doesn't ever seem to want to talk about how he's feeling and barely likes to chat at all. 

I don't want it to become so bad that he's deeply unhappy and depressed and I was just to afriad of causing an argument to do anything about it.

But how do you help someone who doesn't want to talk about what they are feeling??

If anyone has any experience with a situation like this, I'd really like to hear your thoughts and opinions as it's causing a lot of pain for me and my parents to see him this way."
434,Diogo Portela - The Man Who Won’t Give Up,"Diogo Portela - a professional Brazilian darts player. 

Unfortunately, tonight, Portela lost his darts match 3-0. But, that’s not the story that’s going around, there is a much better story to be heard. 

In the first road of the tournament, Diogo won his match 3-0. After the match, he broke down in tears. During his interview, Diogo revealed the adversity and challenges he has faced beyond the darting stage. Diogo sadly battles with depression, as does his wife. Also, his daughter is fighting an illness. He said “*To win at Ally Pally would be special any year, but this year was even more special. I've been to some really dark places this year. What I've been through this year I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I was thinking about quitting darts and even killing myself. To overcome that and win on the stage after just two or three months, what can I say? This was a win for myself to prove how strong I am”. 

This shows everything. If you’re feeling down in the dumps or suffering with any Mental Health issues, your dreams are not going to give up on you. Life is going to challenge us in different ways, the most important thing to take out of it is how we fight back. Yes, you will experienced bad days, you’re going to face setbacks, but they will make you a stronger person. The pain isn’t there for nothing, it’s going to build you up into something you thought you were never going to be. No matter how you’re feeling, no matter what you’re currently going through, it will get better, I promise you. This stage of your life is important, it proves how strong you truly are deep down. 

Be like **Diogo**, don’t let this feeling get you down, don’t let it push you about and don’t let it defeat you. Take it each day at a time, you will come out the winner, even if you feel like the loser. We are currently living in hard times, but it will all be worth it in the end. You’re learned a lot this year, more specifically, about you. You need to believe in the person you are, believe that this whole situation is going to blow over and you’re going to leave with your head held up high. 

Thanks for reading. :)"

436,I’m worried that I’m some kind of pedo freak,"TW: My struggle with what’s pedo and what’s POCD, the OCD fear you’re a pedo.

I found out that most people online find it on when someone find an anime character who is in high school attractive.

I figured most people just aged them up in their heads, since most anime high schoolers look 25. They make underaged characters look so adult, it’s weird.

Online, I found takes such as “An adult should be able to see a character they were initially attracted to, find out their age, and then seperate themself from the initial attraction.”

So I decided it was creepy. However a few times I felt that attraction still and justified it in my head.

I finally tested it with Starfire from the animated movies

https://youtu.be/9TLX1KRDmV0

They decided to make her adult form and her on the Teen Titans look the same age. And lo and behold, despite knowing when they take place, I still got aroused by, and justified the feeling as just drawings, her TEEN Titan era form. 

Apparently, the aged up mentality is still very much frowned upon.

I once liked the taboo that I was able to find a character canonically underaged attractive because they looked like an adult.

So that means I do like underaged things? I really hope not.

Now I’m afraid that I’m an actual creep. How do I process this? Am I a pedo? Or doing pedo things?

I posted this elsewhere and was told I was “fucked in the head” and “need help.” A therapist said I was fine, but."

They don’t let me talk or rant to them because I’m a drama queen.

I do one thing wrong and I get everything taken from me even if I don’t have a clue what it is.

I have no one to turn to I have no one when I do I push myself away because I feel like I’m not good enough and that I don’t deserve them.

Last year I cut almost every day I stopped but I’m feeling like I want to pick it back up.

Normally, after about half an hour of this I feel a bit better, but I'm worried that this is an unhealthy coping mechanism that's just helping me ignore my emotions."

I finally switched doctors about two months ago after my last suicide attempt, and he put me on lithium. I haven’t had any suicidal thoughts in two weeks, and honestly I’m pretty excited for the future!!! I don’t want to die anymore. I have attempted suicide 5 times, thinking that there was no more hope for the future. But I am glad I kept on trying. I hate being cliche but honestly those people are right. You have to keep on trying!!! I really thought this day would never come. Please keep on going on. I hope you all get to come to this day at some point too."

447,Mental health recovery journal prompts?,"Any suggestions? I am on a waiting list for therapy so would like something to help recovery in the meantime. Recovery from: anxiety, depression, SH/Suicide, OCD etc"
448,i feel shameful for ever trying to use mental health resources,"I recently got put on a truancy diversion  program at school. (i’m in high school) I have gone to online school before covid. The way they took attendance was if you turned in a certain amount of assignments per class per week, you were present. Fair right? I understand there are many teachers and students who have never had to do everything online to this extent before and the way things are being done is because students are having difficulties completing things when they’re not in a physical classroom. I am attending a high school who is doing remote learning due to covid-19, not an online school. I was confused about the requirements in order to be counted present and due to this I got marked absent a crazy amount of times, despite completing my daily work. The dean sent me an email saying she was coming to do a home visit on this date at this time. She didn’t ask my dad if she could come or gave us any notice she just said that. So my dad called her and said why that was disrespectful and told her a different day and time she could come. She said that she had to check with some other staff if that would be alright and that she’d get back to us. She never got back to us and showed up at the house on that day. My dad told her to leave because she never told us she was coming and it was disrespectful to do that which I would think is fair? Anyway, after that, I sent a very long email to the school counselor, explained my situation and told her i’d like to meet with her on zoom in an attempt to clear any confusion regarding my situation. She said she would like to do that and that she would let me know a date, in which she never did. After that, I had no staff members reach out to me regarding my attendance until I was put on a truancy diversion program. Up until that point I thought I was doing fine and was improving because they hadn’t said anything to me. but no. No warning, nothing. I understand the expectations now to be counted present during remote learning at my school and my attendance rate is at a high 80%. I am planning on dropping out and getting my ged once i turn 17 which i have told my truancy officer. I thought I was doing better she and everyone told me i’m doing better but she’s trying to get a release of information from my therapist which seems extremely intrusive and i’m honestly regretting ever being honest with my therapists again. I just started to open up about things to my therapist because I want to better myself but it feels like i’m being treated like a criminal for being confused on what I needed to do for attendance during a global pandemic when the instructions and expectations have been constantly changing and have been consistently vague. Are they even allowed to just put me on truancy without a warning? Are they allowed to get a release of information from my therapist? The paper i signed for truancy only said they were allowed to get info from my school. That was the only box that was checked. I feel like relapsing i haven’t gotten thoughts like this in a long time i feel awful about myself and everything. Shame on me for trying to get help. Any effort i put in isn’t enough. I’m literally dropping out the second i’m old enough to. I will attend school until then but I have no interest whatsoever in doing credit recovery or finishing high school. The school system has made me feel worthless my entire life and this is probably the worst it’s been. I am trying so hard to make things right to get out of this program as soon as possible but the fact that this lady is trying to get a release of information from my therapist honestly just doesn’t seem right. I am trying to get better but I don’t even want to anymore. I am so mentally exhausted I wish I was normal I wish none of this ever happened. I want it to all go away this is making me feel like i’m not getting better anymore i don’t feel like getting better anymore i don’t want any of this. I’ve barely been eating or sleeping. I’m being pushed into a depressive episode and I feel like i’m loosing control again. I was so hopeful for the rest of this year before this. I’ve seriously started improving so much with myself but after this all happened I started lashing out again and have been having panic attacks and less and less care for myself. I just wish I could have control over this. I hate being underage it feels like my life is in the governments hands. It feels like I have no control over what’s going to happen to me."
449,I fucking hate my life.,"I don't know what to do anymore. Everyday is crying, severe stress and suffering, I harmed myself again after I had stopped for months. Shitty sleep schedule. Phone addiction, unproductiveness, time waste, and on top that being in love. I am uneasy 24 fucking 7!

Every time I love someone I end up getting hurt, and it is MY FAULT, not theirs. I have very unstable relationships, meaning I probably love everyone 10x more than they love me, and it is tormenting, because my brain creates unrealistic expectations to my friendships etc. 

Sometimes I just want to say fuck having family and friends, smash my phone, delete all social media and isolate myself from this world. I can't love anyone more, because it always hurts me (and that's MY fault, let me make that clear)."
450,How long does abandonment trauma last?,"The first time I was abandoned, it hit me incredibly hard because I was already at an unprecedented low point, had very few resources, and was very unprepared in terms of mental health awareness in how to navigate such things. It turned all of my outward resentment inward, and resulted in excessive self loathing and feelings of worthlessness.

Then in short succession, it happened again. Then over the next two years or so, it happened several more times. To varying degrees of severity, I'd say it happened about 9 times. Each one left a mark, though particularly the 3rd and 5th, and 6th. The 5th was the most painful experience of my life.

I've had periods of enthusiasm and concerted efforts, but each day that I feel exhausted I return to the same old place. The more effected I feel, the less capable and worthy I am of pursuing new connections.

I've used dating apps/sites for about a year, from mid 2019 to mid 2020. I've also occasionally responded to other personal listings and such. I know these matters are pretty dramatically different between men and women, but although I haven't literally kept count I'd say I probably messaged some 150-200 people. For my own profile on rare occasion someone would message me first, but it only happened a handful of times. On several of those the girls lived extremely far away, and it never amounted to anything anyway.

At a certain point, adding up the congruence of evidence, I came to the conclusion that I must be generally perceived as a very low value person. I'm not really sure why though.

Sometimes when people talk about abandonment or rejection, within a short interaction it's fairly easy to see why others don't want to be around them. Maybe they're aggressive, resentful, have disorders or addictions, are disrespectful or emotionally erratic, boring, unattractive, self-absorbed, some repellent trait. Others aren't so immediately obvious, though after a good amount of time their flaws become more apparent. Others sabotage themselves. They complain about being lonely, but dismiss or avoid opportunities for connection. It's like being hungry, but also being extremely picky about where and what you'll eat.

I don't really know what my repellent trait is. I have theories, but I can't apply those theories to others as they're not repellent to me. When I encounter someone similar to myself of the opposite sex, I'm usually attracted to them earnestly. I can only assume it's something regarding the dichotomy of the sexes, that I can't ever put myself in a woman's position to see things from her point of view because men and women relate to each other differently and the same standards don't apply. If I go too far down that route though, it leads me vaguely toward a sexist mindset, and that's something I don't want to pursue.

From what I hear from women though, they typically have the opposite experience. Their dating profiles are overloaded with messages, even if they're pretty unremarkable, even if their lives are a mess and they possess many of the negative traits they condemn in others - even if their profile doesn't even have a picture.

I became so exhausted by these trends that for awhile I stopped altogether. During my break, I focused on improving myself, so as to raise my value, and I've made a fair amount of progress. Then as of late, I've gently tip-toed back into it, but even with the lightest attempts I see the same old patterns. I feel too jaded to go back to my initial idealism and determination. The people who really hurt me, the way they've treated me I'd never treat anyone else, and I prove that through my actions. I'm conditioned to all of my investments abruptly going poof, to patience not paying off, to low-quality people. I'm used to taking the high road, while everyone else takes the low. I don't feel as if my energy will ever replenish, but maybe at best see periods of optimism, followed by cynicism at being proven wrong again.

I guess I'm just sick of every day that I feel less capable, I'm taken back to the same old place. People can't exist in a constant state of recovery.

I recall Tara Reade, the woman who was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, claimed that her experience stuck with her for now almost 20 years after. That it wasn't just his actions, but his words ""you're nothing to me"" that caused her trauma. I can relate to that. I know that how I feel and what I think don't matter to those people, that in their minds they're better off without me. I know that it's not the physical setting that impacts us, but the way those situations made us feel. It's knowing you're nothing, that you don't have value, and that even the best you can do or the most you can give isn't worth it. That's what sticks with you."
451,I feel like I'm in my thirties living with my parent without a job but I'm 16?,"I feel like I'm a lazy adult living with my parent in my late twenties to thirties not doing anything with my life but I'm 16. 

I feel like a failure and like i need to provide for myself but I'm only 16. 

I feel like I'm desperately holding onto whatever bit of my childhood is left and wanting it to come back and stay with me. I'm still technically a kid. Idk why i feel this way. I can't enjoy my childhood and haven't for years. it feels gone."
452,Why do I hit myself without thinking when I get upset?,"Whenever I get upset, like, genuinely upset about something, I always end up hitting myself or hurting myself in some way and for around 30 seconds it’s all I can think about doing. The thing that usually triggers this is someone in my family getting mad at me/me presuming they are mad at me or them yelling at me. I usually end up breaking down immediately, sobbing and yelling at myself and then hitting myself, or burning myself if i am in the kitchen. It’s honestly horrifying how little control I have over the thoughts I get during these instances and how hard I hit myself. Today it happened again, though this time it was because I slept through an online doctors appointment. I couldn’t stop yelling at myself for being a failure and never doing anything right, and I slapped myself so hard and so much that I have a bit of a black eye.

The fact that I even hit myself is strange to me. It’s like I blank out and freak out and hurt myself. I don’t know what could be causing me to do this. I do have GAD and was previously diagnosed with severe MDD and dysthymia, though the latter of the two have improved drastically since starting thyroid medication. 

I have some trauma from my mom emotionally abusing me (and her overdosing multiple times) and I still live with her as I am still struggling a lot mentally. Is that what is causing this? It feels like a completely different response than when I’m having a panic attack or a depressive episode; it almost feels like dissociation, and it always ends with me hurting myself in some way."
453,Unfortunate and most agonizing breakup causing me to lose everything,"Hi All, 

Please forgive me if something like this have already been as I was unable to find the relevant post.

Please bear with me while I write this:

28\[M\] met this girl and we hit if off right off the bat and slowly we ended up moving together. Even though we were very different in a lot of ways but we still got along fine and then comes time where we both were ready to move on to the next stage (marriage). I started planning everything, bought the ring etc. Since we are from brown families, we both need approval from the families before going ahead. Considering we both live in a western country but we still are very close to our families even though both sides are in 2 different countries. The talk began and the religious and cultural differences were a concern from both sides and ultimately we were forced to be separated.   
I know a lot will say it shouldn't concern anyone else but you two. The only difference is that we both have a lot of respect and feelings for our families and we can't really afford to lose them and due to that we had to go our separate ways unwillingly as we both know that it will not work out with our current circumstances.

The issue I am having is that it's been nearly 3 weeks and I cannot focus on anything, constant headaches, migraines and absolutely no sleep. I have been eating healthy and on time and working out regularly. Physically I am in a good spot as I am working out 4-5 days a week and eating measured diet. I am just worried about work because the job I currently have, is amazing and I can't afford to lose it but concentration is near impossible at this stage and I fear if this keeps up, I am bound to make mistakes which will ultimately cause me to lose my job. Unfortunately I have close to no friends as I burned off those bridges ages ago when I got in this relationship as I was doing a lot of things with her so I basically had no time left (spent other time on my hobbies instead of hanging out with people). Another issue is that I have zero relatives or family members in this country so basically no one that can actually guide or listen to me. Furthermore, I don't drink at all (no smoke or any hard stuff) so meeting people at bars etc. is literally out of the question. I am quite limited to a lot of things too where I have opportunities to meet other people such as rock climbing, hike tours, sports, the only reason why I can't do any of that is because I tore my ACL in a wrestling class and I am still waiting for surgery and no one like a whiner when you go out.

That is what brought me to reddit in hope for some useful advice that may help ease some of the pain.

Thanks !"

I have good friends and am always there for them making sure they are okay and discussing their issues but I think when it comes to me the way I present myself may make them think im always okay. I often bring up my mental state and how I feel in that moment and not many words are said. I think mainly its cause they don't know what to say or it could be that they think its not as serious as it is. Has anyone here gone to therapy? What was your experience how did it benefit you??

461,"I have symptoms and alters, but I don't have the trauma to have DID, help? //tw s*icidal thoughts"," First of all, I am NOT looking for a diagnosis, just suggestions. I am very confused about myself, so I am just making this post, I'm so so sorry if these kinds of posts aren't allowed, if needed to, I will take this down and post it elsewhere. I just thought that this subreddit can maybe help.

Alright, so. When I was 8 years old, I lost a very good friend(he didn't die, but he left my life) and ever since then I thought he left my life because I was an awful friend who didn't treat him right. When I turned 9 and went into 4th grade, I had s\*icidal depression because of that. I thought that my friends actually hated me, and were only hanging out with me for pity. I would daydream about s\*icide every day during class. I was close to attempting it too a couple times.

I call that period of my life, ""The Bad Times"" and I made that part of myself a character. Instead of moving on from the Bad Times, i just, let them come with me and grow and evolve alongside me. When I have a meltdown, I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel like I have become a 9 year old me again, or at least he is influencing my actions and emotions. When I am him again, I feel very very s\*icidal, when usually I just feel, empty.

Over the summer, I actually became him again. It was a nightmare, and I really was 9 year old me again. From outfits to personality, I was back in The Bad Times again for that dream.

When I woke up, I had a panic attack, and felt as if 9 year old me was, close. Like I was close to becoming him again. It was a very traumatic nightmare.

So that is alter(?) number 1. My second one has a more active role in my life.

When I was 11, I decided to try to turn my life around from s\*icidal thoughts. And how would I do that without a therapist? Well I bullied myself whenever I had s\*icidal thoughts or whenever I had a meltdown, but in a calming and soothing way. The reason why I bullied myself to make myself stop being so sad, is because from a young age, I was bullied for crying. Fellow students, some teachers, and even my mom at one point. So I think 11 year old me internalized that being sad is weak and bullied myself whenever I was.

Bullying myself out of s\*icidal thoughts worked, but only temporarily. Rather recently, I am starting to have more meltdowns, and whenever I do, I start to dissociate, and a motherly like figure takes over my body. She tries to calm me, but in a harmful way. She'll say stuff like, ""Calm down (my name), you're being too loud. No one wants to hear your crying, so shut up. You're being so annoying right now."" She does end up soothing me, and stopping my meltdown, so when I stop crying and calm down, she kinda, goes back to sleep in my head, as if I woken her up with my crying. And i regain control.

The mother's name is Helen, and she only interacts with me when I'm crying. She was abused in her past, and she doesn't know how to deal with it, so she takes it out on me. Me bullying myself out of crying when I was 11 gave birth to her. She is my 2nd alter(?).

I even feel 9 year old me and Helen just, watching me. Staring down at me.

The reason why I don't have DID is because I don't have the necessary trauma for it. It may not seem like it from this post, but I never actually experienced abuse. Or if I did, it was no where near repetitive enough for me to have DID. And the ""traumatic"" stuff happened after I was 7. Also, the alters are pretty recent (2 years old for 9 year old me, and maybe a few months for Helen?), so there is no way a childhood alter just took all of my traumatic memories as a child.

I am just, so confused on what's wrong with me. I really need something to describe what's going on with me, because DID is out of the question because of the trauma stuff. I will also say that I have Maladaptive Daydreaming, so maybe what I'm having is a super weird symptom of that?"
462,my body is still breathing but my brain is basically garbage. I dont know what to do.,"my title says it all. ive been genuinely mentally ill and out of my mind for about 2 or so years. I'm still alive you know, im breathing but I can barely think. I started smoking pot when I was like 13, drinking excessively from 17 to now. I was prescribed Adderall and took that a bunch, Messed around with psychs but nothing too crazy.and other than that ive abused just about every substance besides the dirty ones like black tar herion etc. and have fallen into Xanax in the past and crave that and alcohol alot. the holy trinity of my devilish demise is xannax, weed and alcohol in that order. however these substances suck but I KNOW all of this isn't necessarily drug induced because before I got deep into Xanax and alcohol I was always depressed and suicical ever since 15. I think tasing Adderall basically everyday really fucked up my dopamine. the nail in my coffin of this demented brain I live in was taking saris. ever since I took them I have been so incredibly suicidal and haven't felt legitametly good ever since then. I was pretty happy on them I think, I defiantly didn't have as much old or intrusive thoughts telling me to kill myself every 15 minutes but I remember them making more depressed towards the end. I genuinely do not remember anything of 2018. I know I went to Thailand and was in college but as far as like actually remembering its a depressed foggy SSRI haze. those things are lobotomizing garbage that ruined my life by decreasing my pituitary gland, lowering my testosterone and fucking with my testosterone. taking them was the worst mistake of my life. I also have a few concussions, I have ptsd, 3 concussions, Bi polar type 2 and MDD. MDD is the one ive gotten everytimeee time. I have genuinely never met some one as absolutely out of their mind and depressed as me. I am constantly tortured daily by my brain

idk im rambling, I have lots of other issues I haven't named. but man do I feel basically like shit every single fucking day. my life a fucking nightmare and my brain is grey matter of pure depression really. the only thing im looking forward to is working some mundane job, buying a camper and then killing myself in 19 years when I officially won't really have an affect on any one. 

&amp;#x200B;

after reading this I dont know what the point in this is but im still gonna post anyway until someone sane takes it down. basically im like past the point of depression and living in my depressed brain that doesn't even fuxcking work is just exhausting. fuck this. sometimes suicide is genuinely a good option for someone such as myself"
463,Is it normal for a doctor to ask these questions on the first visit?,"I just saw a GP a few days ago for mental health issues and he asked me a number of questions in such a condescending tone that I actually found it offensive.

GP: do you think you have depression
Me: my old psychologist diagnosed me. (Persistent depressive disorder)
GP: but do YOU think you have depression? 
Me: (confused)
GP:*smirking*
.........
GP: so, What do you want me to do?
Me: ummmm... I kinda assumed you'd know what to do.
GP: You just came in here a few minutes ago, I just met you and you're telling me you have depression.
(I was told by my counselor to tell him that)
Me: *silent*
.........
GP: so hows your relationship with your parents
Me: we're not close (my psychologist said my mum was emotionally abusive and there was a lot if beatings growing up but I didnt tell him) 
GP: so your adopted, and your parents migrated with you here and you're telling me you have a bad relationship with them? 
Me: it was my sibling who brought me here....
........
At this point I just didn't want to talk anymore cause I felt like he didnt believe me or most of my stories.
I just let him prescribe me medication and I left without asking any questions. He told me to come back this week but to be honest, Im too scared now.
He was sighing, smirking and his body language and facial expression looked like he was done with my shit.

It was a walk in clinic and it was my first time meeting him."

It feels like my problems and emotions pale in comparison to theirs and that I have no right to be upset because of it, I should be happy because I am lucky. This happens every single time without fail, it feels like my friend deliberately does it for attention now( I know that makes me sound like a terrible person but this has been happening for nearly 2 years) then they proceed to say “oh hey y/n you seem to get bothers easily recently” as if they don’t know. I’ve told them about this and how they always one up me but it keeps on happening and I always feel like a burden to them, only making their problems worse by existing. I’ve tried talking to my parents about my problems and how I feel but it feels like they just brush them off and ultimately undermine the extent/intensity of it and act like it’s no big deal when it is for me. Such a thing is intrusive thoughts I’ve been betting them very frequently recently about stuff like hating myself, self harm and suicide. The self harm thing has also started to manifest physically.. when I get very upset I just want to claw my skin off, bite myself,punch myself, just do something to make me feel, to punish myself and to let my emotions out in a way that doesn’t upset or harm other people and be more of a burden I already am. This has led me to feeling like no one cares or gives enough of a shit about me to properly just hear what I have to say. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s gotten to the point where I just don’t tell anyone because like hell it’s going to do anything or matter to them. Not even my parents will listen or let me tell them what’s going on without groaning about how I’m just rambling on and it’s nothing."
465,CRISIS text line just made me feel worse...,"I’m having .... a bad day- I texted the CRISIS line and the person made me feel worse.  Dropping that “only you can make change in your life” etc stuff.  But that only gets you part of the way.  It doesn’t take into account outside forces.  The person wasn’t budging.  And it made me feel worse/ more isolated bc I never feel understood. 


I can’t make other people care about me
I can’t make a job give me more money
I can’t make rent more affordable 

I do not have the control over other peoples choices so how is the change only on me?

I get what they were meaning 
But it’s also frustrating and things are not that black and white 


Anyway I had to stop the convo bc I was getting way way worse and fast.  


I don’t know what to do now.  I don’t have anyone to talk to- reached out to a couple ppl (even tho that is really hard for me) anyway and (of course) crickets 


Sorry just having a bad day and wanted to vent....
I dunno

466,I’m scared of living,"I (25F) don’t know where to start off....but I just don’t have the courage to make any actions. I feel like living is a task for every single day.

I have no career goals( I’m scared of them), and I have no hope for the future.

I remembered in middle school my dad past away from alcohol/ heart problems, and my grandparents past away in high school. Really just took a lot away from me. And my mom is a really strong woman, but she was emotionally unavailable for me. And now she’s also trying to help me and I feel so guilty for that. And when my friends reach out to me I dodge them...because i don’t want my negativity to effect them. 

I cut all my friends off, because I don’t want my negativity and depression to effect them. I hold on to so many negative energy and I can’t let go of them. And I hate myself for that. I don’t focus on the positives, and I just deeply always think of the negatives. 

I’m hypertensive towards the energy around me, I’m easily effected by them.

Thanks for reading my post, and I just feel like I need to get this off my chest."
467,I’m really anxious please help... worried I’m interested in a fake person possibly...,"


It’s about this woman I’ve been talking to. What if she’s only *acting* interested for attention? 😳

We’ve been talking since around the summer on and off. I posted this on /r/nostupidquestions and some guy told me I was spazzing. Then another said;

&gt; Ugh you posted this question in 3 places! You’re definitely spazzing! 

I tried explaining I wasn’t spazzing and I was a bit anxious. They obviously didn’t listen. I realized I was obviously wasting my time with them, deleted the post, and blocked them all. The guy also said ‘people usually can’t tell if people are into you’ or whatever. Before I deleted the post, I asked what he was talking about, then realized it wasn’t worth it.

So here we get to the details. Yesterday we talked about mindfulness. She said it’s a great tool and she tries to be mindful often. I thought that was a polite statement and I felt she was being genuine. I told her I understood, mindfulness is great, she’s a beautiful soul trying to be genuine, and we should continue our conversation sometime. 

I was anxious after that. I was at work and I *definitely* didn’t feel like talking to anyone, so I did some outside tasks while breathing. I felt like I couldn’t calm down, but after awhile of being present and mindful, breathing through the nose, I felt better. 

I will say I was/am *terrified* of saying something weird, dumb, or creepy to her. Anxiety 101 right? Then I slowly remembered we’ve been chatting since the summer I think. There was a time when she didn’t reply to my messages but replied she was busy, but later on gave me signals I feel that she was interested.

* She invited me over and gave me her number.
* She winked at me.
* She raised her eyebrows and acted excited to see me.
* When I finally got the courage to call her, she said to hit her up anytime.
Sigh. I think this is some decent evidence she’s interested. A few days ago my housemate invited her with my phone, we’re both drunk, and she seemed pretty excited. So a few days later was when I messaged her saying she’s a beautiful soul.

What do you think? I realize if she isn’t interested that’s the harsh reality, but I felt like she was. Then I was contemplating who goes from telling someone to hit them up anytime to being turned off or uninterested? It’s also not like I was messaging her everyday. I also realized because she doesn’t reply it doesn’t necessarily mean she’s ignoring me right? She could be nervous."
468,Struggling after a breakup. I feel like I’m not making progress fml.,"
I broke up with my boyfriend of three years a couple months ago. He ghosted me for 10 days and it’s happened before and I couldn’t take it anymore... it was basically a toxic relationship and I still feel guilty for ending it. During that time, my chest was hurting like a mf, crying all the time, not eating well at all. After the breakup for about two months, I was still struggling...not eating much, isolating myself, all that. My doctor gave me antidepressants (bupropion) but I decided not to take it because of the side effects. 

Now, I really feel like I need to be placed on them because I just can’t stop fucking crying and feeling like shit. Every little thing fucking triggers me and I can’t seem to get away. I keep looking at social media and I keep looking if his family still follows me and I think they did on Facebook and idk why it’s triggering me. I feel like I’m not making any progress towards recovery. I’m not even happy about getting into grad school I’m not happy. I don’t like doing shit anymore.. I don’t go on walks or ride my bike anymore I don’t want to be near people. My parents are eating dinner and I’m in my room crying. I don’t know what to do. I hate feeling like this. I keep posting my story on another sub Reddit because I just need that constant validation that I made the right decision. It’s such toxic behavior of mine and I need to stop but I don’t know how.

469,Can someone explain to me what bipolar ii and schizotypal/effective disorders are and how they are different from depression/anxiety?,"I’m depressed and have general anxiety.

470,"I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life, and I feel as though I may suffer from anxiety","I, Male 26, from the outside may look as though my life is going well, I managed to get a well paying job, during the pandemic, albeit covering maternity but needs must (for context my field of employment is laboratory work, and I live on my own and pay my own bills). But inwardly I feel overwhelmed by life, with work I feel not organised enough to maintain employment, but not for lack of trying, I constantly feel tired, however the shift patterns are 7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm and 11pm- 7am, with a shift pattern which changes between them every so many days. It could potentially be my diet, but its hard to be motivated, to make something nutritious when you get home after midnight. I don't feel as though I can talk to family about it, as I'm usually the person they talk to when they have issues, so I have to be strong for them. I'm constantly thinking about things that happened at work when trying to sleep, as my work can directly affect the production of the site in which I work, so I'm always second guessing myself. Also I've previously worked in one place, where I had to second guess every thing I said and did, and said to ensure nothing came back on me. I feel as though it's only a matter of time before I lose this job too. I feel as though laboratory work may not necessarily be for me, despite my genuine enthusiasm for anything scientific, however I've been doing it since I was 19 and because I don't have a degree, or much experience in any other field (as it started as a work experience placement), that I don't have much choice but maintain this field of work."
471,An admittedly not so brief retelling of my life until this point (but I gave up 2/3 of the way and stopped just before my time in university.) Life advice? Opinions?,"I’m still in a bit of a rut, emotionally and situationally, and while my more recent troubles after a wide range of things that are more obvious to change, I can’t change the past.

This is really long. You don’t have to read it, I just felt like sharing with someone who doesn’t know me. I’m not someone worth a biography, but I would really appreciate it if someone read this. TW for suicide, assault, life in general.

So.

An admittedly not so brief retelling of my life until this point (but I gave up 2/3 of the way and stopped just before my time in university.)

	I was born on a Friday, removed from the womb of my mother at 8:05 in the morning by the means of a cesarean section.

	Apparently, I had a lot of ear infections as a child. For the first year of my life, I cried, constantly. It wasn’t until I had tubes put in that I was able to achieve some relief. On my first birthday, I walked.

	Apparently I developed fairly rapidly from that point on, drawing, talking, and learning to read. My mother played addition and subtraction games with me early on in life. The first drawing I was told about was a picture of my older sister. I had drawn it on the wall with a pencil—my parents were so proud that they took a picture with their disposable camera before removing it and explaining that I shouldn’t write or draw on the walls or furniture.

	Apparently I was rambunctious and constantly getting into things I shouldn’t. No baby gate or fence could contain me when I became curious about something. I had my head pinned between a gate and the floor, or the wall, or the stairs, on multiple occasions. I even fell down the stairs a few times, having snuck past when someone didn’t pay full attention. I probably fell down a few times even when they were, as I was a clumsy child.

	One time, though I am not certain of the age, my sister, doing her duties as my elder, took my rocking chair when watching a movie. Being the brilliant mind I was, I retrieved a wooden chair from our craft table.  Upon rocking back in it—and this is why parents and teachers constantly scold you for doing so—I tipped a little too far backwards and collided with the glass coffee table behind me. I sliced my head open, and my father, forever the “don’t-be-a-sissy” proclaimer, insisted to my mother that I was fine... until she removed her hand from the back of my head and it was covered in blood. I required seventeen stitches, put second in line at the emergency room to a man who lost a fight to a chainsaw. I’m glad I don’t remember that hospital visit.

	I went to a methodist preschool and did gymnastics and dance, not unlike other children, though my family wasn’t particularly religious, my father having abandoned Judaism before his bar mitzvah after his grandfather died. His father did so as well. My pediatrician insisted upon me getting tested for gifted after noting certain advancements, given my sister had done so when she was in third grade. All I remember the doctor saying was that I had hidden the hands behind someone’s back in a drawing, and, when asked why, I replied that I wasn’t good at drawing hands—a struggle many artists relate to, I’m aware. I did notice that I was reading chapter books in kindergarten, unlike my classmates, because I had discovered a magnetic poetry board, upon which I created a short story and showed my teacher. She asked if I could read it to her, and I promptly said sure, I wrote it after all. I tested into the “genius” IQ levels when we got around to it that year. I don’t remember the test, but I did start crying when we were doing some mathematic equations during it. The proctor reassured me that it was okay and that it was fairly advanced. I received an invitation to MENSA, and my mother, after researching it, threw it out. I started taking pull out gifted glasses with the first-third grade students for the rest of the year, before transferring to a gifted magnet school before first grade. I attended that school for the remainder of my elementary years.

	I had good friendships in preschool, though none of them have lasted. I did recover one of them in high school, which I’ll discuss later, but she turned out to be an enemy more than anything. Another friend was the younger sister of my older sister’s friend. We did a lot together because of that, but it became apparent that their dad was a bit of a mean drunk and her mother apparently had a drug habit that eventually came back with a vengeance. We stopped going over there, and, slowly, they stopped coming over here, too.

	I did make a best friend in kindergarten, as I had slowly lost contact with the two I made in preschool. She and I were as thick as thieves—after a riveting confrontation with an older boy on the playground, in which I called him a jerk after he insulted her. Gasp. The funny thing is, if I recall correctly, neither she nor I liked one another when we first were placed at the same table in class. We played a lot together, but her family was honestly weird. For some reason, we played “doctor” a lot, especially after looking up GGW on the rare thing that was the internet back then. I think her older brother was the one that told her about Gone Wild, but I’m not sure. It wasn’t really playing doctor—it was quite lewd and we knew it, having invented some perverse scenarios that would make the BDSM community blush. I think we were caught a few times and made to apologize, though we had both discovered that grinding felt good. I’m not sure who introduced that situation to the other, and, should it have been me, I am deeply ashamed. It could have, as I remember playing similar games with my female cousins of roughly the same age, occasionally, though hazily, blended in with my grandmother somewhat innocently playing in what might not have been so innocent ways. If it were her that did, I hope that she is okay. I remember her peeing on our floor simply because she didn’t feel like getting up to go to the bathroom, and I know that is prevalent in kids that were sexually abused. Her brother was a strange kid, and I always remembered feeling off around her uncle that lived down the street from them. I stopped playing with her after third grade, and we occasionally talked in high school because we had some of the same classes. She started dropping ecstasy and acid with her brother around then. She seems nice enough, though.

	That stimulating behavior stayed with me, and, probably around first grade, my mother took me to the doctor out of concern, not that I blame her. The doctor said it was pretty normal and didn’t mean I was being abused or whatever she told my mother. My mother made me stop, which turned it into an activity of shame. This shame has stayed with me even until now, though I know masturbation and sex is healthy and normal. I still did it in secret, and I’m sure that she knew, and probably knew I knew. That was a huge part of what made my family—not sharing things and putting up fronts.

	In first grade, I definitely made a solid friend group, who did the normal things like birthday parties, playing make believe during recess, fighting over who got to be the main character in said games. The group unfortunately got split up the next year, and all of my friends—the “popular” girls, one could say, though we were eight—went to one teacher and I went to another. It was supposedly random, but apparently the principal had received the soccer mom equivalent of bribes. If there is one thing you learn at a gifted magnet school, it is that all of the mothers are Karens. Trust no one. Sadly, my family has a habit, which is usually not a bad one, to trust others and believe that they are being as open to you as you are to them. This has lead my father into one horrible business partnership, my mother into some lingering feelings of guilt that she let me or my sister down, and my sister and I into some heartbreaking friendships.

	All in all, second grade was alright. I made friends with a girl who had a rough home life and a tragically ill brother, a boy that was allergic to everything under the sun, and two people who would continue on to attempt to wreck my life in one way or another—“Hillary” and “Kate”. Our teacher was mean, but we survived—though it did help that the summer before, we got a tiny little dog named “Baby” that the teacher loved. By third grade, the classes were mixed up again, and I resumed a friendship with my previous friend group and was finally able to successfully make it through the night at a sleepover.

	In fourth grade, Hillary already started planting her seeds of hatred. She and I had to work on a project together, and we had two strongly opposing opinions on something menial. We ended up going with my opinion, as I was able to prove to her it was the more accurate representation of this small detail of our project through pictures, but apparently that was enough fuel to kindle a flame she held for years, unbeknownst to me. She was nice otherwise, and we remained friends. I stayed the night at her house once, which was fine except that they made me sleep on the floor with a decorative pillow and no blanket, and we weren’t allowed to be awake or about the house before 9 am. I have no explanation for that and it still confounds me to this day.

	In fifth grade, she and Kate tried to start some drama about the freshly made cookies my mother would make for me to share during lunch every morning. They didn’t believe my mother would make them before school, for whatever reason, and continued to harass me about it until my mother stopped by once and told them that she did, in fact, make them that morning when one of them asked her. As a response, Kate told me that “they,” meaning the friend group, didn’t actually like me. 

	At some point in the year, I was swinging on the playground and lost consciousness. I landed in the tire pit beneath the swings, meant to cushion a fall, but, unfortunately, there was a hidden piece of the old school’s foundation left over from when they moved the historic building. I concussed myself on it and was out for several minutes. I continued to pass out once a year until tenth grade for medically reasons never discovered. After that year, most of my friends went to an art magnet for middle school or the local middle school. Kate and I actually went to a different local middle school because of the district lines (which were and are very strange.)
	
	This middle school was a terrible school. I was going to go to a private school, but my dad, with his attitude being what it was, insisted that I attend school with normal people to get a life experience. Oh boy, did I get one. This school was mostly attended by navy brats or bussed in from low income neighborhoods with failing schools. There was significant gang activity, bomb threats, pre-teen pregnancies, fighting, and just about everything under the sun. Now, Kate and I, having been in gifted, were mostly separated from the rest of the school in a small building that housed the special ed and gifted classes. It was a weird setting—only seven students were in my classes by the ended of eighth grade, outside of gym and computer lab. Aside from the glaring issues in this environment, we also had bizarre teachers and unfair treatment.
	
	In middle school, I avoided Kate for the most part because of her weird stance in fifth grade. She and I, however, did make friends with a hippie and a girl named “Daphne”, who would go on to be my academic “rival” in every sense of the word aside from the lack of true competition between us. Daphne loved being the top student and achieving, and loved letting others know that just as much. She and I, however, had the exact same GPA throughout middle and high school since we had the same courses, though she ultimately came out a few hundredths of a point in front of me senior year, as she took an extra class online. More power to her—I just didn’t want to get anything less than an A because I was terrified I’d disappoint my parents. For the most part, Daphne wasn’t a main player on my stage, and neither was Kate. It was the three girls I befriended to avoid Kate that changed me.

	 These girls were, or at least thought they were, more worldly than I was. From thinking they could pass as high schoolers to being very interested in boys and alleged parties, they were mean girls down to the letter. “Katrina” was the leader who had an older cousin I developed a crush on in gym class, “Jake.” Her second in command was named “Natasha,” who did martial arts and wore her sexuality like a sword to ward off anyone who accused her of being a lesbian due to her more developed muscles. The third, and who was just as much a victim of them as she was a follower, was “Meghan.” Her being subjected to their manipulation doesn’t excuse her, but, for what it is worth, she did eventually apologize.

	Katrina and Natasha had been friends since elementary school, while Meghan had just moved to the state. They were the type of girls people liked because they made you feel like you had to prove yourself to them. I’m not sure why, maybe it’s in the blood of gifted students or maybe it is just a trait of middle school students, but it seemed like everyone was a sycophant to some degree and their manipulative personalities were like nectar.

	The bullying and puppeteering began almost right away. It started when one of the special ed students, a girl a bit older than us, developed a crush on me. It was obsessive, and while I wasn’t really opposed to flirting with girls, I was extremely uncomfortable. They began writing fake love letters to her in response to her inappropriate drawings of me and notes that she’d leave in my locker. They probably made some of the letters themselves, but I wouldn’t know. It was encouraging her and they forced me to hug her. It eventually got to be a bit scary, as she stared at me from the hall through the windows in the classroom doors. I think I had to get the assistant principal involved in order to get it all to stop. She never truly stopped, but the majority of the behaviors did. This all pushed me into a weird depressive state, though I don’t know if it was truly depression them. I started to self harm and found peace in the “emo” scene, though not really a part of an emo group. I was still in the trio’s friend group, and they listened to the same music but wore Hollister over Hot Topic. I did make friends with a boy, in a different grade, who threatened to kill himself if I stopped talking to him. Eventually I got out of that toxic friendship, not before he blamed me for what happened in seventh grade, and lo!—and behold! He is still kicking to this date.
	
	Seventh grade. The year things changed. I always had big boobs, even back then. It was either the source of unwanted attention or jealous teasing. However, I wasn’t unattractive, though the braces and zebra skinny jeans probably didn’t enhance anything about my appearance. But seventh grade, my crush on Katrina’s cousin, Jake, took flight. After embarrassing interactions and a weird skateboarding attempt, he asked me out. I was, of course, thrilled. We went on a date—a bike ride on the beach—and I had my first kiss. It was very gross, wet, and his breath reminded me of dog food. Still, I was excited. I really did like him. The next day at school, his friend texted me and told me that the relationship was over. The devastation set in, but things weren’t too horrible—yet. A week or two later, he asks me on a date again to talk, same place. We ride our bikes and we stop near a public rest area with facilities, though it was mostly abandoned. It was near a beach, so we were wearing swimsuits.

	Jake explained to me that he wanted to date other girls first, because I was “really special” and seemed more like a long term girlfriend. There was high school for that, after all, right? I think I knew it was bullshit then, too, but I let myself want to believe him. More dog food kisses. Then things turned less innocent. It started raining, so we ran for cover in the women’s restroom. He insisted on taking off my top. I didn’t let him, but eventually, it was off. I had cuts on my arm and I remember eating for him to see them, and maybe he’d stop. He didn’t. We heard a noise, and ran into a stall. He locked it, and stuck his hand into my swim bottoms. I felt like passing out. I told him I was going to pass out. He took off his clothes and grabbed my hand, stroking himself with it, before forcing me own onto his lap, but I kept my swim bottoms on. He wanted more, and kept pushing for more, but I was crying and saying no at that point, claiming I was sick and needed to go home. I couldn’t see clearly, I needed to go home.

	I was redressed and quiet and was mostly home when my mother pulled her car up near me. Apparently I was out pretty late with him, and so she wanted me to get in and go home. I did, and he went off to his house. My mother felt something was off but I didn’t tell her. She would have been even more made if I had told her. Jake and I didn’t talk again, except for once, when Meghan messaged him through my facebook about the incident—some penis joke only middle schoolers would find amusing, after I confessed to my friends what happened, but no one believed me—and he messaged back, insulted, and saying that he could have raped me if he wanted and I should be thankful. At some point, I attempted to overdose on OTC painkillers, particularly after the suicidal boy told me that I was a (choice word) that deserved it when I reached out to him for support. I regretted it immediately, called poison control on myself, who called my mother. I took the SAT the next day, as part of Duke TIP, and received a decent score, despite shaking and vomiting during every restroom break. Eventually, the guidance counsellor contacted my mother about cuts that someone spotted on my arm, and I went to therapy maybe three times. I hated it and cried the entire time while the therapist told me I was an attention seeker.

	Our friendship ended when the girls told me that I should kill myself and that I wasn’t allowed to sit near them, walk with them, or talk to them ever again.

	In ninth grade, the self harming took off, and I was covered in shallow cuts at one point. My mother, who screamed at me more than she didn’t at that point, eventually got into an argument with me, likely about how I was trying to make her miserable or that I didn’t care enough to please them, and then I showed her my legs. She made me show my dad, who then started making me go on these evening walks with him. I lost all support from my friends, as I no longer had my phone. My mother didn’t like my friend group—filled with gay guys and goths—and thought they were the cause of my anxiety and stress, despite the fact that I was under constant pressure to perform for my family and make them happy. I didn’t have a plan set in life other than pleasing them, like my older sister. I still don’t have a plan.

	Some kid in my class took a photo from facebook (of my face) and shared it to a NSFW subreddit. I had to go onto all these porn websites and ask for them to take my picture down, so that was kind of scarring.

	Eventually, I changed friend groups to drama kids and choir, but before I did, I had one incident with one girl who had a crush on me. She showed up to my house with a knife, twice, wanting to see me. At first, I was okay with it and even receptive of her flirtation—then identifying as pansexual, though I later learned I’m just not into girls. Then she told me that she killed cats for fun. Then things just went very downhill fast and I cut all ties to her, not before she threw something at me and broke my cheekbone and told the GSA teacher that my parents were homophobes. 

	After that year, things were mostly okay. My best friend for ninth and tenth grade and I were super close. Only when a former elementary school classmate of mine attended our school and became a part of our friend group did that change, as she decided she wanted the attention from my friend. She had a baby right out of high school, and my best friend came back to me towards the end of senior year, so there wasn’t that much of an issue over all, just weird. My junior year, I dated a boy a year older who was too inexperienced to deliberately be an asshole, but things did not work out. It doesn’t help that I was strict about not having a physical relationship. I, much to the chagrin of preschool-friend-turned-foe, became the school’s pageant queen, to which she launched a smear campaign in response. She apparently was convinced that the title was hers.

	Aside from having the title in junior year, I was very close to Hilary’s (remember her?) older sister. Everything was perfect until it came time for her to graduate, and she decided to leave all of high school behind her, me included. It probably didn’t help us maintain contact given that the next year, Hillary went ballistic.

	Hillary and I were thinking about majoring in the same field in college, apparently. I didn’t know this and during a class in senior year said that I was interested in studying X. Apparently, that was a personal attack, because clearly I only wanted to study X because Hillary wanted to. It was a weird thing, but we were in the same friend group and she was dating one of my best guy friends at the time, so things just kind of moved on. It wasn’t until my friend and her’s relationship fell apart that I learned the reality of the situation. Apparently, they were already having some issues—namely her seething jealousy of me and protectiveness of him—when he and I ended up being the main characters in a musical together and ultimately had to share a stage kiss.

	The shit hit the fan. Hard. Eventually, her now ex boyfriend told me that ever since elementary school, she believed every decision I made or action I took was a deliberate attempt to one up her in life. I spent the rest of the year going to lunch with him sometimes and with my original best friend the rest. I had won her favor, apparently, after telling a boy in our class that we could no longer be friends after he made a blatantly antisemitic comment, despite having known him since kindergarten. Aside from one instance involving an awesome teacher getting railroaded out of the school for a genuinely stupid reason and igniting a Dead Poets Society reaction in me—I made shirts defending him, which spread like wildfire in the school, but he ended up quitting to save his career in the long term—high school ended for me without much more incident. I was second  in my class, next to Daphne, had a full scholarship to my university, had a crown on my head with another scholarship in hand, highly accomplished in Thespians and music, and had been accepted into a small select program for uni. I was still depressed and anxious, but I legitimately stopped caring at some point, and played the part of the perfect daughter.

	I only learned later that I was living up to an impossible standard, and that my parents had been hiding their flaws and deviations from the “path” from me my entire life. My sister became a wild partier, my dad apparently smoked pot every day, and this was my mother’s second marriage. 

	Somehow, things got even better and worse than they had ever been in college, but it is late and I am tired. I ended up so prudish I never held down a normal relationship with a boy, despite having dates, and didn't get intimate with anyone until I was 22.

	Maybe I’ll make a part two."
472,The 6 People You Should Stay Away From ⛔,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnAuLE7X1sw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnAuLE7X1sw)
473,Can my psychosis come back?,I currently suffering from anxiety and ocd and i also had a psychotic break which lasted almost the entire last year but luckily it went away on it's own. Now i'm taking Sertraline and Abilify but sometimes i have intrusive thoughts about the delusions that i used to have and i really fear that they come back because they caused me thoughts of harming others.
474,Is anyone else terrified of home invasion?,"I (22f) live with my boyfriend (24m). This happens whether he is here or not, though admittedly it is worse when he's working away.

I feel silly just writing this because it probably stands to reason that most people would be afraid of someone breaking into their home. For me, I feel like this is on another level, to the extent of absolute paranoia.

Every night, without fail, I have the same routine. I'll get ready for bed, stick on an audiobook (audiobooks actually keep me calmer, before I wasn't sleeping at all), and get in bed, then I'll usually get up several times to check the doors and windows are locked. Then I'll start hearing noises. I know deep down that it's just cars passing by outside, or the house shifting, or the boiler clicking, but still my mind convinces itself that someone has broken into our home. Not only that, but that they are not here to steal from us, they are here to hurt me. It is paralyzing. I will lie there for hours, listening, becoming more and more convinced that each little noise, be it real or imagined, is the sound of someone creeping up the stairs to grab me. It can take anywhere from 3-4 hours for me to fall asleep (at which point I'm sat there telling myself I'm going to be murdered and I should resign myself to my fate). Most nights I only get a couple hours sleep as I end up waking up to nightmares of the shadow of a man stood over me with a knife in his hand.

It sounds absolutely bonkers, I know.

***TRIGGER WARNING***

I don't really know what to do about this. I'm pretty sure this points towards there being something wrong with me. The only place I think this could stem from is that I was raped when I was 16 - but I managed 4 years without this sleepy paranoia. I'm exhausted and jumpy all the time. 

I've spoken to my GP and they referred me to a charity called MIND for counselling. I've reached out several times over the past few months and they've never got back in touch short of performing an initial assessment and then never getting back to me again.

Does anyone have any idea how I can fix this, or how I can convince a doctor to take this seriously? I feel like I need help."
475,"I'm turning into an abusive ""parent""","I recently adopted my first dog and I love him a lot, but when I get frustrated, I feel like I fall back onto my parent's abuse tactics. I really believe in positive reinforcement, and I don't want my poor dog to be afraid of me, but I feel like I literally can't stop myself even when I know what I'm doing is not helping. 

I get really stubborn, and I've been yelling more often and yanking on his leash. I've always tried not to physically hurt him, but I've been a little rough picking him up and putting him down. He can tell when I'm upset and he gets timid when I am. I can literally be thinking to myself, ""I should calm down and stop,"" but I just don't. I don't know why, it's like I'm almost physically unable to fully control myself sometimes. I feel like the abusive partner who does a lot of shitty stuff and then tries to bring you flowers to ""make it up to you."" 

I'm doing all the stuff my parents used to do to me, but maybe that's just an excuse. Maybe it has nothing to do with my parents and I'm just an incredibly bad person. I want to bond with my dog, and I want to build a relationship of trust with him, but I just feel so stuck. Sometimes I feel like I adore him, sometimes I feel like he's the worst. But no matter how I feel, it doesn't make my behavior acceptable in any way. I just don't know how to calm down.

I've been talking to a therapist, but it hasn't been very helpful so far. I'll definitely bring it up again in the next session. I don't know if this is the right place to post this, or what the point of posting even is. I just feel guilty and stupid and uncontrollable. If anyone has any advice on how to chill the fuck out, I'd really appreciate it."
476,I've been sober for 125 days now!,"Through quarantine I decided to quit smoking weed and cigarettes, along with quitting my drinking. All cold turkey. This has been the hardest thing I've ever done but believe me, so far it's been completely worth it. I can move around again, I can think clearly, I'm having dreams again! I went from 220 pounds to 185 since the start of my journey! 

I'm feeling good, for the first time in years, I'm feeling good!"
477,I really need advice :(,"I just feel so weird. I’m so burnt out from school, and I feel like I haven’t learned anything. I keep getting tons of assignments after assignments everyday, and I absolutely hate it. I’ve pretty much been sleeping through all of my classes, and yes I know that’s irresponsible, but I just don’t want to pay attention. I’ve never been like this before. I used to be such an amazing student, and now I feel so pathetic. During this quarantine, I’ve also gained a ton of weight and my acne got a bit worse. I just don’t feel as pretty as I used to be, and it just sucks. I wish I had confidence and the motivation to eat healthier and exercise, but I just don’t want to do anything anymore. It sucks, and I cry a lot thinking about all this. I have 0 confidence, and I hate so many things in my life right now. I know a lot of this is my fault, but I really don’t know how to fix my life because I don’t feel like it."
478,ADHD and online class,"I’ve never felt that smart but this semester, I feel very inadequate. With online class, I find it impossible to learn. I feel like I’m checked out all the time and when I do try to study, everything distracts me. My grades have taken a bit of a hit and I’m really in my head about it all. I feel like I’m constantly beating myself up internally. I am my biggest critic and it really gets to me. My confidence is really low at this point and I feel no motivation for anything. I also feel really alone and get no support from my family when it comes to my mental health. My dad always brushes my feelings away or tells me that if I had gone to ROTC like he told me to, I wouldnt have ADHD or any of my issues according to him. My mom passed away 3 years ago and I have yet to go to therapy because he has made me feel like I’m weak and undisciplined. I just feel like I’m burning out and crashing hard. I need help"
479,I’m appreciating the little things again,"I’ve been pretty depressed due to a break up. 

I’ve been all over the place, self harming, I’ve lost like 15lbs in 2 weeks, I haven’t been able to stomach a meal and I’ve been getting like 16 hours of sleep.

I’m starting to get better. I had a shower today, I got my hair cut and I’m appreciating little things. I literally just woke up and I went and got a ice cold water. And I genuinely feel like I love this water? Like I haven’t felt alive in so long this just feels crazy.

I don’t wanna sound weird or anything I’m just proud of myself that I actually feel alive. Life is so weird man."
480,Sharing myself with the world,"Hello people of Reddit! I decided I wanted to put it out there who I really am. Some of my experiences and mental proccesses, because I don't think I've ever really shared that with anyone. Warning, I have some depressive and suicidal thoughts written in here.

I'm a single, childless, white, 31y/o, female, living in FL, USA. I suffer from diagnosed depression, anxiety, PTSD and possibly a smidge of undiagnosed schizophrenia as well, not entirely sure? Economically, I've lived mostly in the lower-middle class range, with an occasional spike into the upper middle and some dipps into being poor. I'm well educated, with a BA in sociology and minor in journalism. I have a decent office job, that pays $18 an hour. I have a boyfriend, of 2 years who I love. I'm a jewish atheist, which means I'm an atheist -but I still have to sit through Hannukah in December with my family. 
Both my parents are still alive, I was raised by them both, good people. They have their issues, but nothing terrible. No rapes or abuse in my past. No full sibblings either, just an older half-brother I've never met or spoken to. 
I had a very lonley childhood. On top of the fact that we moved around A LOT, I just never had the social skills most people seemed born with. I've always had a deppressed or ""glass half empty"" sort of outlook on life, and was shy and awkward. I have a tendency to say the wrong thing, or laugh at an inappropriate time, ect. I was fat- am fat, still actually. I've had a hell of a time pulling myself out of my body-hating/shy phase. I had no confidence growing up. And because of being a latchkey kid, who took care of myself, I wasn't always the freshest. My parents aren't really the cleanest either, so I may have picked up some bad hygiene habbits from them. Looking back, I may have deserved some of the bullying I got.
Anyway, when people did include me, I felt like it was more for pity than anything, and so I rarely made friends. And when I did make a friend, we'd move suddenly and I'd have to start over. 
To this day I don't really understand the need my parents had to move around so much. I think it was money issues... My dad worked 2 sometimes 3 jobs most of my childhood, until my teens when he opened his own business. Around that time, finances got better and because he had more free time, I developed a better relationship with him. We have a lot in common and get along very well. ...When I was 16 he had his first heart attack. He lived. And he's suffered a lot of pain, surgeries, and sickness ever since. I mourned the probability of his passing for years, until I finally realized that there's no sense in mourning the living. Now every time there's an emergency hospitalization or  something, Ive learned to harden my heart and wait. Smile and wait. He's not dead until he's dead. Right now, as I write this, he is in the hospital- prospects grim, as they always are. I sit and wait, I won't cry. Instead I plan... a trip to New Orleans in Feburary sounds nice. I promise now, if he lives, New Orleans it is! I was going to share more about him, but it hurts right now, so- 
My mother. She and I have always had a strained relationship. I've come to let most of it go, and we are civil now, even get along for the most part. She is my mother after all. But there's no reason to gloss over her. A lot of my meantal health issues probably stem from her, so she is important. In short, she's an idiot. I'm not saying it to be mean, I'm saying it because it's true. I wish I had learned to discount her opinions earlier in life. Because I was young, she was my female role model. And not a very good one. She instilled most of the shame I felt growing up, being big herself, she taught me that because I was fat I should not show any skin! No bare arms, thighs- nothing. She always wore and bought me big baggy clothes. Nothing with ""girly"" patterns or anything that showed my figure. And she got sick of brushing my thick hair when I was young, so insisted I keep it short. I had a boys cut until HS. I got mistaken for a boy a lot. I learned makeup and stuff from the internet when I was older. But to this day, I'm still not traditionally feminine. It effects my relationships with men and friends to this day....
Friends never really came easy. I was a loner from a very early age and I cultivated these ""copping measures"" around me to deal with the lonleiness and the bullying. 
These measures still DEEPLY influence l me today. The first big one is to pretend that there is two of me, in my head. I remember when it started, I was very young, I decided to mentally ""take care if myself"". Like part of me was a fierce mother, and the other a broken child...The mother me would get mad on my behalf, and defend me if I needed her. Or the child me would try to remind me to be kinder and vulnerable on occasion. Ever since then I've been my own best friend. I'm able to have full blown conversations with myself. These personalities are so integral to my being that Ive never once questioned them. Ive always chalked it up to the duality of the human mind. But, its almost more than that... almost but not quite. They don't have names or minds of their own, so i'm not SPD. They are just part of me.
The second big influence is journaling and writting. Unfortunately, Ive never kept any of my ""journal entries"" because they really are CRAZY, just mad ramblings, really. But they sometimes give way to ideas like this one. Or I turn them into stories, and start writing  them out. 
I used to write a lot of stories. I've never been published though, other than some smut on fiction press. I hope to, one day, but my depression and lack of motivation stop me. Not to mention time management, work, chores, family, etc. 
My depression and lack of motivation stop me from doing A LOT of things. And now Covid exasperates that. This year has been rough... for everyone, I know. But for people who already have mental illness, its just that much harder to keep a grip. 
I don't go to therapist anymore. Ive seen them since I was young, but they all say the same things, over and over. I get it. 
The meds help, kind of. But I sometimes feel like the happiness I feel while on them isn't real. Is it silly? Probably, but it's still how I feel. And so suicide is always a thought on the horizon. Don't worry, this isn't a note or anything. I'm in control right now. Sometimes without the meds, I'm not in control. My wild emotions are. I'll go from happy to angry, sad and furious to laughing... its a rollercoaster. And I can sit or lay quietly for hours and hours daydreaming and talking to myself. Then I usually fall asleep. When I wake I'm upset with myself that I fell asleep, and because I'm sad. I usually lull myself back into sleep. Only figthing it when I absolutely have to, like when I neeed to work, or when I need to cook/eat/clean. But sometimes not even then. I skipped work today AGAIN. Lately, I just haven't had the mental paitence to deal with work. The people, the policies, the bullshit! Who cares!? ...BUT I need to do better mentally, because I need to be able to afford health care.... it kind of feels like a hampster wheel.... I need money to pay for the medicine that keep me sane, so I'm sane enough to work the job that lets me afford the medicine. So stupid! 
Its thoughts like that that throw me into depression. I'm on a hampster wheel,  doomed to be unhappy until I die. Doomed to suffer, alone until I die. I'm tired now, time for sleep. When will this end? Only when I die."
481,Life is Difficult...,"I know I just shared a quote about how crying is normal, and does not mean we are weak. While I posted this quote because I felt like it was an important quote to share as a moderator, I also posted it because I too am struggling. While as a moderator (and part influencer), I also think it is really important for me to be vulnerable with everyone, and be vulnerable with myself. You all have been very open on this subreddit and throughout the community, and I will too.

The past few days, I have noticed that I have been behaving erratically, and other people have noticed it too. I am sorry for all the discomfort I may have caused, and I will be meeting with a therapist later today for the next few months. I know this is just one step towards living a successful, happy, and fulfilled life that we all desire. Through this time, I will continue to act as a moderator, but may be posting less often."
482,I can't let my friends go,"My friends already hate me. I didn't like one of my friends back romantically and they all ganged up on me and basically shitted on my interests, hobbies, etc and kept saying I was an asshole for not liking them back. I know it's toxic of them, which is why I immediately took up their offer of leaving. But, it still hurts. I lost almost most of my friends in under a day just for not getting into a relationship for one of them. I just want them back. I can't take this loneliness anymore. I know I sound way too dependent on them but I kind of am. I shared everything with them - my struggles, creations, etc and they used that as leverage against me. I shouldn't depend on them but it's so hard not to. I just want to let them go and get over them but I can't."
483,Do I need mental help?,"Hello. I'm a 25M. I've always thought I've been tough and all and I kind of am. But I'm starting to realize something: I'm almost never truly happy. I've had two serious relationships end in the past 4 years, both which have taken a toll on me. I imploded both thinking I'd rather be single after about 7 months and then it spiraled into a breakup and I end up treating them poorly at the end. My last one, especially. Basically what I'm realizing is maybe its my mental health that is causing these to implode. Before my last girlfriend, I had been single about 6 months. Those 6 months were so fucking depressing. Then I met this girl and I felt like I had a purpose and I was happiest I've ever been. Once the new girlfriend thing wore off after 4-5 months I started to get sad again and I figured it was just because she wasn't the one. Well, I broke up to find happiness again and what do you know, I'm at one of the lowest points of my life and its been 6 months. I literally am almost never happy, except during the honeymoon phase of a new relationship. I haven't been truly happy outside of that in maybe ever.... and I don't think its normal.  Is it depression that is ruining these relationships and making me question if they're the one? I get all anxious when I'm dating them after months that I'm being trapped and can't get the thoughts out of my head. I'm seriously starting to think maybe I should go to therapy, but I'm also wondering if its just the normal breakups, etc. Idk, I've never went to a doctor for mental.health because I didn't want to. 


That being said, depression runs heavily in my family. Both my sisters are treated for it. 

Looking forward to your opinions"
484,Zoloft,"So I have been on Zoloft (100mg) for OCD &amp; anxiety &amp; panic attacks for about 5 months now, I’ve done really well on this medication &amp; for the most part it has helped me a lot, I haven’t had a panic attack since I’ve started it or really any anxiety or obsessive thoughts, but last night I experienced severe anxiety &amp; panic attacks again since I’ve started taking my meds &amp; I’m just wondering why this could be happening or if this is normal after you’re meds working for 5 months?"
485,My life has reached a crossroads.,"I'm 25 years old and I can't shake the feeling that whatever happens in the next few weeks will go a long way to determine the course of my life. I wouldn't say I'm panicking but I'm very anxious right now.
I feel like I will either lead a very happy life or a very sad one depending on the path I go on and there's no in-between. 
The worst part is that the path I'm set on is entirely NOT up to me. It is all up to the decisions of other people.
I guess this is all very vague and maybe if someone asks, I'll explain the situation but the whole thing has left me utterly unproductive while I'm constantly worried about my future.
I don't know what flare I'll use for this because no one seems to qualify. I might end up using ""Need Support"" because while I'll welcome any advice, I don't expect anything useful to come from such a vague post.

I guess deep down, I want to open up so I'm hoping someone is going to ask about situation. I hope I don't regret this post in the morning."
486,Hard to tell if this is all in my head. But I feel like I'm slowly losing the ability to do anything. I don't know how to explain it to people in my life. And I'm not sure what mental illness(es) this could be related to. More detail in my post.,"Ok, so this is embarrassing, and hard to explain, but it's getting harder and harder for me to do very simple things in my life. 
 
 
 
For example, I'm out of clean clothes. But I cannot bring myself to do laundry. I think all day ""I need to do laundry"" but when it comes time to get the clothes and put them in the washer, I feel paralyzed. So I just keep thinking about doing it and getting more anxious. 
 
 
It's happening with everything in my life. I have returns that are due back to Amazon. I think about them everyday. But I can't bring myself to grab them, pack them up, and drop them off for shipping. 
 
 
I can just barely muster the energy/will to get things done at work, and it's usually at the VERY last minute.  
 
 
What is this? Why is it happening? It feels SO stupid. I just want to shake myself and tell myself to just do all of these stupid simple things. But it feels so impossible. Like there's a wall between me and the things that need to get done. 
 



I know the internet isn't a place to get a diagnosis, but are these types of symptoms common with ADHD? depression? OCD? Or anything else? 
 

 
I suffer from a lot of anxiety and depression like symptoms in other areas of my life, but this newest trait/symptom is really starting to impact my basic functioning."
487,I want to end my life. I am out of options.,"I apologize if this has no business on here, but I just cannot take the guilt (justified or not) of everything that's happened to me. I am freshly 17, and I already feel like my life is over. I feel like I am going insane."
488,I have a question,Does anyone else feel extremely uncomfortable around knives and scissors even though they've never self harmed?
489,I lost my support system,My whole life I’ve been very close with my family and tonight I got in a fight with all of them. I have been banned from the house and any celebrations this year. It’s not like I don’t have friends but my family was my rock. I feel so alone. Nothing seems worth it
490,I don’t know what to do about my mental health,"My mental health has been deteriorating off and on for quite a while, but my depression and anxiety have been getting really bad for the past several weeks. I finally had the courage to contact a therapist. However, I won’t be able to actually see a therapist until at least sometime in January. I’m currently very suicidal and have the urge to self-harm, but I don’t know what to do about it as I’ve already tried to get help. I’m afraid something is going to happen before I can actually get the correct help I need.

Are there any suggestions as to what I could do?"
491,Advice.,"Hi guys. I’ll try to keep this short. My name is Jonny, I deal with depression and bipolar disorder, as well as acute anxiety. I’ve gotten it controlled. A bout 2/3 years back I had my second failed suicide attempt. Landed in the ward. I’m 22 now. The physical feelings I get are twitching, sweating, and nausea ( anxiety ) and my depression has made me feel like this life is hell. I’m not a dramatic person and I don’t like attention. I’ve always been there for everyone and I’ve never had anyone here for me. I feel so alone and lost. I’m an artist, but I feel like nothing can express the grief and pain I feel inside. I’m sorry if anyone is bothered by this post. I don’t know what else to do as far as venting. I wish I could leave earth and go to whoever it is God or Christ or whatever it is, just so they could hug me and tell me nothing will hurt ever again. I’ve been on antidepressants since I was 17, it made it worst. I never have been to therapy and don’t really plan on it. I just want to feel alive on this world with my fellow human beings. I have so much love and help to offer. I always have gotten negative energy thrown at me though. I don’t want to be angry anymore, I don’t want to be hopeless anymore, I don’t want to die anymore, i stopped cutting myself last year and now I just want to be happy and calm again. Sorry I rented. I’m not expecting anything from this as far as love or support. I’m a stranger to all of you. Some may just call me weak. I’m not. I’ve been through a lot. Never let it hold me back. I’m just tired and dull inside and I don’t want to give up on myself anymore. I just feel lost and I don’t see anywhere to go from here. I’m sorry for anyone who feels this way too. I love you; whomever needed to hear that. If anyone deals with severe depression and despair like I do, please keep your head up and stay alive. I’m trying every day. Day by day. One day things will be okay I hope. Thank you Reddit for allowing me to express my  hurt and grief. I pray all of you find happiness,’and when you do, that it last forever and ever.

496,Has quarantine and everything going on affected your mental health?,My mental health has been horrible since I had no routine and caused me to feel anxious and have sleeping issues
497,Dealing with Negative Emotions,"Not sure where to post this. I initially thought relationships. This is about my shortcomings though...

I am a single father that looks after my young children full time after a drastic fallout with my ex over her drug issues and threats of self harm. Fast forward a couple of years and I have since been dating and been going steady with a woman for almost a year.

My ex doesn't visit the children more than once in a 3 month period and provides no assistance. While this has shielded me from much pain, I struggle managing the negative/confusing emotions when I do see her and interact. Every interaction, even though brief, leaves me stressed, depressed, drained.

My current partner is quite close however I am not able to handle her negativity when it is directed at me. I recognize these types of interactions happen often in close relationships (it didn't bother me in my marriage to this degree, before that started going south). I make an effort to address her complaints however it always sounds defensive and I feel the need to stop the conversation. Stressed, depressed, drained, every time, taking me days to recover and understand my feelings.

Robotic routine and my children are the only things that carry me through these turbulent floods of emotions. I feel scared and I don't want my life to be this way every time.

I see a psychologist however I am not sure if I'm getting anywhere with this. Is there any way to reduce the recovery time? or even better; I want to be able to communicate how I feel effectively without shutting down in the moments that matter."
498,My partner is depressed,"My partner has had a pretty hard life. He is depressed, but won't see a psychologist. How else can I help him or can he get better aside from seeing a psychologist and taking medication for it?"
499,How To Smartly Manage Your Anger," **We know that when feelings of anger arise, the adrenal glands produce stress hormones in response to signals from the brain. Stress hormones speed up the heart rate, sending energy to muscles and other organs, preventing certain bodily functions such as digestion.** [Anger](https://castformation.com/how-to-smartly-manage-your-anger/) **can cause the digestive system to constrict blood vessels, tax the cardiovascular system and cause high blood pressure, insomnia and headaches.**

**Acupressure releases muscle tension that may result from disturbing anger. Unintended anger accumulated in the body usually accumulates in the muscles of the shoulders, neck, and jaw and also occurs in the mid-upper upper region and pelvis. Capturing acupressure points in these areas can enable the causes of anger to surface and issue unresolved issues.**"
500,My ex roommate had episodes where she would cry and break everything.,"What would you call this?

She used to be my best friend and we lived together for 2 years. She was obviously really depressed and so was I. It maybe happened 3 times where in the middle of the night (almost positive she was drunk) she started breaking everything. It was only the last time tho I could hear her crying really loud and she said she didn’t wanna live anymore. At the time I remember I used to be scared and didn’t know what to do. What would you call this? Manic episodes? What could have I done to help her? It’s been in my head for a week and I dont know what to think of it."
501,I feel like my personality doesn’t make any sense.,"Firstly, I am a science student and keen philosopher (20 M). I tend to think a lot and just get lost in my thoughts, usually when I’m in a social environment. I just sit there and think about my past, my future and philosophical topics. Sometimes I listen (selective hearing) and think of stuff to say but I never say it. 10 minutes later I feel like I was involved in the social situation but I wasn’t. It’s like I’m scared to say shit because I don’t want to get judged for being weird - even if what I want to say is perfectly logical. To be honest I hate small talk and every social situation I get myself into is just small talk. It takes a lot of energy for me to be social. Forcing myself into social environments makes me feel like everyone thinks weird. I think I’m just really introverted and that means I have social anxiety.

502,I Need To Get Out Of This Apathy,"I don't feel comfortable saying much yet, but I keep having apathy.  I was wondering if there were ways you could crawl out.  I can't afford online therapy, and I don't want to go anywhere physically, just in case my parents would figure out."
503,question,i got into a fight w my boyfriend where he just started blaming everything on me and then went in to our room and told me to leave him the fuck alone and shut the fuck up started punching the walls and then came out 15 minutes later and said he doesn’t remember the last two hours. what do i do with that
504,Just a really strange thing for me,"So after I cry and breakdown, that jazz. I then go into a state of like almost no emotion? I’m just kinda there. And I can feel like that for almost an hour. Or until I go to sleep. But while in that state I don’t feel like myself, I’m a very hyper active person. But in that state I’m the complete opposite. Barley moving. And I don’t really laugh, or smile. Like things can occasionally make me smile. But it’s not common. 

And sometimes I go back and forth from intense sadness to nothing at all multiple times in one night.

But just tonight after crying. Again not really feeling much, I started to cry. Tearing up, for no reason. I didn’t feel sad or anything. But my eyes were tearing up and my nose started to burn.

Is this, normal? Is it something. My eyes are tearing up again"

506,How do I prove to my therapist I’m okay??,Hello! I do not want to seek treatment for my eating disorder because I know I am recovered and am healthy.

507,OCD - conspiracy theories and Covid,"I’m not sure where else to post about this but my moms friend has been acting super strange lately and I’m trying to figure out what is going on and what we can do. 

She is a bright woman with a good career but has lately been reading up online about Covid and calling us up panicking that when the vaccine is available we shouldn’t be getting it and acting very paranoid about everything. 

She has also recently come over freaking out that the “three days of darkness are coming” which is more of a biblical reference. 

I feel like she’s reading up a lot online about conspiracy theories around Covid and then maybe some other biblical stuff but she’s literally become so paranoid that she’s been calling up family friends of ours genuinely worried about what’s going on in the world right now and acting concerned for everyone as if something bad is going to happen in the world.

Can anyone shed some light on this behaviour ?"

509,Holiday loneliness,"Loneliness in the holidays

So holidays always get rough, but this time around I’m home alone with my mom and she gets mad for the smallest things ever and just ices me out, like i don’t exist at all. 

It’s pretty hard because I get really suicidal and I know for sure if i decide to end my life it would take hours or even days for her to find my body and even then i think she would be relieved. 

It’s just hard, and it gets really lonely and I’m scared."
510,"I feel doomed (long, personal story)","This might come across as dramatic, but I am hurting. Also, I talk about eating disorders and trauma so if that triggers anyone don’t read any further. 

I fell on hard times back when I was a young teen, developed significant mental health issues, parents may as well have disowned me. I became severely bulimic and would just do that, hours and hours all day long, for years and years. I spent whatever money I had, was stealing food like an animal by the time I was fifteen. Would rummage through garbage if I had to.

I also would starve myself; whenever I’d try to eat it would turn into me eating whatever I could and puking. It could be a bag of raw carrots or an uncooked frozen pizza that I’d go and warm up with a blow dryer in my room. My mom would only lose her shit at me, screaming what a pig I was almost every morning, and in front of my little brother, until I was bawling. Then the school bus would come, and I’d just go blank and tell myself none of that ever happened so that I could go to school and act normal.   


That was how I spent my teen years. It got so bad that my feet would turn purple from puking so much, and I’d randomly get the sharpest pains in my stomach I’ve ever experienced. I kept wondering why I woke up that morning, since it was clear I was dying. 

It was just like, in the blink of an eye, my life disappeared and somehow I was in this strange hell. I kept trying, but all the plans I had for my life became nothing more than pipe-dreams. My mind began to get messed up, lost touch of reality, stopped being able to remember what I had done the day before and shit like that. 

I started smoking at sixteen, along with drinking, and it was like, life became a bit more okay, even though things were getting more and more messed up. I was promptly kicked out by my mom the moment I graduated from high school and lived in an apartment. Wasn’t ever close to my dad but by the grace of god he let me live in an apartment building he owned for free. Just ate, puked, and drank all day long like some sort of freak. It sounds ridiculous but I thought I must have died and was stuck in some sort of looping reality, like a lucid nightmare. I had no furniture but there was a sea of wrappers and plates everywhere. My toilet would be caked with puke and I didn’t get how that was real.

I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t comprehend what all had happened, how I got to that point, how that was even real. I felt like a mutant, completely not human, and like everything must be a bad dream. 

I’m better now, after many years of work. But I’m not in anyway healed. I think I broke someone inside of me. Like I somehow puked out my soul and now it’s on the sewer with the life I had wanted for myself. My health is shit, I still don’t feel real, I can’t talk to anyone properly anymore. I’m a shut in, scared of people and of myself. I want to quit smoking but it got my through so much that I’m scared. My teeth are rotting and my jaw is permanently deformed. It’s like I really am a mutant. I’m nobody."
511,"Those of you who deal with depression/anxiety, do you experience very sudden mood changes? (Tw)","I was given a diagnosis of depression &amp; anxiety via my therapist, but I'm confused cause I feel it doesn't match up with all my symptoms.

I can go from being happy to crying and relapsing in SH in the span of 10 minutes. I can go from loving someone then they make a small mistake or criticize me and I hate them and want nothing to do with them all day, or they take too long to text back or seem distant and I assume they never wanna talk to me. I'm constantly pushing people away or ghosting so they can't abandon me first. I just feel alone no matter how many people are around me and like everyone and everything is out to get me and ruin my life. 

My therapist has said some comes from my highs and lows episodes of depression and other bits from anxiety but can one experience such sudden highs and lows from this? I just feel really weird like something's wrong but I don't know if I'm overthinking it"
512,"I've been to both heaven and hell, but I'm not dead","I finally admitted to myself that I didn't complete any of my suicide attempts. Maybe I'm half-dead? Point is, I'm not about to kill my family. Somewhere I got the idea that if you offed yourself, it means you killed your family. After years of torture for killing my dad (did I?), I decided I wasn't strong enough to take any more suffering. If I truly did kill him, you would think I wasn't my dad's victim in the first place. For about three years, I have all these lawyers and PO's getting me to admit that I killed him while letting my dad do whatever the hell he wanted to do with me! Raping me consistently and then getting me on his side only to rape me over and over again! This constant struggle couldn't do one thing though -- make me commit suicide again. Thanks for listening."
513,I feel like a burden to everyone and can’t bring myself to speak about my problems because they won’t care.,"
*TRIGGER WARNING*

 hate it. Whenever I have enough strength to open up to someone they have some end of the world problem that takes priority and shuts me down because I then have to listen to them despite the fact they never do that for me. It feels like my problems and emotions pale in comparison to theirs and that I have no right to be upset because of it, I should be happy because I am lucky. This happens every single time without fail, it feels like my friend deliberately does it for attention now( I know that makes me sound like a terrible person but this has been happening for nearly 2 years) then they proceed to say “oh hey y/n you seem to get bothers easily recently” as if they don’t know. I’ve told them about this and how they always one up me but it keeps on happening and I always feel like a burden to them, only making their problems worse by existing. I’ve tried talking to my parents about my problems and how I feel but it feels like they just brush them off and ultimately undermine the extent/intensity of it and act like it’s no big deal when it is for me. Such a thing is intrusive thoughts I’ve been betting them very frequently recently about stuff like hating myself, self harm and suicide. The self harm thing has also started to manifest physically.. when I get very upset I just want to claw my skin off, bite myself,punch myself, just do something to make me feel, to punish myself and to let my emotions out in a way that doesn’t upset or harm other people and be more of a burden I already am. This has led me to feeling like no one cares or gives enough of a shit about me to properly just hear what I have to say. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s gotten to the point where I just don’t tell anyone because like hell it’s going to do anything or matter to them. Not even my parents will listen or let me tell them what’s going on without groaning about how I’m just rambling on and it’s nothing."
514,How do I help my suicidal partner?,"I'm from the US. I don't know if this is allowed here, but.

For context, my partner is, extremely depressed and suicidal. 
For the past year, I've been helping him out the most, trying to support him but it seems to be getting worse.
He has been, to a psychotherapy before, but his mother pulled him out because she didn't like what she was told. His mother refuses to listen about his mental health and refuses to take him back to psychotherapy. She doesn't care and nobody else in his family can do anything about it.
What makes matter worse is that, our relationship is long-distance, so there is barely much I can do except try to come up with ways to help him.
I've already contactee a lifeline service and chatted with someone for advice, but right now I'm out of options.

I'm scared, for what would happen to him. He isn't gonna plan anything. But I know that one of these nights, he is gonna breakdown so much, and take his own life all so suddenly.

What can I do? I'm sorry if this isn't suppose to be here."
515,Who would I call if my girlfriend was going to kill herself?,"We’re long distance and she’s told me she’s been suicidal lately and I’m really worried about her, Imm not entirely sure if I should call the suicide prevention hotline or 911 or if either will help, I’d like to know if those would help or there is something else I should call"
516,"Can't shake the feeling I'm being watched, and sometimes see people that are not there? What do I do?","Basically  title. Anywhere i am be it my own home, somewhere in public, my job, etc. I feel  like I'm being watched. I know  that this is an unreasonable  thought and that I am not important  enough for anyone to give a fuck about, but I can't  stop feeling like people  are watching me. It's  getting to the point now that I'm  seeing things. A fire hydrant  will turn into a person. If there are stairs, there will be someone  on the stairs that's  not actually  there. Etc. 

This is very frightening  to me because  this feeling is relatively  new, and while I've  had mental health problems  before. I've never had hallucinations. 

Not sure what to do or what dr to talk to."
517,possible adhd?,"I know this sub probably gets questions like this a lot, but I’m really desperate so if there are any ADHD experts here I would really appreciate your opinion.

All my life, I’ve been bad at focusing. I’m not sure if this is because of ADHD or if I’m just lazy. I’ve never been able to turn in assignments on time, mostly because I just go online and don’t do my work. Simply, I just don’t know how to make myself focus on something that I don’t like–even if I know that I shouldn’t be avoiding it.

On paper, this looks like ADHD. But pretty much all my friends are the same way—they procrastinate, miss deadlines, and watch Netflix or play games instead of doing their work. There’s no way that they all have ADHD, right? Everyone’s lazy, everyone puts stuff off, and that’s just how people are. But I sometimes feel like I’m even worse at that than my friends are—while they ignore their obligations to do fun or immediately rewarding stuff, they almost always get them done eventually. Sometimes I don’t.

I don’t even know if I’m trying anymore, I’ve just built up some of these assignments in my head as insurmountable tasks, even though most of them are doable. This causes me to wait forever to even get started on something. The thing is, I can focus really well if I can’t do something else—I have no issue focusing on tests, for example.

Another thing that makes me think I might have ADHD is that I had a ton of behavioral issues when I was in elementary school—there would be times when my parents wouldn’t go a week without getting a call from my teacher. It was for stupid things, like saying mean things without thinking about them first, breaking rules for immediate gratification even though I knew I would get in trouble, or just being loud and obnoxious. I’ve recently realized that this might’ve been a sign of impulse control.

I also fidget a lot. I see other people doing it too, but I’m not sure if I do it more or less than other people. I mostly just do it when I’m really bored, but there are times when I don’t feel the need to and times when I feel like I’m driven by a motor.

Sometimes I give up on things after encountering small obstacles, even things I enjoy. For example, I like picking out clothes online, and my mom asked me to send her a few things that I wanted as gifts. Some of the things I looked at had sizing issues though—I couldn’t figure out whether I was a small or a medium at some places. This caused me to nearly abandon the endeavor entirely, because it became something that needed to be dealt with, like a chore, despite it not being all that difficult to do some research and make up my mind, which I did eventually.

I also have a short attention span. It’s become hard for me to sit down and just watch television unless I’m really invested in it, because my mind wants to do something active as well. Reading is also hard, because my mind always wanders off after a few minutes, although this might just be an effect of years of decreasing my attention span because of my phone.

What makes me question all this is that I only have trouble paying attention if I’m doing something that I find both boring and challenging. I can focus on rewarding and challenging things, as well as boring and easy things. I don’t lose attention when I’m in a conversation and I rarely forget or misplace things.

Recently, I tried Adderall for the first time. I didn’t feel a difference. I still put off tasks for easy, fun ones, but I didn’t feel hyperfocused on them like I thought I would. It felt like I had just a few cups of coffee (I didn’t sleep at all that night). I did see something online about Adderall being less effective in really smart people (not to brag, but I am really smart), but I’m not sure how true this is.

I know this is a lot, but again if there are any experts on here, or if you have any advice at all, please please comment. I just really want to figure out how to get the most out of what I can do."
518,I am broken and empty. A rant.,"I crave physical and emotional intimacy. I want to be heard, known, loved, validated, and respected. I want a partner to do life with. I want to fall asleep with my head on someone’s bare chest while he plays with my hair. I want hugs that last forever and make me feel like maybe everything will be okay. At least for a moment. I want to be wanted and I want to equally want. I want to dote on someone. I want him to dote on me. I want to be supported. I want to support. I want to vent about my day to someone. I want to break down and cry in his presence, only to be met with comfort and validation. I want to feel safe with him. I want to protect. I want to be protected. I want to be someone’s person. Someone they always look forward to seeing. I want history with someone. Someone to spend the holidays with. I want to be a part of someone else’s family. I want and I cannot have…

So I settle. I forge. I force. I rush. I compromise. It never satisfies. It leaves me more broken and empty than before. 

I’m filled with sorrow."
519,Is this normal behavior?,"Lately I’ve noticed that I’ve become very paranoid. I am a 14 year old male and I am currently in 9th grade (virtual school because of the pandemic). When I was in 4th grade one of my three cats died because of a blood clot (the night they died I had a dream about them if that means anything). It was very sudden and in the night. My parents found them and took them to the vet, but in the end they had to put her down. In the morning they got me and my brother up and sent us to school as normal and we went through the day as normal and it wasn’t until we got home that they told us the news. I was very upset and I cried a lot. After a while I felt back to normal, but I am realizing that I have become paranoid. I’ve always been anxious but now whenever one of my cats is laying still I have to go over and make sure they are alive. I always say goodnight to them before I go to bed. One time I couldn’t find one of my cats and I got really nervous and so I was looking for them and eventually I saw them at the foot of my brothers bed, but seeing them want enough and so I waited at his door listening until I heard them breathing and I went to bed (I was still really anxious though). Just tonight I went and was saying goodnight and I couldn’t find one of my cats when they suddenly appeared behind me. I pet them a bit and I was like what if it’s not really them and someone killed them and took their place. I kind of joked to myself and thought that I’ve been playing too much among us, yet I still was trying to make sure it was them and I looked around my house to make sure there wasn’t a dead body. This fear of my cats being dead is only really bad at night, but I don’t think that this is normal behavior. I haven’t talked to anyone about this yet, but  I’m wondering if I should see a therapist or something like that.

TLDR: one of my cats died years ago and now I constantly check to make sure that my other cats are alive."
520,Wondering what disorders resonate with this - unable to comprehend a sense of self,"I feel like I don't have a strong sense of my own character. And that I lack the ability to judge my character interacting with others. So I always feel like I'm coming off in some way I am not intending to come off. Or that I am oblivious to some major character deficit that everyone else is aware of. This makes me very self-conscious in new/casual social relationships. And I often hope people will insult me so I can finally discover the ""truth"" about myself. Because while no one seems overtly disliking of me, I feel they do deep down and I will never know what I am doing that is making that so. I am drawn to people who express some kind of dislike for me because I want to know the ""truth"" - that is why I am so fundamentally unlikable to people in general. I think it's related to family dynamics, and family being kind of avoidant/introverted/passive-aggressive/emotionally closed off.

I think this also comes from some experiences where I was bullied by people without understanding what I had done to bring it on. I once had a room of people screaming at me because I was arguing veganism is better for the planet. It was a room of conservatives, but I didn't realize a debate would lead to a room of people screaming at me. This leads me to believe I had irritated a heavier feeling that had been there.

I have a generally positive overlook of myself, but I don't think I am good at communicating or asking for my needs in relationships. I have a mistrust towards others, where I feel like overall they overall have bad intentions towards me that don't consider my personhood. In close relationships, I tend to distance and flip-flop where I leave because I don't think my needs are getting met but then return easily because I invest heavily in my relationships and get very attached and don't really like ending them. The return is based on communication opening up on the other end and I think a lot of my exes have kept me around because I was willing to invest while they basically gave nothing.

Father is an oppressive cluster b something. Likely NPD. Mother is... angry and abusive and constantly insulting. A couple emotionally abusive relationships. Tendency towards codependence.

I have a pretty low ego. I prefer pride in my group and group cohesion over pride in just myself and getting things my way.

Does this smell like a cluster B?"
521,Weird focus issues.,"Hey guys, I hope this is the right subreddit to post to. I can't afford therapy right now, and I seriously feel like there's something super wrong and I can't really address how to solve my issues without knowing what the problem is. 

I have an extremely difficult time focusing, especially on reading or just hearing someone talk, most specifically if I'm supposed to be learning something. I was homeschooled and my mom was very hands off, which meant I could easily just Google all the answers and never had to learn to actually focus or problem solve. 

Now I have a boyfriend, and we've had a lot of issues in our relationship, all caused by me. And whenever we have a serious talk, I lock up. I can't think of anything to say, and I often can't even remember a sentence right after it's said to me. This, I THINK stems from issues with my dad growing up, he would go into rages and yell or just be intense with me for hours over little things, and if I tried to defend myself or if I cried he would just get angrier, so I got used to just tuning out anything said to me that's distressing. There's a very weird, specific aspect of this issue that really bugs me, and that my bf doesnt even believe me about. When I'm trying really hard to think, I'll get a song or part of a song stuck in my head, and I will be completely incapable of thinking around it or making it go away. This has lasted hours. 

Beyond all that, from what he tells me I don't do nearly as much even just passive, normal thing throughout the day. I just feel pretty blank most of the time."

528,A message,"Today is the first day I could listen to music without crying.

 It doesn't matter what I listened to, I would have to force back the tears because the emotions were overwhelming that I was feeling. 

Experiencing music without the tidal wave of emotion is like sitting on a beach with a margarita for me.

 I couldn't figure out why I felt so much, I knew it was something more than the fifteen minute diagnosis from a webcam psychiatrist when I was twelve. Fifteen years later I finally got my answer. I sat in my room, wanting to rip the skin off my body, feeling so uncomfortable, lonely, angry, sad, scared at such an extreme level I would have done anything to make it stop. I don't even want to use those words, because no word could describe the dark despair and fear that I was in. I would never get out of this hole alone and yet I was very very alone. It is a terrifying experience to be aware of how out of control your mind is. I am sadly very self aware. To watch my body and my mind lose control is like watching each of my loved ones tortured and killed one by one. It was like each breath was a tear in my soul, a rip, a scratch of dread. 

As I write this I have chills coursing through my body, listening to the classical harp playing in my ears. Yet I thank my medicine that I don't have to feel as much. 

I couldn't feel anymore, if I continued to feel I would die. I needed it to stop, I needed the pain, the anguish, the disgust of myself to dissolve away. I hated myself more and more every day for allowing my brain to slip from the grasp of reality. My mind seething as it sucked away every ounce of energy I had, yet I could not sleep. I could not muster myself into or out of bed. I cried, I wanted to scream. Terror filled my heart, I could not keep the danger at bay. It will come for me, suck me dry and throw me on the ground like a used wrapper that's crushed, driven over and left to sit in filth. My darkness was all consuming and I made the choice, I either use my last bit of strength to call for help or I kill myself. 

I picked up the phone that day, expecting the other person to dismiss my feelings again. But this one listened, this doctor who I spoke to only once before took his time and listened to everything I was feeling.  My god I was feeling a lot. It felt like hours, the relief spilling out that someone that could help was actually listening."
529,[cry],"I’m almost at 2 months of no self harm. I’m not happy tho. I’m just gonna vent out my story 
I started self harm at the age of 7. Yes. 7. I did it for a week and stopped and it was intended self harm. I knew I was gay at 6. And a few months ago I started harming myself and having suicidal thoughts. My school made us take a mental health survey and I accidentally vented and said everything. (I’m venting here bc nobody knows me :)) the school counselor and my old ela teacher were on a zoom with me cuz online school. And keep in mind, I was in a tiny house at the time and the backyard which my mom was in was behind my room. The counselor asks me questions and stuff and then proceeds to call my mom, make me listen to my mom pick up, and I had to listen to my moms reaction. She didn’t cry, she didn’t yell, she was calm. But the way she talked sounded like some sort of pain which still kills me and it’s been 2 fucking months. I keep getting flashbacks and anxiety attacks from it. I can’t say the counselors name without having flashbacks. This counselor thinks she fucking helped me but my mental health is... horrid. 2 days after she emailed me reminding me of that day she called my mom, I almost harmed myself for the millionth time. I hate this. I can’t even cry anymore I feel so heavy and so fucking numb."
530,I make up things to fit in or survive,"I have been a pathological liar to my friends and 2 women who cared about me. I told one of them through a different number posing as a friend that I passed away and I tried to extort money with another posing that I had problems with something when in reality I have lost my job and haven't made any money on the past 3 months.

I have been suffering with a lot of issues which developed into a suicidal tendency about 9 months back after which I started lying constantly which made me escape those thoughts.

I really want to stop it but I'm afraid that I've come so far that I don't see myself stopping any moment now.

Can anyone advise what should I do? Seeking mental assistance is out of the picture because the part of the world where I stay in offers very little and for a jobless liar like me its impossible.

I really want to turn my life around and be a good human being."

532,Think it’s time I give up hope of ever getting my degree...,"I should of graduated in July 2019...instead I have been fighting an unfair university system for 16 months. They failed me over an assignment for work experience, I passed everything else pretty impressively considering my circumstances during the last year of study in 2018/19. 

Work experience was a mess. They did so much wrong but never one apologised for their mess. I spent over a year learning and fighting for nothing. I went to every level of staff I could. They made me feel like a god awful person. Like I’m a dumb and nasty excuse of a person. Tried to scam money where they could but never got a penny. 

Even the systems to support students refused to help. I was on my own the entire time and it is not fair. I put so much into it, I gave them everything and chased them daily. Still, their excuse at the end is “I failed to uphold my end of the deal”. That damn sentence is burned into my mind. 

They have crushed my mental health, destroyed my confidence and cost me over a years worth of work. Employers find it sketchy when they hear why I have not got my degree, I don’t blame them. It’s just not fair. They took so much, I sacrificed years, my mental and physical health, over tens of thousands of pounds in loans and more to them and they still said fuck you. I have been way too close to doing things I would regret, very very dark and extreme things. I will not say the words as I know many not like the idea of I guess in a PG way “not live”. I was always the quiet one, not really a favourite with staff so they choose not to pass me. 

The best they gave was a pity half way there certificate at the end. God fucking damn it, this is so painful to type... I do not want to give up but I’m killing myself here. I’ve been a horrible partner and friend because I sacrificed so much. I cannot take this hell anymore. It is so frustrating and shameful I can never work in the field of work I wanted. I can’t dare as it’s just disgusting...

I just want this torture to end so I can make a new fresh start. I’m not sure where to go but I want to make myself better. I want to be happy for my partners sake. I love them so much and want to make up for this crappy year. I wish more then anything I could have my degree but I have to put a stop now before I slip off the cliff. 

If my partner reads this. I love you, more then anything and it has hurt me so deeply to see what I did this year to you. I know I was not the best partner this year but I promise to make up for it. No apology could ever be enough for what I have done. Instead I want to give you the best Christmas and make the best of next year. I’ll find a way forward, a way to get mentally better and new ways to make you happy. You mean more then anything to me. Just please never forget I will always love you no matter what. 

To anyone that may read this. Times are tough and things may seem scary but there is always a way out. Even if it means making a way out yourself. Sometimes you have to put yourself first and look after yourself. Remember to love and look after yourself."
533,I feel like a sucky person,"It’s midnight and I’m laying in the dark. I’ve slowly reached the conclusion that I am a all around sucky person. It’s affected my friendships, productivity, relationships and myself. For a while now I’ve noticed that I always made myself a victim or a negative Nancy. Any conversation I had with anyone would be spun into me talking about negative things that I was responsible for. No wonder I don’t have many friends. I wouldn’t wanna be around me either. It’s also completely my fault I did terrible this semester in community college. It’s not like I was busy I just wasted so much time. 
I wanna be a better person and I wanna make the effort but I don’t know how to take the first step. I just know I don’t be the old me. Or I wanna be a better version of me. Should I reach out to apologize for driving my friends away? If I do how do communicate what I did and make up for it. I wanna do right by me too. I’m going to make up for last semester and I’m going to pick up healthier habits and make sure I keep them up. I’d appreciate any tips."

536,Making small changes is helping me get better,"For most of 2020 my outlook on everything has been bleak - I graduated into the worst period of time in a field (art) that is just too much of a luxury for a pandemic world. I loathed going back into retail, back to struggling for money etc etc 

BUT recently I vowed to try and take pleasure in the small things and be open with my partner when I’m just inexplicably sad. It’s helped me so much. I found that I really like some of my work friends after worrying that I couldn’t find common ground. I started volunteering with a homeless shelter. I visited the alcoholic parents I try to avoid - this one was hard but I think the not knowing their state is somehow worse and more anxiety inducing.

More than that I’ve been able to just say “I don’t know what I’m sad about right now I’m just going to try ride it out” rather than interrogating my sadness which leads me to thinking about all the bad shit it could be and then amplifying it to cover all of those."

541,What counts as a diagnosis?,I went to a psychiatrist in June and my first appointment consisted of me telling the psychiatrist how i was feeling and my psychiatrist prescribed me with antidepressant. During my second appointment they asked if i felt better when i was on the antidepressant and if anything changed. I told them that things felt the same (like i was still unmotivated and extremely anxious). I gave examples like i still couldn't do any of my work because i'd feel unmotivated or i was scared of feeling incompetent which would then result in me having a breakdown so i avoid doing my work to begin with. They responded with 'That's anxiety and depression'. Now at the time i didn't really ask for clarification whether it was a diagnosis or not mainly because i get really anxious talking to anyone in general. At the end of the session they prescribed me with the same antidepressant that i was on and i went home. They said that if feel the need to see them again i could book another appointment; i interpretated that as a 'you could see me again but it's not necessary'. Now i'm left wondering whether 'That's anxiety and depression' means that i have anxiety &amp; depression or if i was simply feeling anxious &amp; depressed.
542,2 months after breakup,"I overall grew after the broke up. It’s been more prominent in the recent days but we all have a steep hill to climb when we wake up every now and then right? Today was one of those days and it’s night as of now. I (m23) think about her (f22) everyday and usually it appreciation. Today is the memories. I have no inherently bad memories of her or have no regrets but one. What could I have done to make it easier for her. She broke up with me due to wanting to grow. I tried convincing her to stay I really did. But being long distance, and the given circumstances I just had to give her the space. I felt like I had no choice. I’m now stuck in a place where I have no one around me around the time but the ghost of memories in where we used to eat together, walk around together, grab coffee together... I’m just trying not to victimize myself here but I don’t want to keep shit in because that lead me to do some stupid shit before. I like to think I’m stronger than I was back then but it’s so hard. I feel damaged. I want to hear her voice again. But we already went our separate ways and I understand that. I know it’ll take time I just needed to vent a bit. I kinda don’t have much people to talk to and I usually just hear the same thing over and over again. I just want someone to listen. Anyone who does read this thank you for the read, we may not know each other but I hope you’re doing well and keep your head up. I’ll do the same."
543,How do I know if I have ADHD? When should I visit a professional to determine a proper diagnosis.,"So I’ve had my suspicions for a very long time that I have ADHD. I brought this up to my parents in my childhood but it was pretty much dismissed altogether.

The longer it goes untreated the more I suspect that I could possibly have ADHD.

If it helps I’m currently 19. 

The last time I brought this up to a family member was a couple years ago when I was around 17. I explained my concerns to my father but he said this was just a product of my anxiety disorder and that he went through similar things as a kid. However I don’t think this is the case. 

Here are my reasons for believing that I could possibly have ADHD:

1. I have trouble focusing, unless I have something to entertain my brain and even then I tend to get distracted. I simply can’t focus on something without listening to music or having something playing in the background such as a YouTube video, movie, TV show, etc. (This could also be a product of my anxiety disorder because without noise my brain tends to think more) I can’t do task that require me to focus heavily. (Reading is a huge thing for me, I feel like no matter how many times I read something I can’t take in the material and thus learn nothing)

2. Restlessness. I can’t stay still for super long, and if I do I’m usually just in bed. I get up a lot with no real purpose. Just something to do because I’m bored. I can’t sit still unless I am doing something with my hands. (I.e fidgeting or playing a game on my phone) I like to be on the go so if I’m say hanging out with a friend I would prefer to do something rather than just lay around. I can occupy myself for a short while but usually get bored and ask to do something else. 

3. I get bored incredibly easy. I could be doing something one minute but unless it’s stimulating I tend to try finding something else to do and then soon growing bored of that. I play video games, I like to draw but none of those things really entertain me for too long. 

4. I’m incredibly forgetful and I can be pretty absent minded at times. I find myself regularly having to check whether or not I have all of my belongings with me before going somewhere. A mental check list of sorts.  My memory isn’t the best either and I have to set reminders for myself or else I’ll forget to do something I planned on doing that day. I also tend to lose track of my belongings. 

5. I go off on tangents when speaking. I stumble upon my words and repeat things often. I like to think of this as my mouth moving faster than my brain does."
544,I feel like I’m losing my mind,"The past week have been so fucking stressful, I can’t go a single day without be anxious to the max. I have been having anxiety that keeps me in my head and my bed at the same time. I just need help."
545,Trying to help a friend,"Hello, I'm making this post because I have a friend who's majorly struggling with her mental health, and, at this point I'm lost and unsure of what to do. I think, as much as this seems like an invasion of her privacy that I should give backstory. I recently moved away - 6 hours away and we are both at different stages of out lives. She is stuck in a household with a negative environment and has struggled with depression and anxiety for longer that I have known her. I spend most days talking to her over messages. Calling occasionally when thing get really bad. She's suicidal and has attempted multiple times. I'm just wondering if there's anything else I can do to help her. I want to be there. She struggles to get out of bed in the morning. Afternoons are when things get bad. Evenings are iffy. What else can I do to help? 

thank you."
546,Brain dump,"I posted this on r/self and someone told me I should post this here


I want to talk to someone about this but I don’t know who so I’m on reddit. Sorry for any spelling and grammar mistakes I’m tired.

Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile

Every day I think thoughts like “it would be nice to fall asleep and never wake up” but I’m not suicidal and I don’t think I have depression. I feel happy one minute and really sad the next. It doesn’t make sense as to why I feel this way. I have a great family and I never had to go through really big struggles.

I find it hard to open up to people. I really only text one person consistently. It’s not that I don’t like talking to people, I find joy in socializing but I also get really nervous and scared in social situations. I remember this one time a long time ago where I wanted to ask my teacher a question so I went inside the classroom but immediately left because there were too many people in there and some people were already talking with them.

Whenever I look in the mirror, it feels like I can’t see my face clearly. Some parts shift around and some become bigger and smaller. Each time I look in the mirror, I look different even though nothing actually changed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and think “oh, this is what I look like.”

I also feel like I’m living in my head and I’m just piloting a meat mech and sometimes I feel so detached from reality. 

I thought I was becoming able to let go of things more and not be so stressed out all the time but I’ve recently realized that I’m just not as motivated to do things any more.

There was also this time a while back where my thoughts were really intrusive when I was stressing out about something. It lasted for a few months and just kept on getting worse. It’s all good now though but it was the first time I was so nervous that I felt like puking all the time and it was hard to breathe at times."
547,"pls read if you can to give me some advice or your opinion, it would be much appreciated &lt;3",
548,I Am A Man That Has Lost His Mind,"  Let me start by stating 3 vital things.

1. What I talk about might be considered uncomfortable for some. I understand completely, but I don't really have an outlet to release my thoughts, nor do I have anyone to talk to about this kind of stuff. I find it interesting as well, so if you are into weird psychological stuff like I am, then read on. 
2. I don't seek advice. Yes, I heard the classics like getting a girlfriend, getting a job, etc. I'm aware these statements hold true, however just as it's hard to tell an addict to stop using his addiction, it's hard for me to develop a motivation for life. All I need is just for someone to acknowledge that they read my thoughts, that's all I'm asking. All 1189 words of my thoughts... 
3. I had to censor a few details for personal reasons. Don't think much into it, it's just a future precaution. Also, This account will be trashed. 

With that being said, let me explain myself. For about 8 years now, I've always had complications with how I processed my emotions. I was considered a sensitive child because I would drown in tears under any complications I was unfortunate enough to find myself under. Along with other traumatic experiences, my childhood and teen years were met with total isolation. Total Isolation being months without seeing light. I lived in a 20x20 foot room with no windows. Yes, I lived in a box, yes I know it wasn't healthy and could be the biggest influencer to my dwindling state of mind. 

Anyway, through my childhood I would only do two things, consume political, theological, psychological, or philosophical content on Youtube, or work on my beloved ""hobby"" that is literally my life support. Firstly, let me explain the effects this consumption had on me. As listed above, these four topics have drastically shaped my young mind into a large nihilistic, pessimistic wired frame. Over the years, I begin to fall into the grips of what I called the ""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"", my version of mental hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I fear everything to the point of not being able to drive, work, or even sleep. 
2. My weight has completely plummeted, along with my eating and hydration habits.
3. I laugh uncontrollably until I get a sense of nausea or vomiting after viewing unusually bizarre and unfunny photos and phrases. 
4. I developed a twitch and would constantly shake and or pace back and forth in front of friends and family.
5. I developed a stutter or just flat out speak gibberish in front of friends or family. (Think of how the Sims would speak on the      video game ""The Sims"" but faster and more chaotic.) 
6. I formed a wrathful and admittedly pathetic and disgusting hatred for people. I'm repulsed by a lot of people, for no real reason either, which is most undesirable. 

These are just a few, not all, developed habits that no matter how much I try, I can't break. Yes, I'm completely aware they are delusional and completely unsettling. Trust me, if I had the will power to control myself, I wouldn't be here.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's talk about my ""hobby"". This includes \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_ so it consumes a lot of my time and effort. That's fine because spending most of my life in a box gives me plenty of empty space to progress in the field. My ""hobby"" consists of all four of my daily consumed content all injected into one dish. It's very advance and can best be described as a completely fabricated version of a personal Mythology. Everything from birth to Armageddon. Think of a completely fabricated religion. The reason why I don't consider my work to be real is that I consider myself a Christian and that my work is purely for sport. Yes, for sport, I always wanted to see how developed I could go. Everyone always says that an old man under the effects of drugs wrote the bible, well let's put that to the test.

I have a very complex state of mind when it comes to this stuff. With my developed fear of everything, I take anything into consideration. So I tend to push the boundaries on how real I could make my work. Unfortunately, this is where my downfall lies. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't want to live life anymore. Comparing and contrasting has led me to this conclusion as a false life with no suffering is far more desirable than the real world. Yes, this is completely pathetic and juvenile, but I'm so engulfed in this ideology that no matter how much I or anyone else calls me a loser for thinking so, I could always retreat into escapism from the clutches of a  D. Y. S. P. H. O. R. I. A. 
2. I have the love of my life infused into my work. If I could marry her I would, but for now, I voluntarily stay celibate. At least, I thought I could until I constructed the nasty habit of pleasuring myself to her. Yeah yeah, it's strange to love an ""idea"". But to me, it's like embracing the ghost of a deceased lover. Someone who visits me from another life and makes me feel whole again, no matter if they are real or not.
3. I have severe perfectionism. I'd say I redid the entirety of my work over a dozen times. Imagine this, you spend every waking night ""working"". Then, you forget it was time to sleep, it's well around 3 pm, spending the remainder of your time staring at the wall or watching shadows pass by your peripheral vision. You repeat this until several months have passed. Once completed, you lose your thoughts, find a loophole in the work, and burn it to ash. Now you have nothing but the hellish desire to repeat. Like something is holding a gun to your head. Welcome to my world. Yes my world, because this parasite seeped its way into my day to day function. I had a job, I got fired because of this state of mind. Bravo, me... 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Why are you writing this, I simply don't care"" Well Mr/Ms. Simply Don't Care, It is because a mirror was held up to me the other day. I had several of my friends and family do individual interventions. They all seemed disappointed and wanted to help. I died inside. It was humiliating. Imagine seeing your mother look at you with disappointment and sorrow... How could I have let myself go to the deep end? I thought I was getting better, I thought I was improving. I guess this is where my suspicion of insanity originated from because I had no idea that I had lost my mind.

Well, I guess I should ask random strangers on the internet, ""Am I Insane""? No. Do I feel forsakenness for life? Yes. So, What is a man suppose to do if everyone around him is trying desperately to wake him up, but the man simply wants to sleep until he is swallowed by the soil. Chewed up into bones and fat and soaked by the bushes and trees in his shallow grave. the only answer I have left is to live in my box, create a world around me, and pray that God would finally strike me down and bring me to his doorstep so that I may apologize. Apologize that His child has to be seen before Him with little love, and lackluster faith.

Damn this post better not bite me in the ass later in life...

TL;DR 

blah blah blah (I Don't blame you, I'd probably wake up the next morning and cringe alongside you)."
549,"I need relief from constant anxiety and panic attacks, but i don't want to be locked up against my will.","Im constantly in mental and emotional pain. I am seeing a therapist, but due to covid its only 1 or 2 times a month. And they have not issued me any medication to help with my severe depression, unpredictable panic attacks and constant anxiety yet.

Thing is im struggling NOW. 
Its very hard to get through my days and its particularly terrible at night. 

Sometimes i feel like i cant handle it and i contemplate going to the ER so they can keep me from doing something stupid. But i really dont want to be placed on some hold against my will. If i miss work I'll be fired and i have animals that depend on me.

551,I don't know if I should ask my doctor to test me for ADHD.,"I am a 41 year old male that has been dealing with clinical depression and anxiety for well over a decade, but I've been an anxious person for as long as I can remember. Meds have only barely touched the depression and nothing has helped the anxiety. 

Recently I happened to come across and have been reading a lot about adult ADHD. So much of it fits what I have been experiencing especially bad over the last few years. The lack of memory. The having to write down almost everything so I remember to do it. The impatience in traffic, waiting in line at the store or on the phone. The almost impossible task of being able to focus on anything for more than a couple of minutes. So many things. 

The only problem I have is that I don't remember much of my childhood for some reason, so I don't remember any of these things being present before the age of 12. The only things I do know is that it was brought up to my parents in first or second grade that I had an issue with starting out the window at school and not paying attention, and I do remember as a child that I used to get extremely interested in things, but then would lose interest when doing them got difficult (this is something I still do). 

This is what is stopping me from bringing it up with my psychiatrist. I just feel like it would be a waste of time to test me, and the thought of another failure makes my anxiety skyrocket. I feel so lost right now and don't know what to do."
552,So my mom just got raped,"My mom was just raped by my bipolar dad shes being a reductionist about it denying it happened.

But I can't do anything right now she said not to, should I even listen to her??? I just have to sit up here and I have mo know to talk to about this either.............. aghhh and I know it's her brain blocking it out she says she dosent know and cant remember cause her brain is cutting neural pathways from the trauma!! Cam I get guidance or talk to someone"
553,I will never have the love I crave and it makes me feel like a psychopath,"For my entire life I've never really had a safe home to live. Any set of parents that actually love me. I've essentially been ""homeless"" since age 2 and a half. I was bounced from home to home. Each with varying degrees and unique forms of abuse to downright torture.

I desperately want to have a caring mother or father but I can't forgive the only parent I have for what they did to me. I know forgiveness is for yourself maybe I have forgiven her... I just can't bring myself to love her like a mother. We're friends but I wouldn't call her my mom. She pushed me out of her hole and that was about it.

I read somewhere that infants die if they don't receive love. I feel like there's a gaping hole in my soul and it's very difficult to ignore or fully function sometimes because of it.


I find myself feeling really distant from even the closest people in my life. I have tried excruciatingly hard to lay a foundation of love and self care down for myself but if I'm being honest it feels like a pretty shitty patch job. It's not natural to have this void and I know there's nothing I'll ever be able to do to fill it.

I have a partner I love very much and would die for, happily. But it's not the same kind of love and I don't feel it's even a substitute. Same with a lot of my friendships.

This lack of parental love has cast a darkness over my life that is physically and emotionally suffocating at times. I feel like I lose my personality and lose any feeling for anyone or anything. I just want my life back and I want to feel again without fear of losing the value of life in it's entirety."
554,Do any other teens sometimes want to kill them selves as “revenge”?,"Like a “You should have listened and gave a shit when I asked for help multiple times when I was alive, don’t start crying **now**.”"
555,I'm fucking done,"I know this post will be overlooked. I know I won't get any of the answers I seek from this. I know the only comment I will probably get is from the one guy that just posts the same 2 articles about self love and not hating yourself. But I need to scream this into the universe so that it hears me.

What have I ever done? To deserve the misery you have given me? At every step and turn of my life? I try to make friends, I get bullied and learn Im different from everyone else. I accept that and lose every acquaintance I had. I try to love, again and again, only to learn that everyone is just broken, and they break everyone else around them just to spite the world. The universe has been so unkind and so unforgiving that I'm becoming one of these people. The wrath I feel is so powerfully dark that I can feel it swallow the golden heart I once had. Im going to kill myself. Not today. Not tomorrow. But when my parents die, I will literally have nothing left. No hope. No love. No support.

My only question is why? Why am I being so punished in this life? Is it payment for a past life? That I was so evil towards humanity that in this one it is only evil towards me? Was I Hitler? Stallin? If im being punished, shouldn't I know what for? So I dont do it again? I'm afraid of myself. Im afraid of what I know I'm capable of. And I'm afraid of what I'm becoming. I dont want this. I dont want any of this. I do not have control. I know that. I can only control myself, but how much pain can one person take? Is THAT why Im here? To be some test dummy to see how much it takes until a person breaks? How loneliness can turn you so evil. I forgive the world over and over when it doesn't deserve it. I allow people to treat me bad and walk away because I cant control how they feel, I cant help fix them, and I cant give them love that can reach them. And now no love can reach me. None but my own. And I only love myself enough to recognize that I've been a good person, despite all thats happened to me. So why do I continue to be punished? Why do I deserve misery after how I've treated everyone in my life? What more do you want from me?"
556,How to stop thinking so much?,"With covid and working from home, it leaves a lot of time on your own to think... and I'm already an over thinker! I'm talking about the inner monologue mainly... How to get it to shut up for a while? The thoughts aren't negative really just a lot of noise. It's tiring. 

I tried meditation but I didn't really ""get"" it... Same with mindfulness. Any good resources for this? Would prefer traditional Buddhist type rather than the new western adaptation of it."
557,Overwhelmed by News,"Tw: covid 
** if the post is funny, I’m on mobile. Just an FYI. 

It’s 4 am and I’m here scrambling to do a last minute gift wrapping for my bf (my dad on his way to work later may drop off some things for my boyfriend to take). My bf started feeling ill last weekend, got tested this week and was called back yesterday confirming that he has covid. 

The last few minutes I’ve been between feeling okay about covid and also between feeling fearful. My bf being tested positive for covid just kind of amplified my feelings. I’m overwhelmed and I’m afraid. I’ve seen stories of people who were doing well and suddenly their health declining and I’m overwhelmed because I have so many emotions going on right now. I also received a friend request from my boyfriend’s mom earlier. She’s asking me to tell my boyfriend to take vitamins and herbal medicine that she made (Asian parents lol) which my boyfriend dislikes. Meanwhile my mom is telling me to just cheer my boyfriend up, make him laugh, to not talk about covid, etc. both things are very conflicting and clashes with one another. 

I’m writing a letter to include into the present but I keep breaking down and crying, I see photos, I think about him, all these things are making me cry. I feel alone because I don’t want to worry or burden my boyfriend but I also feel so alone because aside from my boyfriend, I don’t really have anyone else to talk to about this. 

I would just like some comfort that things will be okay. Thank you for taking the time to read this."
558,“When your an adult”,"Have you ever had a family member tell you “your not an adult or when your out on your own.” 

Implying because you don’t follow their rules or expectations for yourself that you some how lost the privilege of being an adult. 

I’m 31 and my family still tells me I’m not an adult because I had suffered a six year chronic illness lost my job went on disability and had to move back in that time. 

I just feel I’ll never get there respect. They will always use this to try to get me to do what they want"
559,Alone this Christmas,"I know I’m not the only one. Who else is spending Christmas alone and what are you doing to keep your mental health up? I do not celebrate Christmas to be honest, therefore I love the irony - I get very lonely.   This is more down to the fact that everyone is absorbed in their Christmas celebrations - for the record, I do not blame them at all and wouldn’t have it any other way. But it’s still hard, you know? I do have my 2 dogs and budgie who are the best, but sometimes I wish they spoke back!!"

565,Weird intention to do stupid decisions,"Hello everyone,
Currently  I am 20 yo, and I have a fair share of stupid decision-making.
When deciding to act, I can estimate the outcomes of different action I might take. And for me, the difficult thing is, I know what is bad, even worse decision, yet I still WANT to make that decision, aware of the implications and negative consequences it may lead to.
Why is that? I do not even understand myself. Even sometimes, I just like to go do the opposite choice of order, i just cant help myself.
I NEED HELP"
566,Am I a spoiled brat,"Ok so all my life my parents have brought me almost anything for me and my sibling, even now my parents recently bought me a Nintendo switch. But I’m having these thoughts of “what if I’m a spoiled brat” “do I rlly deserve this”, my parents never fight against gifting me stuff. Though I’m the one who always refuses to have them buy anything for me, unless I pitch in to help. But it always ends up with them giving back my money, or yelling at me to take it. I always feel terrible after they buy be things, I feel like it’s out of pitty. You see I do have OCD and have a history of self harm, I feel like they buy me anything I want just to keep me from hurting myself. On top of that my parents don’t exactly get along, with my father giving away money to his other daughter (from a girlfriend before he met my mom). My mom always tells me to spend his money, that I come first and if I want something ask. I hate it when she says this, i feel like shit when I look at all things they’ve given me. My parents weren’t the best growing up, I’m Hispanic so the practice of punishing a child with a belt or a lot of yelling was very much real. I did develop OCD when I was younger, and I know I didn’t receive as much love as a child but still I should’ve been happy to have not grown up poor as my parents did. I know I’m spoiled, and I always wonder why I’m depressed or why I’ve thought about taking my life when I’m so privileged to have all this. I always told me parents that once I get a job, I’ll pay them back for everything they’ve given me. I just can’t help but think about why I’m so sad, why am I such a brat."
567,Wanting to cause harm to living things.,"Ok, so I’ve been obsessed with looking at videos of gore and stuff like that for a few weeks. I am also feeling the need to kill something (ex I was cooking fries and felt like I needed to put one of my cats in the air fryer. I didn’t do it but I wanted to) I am already seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for problems with depression and a suicide attempt I have had a past of self harm and substance abuse I don’t know if this is important but I’m 18. I just want to know why I’m having these thoughts and why I enjoy watching things die."
568,Girlfriend has been super anxious lately.,So my girlfriend (22f) recently over the last week has been experiencing quite a bit of anxiety and nothing big has changed in her life. She has been trouble sleeping to the point where she is up for 3 days because her mind is racing. She has an appointment made to get on some medications but that’s almost a month away. What could I do to help her feel less anxious and more safe and comfortable? Thanks for reading.
569,Becoming my MDMA self,"I've stopped taking MDMA due to come downs however the thing I loved most about it wasn't the feeling. It was who I became whilst onit, and its still my favourite version of myself. When all of my insecurities are removed my comedy and intelligence shine, because I'm not afraid of being judged on my opinions. People gravitate towards me because of my confidence and generally everything goes my way. I tend to end MDMA nights with new friends most of whom haven't taken it.

Without it I struggle socially. I tend to meet new people before slowly being pushed out of the group for being too quiet or awkward, my jokes can't be delivered the same and my personality goes through so many filters that my intelligence gets lost. Its weird the amount of even women I've met on it who show a lot of interest only for it to fade when they meet me sober.

I just wish I could find a way of being more in tune with my MDMA self... Because i know thats me underneath all this bullshit limiting beliefs I can't shake. I hate who I am but I only hate how anxious and scared of being judged I am because it limits even my ability to think of the things my drugged up self could say without fear or self judgement. Even if I attempt to force myself into situations what I would do if I was on M, it ever ends the same because people can smell my fear...

I just hate myself and hate that I need substances to find a version of myself that I'm happy with"
570,I feel so bad,"I feel so down all time. It feels like something inside my chest is consistently bothering me. It feels like some obscure emotions have formed a cobweb like connection inside my chest and they are constantly making my chest pain. My head feels like it's going to burst- so many thoughts, sadness, insecurities, pain. If only I could kill myself with a gun. I wish to kill myself so much because this pain is unexplainable.
Rn I'm just lying on my bed and staring at the ceiling oblivious."
571,How to have a successful mental health day?,"The holidays have been kicking my ass, and I've been feeling more overwhelmed than I have in a long time. I'm so stressed that even my dreams are stressful, and I feel like I can't get a good rest no matter what.

I've been wanting to call off from my job to take a break, but I feel so guilty for doing so. Last time I called off sick and to go get a covid test, my boss told me she would rather me try to rally and come in. She didn't force me, but she didn't make me feel okay about it. 

So today I decided to take a half day. I couldn't call off because we already have a worker who has been out for a sickness unrelated to covid. So I said I'd leave early. Now that I'm here I feel like I can't leave, and might as well just stay. Plus I need the money so badly. 

Should I just stay? Should I call off another day? I feel like I've already ruined my chances of my boss saying okay to me taking a day off. 

How do I successfully have a good mental health day without just feeling guilty the whole time? Sometimes I think they just make it worse because of how much worrying I do at hom. But I'm just so exhausted. Any advice?"
572,I FEEL SHITTY. AGAIN.,been having anxiety attacks for the past few days and it is really shitty. can y'all be angels and send me anything that could make me and others that are having bad days smile. 🥺
573,Have you ever been prescribed a low dose of Fluoxetine such as below 40mg/day to treat OCD?,I'm switching from Clomipramine to Fluoxetine and am wondering if a very low dose can sometimes be effective? I'd appreciate anybody with any feedback or experience about this - Thanks
574,Why do I have to be so messed up in the head?,
575,A daily struggle.,"For years I have felt so many different things but maybe the best way tk describe it is lost. I feel lost, and I have a hard time. I started talking to a counselor this year but it's been so hard to actually get appointments with my schedule. I'm starting to wonder if maybe I should start over new with a counselor. The one I've been speaking to is nice, but I feel like she doesn't quite meet my needs or understand what I feel. Am I moving too quickly and just being impatient? I don't think I've been completely honest with my current counselor and I think I need a fresh start."
576,The Worst Thing You Can Do Is Deny How Fucked Up We All Are,"To keep it short and sweet, we're all fucked up. The sooner that you admit this to yourself and stop fighting it... the better off you will be.

Many people find themselves with plenty of issues, internally and externally. Unfortunately, most people only make it even harder for themselves when they can't accept it. They feel like they should be perfect and this only makes their problems so much heavier to carry.

Accept your shadow. You might just learn that there was nothing to be afraid of all along and that you aren't so ""bad"" after all.

Denying how fucked up we are is a form of self rejection and leads to many forms of self suppression. Attempting to combat problems with suppression only leads to their domination in our lives. 

Acceptance of how fucked up we are is the beginning of self-care and self love"
577,Age 56m and an underdeveloped human,"Sometimes when I’m down on myself, I feel ‘robbed’ of progress (especially in career) but I realize that’s a pretty powerless way to live my life. I’m trying to take on more responsibility in little steps. I listen to Jordan Peterson all the time. He says taking on responsibility is a good thing. I have a master’s degree in social work but always felt a bit too sick with the depression and the psychosis to do it. So I work retail, spending every thing I make. Going on for years. I turn 57 in June and would like to live in such a way that I could thank myself when that day comes. Thanks for reading, and I wish all of you well."
578,My older sister wants to kill herself and I don’t know what to do.,"She’s 18. I know she hasn’t been taking her meds the last couple weeks. She is always either at work or in her room, she never spends anytime with friends and family. She’s had seasonal depression before but this year it just seems especially worse."
579,Death thoughts,"Does anyone constantly keep having death thoughts? I mean I keep on having thoughts of people around me dying. Not only family or friends, anyone I see or think about. Eg- my dad is late from office I get that image, my mom goes to the terrace I think of that, a friend doesn't pick up the phone it comes to my mind, I see the news about a famous person and I still have the thought that he/she died. I had a real life experience few weeks back when my uncle died because of Covid, but I wasn't really close to him. Other than that I'm struggling with a breakup. That's all the ""struggle"" in my life that I can think of but my death thoughts are killing me. I don't know what to do."
580,How has your mental health been effective by COVID and shut downs?," I feel like asking this question is like opening a door to a Lovecraftian horror but I'm curious. Ever since this started in March, every day feels like I'm two bad comments away from a mental breakdown. I don't really have time to write everything out but I have cried multiple times in the work bathroom or closet (I feel like that's a sufficient summary). For context, I work in retail."
581,Some of my favorite comments I’ve received from my therapist this year,"“You have the ability to look at the positive at everything”

“I definitely could see you as a life coach” 

“I don’t think about my patients often but you came to mind because you have such a gift and impressive skills on how you think about life” 

“You’re on the far right side of the bell curve” 

“You ask great questions that I think on all week” 

Just got off the phone with my new therapist and she just hyped me up the whole time it felt great hehe. I’ve matured a lot within the last year after everything that has happened in my life. I’m a wise old soul I guess but in all honesty it’s just me trying my best!"
582,I was doing so well up until now.,"M22, I lost my dad two years ago. The whole responsibility of the house fell on my shoulders. I live with my mom coz she's dependent on me and she's kinda old (50s)

I'm the only child and was pampered my entire life and I spent the first 20 years of my life without learning how to lead a life on my own coz my parents' never let me leave to another place without an adult with me (helicopter parenting?). So I just skipped everything because I wanted to enjoy things by myself or people of my age and not with 40 year olds.

I didn't learn how to drive and things that normally kids learn as they get older. Never had a girlfriend coz my parents' friends were always keeping an eye on me and letting my parents know if I even TALKED to a girl. I just skipped on female interaction because of this.

All these things led to me losing my confidence, ability to stand up for myself, taking a decision and sticking to it.

I've been breaking down from the past two years coz the pressure of paying the house bills, taking care of my mom got to me.

To be frank, my mom has sacrificed a lot for me &amp; my dad (sold her home to get my dad out of debt when they were first dating, bastard ended up cheating on her for 2 years before he died) dad was a good dude overall (except the cheating aspect) and spoiled me with everything I needed but his presence. Mom kept herself in the home without going out at all good she wanted to take care of me.

Now, I just graduated with an MBA and there are a lot of opportunities for me in the neighbouring cities but I can't go coz if I do, then mom will be alone and she will feel lonely as she left all of her friends for my dad and dad's family doesn't accept her so they won't come to even talk to her.

Coming to the present, I got myself a work from home job paying like $163/month (The pay is very low, yes. Even compared to the cost of living of my place, but that's all I could get considering its work from home). 

I completed one month on 16th Dec and everything was great up until today (17th) when the boss and I had a miscommunication and he gave me a final warning and that if I made the mistake again, I'd lose my job.

And everything came crashing down. I started feeling resentment towards dad, mom and anger towards myself for not being good enough. 

Mom has never accepted the fact that too much of helicopter parenting made me what I am today. Socially awkward, can't stand up for myself, isn't confident in public (complete opposite of my parents). She always says that I've to change. I know I have to change and have to become better. But I CAN'T!!

I want to be better but I don't know how! The next question she asks me is (not even kidding here) ""So when will you be better? How long will it take? I was not like this when I was your age, I was Brave""

I can't talk back because the one thing she has when proven wrong is to cry. And it works cuz I don't want to see her cry.

I really want to grow my career and become something in the society but I feel my mom is holding me back. I honestly don't know what to do! I've contemplated killing myself twice after dad's death because of the pressure but nothing recently."
583,Sexually abused but I feel nothing. Should I feel something?,"I, 24m have been sexually abused three different times over my life including one rather violent incident when I was very young. However I feel literally nothing about it. I’ve heard a lot of stories from friends about their abuse stories and it always gets them choked up, or they experience flashbacks, or even just not wanting to talk about it. To me it’s nothing. I process it as an event that happened. I have no issues talking about it to people, I experience no mental pain from it... I feel like I should feel something about it but I don’t. Is this something I should be concerned about? What does this mean for me? Do I need to explore this with a therapist?

As an aside and possibly related I have issues dealing with grief. I’ve buried a fair amount of family members in my time and never cried or even felt sad at the funerals. Normally I’m able to empathise with others about pretty much anything but when it comes to grief at the loss of a loved one I feel nothing for them. Just concern about how sad they are and not knowing what to say or do."
584,I have wanted to give up for a long time. I don't know why I'm still going.,"I have struggled with anxiety and epilepsy for years now, and the anxiety keeps getting worse. I used to play video games to keep myself happy, but I realised that I got more seizures. And seizures is my biggest fear. They are the reason for my anxiety, for my dark thoughts that I don't want to write out. 
Every day everyone expects me to go back to school, even though that is where the anxiety is the worst. I don't even know if I'll be able to make it to my dad for Christmas. And I love my dad very much, I miss him. But I'm also scared of all the anxiety I know I will get by going there. I just want to be happy, or at least not afraid."
585,Damn snow...,"I am exhausted and depressed now. Our kids were putting up a fight about shoveling the (at least) 20 inches of snow that we'd gotten overnight. I don't know how many cm that is...sorry. I had to go out and help, and unfortunately, my asthma has gotten so much worse (because of the anemia, which is low iron in my blood---iron helps in the transporting of oxygen to the body via red blood cells) AND I have a B12 deficiency, which doesn't help a bit either. :( So I'd had several asthma attacks during the Great Snow Removal of 2020...and I feel like I am going to pass out...BUT... I am happy the walks and the 10 billion steps we have out front (ok ok...there are a lot less than that) are clear and salted.

 

The 18 year old, the 16 year old, and the 13 year old DID end up helping...a LOT.

&amp;#x200B;

I am forever grateful. They really are good kids. :) Hubby did the back steps (there are less of them, but you take your life in your hands when you go down them...you practically need rappelling equipment. Yeah, they are THAT steep. I guess you can just don skis at this point and do a Black Diamond run.  


I make jokes, but really I am feeling very sad and just not very funny right now. I haven't eaten yet today, and I don't want to eat. The feeling of hunger is like an old friend...comforting. I guess I will go try and nap now. I am awfully sleepy now too. TY for reading!"
586,Depression and guilt during the holidays,"I feel like shit, nothing out of the usual, but my family thinks its just me being a bitch. I'm 13 and because I'm a minor who is still under the direct command of my parents, I have practically been thrown into a whirlpool of Christmas lights, wrapping paper, and trashy holiday music. It also doesn't help that most of my family is religious and I am a raging homosexual atheist. So lately I've been sitting in my room with the Christmas Drag album by IDKhow blasting in my room hoping to appease their Christmas craving, but to no avail. Apparently dallon weeks is to cynical for them, but they all love grinch! I just can't bring myself to enthuse over the blitz and bling that is Christmas whilst I'm dealing with my own issues that they would never be able to understand in the first place. Dysphoria and depression don't vacate for the holidays and at this point in my life they practically control my every desision. Am I being selfish for not putting the wants of my family over my needs? Is it rude to not like something everyone else I know loves? Because that's how it feels."
587,How have people reacted to you opening up?,"Honestly I'm super traumatized about speaking about my mental health. I come from a conservative asian household so I've never been good at sharing my feelings. But I decided to take a leap of faith one day and tell my friends about my depression and suicidal thoughts over a skype call. 

The call went silent... then I heard someone go ""oh. okay"" and they just moved on. I felt so embarrassed and I blamed myself for making everyone uncomfortable with my disgusting self. After that it took me 5 years to tell anyone else I was depressed and struggling with depression/ed/self harm. 

That story was even worse. I went to my hs art teacher and showed her some thumbnails for an art project about my mental health. Prior to this I had watched some mental health acceptance videos and I felt that maybe my artwork could help someone. So I worked up the courage and shared my idea (at the time I felt deeply ashamed of being depressed and I hadn't told a soul since the friend incident). She looked at it and said verbatim: ""Pick something happier. And you don't look depressed either."" 

Man."
588,"How can I stop being ""reactive"" around people?","I've seen I can very easily get angry, and my face wears my emotions.  This tends to happen a lot particularly when I'm around people who act ""quickly"" do everything in a rush, speak a lot, etc. I get easily overwhelmed by high sounds and find it irritating when I'm around people who speak loud or lack listening, speaking too much. 

Its so embarrassing in a way and frustrating to realize I have this problem. I don't get physically evident is more in my face, words, and tone of expressing. 

How can I deal with this, is there a book, an approach, or strategy to change this unhealthy pattern?"
589,COVID Mental Health,"Now that COVID seems to be here for a little longer, what are people doing to try and keep their mental health in check? Any methods people can share?"
590,Sometimes I just sit in my room without the lights on and stare into the abyss,"Sometimes I just sit in my room without the lights on and stare into the abyss . Just so empty and it’s like I’m not even in my body , it’s just a shell . I feel so numb that I can’t hear or see anything I just stare into the darkness . I can pass hours doing this , doing nothing . My mind is blank and I just don’t exist for a few hours. I don’t talk or move or think , I just am . If you ask me what I’m doing I could not tell you , I am so consumed in nothingness . Sometimes I will silent cry . I’m not sad , I’m not anything. Tears will just come out and wet my cheeks but I am oblivious to them . I don’t pick up calls or awnser texts even though I hear them . I’m in another world and I don’t feel alive . I don’t even use words anymore it’s just mmm , yeah , ok . My eyes are glazed and I’m empty inside ."
591,I’m at my lowest,"I’m a 24 year old guy,I’m a veteran and recently out of the military. My best friend who I’ve been with for almost ten years is divorcing me. My dad and brother both hate me and can’t stand me moving back in until I get on my feet. I got in a big argument with my dad last night and left and got me a really nice hotel. I’ve been hospitalized twice with two suicide attempts in the last three months. I keep fucking up more and more. I feel empty and just want to start school back up so I can distract myself. Somehow with two suicide attempts I manage to keep my gpa pretty high. I just want my best friend back and to feel loved again. I’ve completely lost everything and just want my
Life to go back to normal.  I feel like I’m all by myself and for once in my life I am. I have to start over and just be better."
592,Struggling after a breakup. I feel like I’m not making progress fml.,"I broke up with my boyfriend of three years a couple months ago. He ghosted me for 10 days and it’s happened before and I couldn’t take it anymore... it was basically a toxic relationship and I still feel guilty for ending it. During that time, my chest was hurting like a mf, crying all the time, not eating well at all. After the breakup for about two months, I was still struggling...not eating much, isolating myself, all that. My doctor gave me antidepressants (bupropion) but I decided not to take it because of the side effects. 

Now, I really feel like I need to be placed on them because I just can’t stop fucking crying and feeling like shit. Every little thing fucking triggers me and I can’t seem to get away. I keep looking at social media and I keep looking if his family still follows me and I think they did on Facebook and idk why it’s triggering me. I feel like I’m not making any progress towards recovery. I’m not even happy about getting into grad school I’m not happy. I don’t like doing shit anymore.. I don’t go on walks or ride my bike anymore I don’t want to be near people. My parents were eating dinner yesterday and I’m in my room crying. I don’t know what to do. I hate feeling like this. I keep posting my story on another sub Reddit because I just need that constant validation that I made the right decision. It’s such toxic behavior of mine and I need to stop but I don’t know how.

594,Sucks,I'm too empty that it's painful.
595,Extreamly good therapist,Hi 👋I’m looking for a therapist that can treat a severe mental ill nest that has persisted for over 5 years. The price can go up to $300 but no more than that. Plz it has to have a good track record. If anybody knows someone it will be greatly appreciated.
596,Ex-friends and ptsd,"I read about ptsd and i slowly realized that my situation with my ex-friends possibly gave me ptsd.
Because I can’t go out without getting triggered or reminded or my family members constantly referring back to what happened with my current life, they would something around the lines ( you can’t make friends or trust anyone because of what happened with your ex-friends) 
And because of that I barely could be happy in a lot or move on happily and don’t get me on the anxiety and depression i have that development from it.
I feel i’m not happy.
I always want to kms because of it, and from the stress and anger and other stuff that is based from it. 
I have no motivation to do uni work or do anything but to remember what happened with the ex friends and blame myself."
597,I can't cope for much longer,"Hi everyone, I came here to tell you all that I have hit rock bottom for about the fourth time in my life now. The worst think about this one is that I've really been trying to get better. I've been finding the positives in every situation, been on my phone a lot less, smiling and laughing more if I make a mistake instead of punishing myself. The thing is, it hasn't worked. And now I'm here in bed in the dark at 5pm crying my eyes out and feeling so lonely. Knowing that I really tried this time around has made me just want to give up, because I can't seem to get better."
598,"advice on PTSD, latrophobia and ASD","I am 15, about two years ago i had a very traumatic experience after reacting to an injection i had, i was in hospital for about a week and had loads of tests, nobody knew what was wrong. After coming out of hospital, i struggled with depression, it took me a while to get me the support i needed but when i finally did, everyone was brilliant. I got diagnosed with PTSD and am on the autism spectrum.

However, i still have a crippling fear of doctors, appointments, dentists, orthodontists, needles and even the thought of a covid test makes me panic. Obviously i’m under the age of 18, my mum books and takes me to appointments. I have non stop nightmares weeks before the appointment, flashbacks and i even worry about appointments i aren’t even gonna have. 

I am concerned, i tend to avoid appointments as much as i can due to the trauma. I am a very healthy person apart from a few hormonal issues which is the main thing that keeps me going to doctors. I haven’t been back in the hospital i was admitted to since the situation, we try our best to arrange appointments somewhere else. I haven’t been to the dentist or the opticians since either, i struggle even walking past places like that.

I’m worried because when i’m older and more responsible, am I gonna be able to do this? I need to keep healthy and get checked but going to the doctors is so much for me. I’m willing to go down private healthcare (i’m in UK) or even if people have doctors/dentists in the south that they recommend for people like me. I’ve googled some of this stuff and a lot of people are like ‘you just need to get it done’ but it’s really not as easy as that.
 
Many doctors that i have seen have rushed appointments or made me feel bad and weak. I was told earlier this year that i needed a blood test, I burst into tears and her exact words were ‘calm down and get on with it’. I don’t want this to happen.

any help will be appreciated &lt;3"
599,I hate when your father leaves you at a young age and your mother is not able to financially support you or herself causing you two to live in a shelter for 6 years and one day waking up to find your mother bleeding from her wrist and lying lifeless on her bed made of old rags.,Then you live in a foster home for the rest of your childhood not being able to sleep at night because you are constantly thinking of your mother's suicide and contemplating whether you should do the same to save yourself from the pain.
600,I'm just happy being alone?,"As the title says. I am a mum of 3 and I have a fiancée. I'm happy with my life, like yeah money wise things could be A LOT better but whatever. My kids have a roof over their heads, a warm bed to sleep in at night and lots of food to fill their bellies. But the thing that annoys me, is my partner always says how I need to put myself out there and start meeting up with old friends etc. And I completely get WHY he is saying that, I feel like maybe he sees other girls my age on Facebook posting things with their friends, getting dressed up to go out, maybe thinking that that should be me. But it's not what I want? It's never been what I want. I'm happy being on my own, like I mean I literally have NO friends. I have a few acquaintances I would converse with on Facebook from time to time but no friends. I don't really know why? I've kind of always been like this since a teenager, I've always just been on my own and never really had a ""best friend"", so I'm just comfortable with being on my own and I don't think that I'll ever WANT to be that person that goes out with friends etc. Like yeah it would be nice to have mum friends but I'm the youngest mum at my kids school and a lot of girls my age that I know are only really starting to have babies now and my youngest is already 15 months. 

I also just find it really hard to keep a friendship? Like I'm not the type of person that will sit and text you all day, I'm like the hardest person to get in touch with cause I just tend to not reply to people because I can't really be bothered. So I know I've closed myself off from having a friendship, but I'm comfortable with it. Does that make sense?"
601,I am just build fucking different,
602,I have something weird happening to me lately. I'll try to simplify it.,"Two grains of sand but as large as the average 14 year old person. Still have the same physics and fall down without making a noise. As soon as I imagine that, bam. Heavy weight on my back, it gets way harder to breathe.




What's wrong with me????"
603,"Hard to describe mental issue, help appreciated","For the past 3 years I've been suffering from a strange problem, where basically I fixate in my bottom front teeth. I think it started from when I used to wear a plastic retainer mold and night and would bite down, to get it to fit better. Now, for some reason my mind fixates on that ""hurts so good"" type of feeling when you grind your teeth. Even if I make sure never to grind, it still throbs, hurts and feels good/painful at the same time. I've been trying so hard for this time to keep my mind off of it, but it's nearly impossible. The thing is, that it seems to be more mental, because if I direct this stress type of energy elsewhere in my body, it basically just transfers. It's like I always need to be exerting and feeling pain in some way. It's less sometimes, but the only guaranteed time that it goes away is when I'm falling asleep. 
I just really want this to go away. I feel like a crazy person, and it makes me feel numb in many other aspects of my life, even gives me sexual disfunction because all of my energy is concentrated elsewhere."
604,Just wondering if I can get help or any friends.,"I’ve been feeling fake lately I have no good personality with my life. No motivation, no friends, nobody coming into my life that’s new. I’ve been wondering if anyone new will come into my life and will accept me for who I am but I know I need to change. And I’m not looking for an intervention either. I don’t need an intervention because nobody can help me I’ll act like I’m feeling good about myself but will return to other bad habits. Also I was wondering if someone could talk to me just for a little like be yourself with me. Just be real. Don’t pretend. It’s very hard accepting me as to though me accepting someone in my life to be happy with who I am. Just need a little advice maybe it will help me change my own bad habits. ⛔️ WARNING: I’m very habitual when it comes to careless acts."
605,Sister having problems with reality,"My sister recently has been telling me stories about like her role as the youngest and shit like my mom was never home, my grandmother raised us, when it actually, my mom never left us until like maybe late middle school, and even that was like every other week and it was for like 3 days. She also said she used to budget the family at like age 12-13 so she could keep my mom from spending money, but like my mom has a six figure paying salary and we were never in money troubles, she just likes to spend a lot and then say she’s broke lol. not the point, she also lies a lot for like no reason, i mean to her obviously it’s making sense it’s just i’m confused on what’s going on, I have bpd and i’m just wondering if these are like early signs to some thing? also we just moved to a new town and that’s when she started talking more about her “problems” but idk what’s going on can someone please help! it would be really appreciated :) then again maybe i have this skewed reality and she’s right so you never know"

607,Getting a super good vibe from cbt,"I've been practicing 'mindfulness' without guidance for a year and I think I've bought a few neurotic behaviours into 'mindfulness' practice, I did seem to be improving for a while mentally but recently the improvement seems to of ceased and is going backwards in my opinion.

Anyway I decided that I have issues that require therapy so even though I'm not rich I paid for the best in my hometown and wow this cbt stuff seems to be having an instant affect in regards to dwelling on things.

So traumatic events occurring seem to have a different frame to them, they are now grit for the mill rather than something I should try and ignore and forget about and I can truly let my thoughts go with this approach.

Today I experienced a terrifying event but after analysis its done, I'm not dwelling on it at all.

I'm currently at the stage of categorizing my thoughts and after I get used to this I will move onto challenging them but even doing this analysis seems to dissolve the negative feelings they produce, and these feelings dont return until a similar situation occurs.

Ironically after giving up on my possibly botched version of mindfulness practice in daily life and practicing cbt instead I feel more present than ever before."
608,support groups,"anyone know of any free virtual (zoom, etc) support groups for people suffering from mental illness? Individual therapy has never helped me in the past and I thought this might help."
609,Support groups for late 20s and up about aging anxiety?,"Hi, I was wondering if there's a support group on Reddit anyone can recommend for older adults dealing with aging anxiety or fear of death and stuff like that? I turned 29 this year and am starting to get obsessed with anxious thoughts of my parents dying and stuff like that. I've also become a slight skincare addict. I don't know where to go to talk about this stuff. I don't know if this qualifies as a midlife or quarter life crisis since I've had anxiety my whole life. It's more like a ""whole life"" crisis but just intensified as I become more aware of our mortality."
610,How do I tell my mom a secret I’ve kept from her for so long?,"For over the past five years, I’ve been verbally, physically and emotionally by my mom. I try to keep my head up but it’s impossible when everyday, I am reminded of how ugly, ungrateful and bitchy I am. Today I just couldn’t take it anymore so here I am.

I most likely have Dermatilloma. It’s a mental disorder where one picks any scabs or lesions  on their skin. I have been picking for 5+ years and am still undiagnosed. My mom’s been beating me and yelling at me to stop but I just can’t because it’s so tempting to touch and peel and feel the skin come off of me. She took her shitty parenting a whole step further and stopped paying my school tuition fees, make me go to work (I am 14 mind you) and even once stripped me of my privacy. Every time she screams at me for how ugly I am, I just can’t bring myself to tell her that I am ill and it’s not a phase or anything. How do I tell her? I want it to stop. I feel like she’s going to disown me anytime soon. Please help me. It would be greatly appreciated. 

I think it’s partially her fault as well. She never when to research anything or put any effort to find a cure. You really think beating and yelling at your child solved their problems? 

Sorry if I am rambling nonsense. I am not doing too well."
611,Can a therapist disclose information to a third party without your permission,I had a therapist expose things I told him to a third party recently. I didn’t say anything that would alarm him. It was just personal aspects I told him during therapy like insecurities and things I was scared of. He went and told a few family members my personal stuff I trusted him with. Is there anything I could do bout this. I feel violated and betrayed.
612,I’m tired of being in the trenches,"MentalHealth Community please offer me your thoughts and advice. 

I am married and have been struggling to convince my wife of her insecurities that she has people that want to be friends with her. 

Quick background, my wife is close to her siblings and in particular one of her her siblings. My wife at some point in her life decided she only wanted her sibling as her only true friend. Her sibling is younger than her by a few years and even the friends my wife grew up with in school and are the same age as my wife are better friends with my wife’s sibling. My wife admits she is not the best at keeping up with her connections. Won’t text, call, let someone know she is in town to make plans and has seen this is a fault of hers. She has alienated many friends that would have considered themselves close to her including her school friends that decided to become closer friends with her sibling. 

My wife has these highs and lows of depression (not clinically diagnosed) of saying she has no friends and that she is lonely. She usually feels this way when she sees me interacting with my friends and cannot immediately communicate with her sibling. She decided to put her eggs in one basket and have told her to work to build bridges and make time for others. To strengthen the friendships she has through work, through the community we live in, and she says she will and never does. It’s back to just building on her relationship with her sibling that to be brutally honest would not care if my wife decided not to be her best friend anymore. My wife’s sibling has plenty of friends and doesn’t care to put in the amount of effort my wife does. 

This is so draining to deal with and I cannot get through to my wife. It’s affecting my mental health. What so I do?"
613,Why do I have such a hard time going to work,I enjoy the work im doing when I go I have a good day im in a great mood when I get off and everything is great but recently I've had a hard time making myself go I dont know why and it's putting a strain on my relationship and seeing my partner like that hurts and makes it even harder what do I do how do I make myself go or trick my brain into being ready idk some advice please
614,where to start,"I am lost, mentally and i have no idea how to find myself again, some days i think i know who i am.. but then again probably not. I’m struggling with money, with my relationships, with my head telling me only the negative possibilities. Lately i’ve been questioning my sanity more and more. Who am i, why am i like this, what do people really think of me, why can’t i stop being lazy and unmotivated, and why do i hate myself so much. I know i have the capacity to achieve things, but i’m lost. I’m stuck and i’m scared i’ll never change. This is just something i want to share.. if anyone’s felt this way or has anything to say please do, I’d really appreciate it."
615,So I had this super weird thing happen? Have some questions.,"So my whole life I’ve been living with anxiety. Like really bad social anxiety that keeps me from living a normal life. I thrived in high school, I lived in a town of 1,500 people and there were like 19 people in my class so you could say I am small town sheltered. My whole family and all my friends from my home town are conservative I am extremely liberal and political views are just a part of it I definitely have a way different personality than the average local were I lived. But I didn’t let my anxiety or my differences stop me from making lots of friends and memories. Since I had basally 0 responsibilities it wasn’t that hard to keep a good social life. Skip a couple years and now I’m getting ready for collage, just thinking about going to collage a year in advance was enough to send me into a full on anxiety attack and it kept me up some nights. I am now half way done with my first year in collage and I’m starting to realize that I was scared for nothing. Don’t get me wrong Iv been in a lot of uncomfortable situations that sometimes made me want to quit but recently I feel like someone flipped the switch and my anxiety disappeared. I didn’t get my license until like 2 months ago because I was so scared of driving and I wouldn’t even go to the store to buy milk for my mom 5 months ago because it was to socially exhausting to talk to the cashier now I do all those things plus more and I don’t even think about it. My over all mood has improved and I feel less exhausted from having to talk to people every day. I also sleep better.HOW DOES SOMETHING THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY WHOLE LIFE JUST DISAPPEAR LIKE THAT?

Edit: I have been using cannabis but that should have nothing to do with it because i have been since I was 15 for nightmares.The sleeping pills my doctor gave me made me feel like crap and a read somewhere that cannabis decreases rem sleep and I also saw reports of heavy cannabis users not dreaming. I got to say even though it’s illegal and not recommended by my doctor I’m glad I made the decision to start using it."
616,I genuinely need help right now,"This has probably got to be one of the most stress inducing times of my life. I have always been struggling with this anxiety of mine for a good couple of years now, sometimes it peaks at certain times. Right now, I am suffering a 'peak', and it's the last thing I need because I have my A Level exams. What makes things more stressful is that because of coronavirus, my AS Level exams got cancelled so now my full grade comes from just my second year. Plus, I have university applications to do on the side, so juggling this shit is so hard and taking a toll on me.

Everyday now, I feel like a two-legged embarrassment as well. I keep remembering bad things, and I keep letting others humiliate me, I feel like a comic tool people use to amuse themselves with and to make themselves feel better from the fact that they will never become as completely ridiculous as me. When these thoughts arise, I bang my hand on the table, I cry hard as fuck, in, I hate myself for torturing my family with my useless problems, I feel guilty for making them waste money on me knowing damn well I will never succeed in life. I think that I will always be reserved to my fate as a fuck up, an embarrassment who will only bring shame to her family. I can't go on. I feel like it's impossible to move on."
617,F17. Really need to speak to another woman about something,"HUGE TW: SEXUAL ABUSE, ANIMAL ABUSE
.
  Hi, i want to preface by saying thank you so much for reading and if you're a male please don't dm me. Thank you. Growing up i wouldnt say i was neglected but my parents are both mentally ill and always had a lot on their plate and i suppose i didn't receive as much love or praise as i wouldve liked to at a young age? I'm not exactly sure. Neverless ive felt like i was severely depressed and passively suicidal since i was about 7 years old. 
.
Around 8 or 9 i found the wide unsupervised internet and started finding that love and validation other places. Self harm and injury was a really big part of it but i also started to find it in men online through sex. From ages 9-13 id lie and say i was 15-20 (usually 18) and get validation through sending nude photos and videos and sexting in general. It wasn't usually normal sexting though.
.
It started as normal sexting and really quickly progressed into some of the most horrific porn related things you can imagine. Id tell these men i fantasized about being molested by family, rape role plays, things involving animals and one actually sent photos and videos of women having sex with dogs, some were so turned on by the fact i was underaged that was a whole other ordeal, lots of ddlg type stuff with pacifiers and things i owned as a child being used sexually, id go on chat roulette sites and have these men degrade me and abuse me without ever actually having to me there. Most of these happened before i was 11. 
.
Ive only very recently started to really remember these events and i can't find any research or support on this specifically and i don't know what to do. Ive usually been a quite sexual but mostly surprisingly normal teenage girl with a normal sex life but i haven't been able to finish for the past week which isnt like me at all. I feel like it wasn't really traumatic because it was all online and a choice i was consciously making. I just really want to talk to a woman. Thank you so much for reading it means the world to me."
618,Looking for advice. Trouble expressing myself and being vulnerable,"I am looking for maybe some advice or like, something I could try to work on this. Usually, I have a really hard time expressing my emotions, especially verbally. Once I am more comfortable with a person it’s easier but that can take a long time and even then, there are things I still can’t say. I feel really embarrassed usually, or I get really worried about how they might react to what I’m saying. But, last night my girlfriend and I got into a sort of argument? We haven’t been together for too long, so we’ve never really argued before. I wouldn’t really call this an argument. But, she was upset about something that I said, and she was a little abrasive about it, and I just shut down? I was thinking all of these things in my head but it was impossible to say it out loud. I was so afraid she would get really angry at me if I said anything. My heart was pounding, my whole body felt tingly- like pins and needles when you lose circulation- only not as intense. I often feel like I can’t say anything, and can tell myself in that moment like “just say it, what are you doing?”. So that’s not new but my heartbeat and everything i was thinking was so LOUD I felt so small. I guess I’m looking for ways to work on this or how to cope with this? Is there anything I could try that would help me? I don’t want my inability to express myself to get in the way of my relationships. The friends I have in my life are really understanding of me, and I think they get it better than I do myself. But I don’t want people to have to cater to me. I don’t want to damage my relationship because I’m shy or whatever. If you think of anything that might help please let me know. Thank you for reading all of that if you took the time to!"
619,What should I do? Serious advice wanted.,"I have a younger sibling and after the pandemic, they have been on their phone way too long. So much to the point where they are falling behind in school. My sibling used to have straight A's, but her teacher emailed recently and told my parents that she did not hand in any homeworks and is basically failing the class.

I think she is depressed and social media/TikTok is really affecting her. She has been very active on all the social movements and has strong opinions on mental health. That's why when I try to tell her to do her work instead of laying in bed all day, she tells me that I don't care about what's going on in the world and that her mental health is more important. She tells me that even if she opens up to me, I shut her down, which I really try to never do. However, it seems that anything that goes against what she wants me to say is seen as ""bad"" even though I am just trying to look out for her because I care about her future. I understand that this is a hard time for everyone but I think everything she sees online about mental health is going really overboard. Failing school is not self-care and I think there has to be some kind of balance. I don't want to sound offensive to her, but I do not know what to do or say at this point.  

I tried telling my parents multiple times to do something and stop her  from using her phone, but my mother keeps telling me that she is the type to not listen so it's no use. That is why I am seen as the ""bad guy"" because my parents always coddle her and she never gets scolded. Therefore, anything I say or do regarding school is seen as stupid and as capitalist  -\_\_- 

If she does get  scolded, it's always in a nice way :/ sigh. Also, I do try to set a  good example, but it seems to not be working :( I am straight-A student  and involved in many extracurriculars. 

Should I tell her to seek mental help from a medical professional? I really do not know what to do at this point."
620,Everyday i hate people more and it scary me,"I’m 22F. I’ve never been a very social person, but it was a times when i actually had a social life and i enjoyed that. Right now I live away from my familly, i dont really have friends and i’ve never been in relationship. Im not going to my hometown for christmas this year, „because of covid”, but it just An excuse, i just dont want to see my familly. They’re not The best, but their not awful either. My only friend wants to visit me at New year eve, but im looking for excuses.
Its scares me, that i don’t like spending time with people. Their irritating me, im anxcious around them. Im diagnosed with social anxiety and depression, but i stoped terapy and talking meds, it never worked. 
I get used to be alone, it easier. But at The same time it hurts me. If i feel too close to someone, i run away. I want to be alone. But life seems to be so empty and pointless without others. 
Everyday i’m falling down deeper and deeper in hole od lonelyness and isolation, it hurts but feels safe and comfortable. 
I dont know if What i just write makes any sense, i just want to tell about someone, but i have noone."
621,Who do I go to for help when not even my mom believes I have eating disorders,"First time I asked her for a therapist, both her and the therapist said I didn’t need an appointment and it was just adolescence. Second time I asked her for a psychiatrist, the next day she told me she asked someone she knew who was a psychiatrist, and they both agreed it was normal (who btw only heard a brief summary of what I’ve been struggling with, assuming my mom fully understands I’m asking for help with an eating disorder and explained correctly, and didn’t even sit down to talk with me or take notes for at least an hour). Who do I ask help from when not even my mom believes I have an eating disorder. I’ve tried with friends and it only made it worse, my dad doesn’t believe in serious mental health issues (mental health issues are shamed where I’m from, but teens are now spreading more awareness tho), and i still have online classes so I can’t contact my school counselor. Please any help is appreciated! (I would pay for an online counselor but my parents can track what I spend so yeah)"

It does get better 

I am super drugged up on anti anxiety and sleep pills so goodnight Reddit, safe dream."
624,I haven't needed my 'sad music' playlist for 3 weeks!,"I can usually track my mental state by how often I listen to the sad songs on my Spotify.

You know the ones that make you even sadder.

I haven't needed them AT ALL recently! I think this is a good thing (:"
625,How do you deal with attaching yourself close to your friendships?,"I have been traumatized when I was in school when my School Counselor told me what my ""Friends"" were talking about me behind my back and what they actually thought of me. After that I started be this ideal friend to the friends I made - hanging out with them - helping them out - going to their house and chilling. Yet when I hear someone say that friends change and when that actually happens eventually it feels bad and can't help but wonder if is it just me or am I just a bad friend ? Is this even normal ?"
626,Inside Ride (66),"It takes time. Its about learning. Its about doing our best. That in itself is the most we can do. Everyone makes ""mistakes"". Everyone has moments that they act in, but reminisce on once that moment is over, we can't dwell and begin to regret our action, we must feel how we feel, watch our thoughts and move forward. Next time, do better. It will bug you, it will make you feel indifferent, it will allow you to feel uncomfortable, but remember thats where **Growth** is. 

Growth is always in the moments of hardships, pain, sadness, things that we don't expect but can not change since its already happened. I have had many moments that after I do something i'm like ""oh, I did that"", feeling embarrassed for a brief second, but knowing this is all for my highest purpose. Everything is for our highest selfs. It takes time and is always on Divine Timing. The way each of our paths and lives are different, unique, original. 2:22. Right place, right time.

Its snowing, its cold outside, the seasons have changed right before our eyes, we must stay focused. Focused on our mental health, our wellbeing, our crafts, our passions and our Divine Path. Life is about Trial and Learning, rather than what we have been conditioned to saying ""Trial and Error"", it is only an error if we do not learn from the action that we have done, next time. 

We can conquer this winter together. We can conquer Seasonal Affective Disorder together. Together, Separately. We Will. We Have.

I love you.

627,Best telehealth for mental health?,"A lot of the telehealth places I see are better for physical illness, rather than mental (some won't even treat mental.) I was diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety, insomnia, and ADHD years ago, so I'm familiar with medication, I just don't have insurance right now so I can't get it. I know a lot of the telehealth places are meant to be more affordable, especially for people without insurance. 

Anyone have any telehealth companies they recommend for MH stuff? 

(I know it's pretty much a guarantee I won't be able to get ADHD medicine because it's a controlled substance, that's fine. But help for depression/bipolar and anxiety would be great.)"
628,"I’ve started to laugh during panic attacks, is this normal?","Recently I’ve been having more frequent panic attacks, I’ve had them lots throughout the years but recently I’ve developed in laughing randomly during them. Is this normal? Is there a name for this? If I can’t stop the panic attacks, is there a way to at least not sound insane during them?"
629,Does anyone else get angry for a really long time?,"I know it's not healthy or good but it's just how I am. I took it from my dad who tells me not to do it but then he does it anyway. I don't think my parents think it's serious enough to get help either.

I can stay very mad for weeks. Not just grudges but actively mad. It doesn't seem to lessen unless the thing I'm mad about is fixed or  some sort of ""revenge"" is done to the person (nothing fatal or bad). Am I the only one?"
630,Does it really get better?,As you can understand from the title I am in dire need of someone to tell me that everything will be fine. Because even though I try and try and try I never seem to be at peace. Today I realized that I was crying in the exact same spot I did two years ago in my childhood home and it just made me feel like nothing ever gets better. Am I trying all these different things for nothing or just to make no progress at all?
631,Am I the problem,"So when I was born my dad was in the military and left me and my mom around and well it all went downhill for me my mom lived at my grandparents house on my dads side so then one day my grandpa told my mom that I will always have a place here at the house  and next day she had packed up and left and then she still saw me after she left me but she would leave me with strangers and random people without telling anyone and then I would always return sick and dirty and then one day my mom wasn’t-watching me and I had climes on a slide and I fell off and hit my head causing blood to flow to my brain and cut off my circulation and then i should of died but I somehow lived.
My dad me and my dad never had a good relationship ever but what broke the relationship completely is when I had a surgery go wrong and I was about to die again and was on death row and my grandparents called my dad and he said he was to tired to come up and see me if anything else he would and now as I look back it’s my fault I’m the failure and the fuckup who no ones wants around thank you for wasting ur time to read this...sorry for the lack of punctuation btw"
632,Caught my girlfriend cheating on me,"
So I caught my girlfriend cheating on me with two of my coworkers. When I confronted her about it she started crying and told me it was all my fault she did it.

She then said she wasn’t happy and when girls aren’t happy the cheat and that’s ok

Her dad talked to me and said if my daughter isn’t happy then she’ll be out cheating on you and me and the entire family are ok with it

And she kept saying see see, I’m allowed to cheat on you

Does anyone have any advice for me? I don’t know what to do.  I had a hard time believing everyone was serious but they are, her family supports her cheating on me if she’s not happy"
633,What was this eye doctor inferring?,"He was trying to diagnose me with something Bc I had convergence insufficiency. He described me as “people like us” and was clearly thinking I had some condition or something. I’ve mentioned trouble in schools he mentioned how people like us “have everything just the way we like it and don’t enjoy change.. but can handle change really well if it happens”. He asked if I startle easily and i said yes.. he said this is something that’s caused in early childhood. 

He asked if I’m oppositional and don’t like being told why to do, if I use poor language towards my parents, and said I would be bothered by things like light touch but firm touch wouldn’t bother me. He is right about a lot of this but my parents are abusive."
634,Am I okay?,"Random Happy Memories

Hi everyone. I had to ask this question: “Does anyone else randomly get thoughts or images of happy events in the past?” I’ve been recently having these happen to me and I’m not sure what to make out of them  any advice would help. Thanks"
635,Does anyone else feel like you’re not connected to you body?,"I don’t have any memories from my eyes. All my memories are as if I’m the little turtle on a cloud from Mario cart that fishes you back onto the road. I remember everything as if I’m floating next to my body. And when I start having panic attacks and feel like I’m shoved back into myself and it’s the worst feeling. So wrong and disgusting. I don’t feel like I’m inside my body, ever. Sometimes I’ll sit quietly and try to get back inside myself and damn it’s horrible. 
I am writing this, I am sitting here. But my ghost, my me isn’t inside my body. I’m floating around next to myself. 
Is this a normal human thing that everyone feels but doesn’t acknowledge? Or is this a me thing?"
636,Supporting partner going through withdrawal.,"My partner has been smoking weed since he was a teen. He was in a high stress job and it was a good way for him to relax after work. When we first met, he had it under control and would only smoke to relax but then after we married, it became quite frequent. Once we started having kids, he wanted to quit and over the years have picked up smoking and then will quit. Everytime he quits, he goes through massive withdrawals. The physical symptoms abate after 2 days but the mental issues like depression, restlessness, irritability can last for weeks! We knew that withdrawal did this to him and he also knew weed was his massive weakness. Once he starts, that’s all he would do all day and he would lack motivation for anything else. 

This last time he picked it up, COVID didn’t help, he was doing part time work that was boring and he was bored at home. Now he’s trying to quit again and going though the same shit we’ve been through on and off for the last few years. I know that he’s now finally quitting knowing that weed really is just toxic for him and he says he will never touch it again. But at the same time, I’m just so annoyed that we’re going though the same emotional roller coaster again. The last time we went through this, he was talking about leaving. 

He’s now sober but is restless as he is not working and COVID makes it difficult to find a job. He wants to spend money on stuff which makes him happy temporarily but on one income, it is hard. So he complaints about being bored and not being able to get what he wants and then gets depressed. I don’t know how to support him anymore. The first few days of his detox, I tried to make sure I was with him ( while working from home), talked to him when he’s down. But it’s now a week and he’s still going though the motions and spending time in bed by himself a lot. I know I should be spending time with him and talking to him but it’s just the same conversation all over and to be honest, I’m just exhausted to be dealing with this again. 

I really hope that this is the last time he picks up that toxic shit and that he really keeps his promise this time because I don’t know if I can cope with this another time. Just really wanted a rant and to see if there’s any sage advice on how to support him that actually works! He knows it’s temporary and so won’t want to get professional help. In all likelihood he will be back to normal in another week or 2 but another week or 2 of having a moping partner who just complains about boredom and how life sucks when that’s not how I feel, is really starting to bring me down."
637,Hello I have a question,"Hello my name is Izzy I’m 18 years old(sorry if my grammar is not the best I’m form the Netherlands) 
I have been diagnosed with depression and I’m on anti-depression but I have been feeling really bad again and have had some fall backs on like staying in bed and not doing anything all day and self harm again I started to talk about it to my best friend her mom and she said that I maybe should look into a mental hospital for my depression and self harm but I’m not sure how my family will react to that and I don’t know how to approach my dad about a mental hospital because they not really supportive in anything when I speak about it 

So my question is what do you guys think do I need to listen to my best friend her mom or try talk to my dad"
638,Can you get so good at managing you're emotions that you turn yourself into a psychopath?,"Like say, you have had severe depression your whole life and became really good at not letting the bad emotions affect you that consequently no emotions affect you anymore?"

641,I am 2 or 3 months free of self harm!,.
642,"Show up to hospital seeking mental help? Sorry, can't help you.","Just a long rant. This week has been rough. Rough enough that I found myself driving to my local hospital in an attempt to speak to someone, ANYONE about setting up an appointment after being on hold for nearly 1.5h, bounced from one department to another to another (not sure how there's this much confusion on where to a connect someone looking for ""adult psychiatric help"", but k) and eventually was either dropped or hung up on (logic tells me the former but depression goes with the latter for suuure) by the same hospital earlier in the day . I figured showing up in person would ensure that I leave with an appointment, or at least a phone number to the correct department. To put it bluntly--I was there to actively seek help or a connection to some kind of help after coming to the realization that therapy has not been working as it should right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Y'all. They legit sent me away lol. I was allowed inside the main entrance and COVID screened (temp check, pretty standard in US right now), was told I was in the wrong building and to go across the street to another building to ask where I should go. I do that. They tell me that I can call the number that dropped hung up on me, but they themselves can't direct me to the department because they are only allowing patients with appointments inside as a precaution (one legit goes ""well i THINK theres a behavioral unit in the basement hold on..."" before relaying this other info, btw). Cool, makes sense. Would someone from that department be wiling to meet me at the elevators in the lobby and explain how their system works/which departments I should be seeking out for my needs, then? Literally just to help me start to navigate this. No, they really can't, but I can try calling the number!! So I do that in the lobby and sit there for literally 45 mins before someone picks up and again starts the bouncing process. Finally, someone picks up and is shocked that I was connected to their line as they are the child and adolescent behavioral unit, and this is now the 4th time I've stated that I am an adult looking for psychiatric attention on the call.  This kind lady FINALLY connects me to the right department and.......I get a voicemail. They're open remotely from 10-1 M-Th, and of course by this point its 1:30. With only one option to go, I left a voicemail. They said they'd get back to me in (hopefully) 48h, though! Well, its been four business days and nothing. I understand that 1.it's the end of the year so hospitals are busy as all hell, 2.we're in the throes of a pandemic that is rocking our nation and exhausting hospital resources from every angle, and 3. if i were really that bad I could have called 911, but they basically gave me a phone number I had already accessed through Google. Not rocket science by any means.  Regardless, I am so surprised at the lack of fucks given towards someone clearly struggling in a place designed to mitigate the suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

I shared the details of this experience with my therapist yesterday and she was shocked. You can legit be begging for attention at a literal hospital and not get it unless you're teetering on the 5150 line. Absolute insanity. THIS is exactly why people get way way worse before they get any better."
643,I can't concentrate!!!,"I stare at my screen at work for hours and do not complete a single task. I have plenty to get done, but I have a complete lack of interest/motivation/desire to do any of it. I take meds for ADHD, but it isn't helping. I feel like I will lose my job because of this. What should I do!?"
644,Is there something wrong with me?,Sonce i was 11 years old i REALY started to hate rodents like i wanted to torture them and make them suffer this part is going to sound sick but here it is: when i cant sleep i sometimes think of what torture methods i would use against rodents.And when my cat caught a mouse i picked it up and threw it at concrete and then stomped it and then it's organs got out. When i see rodent torture videos they make me so happy. I am sorry that i am saying these things to rodent lovers who are reading this and please tell me if something is wrong with me
645,Finding something to do,"TL;DR: bored without computer games. Can't concentrate on other hobbies. How to enjoy other things?

Hello everyone, I [M 54] have been afflicted by depression and panic attacks all my life and take a couple of anti-depressants to keep my head above water. I'm also an alcoholic, but have that under control these days. My partner [F 50] is incredibly supportive and affectionate, so all round a good and happy place to be. (Yay! It DOES work given enough time)

Problem that I still have is computer games. I've been playing since the late 80s and spend too much time playing strategy and open world games that I have always loved. I can become so immersed that I lose myself for hours sometimes.

I still go to work, cook, eat, spend a lot of time with my partner and socialise (pandemic permitting) but I can't seem to replace the games with anything. I've turned to music (listening and playing my synth), a little writing (just random stuff, but normally observational), getting stuff done around the house (service the car, fix broken stuff etc), but nothing can hold my attention for long enough. I can't even get stuck into a book. It can take me 5 or 6 tries to watch a movie and I can't binge TV.

I sometimes long for earlier days when I just drank, smoked and looked for sex. I enjoyed my days back then, but have all but given it up now. I don't smoke, won't let myself get drunk and sex is still very good (just monogamous now).

Why am I so bored without games? Has anyone else found a way to teach their mind to enjoy other things?"
646,A new perspective,"I've been depressed on and off for years but only recently started seeing a psychiatrist.
All my life my family called me lazy and I internalized that and feel guilty for spending so much time on the couch watching youtube. 
Well, today at my second session with the psychiatrist I told her about my daily routine:
Get up around 8am
Go for a walk 
Cook lunch 
Hang out with my family 
Lie down rest of the day 
And she seemed so proud that I go on walks and she even applauded me for not napping all day. 
It feels so validating to have someone else get excited about your seemingly little achievements!"
647,NDE moved me to a different reality/dimension,"I don't think im ill... but i guess that's the art of it.
My journey of utter confusion starts long before overdosing last year.. i was placed in an induced coma in which i spent 3-4 days lifeless with no memory of any events other then a strange series of pictures/moments/places i was able to interact with in a way I find hard to explain and really isnt the key topic I am here to discuss..

When i awoke everything felt relatively normal.. hooked up to all sorts of machines surrounded by family... everything looked normal.. everyone acted accordingly, i was showered with love and cared for like ive never been..
Months on I started to notice a strange unfamiliarity with the the general flow and vibration of this world.. like it looks and smells the same but everything everywhere is a little bit out... its like this place was cooked in the same pot with the same broth but before or after the place i was in before.. some flavours intensified, some didnt make it through at all amd some ive never smelt or tasted before.

For example. Before i woke from my coma there was no sich thing as a mandela effect.. i had never heard of the concept nor was it a way anybody in my direct or anyone in the communities/groups i am in online thought.
The clouds are different..almost painted on.
I got a cat (chilli) and he is the jet black cat i have had pictured in my head since childhood with the exact temperament ive always wanted and needed to the point i can feel that his presence and touch is a required tool for this journey/experience.
There is much more.. i take notes sometimes but should take more.

I can feel inside me something needs to be awoken and this place exists to help do that... nobody around me seems to be who they were but they are still themselves... its honestly like they're NPC's activated when i come close.. 

As a disclosure i would like to state that i dont feel delusional or see and hear things that are not there or feel the need to harm myself or anyone else..."
648,I constantly feel anxious without a friend with me,"I recently found out that I'm way too attached to my friends ( I only have 3 irl friends ) and I can't do anything alone in a public setting. One of my friends is in my class but she's been getting sick and needs to stay home. Now all I do is hide in the bathroom and never speak. People have asked me if I'm depressed/ok and honestly I'm not but the thing that isn't ok is me being alone. I feel like a shell of a person, like I'm a different person without that friend. It's true but it scares me so much. I want to be my own person. It hurts because I can't be who I was and I'm trying to develop a more open personality but it's so hard. Even though I'm very young I started vaping and smoking to get rid of the stress cause cuts are hard to hide. It's almost like I have two different personalities. Those two other friends are my lifelines and they help me a lot but I know I can't just fully rely on them. I'm even afraid of wearing skirts in public or tucking my shirt in my pants/skirts and I don't understand why. Basically I'm an emotional mess and I'm trying not to kill myself yet.

Any advice/encouragement would be nice ❤️"
649,I'm having very intense short lived moments of panic over nothing and have no idea what it is,"I've been suffering with these daily for my whole life but have never known what to call them. I have VERY (few seconds) short lived moments of intense panic at small or non-existent things. The best way I've found to describe them is if you imagine ur walking down a dark alley, thought you saw a person with a knife, had a moment of panic, and then realized it was a piece of cardboard.

 I'll then have some sort of a fading aftershock and usually whatever I was doing was interrupted. Ive thought in the past it could be some sort of reaction to being overstimulated or was some sort of heavily dialed back anxiety attack. 

For years it was debilitating, I'd have to take breaks every few minutes and it kept me from doing a lot of things because there times when I could tell I was far more likely to be triggered. (Uneven temperatures, certain environments, being overwhelmed, being out in large open spaces, excessive noise)

Ive very recently realized I can make them less intense with cbd and that's only made me more curious as to wtf they are in the first place. Cbd has pretty much stopped the parts that made life nearly impossible, but Idk if I wanna just keep taking it forever and hoping that it isn't a placebo that will just stop one day

Any pointers are greatly apreciated"
650,I don’t know how to move on.,"I’m not even sure where to start. I’m so hurt and i feel so alone. I have a great group of friends and i still can’t let the thoughts of him go. Me and my on and off boyfriend finally ended things officially after almost a year of dating. We’ve been through a LOT of shit together and haven’t always been on the best terms, however, when we were good we were so strong. We made each other so happy. We did what was best for us, our relationship had become very toxic on both ends during the end. But at one point in my life he brought more happiness into my life than anyone ever has. He used to be my best friend and I fell so in love with him. I thought we would be together forever. I recently got diagnosed with OCD which caused me to obsess over anxious thoughts and i put so much strain in him i pushed him away. I’m so hurt. I love him so so much. I didn’t want to let go, i just wanted us to be us again. I can’t stop thinking about him and i don’t think i can move on. I’m still very in love with him and i know he still loves me but now i’ve lost him because of my mental health and he’s lost interest in me and i’m so lost. I don’t know how to let him go. I don’t want to let him go. Any advice for moving on and learning to let emotional attachment go would be greatly appreciated❤️ He was my best friend for a year and my world used to revolve around him. I don’t want to replace him. I loved everything about him and i don’t think i’ll ever find that in someone else."
651,I’m not strong enough to take care of my sick mom.,"My moms cancer has been up and down and while she seems ok for the most part, she is doing chemo and taking a ton of medications as well as on dialysis. In the past couple months she’s developed cognitive impairment where she has a hard time remembering things, and her thinking and judgement has interfered with her daily life. 

We have an appointment with her doctor to discuss these issues but as of late I haven’t been able to fully be strong. I struggle with my own personal issues such as job loss, heart break and mental health and had multiple ideations of suicide this year. I feel I’ve lost all independence and taking care of my mom has become overwhelming and too much to handle.

I feel terrible for feeling this way but living at home with both my parents and being around this everyday is a constant battle. There’s constant arguments with my mother who has become increasingly stubborn and doesn’t trust me and my dad on suggestions and decisions that are for her own good. While she is capable of doing some things herself, she never finishes tasks and we can no longer rely on her and when she has her episodes of not thinking clearly, I have a tendency to lose it more easily. She gets mad, I get mad and we get in an argument.

The events of this past weekend has resulted in my breaking point as I’ve never witnessed such disasters till recently. I decided to help my mom and dad catch up on bills this past weekend as it was usually my moms responsibility and there were at least 3 bills that were delinquent - with the electricity bill having not been paid for 3 months. She texted my uncle 45 times his name because she thought she was searching his name in the contacts but was actually sending a message. She gets the passcode and keypad page confused and has locked herself out multiple times or actually dialed numbers. She fed my own dog chocolate cake not realizing and today she took a double dose of the wrong medication. All events resulted in arguments between me, my dad or mom. My dad had promised me he would hand her the medication but I feel like I can’t turn around for one second without things going wrong and I feel things won’t get done unless I do them. The house is a constant mess, laundry is always backed up so I did that this weekend. I finally asked my dad for our cleaning lady to come weekly as we need help, which he agreed with. 

My dad has done an excellent job in taking care of my mom. He takes her to appointments, takes her to the bathroom in the middle of night, gets her whatever she wants so she’s comfortable and does everything above and beyond but the stress of running a business in the middle of a pandemic and taking care of my mother has taken a major toll on my dad and I see it, so I try to step in with some of the responsibilities around the house but her cognitive impairment is taking a toll on me and all of us. We’re unsure if it’s chemo fog or early signs of Alzheimer’s or dementia but  we hope to find out soon with her upcoming doctor appointment.


In the mean time, I just feel like giving up. I’m not as strong as I thought I could be. I suffer from my own depression and anxiety and mental health issues and suicidal thoughts daily that taking care of my mom is starting to become a resentment and I feel horrible for even saying that. I’ve said horrible things to her that I regret . I’m so unhappy with my own life in general. I’m constantly on edge. I’m bitter and angry and argumentative and easily annoyed by everything including my own friends and I never get a chance for myself. Even when I try to meditate my dad always comes in and disrupts me making me even more angry and tense.  I’m unemployed, living at home, newly single after an off and on relationship of 10 years, I hate the way I feel and look. I have no motivation to want to do anything anymore and the second I do something for myself I feel guilty. I hate seeing happy people on social media enjoying the holidays so Ive limited my use. Well my parents said I can go and see friends but be mindful, I don’t want to go anywhere cause I fear I’ll bring something back to my mom, but Ive gotten to a point where I want to start focusing on my future, my happiness and repairing things and relationships in my life. I want to better myself and get out of this rut but I feel like I’m abandoning my mother by not being strong enough and wanting to focus on myself more and not on her so much. 

I don’t know how to go about anything anymore and I feel like a horrible person."

653,Self-soothing???,"Hey guys,

I'm diagnosed with BPD and there are often comorbidities. While I'm prone to some addictive behavior, can be very lightly hypomanic sometimes and stuff like that, there is no full blown comorbidity. But I've always wondered whether the puzzle makes sense already or not.

I just realised my self-soothing behavior. I've done that since I was a child and I still do it. I pretty much highly contentrate on some repetitive action. As a child I often went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet (those steps were important) and I there were very specific objects. I took them and threw them up in the air and catched them. I was doing that for long periods of time. My parents often shouted from the living room what the fucking hell I was doing there for such a long time. Sometimes I couldn't stop quickly, sometimes I could. I would do the same thing in my room sometimes. Same thing for chewing/licking/kissing/biting. I would constantly put objects in my mouth. Not fully, but kinda ""bite"" it or kinda lick it. It's an odd movement, I can't really describe it.

I still do stuff like that. Honestly: sometimes all day long. 

It's something so first nature to me that it just occured to me that it isn't actually quite normal? Sometimes I would also just bite my lips all day which was recognized and counted as self harm. 

\+ my severe social issues. I've basically developed an intense fake persona over time, because let's be honest: I'm such an oddball. I'm weird as fuck. Impulsive. Quick to anger. Things are too much very quickly. All that fun stuff.

And I have more ticks, but I won't describe them all now. Some chew movements for example even though I don't chew anything?! Stuff like that. I also was made fun of in school for some of my ticks. One in particular because it was just VERY obvious. Kinda like a yawning movement, but not yawning. Just stretching my mouth a lot? All the time? 

Oh. And whenever I'm happy (and alone and NOT in my fake persona) I kinda have muscle spasms or something?! I don't know how to describe it. I just kinda... tension up everywhere and make faces and stuff and honestly I feel SO, SO, SO embarassed about that. I feel like I'm some sicko. 

I'm honestly sometimes wondering if I have Aspergers. I know no one can tell me here. I know no one is a doctor. I know. But MAYBE someone has a similar experience? I will bring it up to my therapist anyways, but yeh. Just wondering."
654,Hell is better than this,There is no reason why I would go to hell but honestly I might prefer it to this. I just hate everything
655,Is getting anxiety over some person normal?,"Hi.

I am a college student who recently had some emotional scuffle with my best friend (it would be not wrong to say that she was the only one who knew me). Now, it has been 7 months and we have not talked to each other properly. I don't want her to know about my triggers because she herself is struggling to heal.

The thing is that if anything reminds me of her, my heartbeat increases, I would always be on the verge of crying and would sometimes bite my hand or slap myself (suicidal thoughts are not there thankfully but sometimes thoughts of self-harm do come in mind although they are also rare). Something as insignificant as her profile picture change, someone using the emoji she uses a lot or the phrases she used a lot triggers me, and I remember her again and then the cycle of sadness continues.

I have some interest in mental illness as a subject so I know some of the mental illnesses and I think I might have PTSD but then, PTSD triggers are not real humans. I am so confused right now because I am normally an emo vibe person until these triggers come and everything goes south. Also, I don't even mind talking to my best friend. I feel comfortable talking to her (whenever she does message me like once in two weeks) but if someone else reminds me of her and reminds me of her, I get triggered.

Could this fall under PTSD or am I just overthinking? I hope I conveyed what I am trying to say clearly. I am going to sleep now and will check tomorrow the replies (if I will get any :P)

Thanks in advance &lt;3"
656,understanding differently.,"Sometimes people don't want to hear about other people's success stories sometimes it just makes us feel worse. Sometimes finding something positive about yourself or life in general is literally impossible.. for me today, it was getting out of bed.. I took that as a small win, it didn't matter that I was wearing the same clothes as the day before.. 

sometimes when people  try to convince me there's so many people  here for me  they don't realize  sometimes even if you put me in a room full of people that can sometimes make me feel even more alone. Because nobody can really understand how I feel. not exactly. Everybody experiences and feels things differently in life. Sometimes all it takes is someone to tell you that it's okay to feel things differently. Because it's not a competition of who feels worse or who had the more depressing story. 

Sometimes it makes me feel worse When people tell me ""if I can do it so can you""... Sometimes when I say I want to be alone it's not cause I don't want to be near people, it's because I don't know how to be with myself at that moment.

Sometimes when people say they understand what I'm going through or can relate to how I feel or they know my pain...sometimes that just makes me feel worse because you can't really know somebody else's pain. and sometimes that hurts me more knowing someone that I care about  is also hurting or feeling this way.

 That's why I tell them no you don't understand, you just understand differently. Because I'm well aware that everybody goes through their own things in life. So when they tell me they dont want me to be alone right now because I'm acting weird, sometimes that makes me feel worse because inside I know being alone at this moment is exactly what I need and that's okay sometimes too. 

sometimes its OKAY to NOT like yourself. When people tell me I should really stop hating myself it doesn't make sense to me, how else are we supposed to recognize and accept our flaws or things we don't like about ourselves? The difference is, I accept the things I don't like about myself, every one of my flaws.. and sometimes i try to fix some of them and I learned to accept the ones that I cannot. 

So please stop saying that you understand, instead please ask us what we need or how you can help. And please don't ask why do you care so much about something or that we should lighten up about something. Because sometimes that makes it worse it makes us feel that were weird for feeling how we feel.

 Let us feel strongly or differently about things. 

Not being Where You want to be in life right now is okay. You do not need to work out harder next time at the gym or try harder the next day.. you'll just end up tiring yourself out so quickly.  Being able to accept Where You Are in life at any given moment is the first step to bettering yourself."
657,Why is it so difficult to find a therapist??,"I've been on/off seeing therapists for years and unfortunately never found one that I felt was a good fit. Every time I try to find a new one, I'm completely discouraged. It's hard enough to muster enough effort/energy to look for one to begin with, yet the process is so difficult.

1. It's hard to find a recommended therapist if you don't have anybody to recommend you one. There isn't a platform that has reviews for local therapists. I understand why this may not exist because everybody's feelings on a therapist can vary depending on their individual scenario and if they connect with the therapist, but it's so impossible to sort through the hundreds of local therapists. Yes, I know there's Psychology Today.. but just because a therapist lists something that you relate with doesn't necessarily mean they'll be helpful to you.. which leads to my next point..
2. It's so expensive. Finding the right therapist is like dating, except each time you have to pay $100+ to try to see if you're a good fit. I've gone through so many therapists where I've paid hundreds of dollars only to realize they weren't a good fit. I also don't think doing an initial complimentary phone consult can really help you figure out if they're a good fit for you. I understand that mental health professionals need to be compensated appropriately, but how many people can afford $100-250 each week in order to see one? I make enough money so I don't qualify for a sliding scale payment or free mental health services, but $100-250 a week is still an exorbitant amount of money to be spending on a weekly basis and I would expect it to be so for most people who don't qualify for a sliding scale payment system etc.
3. Lately, nobody is accepting new clients. I've messaged close to 10 different therapists recently and each one either isn't accepting new clients or isn't accepting clients that use insurance. At this point I've become extremely discouraged. I even asked the therapists I messaged to refer me to somebody else, yet they state that they don't know anybody who has availability either. 

I'm sorry if I'm incorrect in some of the things I listed, but this has just been my personal experience looking for a therapist. I live in a major US city so I don't know if this is just specific to my local area. It's been really frustrating to try and help myself when it seems like you can't find anybody who can help you and without forking up a bunch of money."

660,Can a new fearful situation in life trigger old fears and flashbacks?,"I'm really anxious right now due to the hole Covid situation, a family member in the hospital and my partner losing his job. Now I feel like all the fears I ever had are coming back, I am easily startled and everything is overwhelming to me. Usually I am not easily thrown of track so this concerns me a lot."
661,My personal experiment.,"So here i am asking for some help. I have been lying about everything in my depression. Hell I even doubt I had that. See, doctors were asking about everything they know just to give a result. Hell, I lied.  Did I hear voices? Nope. Did I see things? Nope
Did I have suicidal thoughts? Nope. All this was my master plan of studying the psychiatric ward. Oh yes, just like the woman in 1800s where she got into a ward just to study how they were treated. I did the same. 
I needed to lie to get accepted. I even staged a suicidal scene just in case they didn't believe me. I know, I know I shouldn't have done that.  But I want to share some experience with you people. 
1- Other patients lie as well. Oh yes, I wasn't the only one. Patients lie, some lie just to get done with it. Other lie because they want to mess with the nurses/doctors.
2- Psychiatrics don't care about you. Sikes! Sorry my people. They are just in another 9-5 job.
3- Security is mean and they see you as a treat once you get close enough to them. A woman that clearly wasn't okay wanted to get out and I know, they sometimes keep you against your will. But this woman even asked for an attorney or someone who could get her out. They just didn't care, they even cuffed her.
4- This is an exceptional case but I found out some of the nurses were having affair with their coworkers. It's ok, as long as you don't have sex at 3 a.m inside the nurses break room. Oh yes, I wasn't sleeping.
5- Overrall, psychiatry is evil as the way I see it. Doesn't help you, doesn't make you feel better. They just tell you what they believe you have and they go to the next one.
6- I was internated a second time because I wanted to see if they would accept my petition to not get accepted. Guess what? They didn't. I signed the papers where it said: If the patient refuses to get into our premises we will respect their decision.  Hell they didn't care, they dumped the papers and internated another week. Were my rights deliberately violated? Maybe. Were my rights respected? Absolutely not. 

What is my opinion on psychiatry? It is a lie, it is cruel and shouldn't be seen as a respected study.
Does it help to some people? Absolutely.  But 70 to 85 percent of those people don't get better. I didn't feel better if I was meant to feel better even if I lied. Those places are dreadful. Seeing all those patients just suffer with impotence because nurses gives a fuck. It is outrageous how people believe in them. A year has passed and now I can conclude that my little experiment was a success. I wanted to prove what it was. And damn. I feel bad for some people that shared the same experiences I had. Again, I am sorry if this offends everyone but I needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to judge in a good manner. I will not answer back to people that text offending and or hostile thoughts. Please, I need your feedback. :) have a nice day and merry Christmas. 
*please debate peacefully and passive. I do not want to see people offending others just cause they shared their opinions. My opinion is my opinion. Try to change my mind but no being mean. Won't help."
662,Mentally drained,"Hi, obviously this year has been hard on everyone, but for me, in the beginning at least, it was really fun. Then COVID hit, and although the times were rough, I had close friends I could hangout with and we all made the most of our time. It seems sensitive to say but, I was having a blast.

Now, my brothers left for college, my at home situation wasn’t very well (it is getting sorted out though), and I’m left with no one to talk too and I feel isolated at time. I still find ways to spend time with my school friends, but it doesn’t help. I just don’t know where to go or look and I can’t find any answers. 

What I’ve noticed though is that, I’ve always wanted straight As in school (I’m usually an AB student with an occasional C here and there), but ever since I got them my life has been super shitty.

I don’t know if any of this made sense but It made me feel better, hopefully someone understands idk"
663,I think I am going through an existential crisis,"Sorry if this is a bit of a rant, I have had these thoughts surrounding death and the meaning of life.  Sorry if it is a bit depressing, it just has been building up for months now and I don't feel like I can't go to anyone in real life to help.

So starting around 5 months ago I started thinking about death and what comes after, and it has just been getting worse and worse since.  I feel like if there is nothingness that would be terrible because just one day without knowing you just die and you completely lose consciousness, never being able to see loved ones again and never experience anything.  But on the otherhan if there is an afterlife I think it would become very boring and I don't know what is worse, to be honest I don't like either options. 

These thoughts have just been going through my head day and night (mostly at night though) and I get sent into a panic attack (or at least what feels like it) most days thinking about it.  It keeps me up hours every night and I just don't know what to do.  No matter what my perspective is on it, it all seems bad.  It has become a major obstacle in my everyday life, at school and at home (I am currently 14).

I just end up thinking what is the point in anything if it is all going to just slip away one day without us knowing.  It stresses me out so much.

Sorry again if this was a bit of a depressing.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

(Sorry if parts don't make sense, if you have any questions, just ask me in comments.)"

666,I'm slowly turning to a vile person.,"Hi people , my name is *** ***** . I borned in a family with  low socioeconomic status and lots of domestic arguements with violence. I got diagnosed with ADHD at my age of 8 ,  and forced to being addicted to Metylphenidate and other kinds of toxic drugs. I've been failed at school several times and relationships too. And that turns my state to anxiety disorder. One day , i was walking on the street , i see a couple , making love eachother , and i stare them close and too much , and the guy noticed me and beat tf out me for staring them. Then my whole world is twisted for that.I got insane for that humiliation , i grabbed a iron bar that i found in somewhere ,  and hit several times of his legs , face and his girlfriend too. And i ran away until a old man called the police. And i first time i been in a custody on my age of 14. After that event , i started feeling extremely envy about people who got more wealth, looks , and social status. And i started to improve myself to best . Started to doing sports , cheating on my highschool for getting best marks , lying people to be more popular , worked as a child labor for afford cool things people that dont have ,and if i was not able do that ,i stole. And my whole dirty hard work gave my prize. I got my first car and license at my age of 18 , firearms , tobacco and canabis products and luxury clothes etc. Afer i graduated , i get enlisted for military and served 4 years. Made lots of money , and gained people's respect and i also ibought my first house at my age of 22. After all.

Then i leaved outside to start a fight with someone to lighten my agony of conscience . And nothing changed. Moved back to my house. And started thinking to tf i have done on my entire shit i lived.

667,How kill empathy,"Hi everyone. My whole life I was a very kind person and everyone abused that.

What are the ways to one kill his empathy? To be selfish, machiavellian and cold as possible?

Should I watch videos where bad things happen with people? Should I start hurting others?

Is it possible?"

669,How to stop people avoiding you.,I recently made friends with someone new from my class and we’ve been getting along really well. We’ve only been speaking since Sunday but we are already getting pretty close. I was talking to her yesterday right before my physiologist appointment and decided to tell her about my depression and anxiety. She is the first person I’ve literally ever told and I’m not sure why. She was really nice about it and It didn’t seem to freak her out at all but since then I feel like she has been avoiding me. She said something about being worried that she will trigger something because we banter quite a lot but I don’t know how to get her to stop avoiding me. This is what I was worried about when I told her and I feel like it’s coming true. What should I do?
670,"I know it’s stupid, but consistently every night i lie awake and can’t sleep because i keep thinking about death.","I don’t know how to deal with it or talk about it or stop it. I’m just so scared of death, time flies by so fast and eventually you just die and everything stops you don’t do or feel or am or anything and it absolutely fucking terrifies me. 

I don’t sleep well ever, I’m 5-15min late to school everyday, i don’t know what to do."

672,Social media stories/posts triggering negative/angry/argumentative thoughts,"Hi, in the last few weeks I've seen posts from people that i followed and, in my mind, look up to (and place on a pedastal which is probably bad!). 

Recently these people have been sharing politically aggravating views and propaganda designed to make people angry. I think they do it to make themselves feel like they are doing something good.

But seeing these things make me have conversations IN MY HEAD with them trying to argue that what they're doing is wrong. I know this is a waste of time and life! 

In general I am a logical person and therefore try to reason with facts 

I feel like this is bad for my own mental health.

Has anyone been in a similar position? I'm a bit worried about coming off social media for a bit but it might be a good thing."
673,Has anyone who couldn't cry before figured out a way to?,"I was a pretty sensitive kid. Those kind of emotions (crying, frustration etc) were sort of discouraged by kids at school who would make fun of me for it and my parents who couldn't be bothered dealing with it. So I pushed everything down every time I felt hurt and now I'm unable to cry, and generally feel a little scared to let myself feel painful emotions.

I really want to be able to cry again. I'm getting better at telling myself it's OK to hurt but it still feels like I have a long way to go before I heal. Does anyone have any tips on things that worked for them?"

676,"Angry, Frustrated, and Betrayed tonight by work","Well, here is a discovery that I made today just a few minutes ago.

I work a low paying job in retail. I was making about $12/hr US ever since I picked up this job at the start of COVID. Anyway, about mid-October I was asked to pick up a shift or two at the gas station attached to my grocery chain, and one day. Something came up at work, and they decided to move me back to where I was working at the start of COVID when I made $12. I was told when I’d go back, I would see a little decrease in my rate back to $12 from the $13 I was making that little time at the gas station, but they lied about that.

Turns out, my rate was cut to $10/hr, and I have only been making that rate since they moved me back. I knew this job wasn’t paying all too well, and I was scrapping for cash as of late, but this just proves my feeling I was being underpaid.

Only to discover this before Christmas.

Honestly, it might just be time to quit the job sometime before my one year anniversary. This was the final nail for me. I have a BA, and I feel like it is wasted at this job.

Might be worth a talk to HR, but I dunno. I have to talk to them about a co-worker outing my Spectrum Disorder too, and that is something I am not comfortable talking about. I still dunno how he found out."
677,Relative Dysmorphia,"I have a question to ask.  Does your perception of your face change?  Does your perception change when you’ve received a compliment? 
For my entire life, my perception of my own face has changed drastically.  Yesterday a friend of mine, who models, complimented my “beautiful eyes” repeatedly.  Suddenly, I was beautiful.  When I looked in the mirror, I was beautiful.  Today, I reminisced about my recent breakup—my face seemed unattractive again."
678,"How do I get rid of this ""need"" for a relationship?","I hate that I can't find anyone to date, makes me feel like a loser and suicidal. I am not ugly or fat, but I hate socialising, I hate people in general because I feel everyone is against me. I live in a homophobic country and honestly the lgbt community in the western world makes me wanna puke. It doesn't matter that I live in a homophobic environment and have abusive parents cuz I'm a ""white cis gay"" who deserves to be hated even by other lgbt people, honestly I hate this ""community"", I wanted to move abroad but now I am not sure after I saw how shitty many lgbt people (especially those self hating white teenage girls who are all like ""bipoc lives matter, those of white people dont!"") actually are... I tried online dating, it didn't work, maybe I am too picky, I dunno, I had okcupid for a year and almost 2000 likes now yet nothing...

I just wanna try stop looking for a relationship but I feel like a loser for not dating anyone, I wish I could just stop and not care anymore, but how do I do that? I honestly considered chemical castration and suicide at this point because I feel depressed and that makes me less productive, I dont even have anything that brings me joy anymore, I just focus on studying and improving my body and in rest... I don't have anything that makes me happy. Maybe I believe that if I had a boyfriend I would be happy but that is probably not true, yet it is the only thing that keep me going because I have a crush on a guy in another country with whom I talk, i try to improve myself for him and if I give up I think it would be like giving up on myself, but at the same time I feel miserable every day because any guy I ever liked was A) straight or B) bisexual and only looking for hookups with guys or C) gay and a total dick.

TL;DR: How do I give up on trying to date? Never had a relationship, but cant accept that I never will and give up, how do I do that? I feel like I have nobody, but there are people who dont have anyone either yet they still cope, how do they do that?"

680,Is this a sleeping illness?,"So from as far back as I can remember I've had trouble sleeping, and I know that's pretty common at a young age but now getting near 18 it feels awkward and embarrassing.
When I actively want to sleep and try just laying down even when I'm tired, I find I start panicking because I'm not asleep yet and I want to be so I can do things the next day, and this quickly leads to uncontrollable crying and sometimes shaking a bit, but I cry to the point when I'm choking and feel like I'm about to throw up but still can't stop crying, and it can happen on and off all night, so when I calm down enough to try and sleep, then I just panic and just freak out again. 

Is this an illness, or does this issue have a name? Any ideas on what to do about it?

My solution so far has often been to just stay up, watch tv, listen to music, walk around, anything to stop the panic and loss of control that I get, until I'm physically too tired to stay awake. Occasionally I wont care about if I get to sleep so if I'm not wanting it then I can sleep reasonably normally, but that's a rare occurrence."
681,"I'm usually a patient person, but...","I'm usually a patient person but lately idk what it is. Every little thing pisses me off. Idk why suddenly the littlest things set me off into a mood lately. Pandemic, maybe not spending enough time with myself, is it my peers that are the root, other people. Idk. The thought alone has been pretty agrovating. Idk if it's a combination of all the stress being thrown at me lately and me not just being able to cope with it or the factor that something actually chewing at me. Things that have been getting to me pretty bad lately are like when someone keeps cutting me off mid sentence, or when someone gets in my way, or takes they're sweet time to get to the point. And other times are when I drop something, trip over something or little petty things like that. Even the most simple things effect my mood intensely. I'm trying to watch it but Idk what's up. Ugh."
682,"I don't want to smoke but why do I have urges, I'm scared.","I feel like I'm more exposed to second hand smoking since living alone in a different country. I just see so many people smoke these days, from teenagers I see online to adults on the streets. 
My dad has been smoking ever since I was born, he smokes around me, in front of me, beside me, and it's like he doesn't care when I cough. I clearly was and still is not interested in joining him. Moreover, I'm scared that I will end up being addicted to smoking like my dad, because he cannot quit even though there are rare instances where he wants to.

But one day I was lost on the streets trying to get to a bus station and I asked the nearest person. She was smoking and she was still smoking even when I'm near her. The smell of the nicotine was so strong it went through my mask, and for the first time in my life, it doesnt smell that bad to me. I was so mad at myself.

I'm also very sad in general right now, and thats why I'm here, because a first thought that came to my mind is whether I should smoke or not. 

Now whenever I smell it I just wanna physically get away from it, because it reminds me too much of my dad and I don't wanna have that self-prophecy bullshit. 

I have never smoked, and I'm generally really anxious. I have traumas and I have OCD.

Please, any answer will be appreciated."
683,I miss my mom,"My parents got divorced 5 years ago ( I’m a minor) and I went to go live with my mom. We did have some financial struggles but it was all pretty. Then in the summer of 2018 my dad got custody back. We now still live with him and he constantly says if not for us he would have killed our mother a long time ago. So because of his hatred of our mother we can’t talk to him about it. This has all come to a head about 1 hour ago I had my first mental breakdown, it lasted for 45 minutes and I was in tears thinking about my mother( I haven’t seen her in person in about 5-8 months) it started downstairs in the kitchen when I was just thinking about her cooking and then when I realised this was going to be the first Christmas I wasn’t going to see her for. I suddenly had the urge to cry so I came up to my room and just bawled after about 25-30 minutes I had calmed down enough to try to talk to a friend about my problems. She was very helpful and just let me pour my guts out. So I’m still crying a little bit but not as much and I just wanted to put this somewhere into words. It’s just really hard having only one parent who barely cares or knows you as a person. I just really miss my mommy I hope I can see her someday soon."
684,i hate being called soft,"i just. i hate being called soft so bad? i don't know why? i don't know if i'm just some delusional pissbaby who thinks they're better than they really are or if something happened that i can't remember, but i just hate it! i hate being thought of as some soft uwu person because i'm not and i know no one means it rudely it's supposed to be a compliment but i hate it it makes me feel ¿¿¿¿¿ and just. i don't know what this is i just wanted to get it out i suppose"

Everything I do is heavy and requires a lot of effort. I always have this sense of dread that I can’t seem to get rid of and am constantly having panic attacks. I have a constant ache in my chest and am overcome by extreme emotions very easily. 
For example I sobbed to the point of choking and heaving for hours over being sent a meme picture of someone who’s been gone for a very long time.
I feel like I want to scream, claw apart my chest and curl into a ball all at the same time.

Does anyone know what’s wrong with me?

""i don't need something that'll make me all upset before i go to work"" like okay? my mental illness makes you upset?? it's literally a part of my life and won't leave anytime soon and you think it makes YOU upset? like all she thinks it is, is a mental illness that makes me suicidal and unsure of my identity meanwhile it just causes me to get really angry and have abandonment/trust issues and impulsivity. and i once also tried to tell her that part of my mental disorder is impulsivity especially if i'm getting involved in risky situations like sexual activity and she said ""i don't need to hear your excuses"" but i told her ""but they aren't excuses, they're explanations behind my behaviour"" and she said to stop talking to her and that i was only going to make her angry.. how can they care about me so much and want me to get better if they won't even listen to me. she won't even come into a therapy session with me so my therapist can help explain either and my therapist is genuinely concerned abou my relationship with my parents... like she was saying it seems they lack empathy in moments where i've needed them most.. this summer i was at my friends house and i got my heart broken by a guy my mom found out i was having sex with and she would constantly say how he's just using me and shit which wasn't true but anyways that night i got my mom to pick me up from my friends house and all she had to say was ""i told you so"". no hug. no it'll be okay. no i'm sorry honey. like she is literally the physical embodiment of my anxiety and everything my brain would tell me. none of it's true but it doesn't make me feel better... oh yeah and after all that i impulsively started drinking alcohol and doing drugs. i've been  a little better since then but i still frequently smoke weed or eat edibles so i don't have to think or feel and occasionally engage in hookups but i think i'm starting to lose myself again.. i don't know how to explain that without my parents getting angry since they won't even hear me out when i wanna talk about my bpd"

691,Sensitivity to angry outbursts in men—PTSD??,"Does anyone else have this going on? I (30F) am highly sensitive to and bothered by angry outbursts in men. I grew up with a emotionally volatile (often angry to the point of blind rage) father who would frequently fly off the handle and scream at me, my sister, and my mom. He was never physically abusive or anything, though. We think the root cause of it was depression. He’s now medicated for the depression and is an entirely different person. Can manage his emotions much more effectively. 

I now experience intense visceral reaction to to displays of extreme rage in others, especially in males. Even if the anger isn’t directed at me, I have a hard time staying calm. I start having heart palpitations, hyperventilating, and sometimes crying. It’s like a fear/panic response. IDK. 

I’m married to a good man who has never been violent toward me, but he does get angry and takes it out on things. For example, he will get ‘gamer rage’ when he’s losing a game and launch into a tirade of expletives, sometimes breaking things (he’s broken a few controllers), and stomping around. Even though the anger isn’t directed at me, I experience the same panic response.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?  Could this be a PTSD thing? Curious to hear from others. I’m trying to find ways to move past this. I understand that anger is a normal human emotion and it’s okay for people to express it. I just need to find ways to control my reaction, so I don’t completely shut down."

696,Should I go to my school councillor for my mental health?,"Recently I've been thinking about talking to my school counciler. I've been struggling with feelings of depression and occasional anxiety for what I think must be over a year now. At first it wasn't to bad which is why I haven't talked to anyone about it but for the last few months I've been feeling extremely unmotivated with everything I do. I find little to no enjoyment in hobbies i used to do, I've got a low appetite and I feel tired mentally. I cant differentiate days, and when I try to remember the last few weeks everything just merges into one blurry waste of time.

I haven't talked to my parents about my mental health as I feel uncomfortable talking to them about things like this. I feel like if I tell my mum she will blame herself or not take it seriously? 

I have shared some thoughts with a close friend but only skimming the surface, just things like ""I'm not feeling to good today"" ect. And talking to him about other issues I'm experiencing. I dont really feel like fully opening up to him will help. because he has his own mental health problems, and talking to him will make me feel extremely guilty about feeling depressed because it feels like I dont have a proper reason/excuse to experience these feelings.

I want to get help, but I'm not sure if talking to a school councillor is the best idea? 
Firstly I dont know how confidential they will be, secondly, i get anxious at the thought of asking a  teacher at school to speak to a  counciler, I feel like i will be judged by them idk how to explain it? 

Yeah idk what to do but I'm really struggling rn so if anyone knows what I can do please reply?"

I just fear that one day I may end up just convincing myself to end my life and there’s no turning back from that. Just a few thoughts I wanted to share because idk I fear opening this up to anyone."
703,I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.,"I grew up with a fucked up childhood, as did everyone. I moved out and settled down at a early age. Now I can’t tell if I’m a shitty adult/spouse. Only relationship issues I have are with my mother (who I have been NC with since May) and my boyfriend of 5+ years. No one else seems to be/get irritated, annoyed, or upset by me as a person. I have a very, very close relationship with both sets of grandparents, my coworkers seem to really like me and enjoy working with me daily, I have a handful of friends who love and appreciate me. Several people that I’m close to think it is more of a manipulation situation more so than my own mental issues. I don’t know what I’m wanting to get out of this post, but I can’t afford therapy and I don’t know what else to do right now. I figured advice from outsiders wouldn’t hurt."

707,I feel like everything I do isn't enough for my mother,"I am a 16-year-old student, my highest grade on my card is A+ while my lowest would be a B+. I would've never expected to get one of the highest grades in class, in the middle of a pandemic, when I even have a sideline career in streaming on Twitch. Recently, I've decided to move to schools for senior high school, one of the requirements is the most latest report card. My school is pretty shitty, and they decided to release our report card when it was incomplete, I got an F in Health because our teacher had issues with her computer, so she couldn't compute our grades but our school assured us that isn't final. Now the grades have been updated, and I have one of the highest grades in class. 

I showed it to my mom, she rolled her eyes and brushed it off as if it was nothing. She began lecturing me that, I don't have to act all high and mighty just because I have very high grades, I should stop acting lazy and or pretend I'm doing anything. That moment, I disassociated with myself and I was just watching myself be berated in 3rd person. Everything was so blurry, and but her words were clear and hurtful. Instead of telling me to improve, she told me my grades might go down and accused me of always playing videogames. What makes it more worse, is that my mom knows I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. So until now, I'm constantly checking my grades on my school's website and I can't think straight. I honestly had enough of my mother, and I wish to cut her off from my life when I'm of legal age. She would always berate me, belittle me, insult me about my appearance and interest and she even selectively chooses my friends. I really don't like my mom, I just never thought of this before because she would provide everything to me, but in the end, she never provided maternal love."
708,"I'm still alive, and I'm proud of myself","I started being suicidal at 8 and have had numerous attempts. I live with PTSD from abuse and trauma, and it causes a lot of pain. At the start of the year, I decided that I would give my all to improving my mental health one last shot, and if there was no improvement and I would just live in pain my entire life I would just end it. 

I'm proud of myself because I tried so hard this year to do everything I could to live. Every day has been a battle, but I made it to the end of the year. I got on antidepressants, and have been trying to find a therapist. Yesterday I was having a PTSD episode that caused me to shut down and dissociate, but I didn't have suicidal thoughts, which made me happy, because it means I'm improving. I know that I probably won't ever be fully ""normal"", but I'm excited, I've even been thinking of trying a relationship, which has always been something I have been too afraid of.  I can't really explain this to anyone I know and have them understand, or not be concerned, so I hope someone understands how much this means, and why I'm so proud."
709,My dads promblems are draning me,My dad is a s*x addict i've know since i was maybe 7 my parents fight all the time and it's become the root of almost all my issues my anxiety self harm and a bunch more it come to the point where i know where every medicine that could kill me is in my house help
710,my thoughts are exhausting,"i need to figure out how to want to be here, i know i have to be here and i accepted that i am going to stay because i can't bear to upset my friends and family, which is also the same reason why i have been clean for half a year now even though i didn't want to, everything that i do is because i have to for them, but there's a CONSTANT reminder in my head that i don't want to be here and i don't want to be clean and i can't even sleep it's so overwhelming i can't afford therapy anymore so if anyone has related to this and has some advice or anything i could really really use it thanks guys:("
711,How to I convince my partner to seek help?,[deleted]
712,I hate myself,"I have extreme social anxiety and general anxiety so it’s very hard for me to make friends and to form trust with people. I’ve had bad luck with friends. Growing up I hung out with the “cool” kids but they only hung out with me because they felt bad and that was only for two years. I had no friends and middle school and only started to get a solid friend group when I was a junior in high school. However, they are now all gone because I imploded on myself and dropped all of them because I was having a panic attack and freaked out. Now they all hate me and talk shit about me, my brother is still friends with all of them and doesn’t stand up for me when they do. It’s not like we have a bad relationship, my brother and I are close so I don’t know why he doesn’t. The main culprit is his girlfriend and my old best friend, who said I shouldnt compare myself to her because I’m a terrible person. I get it I’m a dick, especially while having a panic attack, but that just...hurt me I didn’t say anything bad to her while having my panic attack, she just said that thinking I couldn’t see it. Learning her turn feelings towards me and was my tipping point. After that I really bad suicidal thoughts. I didn’t have anyone and felt like I was a waste of space and just over all didn’t want to exist. It took a few months but I got over them because of this one friend I made, but honestly he made my mental health terrible. 

I felt like his short ugly friend, he would always talk about girls and how he sleeps with everyone and about girls bodies and how the perfect girl was skinny with big boobs and all that other stuff. This was just ruining my self esteem. I honestly don’t know why it did, I just cared a lot about his opinion. He began to talk about this one girl at our school and how she was perfect and skinny  and it was my tipping point. I had a mental break down over my appearance. When I look in the mirror I see an ugly fat troll. I stoped talking to him and I’ve basically stoped eating. I eat like a bowl or two of noodles a day and have lost 5lbs I think over two month. I know it’s not healthy but at this point I have a mental break down if I eat more than two meals a day. I’m honestly not even fat, I weight about 113lbs and I’m 5 foot 1. But every time I look in the mirror I just see a fat blob. I don’t think he did anything wrong though, I never told him to stop because I just don’t tell people how I feel.

I care to much about people’s opinions and it’s my down fall. I can tell the difference between a friendship and a relationship. Every friendship I’ve ever had has fizzled always because I hate starting conversations  or because I keep my mental health locked up and explode. I talk so much but nothing comes out of my mouth. The only thing that’s keeping me going is college. I just want to leave my school and family and start a new life with new friends. I can’t take it anymore I just wanna stop existing and cry all day. I don’t think there is a day I haven’t cried myself to sleep this month.

Anyways I just needed to vent. This was way less organized than my last one but these are just thoughts that kept popping into my head. And I need somewhere to put them. My last post helped me a lot and took a weight off my shoulders so I thought I would try again."
713,"Undiagnosed, yet struggling with anxiety attacks and people’s responses","I never been diagnosed with anything or seen a specialist but I’m pretty confident I have anxiety, and spurts of depression (maybe more). I never talked to my family about it and don’t want my family paying for therapy since I’m in that weird ‘dependent/independent’ college age. 

My mom has ADHD and sleep issues and brothers have bipolar. My issues may be more intense cause I’m on birth control but I use to self harm when I was off it and had more depression than the current anxiety.

I have meltdowns in front of my boyfriend a lot and sometimes anxiety attacks (shortness of breath, fatigue, overwhelmed feeling of dread, and different stress related ‘tics’). Since I haven’t been diagnosed and he can’t understand how I’m feeling, he doesn’t know how to comfort me. I’m not quite sure how I need to be comforted to be honest. 
 
He always says things like: “try not to think about it””you should feel happy/grateful””why are you crying? You have no reason to cry”

But all of this makes me feel worse and hate myself for feel sad about something and just and overwhelm feeling of guilt which makes me more anxious and stressed. I’ve explained this to him but his responses are logical in his mind so it’s hard for him to understand and I don’t know what the other comfort I’d need in that situation."
714,23 year old completely frustrated with my situation in life,"Idk how many more days I can take cooped up in the house with no future in sight, stuck in isolation. This is the first time in my life I’ve genuinely considered killing myself as my best option. When I wake up every morning I get overwhelming feeling of frustration, angst, disappointment it’s hard to describe but it makes me feel like I’m drowning if that makes any sense. The way I cope with this feeling is excessively smoking marijuana and drinking which is a good way to temporarily make me feel better but everyday I choose to smoke and drink instead of working my way out of this situation is only making things worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I honestly don’t see a way out of this situation. I’m 23 and still live with my parents. I’ve been going to school off and on throughout the years but was only going because I had a GI Bill. So school was free and I got a monthly amount of money while I was enrolled. I had no idea what I wanted to do, grew up in an enlisted military family, so that’s what I knew... and the majority of the careers I considered growing up were in the military. Exiting high school I had absolutely no idea about what college I wanted to go to or what to major in, all I knew is I should probably go because I have it for free. All other plans up until this point involved enlisting after high school which my parents strongly discouraged me from doing since I have the GI Bill. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here goes life mistake #1- I have the ability to go to any state school for free in the country and decide to go to a school 30 minutes away so I can bunk with my high school best friend who is also from a low income environment. Surprise surprise he drops out within the first month. No big deal, I can always transfer. Right?

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake #2 Then that same semester I meet this girl who also has the GI Bill. She’s in a similar situation of not knowing what she wants to go to school for. We enter a long term relationship which now gives me access to 2x the monthly payments of the gi Bill. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mistake #3 what happens when you have two kids who have no idea what they want to do thousands of dollars a month whether they show up to class or not? Quite a few semesters of full time enrollment without showing up to any class besides day 1 to remain on the roster. Now my transcript has a good 4 full semesters of literal all F’s and WF’s. Somehow I still have a gpa of 2.2

&amp;#x200B;

Inevitably we both fail out of school and I move back in with my parents. Me and the girlfriend broke up and I’m a 20 YO at his parents house extremely frustrated with my life. Moving back home separated me from all the friends I made at college and pretty much all my friends from high school enlisted because that was our best option. Now I’m at the lowest point of my life with no friends, no future, and no education... que the waking up every morning with an overwhelming feeling of drowning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward until now I’m 23, I went to a local community college to get my grades up enough to get reinstated back into university but have the same problem I did when I was 19! I’m knee deep in an accounting degree but don’t really have a desire to be an accountant. I want to commission into the military to become a pilot. Which you can do with any degree and I actually found a way to do it though something called the PLC Program with the marines. Honestly idk if it’s even possible with all these failed classes on my transcript. It would depend on if they calculate GPA on their own terms or just take it straight off the official transcript (because my transcript replaces failed grades with repeated courses but still leaves the failing grade visible on the transcript. The grade replacement is just for GPA calculation). But I would need to raise my GPA above a 2.2 before I even go try to talk to an officer selection officer so I don’t seem like a joke to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Doing the PLC program is the only way I can see myself finishing school because I now only have 1 semester of GI Bill remaining but have a good 5 semesters of school left. Which at 23 fucking hurts to think about 5 more semesters. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is if I can’t make this PLC program work I really don’t know what else I can do to get out of this situation. I’ve worked so many retail and food service jobs in my life and fucking hate them so much. Plus the pay is so minuscule I don’t see how I’d ever be able to get out of my parents house. They refuse to co-sign for me and my credit is in the dumpster so I can’t even get approved to live anywhere besides on campus housing. When places started to shut down because of covid the restaurant I was closed and I started getting unemployment. The unemployment had a $600 a week boost and was way more than I have ever made at a job which is sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all of 2020 I haven’t been enrolled in school. I’ve been Getting unemployment for the past like 5-6 months and pretty much completely stuck in isolation. This has made me the saddest I have ever been in my life. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it and am scared to go to a therapist due to being disqualified for the military (A.K.A my only known route out of poverty). Smoking helps me cope with all of this but I know that’s doing nothing but causing a temporary solution for a permanent issue. I’m trying to not rely on any substances but waking up everyday and just trying to kill time until I’m tired enough to fall back asleep again is driving me insane. I’m in a pretty nice house but sometimes can feel like a prisoner in here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if there is something wrong with me or what. I live in a filthy room with clothes all over the place but the house in general is super clean, and even has a cleaning lady that comes every week I just can’t bring myself to maintain cleanliness. My hygiene is out the window I often wear the same clothes everyday until I notice they start to smell and have pretty much the same mentality about showering. I live in isolation and can go weeks without calling, texting, or talking to anyone besides my parents whom I just run into around the house from time to time. I’ve had substance abuse problems for the last couple of years. I wasn’t always like this, going into college I would workout everyday, often shower twice a day, cared dramatically about how I looked (often referred to as metrosexual) and was known as outgoing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t even understand myself how I got quite this deep down the rabbit hole but I recognized all these behavioral issues and know that they aren’t normal, are the root of my problems, and need to be changed. So I don’t think I’m autistic or anything. But sometimes comments by my parents make me feel like I have a disability. Recently my dad told me “you should go to the doctor and see if you have anything wrong with you” another distinguished memory I have is once when I refused to cover my microwaved food with a paper plate because I claim they are a carcinogen my mother said in front of me “see I think he has something wrong with him, like mentally” what hurt the most is that statement implied they have had this conversation before. The worst of them all was when I overheard my mother say “I wish Robert was our son...well maybe I shouldn’t say that”. Robert is a family friend who’d similar in age and recently commissioned in the Air Force as a pilot. It drove me crazy hearing that. That one definitely made me feel expendable and fucked me up for a few months until I Drunkly addressed it to them, which they acted like she never said that... I at least appreciate the effort to not let me find out. She couldn’t even look me in the eyes for quite a few days after I told them I heard that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I’m pretty fuck in the head I guess n I have no one to sort this out with. Typing this out alone has slightly helped, I feel like a burden to the only 2 people left in my life. Like my existence at this point is selfish, I can only imagine having sex one day only to have a chronically depressed grown man in your house 23 years later with no way of getting rid of him on the foreseeable future. I know everything that has happened it completely my fault and I’m not even completely sure what the goal of posting this is. Does anyone have any sort of ideas on how to get out of his situation? I’ve recently looked into truck driving as an alternative to going back to university if the PLC program didn’t seem to work out for one reason or another. There is a company called Rohel that will pay for you to get your CDL the problem with that is the trucking life seems to lead to further isolation. I want a job where I can form a friend group and be happy again not be alone for the next 10 years. I’ve already lived a good year of it and can’t stand it. Nobody even told me happy birthday when I turned 23 which is not a big deal but it just goes to show nobody gives a fuck about me and I want to change that."
715,How to deal with someone determined to kill themselves,"My best friend took a cocodamol overdose tonight, I rushed home from work and she's currently in intensive care. I don't know if she'll come out again but I'm gonna assume she will, because I have to.

We were in a relationship for around 6 years, and this is one of many attempts before and since. She's been in ICU for an overdose before, she's tried to jump in front of a train. She has bipolar so her mood changes in waves over months, and I know that this is going to happen again and again.

How do you deal with this kind of situation? She was only diagnosed last year, but she's stopped taking her meds multiple times. I want her to be safe but what do you say to someone like this? She told me that I can't watch her 24/7, and sure enough, 2hrs into my shift she tells me that she's sorry and it will be over soon. I tell her the same things over and over but when she goes into these episodes, it's impossible to reason with her. I have depression myself but I feel like one day am I just going to have to say I've done my best and let her do it?"
716,"I think I’m covert narcissist, what do I do? I don’t want to be like this , but I am","I match literally every sign of this personality disorder, and I’m honestly shocked. I don’t like to be this way, I don’t choose it, I just am. I wanna change, and I don’t know how. I’m worried that I’m doing damage to others, or that I’m spreading bad vibes, when I don’t intend too."
717,Just another 2am crisis.,"so, nothing special, my boyfriend, who had been with me for 2 years, broke up with me, recently. It was all my fault, but fuck, I have no one, literally no one, he and my best friend were the only ones I felt comfortable with, and I lost both of them, I'm alone and it sucks.
I've been dealing my whole life with several mental illnesses, and I usually had them both, but now I'm alone with myself and completely heartbroken, because people scare me and I can't make any friend or talk with anyone but them, isn't it amazing?"
718,How to cope/heal from a toxic relationship?,[deleted]
719,I feel like just throwing my life away,"i am so broken. It started about 5 years ago when I was bullied pretty badly at school it got to a point where I couldn't even make myself go. I know it sounds stupid but id describe it as trauma maybe its not I've never got that part diagnosed because I've never been able to open up about it. My brain has put up a mental block so I can't really remember much I think that's just something normal the brain does but I'm not sure. Because of those events it led to me developing anxiety and depression. Because I couldn't make myself go to school I waited a year and eventually got a homeschool tutor. For over 4 years id cry randomly usually at night. I've tried a therapist but I just couldn't open up about anything. As the years passed I lost a lot of hope and now I just don't open up to anyone who knows me. As a person I just feel like everything about me is a defence mechanism sometimes ill notice something about me that I hate but I just can't change it. I am so incredibly lonely but whenever i try and make friends (this is one of those things I notice about myself that i don't like) i try to overcompensate because I'm so desperate for friends. I notice myself doing it but I still do it anyway. About 8 months ago I tried weed and for the first time since then I felt normal. I started using weed more and more and eventually it got to a point that id be high all the time just so I could feel free from all the stuff making me feel terrible. The problem now is that if I stop taking weed all i can think about is ending my own life. At the moment I'm out of weed and I don't know when it will next be delivered . I just feel so stuck and I often think about what would happen if i just stopped caring about my life and just smoked weed. At least then I can go in peace.

sorry if I've wrote this weird its 4 in the morning and I'm struggling to sleep if there's any questions ask in the comments just don't ask specifics about what happened with the bullying"

721,Heavily Depressed Again after 8 years,"The past week I've been feeling deeply depressed. Its almost as bad as it felt when I was in my  3rd to last year of high school. Literally debilitating.. the worst of it was being out of it so badly I didn't do anything for 3 days straight... thought I was coming out of it and ended up staying in bed from the moment I woke up officially in the morning till 4pm in the dark on my phone. I've had no desire to play my favorite video games, no desire to do the things I want for myself and I just want to see some sort of light at the end of the tunnel.. I want to keep going but I also feel like giving up.
I've been out of a job since March (got turned down by two jobs I interviewed for last week today both in and out of my ""field""),  my self esteem is worse than its been in years, my relationship is rough right now, and I'm lost. This is the longest I've ever gone without having some sort of structure to my day. When I was working it seemed to put a mask on what was broken.. but having to consistently look at myself everyday and see im not where I should be and I haven't done anything to achieve the dreams I've had is depressing. 
I think alot of it is just me feeling worthless and just straight up garbage. I feel lonely, I feel bad. Like this holiday is the first one ever where I wanted to take everything down because I wasn't feeling it. Im not even feeling affectionate.. 
I know Im depressed. I will speak to my psychiatrist next week.. (assuming I don't try and mask how I'm actually feeling) but its all so overwhelming right now I don't know what to do anymore.  I just never thought these feelings would comeback again so intensely.. 
Its just embarrassing i suppose because I tried so hard not to fall this far in again and here I am. The most I've been doing lately is just getting out of bed, going on my phone, and try to work on my personal goals if I have the energy to do it.  I just feel like I'm floating to nowhere..
I know this turned more into a vent than a question but any advice would be great. Thank you.."

725,Why Does A Certain Person Fill me With Anxiety?,"My ex girlfriend, who I broke up with about a month and a half ago, makes me feel incredibly anxious when I’m around her, and it started even before we broke up. The reason I decided to end the relationship was because of the anxiety, I don’t know what it was but I boiled it down to relationship anxiety, but it seemed much more than that. Every time I was around her I felt a pit in my stomach, and I was constantly worried about our relationship, though I never wanted to lose her. Now that we’ve been broken up and I haven’t been seeing her as much I don’t feel that anxiety much anymore. The thing is, I still care about her and am attracted to her, but whenever I see her I just get anxiety ridden, I think it started because I was scared she’d leave me when we were together, probably because of my own insecurities. Now that we’re done I don’t get why I am still this anxious when I see her, because at this point after talking a few times we’ve cleared the air and agreed that neither of us really need a relationship right now, so why am I still so anxious about her? The reason why I made this post was because I saw something she posted on social media with one of her friends and I got a pit in my stomach, I know it’s a long shot but maybe somebody can help me understand why I do this."

728,why do I hate going outdoors? (not agoraphobia),"I don't know if it's the depression or chronic illness or what, but I haven't liked going outdoors as long as I can remember. It's fine if I'm out *doing* something, or with people (pre-coronavirus), but being outside for no reason makes me want to crawl into a hole. Day, night, hot, cold, it's exhausting and uncomfortable. I try to go outside every few days at least, and spend like 15-60min sitting outside for some sun, but some weeks I just go outside to get the mail. It sucks because I have a nice backyard area and I want to enjoy it but I just can't. Does anyone else experience this?

For context, I am diagnosed with PTSD, major depression, and a genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The PTSD can be triggered by hot weather, but I also dislike being outside in mild or cold weather."

734,Link between your social class/financial status &amp; mental health--some thoughts,"Correct me if wrong:

Are majority of mental health cases prevalent in those from a not-so well off background financially, ie;middle-class, lower-middle class.

For eg:

Everyone has Instagram, social media &amp; irrespective of who we are - all of us are exposed to each others content.

You see regular posts of people posting their fun holidays, what an ideal concept of a day is, eating fancy things see how they are having a seemingly 'perfect' boyfriend/girlfriend travelling the world together. Or those with a loving-family mom dad and children co-existing in peace.

Do these things severely affect a person who doesn't have these things but creates like an artificial pressure / complex  that they're not good enough / and they start comparing their lives with others lives which the hold as a 'standard'?

Am I making sense"
735,Help reaching out?,"Every day just pain and sadness or even just nothing at all not happy but not sad just the pain in my head that'll never go away, I do things to show people that I'm not ok but on the very rare occasion that people see it I just say everything's fine when it's not, I push them away because of my head being too scared to burden them with something that they didn't have anything to do with previously I honestly just don't know what to do anymore I can't reach out since my head won't let it likely because of my trust issues but I want to get out of this hell that is my own mind before I try to kill myself again and succeed, any advice?"
736,Aeroflot,"Hello everyone,

I would like to tell you a story that happened to me on (December 19-22 2018). I am currently in the psychiatric hospital in Tübingen being treated for acute psychosis. Basically I feared that people were out to ""get me"" that I was being ""watched"" and I kept having these bad dreams that I was still stuck in the Moscow SVO Airport of terminal D and was still refused professional medical help, access to local law enforcement and being denied basic information and basically being blocked from the truth at every turn.

I was trapped in the Moscow SVO airport from December 19- 22 after missing my connecting flight back to Stuttgart after being denied entry to Israel after being accused of attempting to make an illegal immigration by the Israeli border control. (But that is another story)

The main story is that once I arrived back at the Moscow SVO airport being run by Aeroflot, I was feeling rather lousy and had wanted to die. Considering that the 22nd of December was the anniversary of my father's death, I saw it as an opportune time to kill myself or allow myself to be killed which was somehow what I believed to be in the cards.

After presenting my case of how ""lousy"" I felt to the information desk at Terminal D in the Moscow Airport, they instructed me to take a seat next to them and they would call a medic. When the medic came, neither of which could speak English administered me a cotton swab with ether and a pill of some sort to possibly calm my nerves since I wanted to die. I took the white round pill about the size of a nickel and and I rested my head over my hands by the desk at the information desk. After some time of coming to, I made my way to the gate where I fell asleep and woke up just in time for my flight or so I thought.

When I awoke I rushed to the desk of the gate and stated that I was there for the flight and was it still there.

They had informed me at approximately at 9:30am December 20th that it had in fact left without me and that they made it a distinct point to express verbally in English that it was my fault.

Without a functioning credit card and only 50 euros in my wallet I made my way through the airport corridors of the massive terminal D of Moscow airport SVO. Lost and alone I went from restaurant to restaurant, to shop from shop looking for assistance of any kind. All of which had unanimously referred me to go to the information desk of Terminal D and ask for assistance.

This whole thing seemed to be as some sort of Kafkaesque nightmare. After seeing that I was not the only person having this problem I decided that after 24hours living in the airport of Moscow SVO terminal D, I would eventually turn myself in to the border control of the airport and have my self deported for overstaying my allotted time in the airport. The difficulty was that I could barely speak Russian and I only knew a few words from what I remembered from my time with my ex-wife who was of pure Russian descent and had family still in Russia, hence being there in the holidays because I truly missed them.

I also had to find where the 'exit' to the border control was and how to get there.

With the help of an anonymous source I was able to have someone translate in Russian my situation. They recommended that I go to the border control. The problem was, the border control was just an exit with no proper entrance so I had to take my google translator on my phone and show it to the immigration officer after so many people had passed and there would be space for me to quickly show the screen of my mobile phone.

I eventually got through and they brought me through the one way exit on the top floor and then proceeded to go through the X Ray machine again but this time from the rear, basically backwards from where the other passengers were entering. After passing control I was led to a large room where passports and entry was being controlled for Russian Nationals only. I was seated and told to wait. For how long I did not know and I was very tired, hungry, thirsty and I needed to use the bathroom quite urgently. I was eventually allowed to use the bathroom after using the Google translator on my phone to express this urgent request. I was taken to a bathroom around the corner which was closed for repairs, I was instructed to use it although the floor was completely covered in what appeared to be human urine. It was the same in the handicapped bathroom nextdoor, so I put my 2 hand bags up in the sink to avoid touching the urine covered floor.

After relieving myself, I made my way back to where the Russian Nationals were passing border control. There was no sound and no music in the air, the mood was completely dead and there were drawings of cartoon animals on the walls of the booths in which the officers were working, sometimes doubling up on duties in the airport but nonetheless working together.

So I waited and I whined. I continued to use my google translator to try to get through to the guards and try to figure out what was actually going on there and what was holding everything up. Eventually like a hostage I took my phone and pressed it up to the window of one of the border control officers and tried to present my case with the phone translator. After making some painful and worried exaggerated expressions with my face he motioned to me to hand him my phone and he typed what the issue was, ""solve the problem"" it said. So at this point I realized I might actually be in serious trouble if I don't have a valid reason for being in the airport. So I decided to come clean and tell them that I was sad and lost and I missed my in-laws who lived in Russia.

I was eventually accepted and after about another hour of waiting I was finally invited into the office/ room to talk with them about my case and how to get me out of there. There was one woman who was trying to gather information and asked me where I went to school, I said SUNY Purchase, not knowing if she had ever heard of a liberal arts college before and proceeded to hand her some ID cards for her to copy as communication in English seemed out of the question. After this brief round of questioning and I was allowed in the room they had prepared some pages of what appeared to be a contract or a release form in Russian, approximately 7-10 pages at least although entirely in Russian. Being the student that I was I respectfully declined to sign the release of information due to the simple fact that I do not understand what I would be signing and could not do so in good faith. The gentleman who tried to explain the case in English understood and said it was ok, but the curly haired mid 30's blonde woman who was asking me questions about where I went to school, was clearly dismayed. I was handed a fine for 2,000 rubles which was prepared and I was sent back out of the room with a new boarding pass back to Stuttgart from Moscow to be at gate 6 at 8:50am the next morning and a credit voucher for 1,000 to buy anything I wanted from the stores or cafes in the airport.

Thankfully and graciously I exited the office of the border control and I made my way back to the neutral zone of the terminal once again, but not before going through airport security one more time and this time they were clearly exasperated and not very helpful or friendly with me, not that they had been up till then. I was ridiculed and made fun of by the controlling officers by the x Ray machine and I simply took the abuse politely and walked on. In this time I took advantage of the fact that there were many hours to go to my flight so I walked around the airport to see if there were in fact any other flight options other than Aeroflot. Apparently there were not so I found a nice 'comfortable' seat and I slept with one eye open.

There is still quite a bit more to the story, but I figured I would start there in telling you the details.

I hope you will find interest in the story as it is one that deals with the denial of basic human rights, denial of information and care and basic negligence and manipulation on the part of the airline and greater portion, the airport itself.

I hope this story finds you well.

Best wishes and a happy holiday.

737,My friend watched her younger brother murder her older brother and it could have been prevented - Please help if you can,"This is all public news now.  Initially we (friends) didn't share any information with anyone.  However time has passed and the family is public about what happened in hopes to raise awareness for mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I had lunch with my friend Amberley.  She told me she is moving back home to Arcata (California) to help her brother.  Jacob was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenia four years prior and things had gotten very bad.  Her older brother Aaron moved back to help as well.  Along with the youngest brother Luke and their mom Beverley they tried help Jacob.  They called for weeks to the local health authorities, the police, and anyone they could find.

Jacob had locked himself in his room for months rarely coming out.  I saw the room after all the trash, feces, and carpet had been removed.  The walls had not been touched yet.  Jacob had put red vinyl tape every foot running up the walls.  Between the lines of red tape were drawings on paper that contained Hebrew and Japanese characters.  There were dozens of them.  It was very clear that whoever lived there needed help.  Amberley said she wanted me to see it, she wanted me to believe her, that her brother was not well.  It saddened me and angered me how their cries for help were ignored.

After being bounced back between the police and local health officials they finally said they would come for a home visit in a week.  Unfortunately a few days later Jacob had an episode.  Amberley, Aaron, and Aaron's girlfriend were playing cards in the kitchen.  Jacob was screaming for them to leave and get out of the apartment.  Amberley said fine they'd leave after the game is over.  She had gone to use the bathroom and while she was washing her hands she heard a struggle outside.  Jacob had ran out of his room into the kitchen.  Amberley comes out to see all three of them wrestling then Jacob gets up and runs back into his room.  Aaron had been stabbed in the heart.  She held him as he died in her arms.

I'm posting this because I love and care about my friend.  As well that this tragedy could have been prevented.  The family knows it and anyone who knows the story knows it.  Right now they're fighting for Jacob as he sits in jail being charged for the murder of his own brother.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the family's story about what happened.  How the city acknowledged and recognized Jacob needed help but did nothing.

Below is a link to the gofundme page if you could help.  They need resources for Jacob's defense.

Within the page is a link to their story written by the family, a video of the mother Beverley speaking at the town square about what happened, and a couple of local news articles.

738,To those who give me direct message requests,Look as much as I want to click accept and the amount that I tell myself to do it I still can't bring myself to do it whether it's cause my anxiety or another issues my head just doesn't let me take on what It feels is another responsibility so I'm sorry
739,What are my next steps after a flashback like this?,"I’ll try to make this post quick. Trigger warning for CSA. Please don’t read if you’re not in a good space to read about sexual abuse at the moment.

I have CPTSD from CSA at the hands of family member’s previous romantic partner. Took a work leave due to severe dissociative episodes relating to said trauma, on medication, have been doing trauma therapy for 3.5 years. Now finally back at work, doing better.

Today, I was doing the dishes and randomly remembered this memory that I’ve always had but never thought much about. It was completely separate from the above issue of abuse. 

Memory: I’m in my mom’s apartment sleeping on a couch. It’s morning time and two, slightly older but still very much young, boys (I am female) who were family friends had come over. One was maybe seven years old and one was maybe ten years old. I was about six. I woke up and my leg was kind of perched on the top of the couch (I’m a weird sleeper, admittedly) but my underwear wasn’t on and they were looking at my parts and kind of awkwardly giggling. I felt so humiliated. That’s it. That’s the whole memory. 

I’ve always had this memory with me, and for some reason, it just never struck me as odd. But I wondered today, like, why wasn’t I wearing underwear? Where was my mom? If we were having guests over, why didn’t someone wake me up or cover me up? Maybe those family friends slept over and I’m misremembering, but even still — why did someone let me sleep with no underwear, as a little girl, with two slightly older boys? In fact, why was my underwear off at all, given that we lived with my mom’s boyfriend at the time as well? All weird things.

Anyway, my question is: now what? Do I message those (now adult) kids and ask them if they remember and what happened? We were great childhood buddies for many years after this, and are still on good distant terms. Do I just move on and try not to think about this? 

Thank you."
740,Am I in a toxic friendship? Or am I selfish?,"I have a bestfriend. Sometimes, she will ask to hangout and I would go with her because I feel energized to do so, other times I refuse to go because my depression and anxiety has gotten the best of me. Then she would get mad or sad about it and I begin to feel bad. And start to question myself, “am I just making up excuses to not go out?” And I tell myself “I am selfish” for putting myself before her.

It’s not that I don’t like hanging out with her, it’s just that every-time I do, She constantly remind me of my unworthiness, my flaws, and my mistakes. When I tell her “I don’t want to go out because I feel mentally exhausted”  she downplays it and says “excuses, excuses” 

I love her dearly, she is a good person with a good heart. However, she has played a good amount of part in looking down on me. I noticed this but I never wanted to call her out on it because then I would become a bad friend. When I tell her I want to pursue something she subtly tells me, I won’t be able to do it and laughs at it like I’m joking and that success for me is unreachable. I told her I haven’t showered in a week and she called me lazy, even though I told her it’s because I’m not feeling mentally well right now, she says I’m making excuses. This is the same with my family. 

She wonders why I never open up to her and well this is the reason. I open up to some people and they never take it serious. Now I can’t help it but keep everything inside because I fear that my feelings, thoughts, and opinions are actually just an “excuse” like they say it is. 

Am I selfish for thinking this way? Should I have just gone with her despite the lack of motivation or energy? Because maybe she’s also feeling under the weather and needs some company. 

I realize my friendship in a way is toxic, but I reduce to believe it because I know she cares about me...at least I believe so. I just need a confirmation from an outsider point of view. Am I selfish?"
741,I have some bad recent injuries. Can I still go to a crisis center?,"I’ve been thinking about taking a 1-2 week trip to a mental health hospital to help calm my emotions, which have been at an all time high. 

On Dec 10, I got into a car accident. I broke my jaw and crushed my left femur and left humerus. I’ve had surgery already for my femur and humerus but they’re searching for someone to fix my jaw. 

I’m still inpatient at the hospital so I’m not thinking about going right now, but my orthopedic surgeon said I can’t put weight on my leg or arm for 6 weeks **at least**. 

Would I still be able to go to a crisis center or shorter term inpatient hospital and continue to receive the physical treatment I need on top of giving me the mental health help? 

I can’t just get a therapist because my car was totaled in the accident and I can’t work so I have no idea when I’ll be able to buy another car. Plus, I’ve been at my wits end mentally for a couple of weeks and I feel like this car accident is pushing me over the edge. 

For what it’s worth, I have no memory starting from about an hour before the accident until the day after (Dec 11). I don’t know or remember anything about the accident so I’m not currently experiencing symptoms of PTSD but I am worried that I’ll start to experience the symptoms at a later time."
742,SAA Meeting Coming Up,"I'm finally going to get some help/advice. This Sunday,  there will be a saa meeting. I'm looking forward to it, but im also nervous. As a younger person,  I don't know how awkward it might be. Anyways,  that's not a big deal. I've come here 
1. Because I adore the reddit community
2. What is a group meeting setting like (doesn't have to be saa related, but preferred)"
743,been going trough a bit more than an under 18 yr should normally have gone though but..,"even tho i have traumas and all other sht in life i'm still sonehow jus chilling and enjoying life.      
like idk how to even explain the sht i've gone trough, so much that i probably can't fit everything in this post and im also feeling too lazy. but basically everything ranging from extreme mental problems to bad memories from life, overwriting all good memories.     
also not feeling like making any1 of you depressed with my stuff so i don wanna talk abt everything since i've talked abt a lot to other ppl already.
      
but yeah, idk how tf i still feel just like a normal person and i'm jus chillin."
744,Something is wrong with me,"I’m 18(M) and a very anti social. I self diagnosed myself with bipolar depression, the same illness my father has. Anyways I talk to myself a lot and have full conversations with myself. And I’m partially out of touch with reality. My grades are terrible I basically just gave up on school. I never brush my teeth I’m too unmotivated. I was exposed to pornographic content at a young age (around 9) after accidentally stumbling acrossed it. I’m 75% sure I was sexually assaulted as a young kid by my older cousin. It’s vague but the memory is there. I believe I have Dissociative identity disorder, I can’t go 20 mins without trying to start a conversation with myself using a different personality trait every time. I really don’t know what to do. I’m just a fucked up person I guess"
745,I don't know what's going on,"Hey guys! I'm doing ok right now, but I had an experience a while back that I was confused by.
This has occurred a few times before and both times I haven't known what was happening.

Usually accompanied with anxiety or panic, I would become extremely scared that if I were to walk out of the current room I was in, I would either open the door to an endless void, or that I would step onto a movie set, and everything I had known would've been fake, like some Truman show kinda deal. What was happening then?? If anyone could help shed any light in what could be going on I'd be extremely grateful."
746,Anxiety worse than ever.. what do I do next?,"So, over the past year and a half I have noticed myself developing OCD like tendencies as I panic about leaving the house and making sure my parents house or my apartment is locked up anytime I leave. It makes me double and triple check things as I fear the thought of a break in or my dog getting out and getting hurt. I also am scared that something might burn down or some disaster is going to happen while I’m away? The fear has gotten to the point where I become super tense and can’t stop thinking about it I locked all of the doors or not when I drive away and I usually turn around to double check, making me late to things.

During COVID, my anxiety has gotten even worse as I moved to a new town for grad school and I live alone and feel constantly isolated. Even when I wasn’t at home I would have panic attacks about going out to places or being around others in a crowded setting (such as a store). I really noticed something was wrong today as I headed back home from Grad School for the holidays and after my car was loaded, I stood in my tiny 400 square foot apartment, shaking crying and feeling like I was missing something. I literally stood there and walking in circles for about 45 minutes making me late on the time I was planning to be home. 

I don’t know what to do next. How do I approach my general practitioner? Do I go to them first? Can someone help me script what to say? I know I want to go back on my anxiety meds (fluoxetine) that I haven’t taken in 3 years as I have been coping but I don’t know when I can get into the office next when I am in town. Can I just call and ask if I can get prescribed it while I’m waiting to get in to the doctor? 

Also, I have an old therapist (not sure if she was a therapist or psychologist??) but I haven’t gone to here in probably 4 or 5 years and I didn’t like her as she was the one I had as a child and she makes me feel like a child when visiting. Do I have to ask for recommendations from my general practitioner?"
747,Can anyone else just not see how they would continue on like this their whole life?,I’m not really suicidal. I just don’t see myself going on and tire life time like this
748,Why do I lose interest in things/people so quickly?,"I don't think it's depression/anhedonia because it's not like I lose interest in everything all at once. But when I start a new relationship or pick up a new hobby, it's like I want to do it all the time and then I hit a wall and I'm just completely disinterested, to the point that forcing myself to do it anyway becomes excruciating. With songs I like, I'm sure it's because I listen to them too many times and get tired of them. Most of it is fine -- I don't have to retain every hobby I pick up -- but with people it's more frustrating/painful. It's really hard to explain to a close friend why I'm suddenly avoiding them, because it's really nothing they did. I just get to the point with people that I've kind of ""figured them out"" so to speak -- I can predict how they'll act in any given situation, I can finish half of their sentences, and talking with/spending time with them begins to feel boring and repetitive. Their interesting quirks become grating and even supporting them with mental health issues feels pointless because it's clear to me that it doesn't make any difference outside of the given moment -- nothing ever actually changes -- and I start to feel like sisyphus.

Plus I'm seriously introverted. And I get these bursts of energy where that doesn't matter when I'm getting close to someone I haven't figured out yet, but that wears off once they become predictable, and it's really hard to explain to someone why I'm no longer able to give them 70% of my free time and want to maybe shift that to like 2-5%.

It's happening with my current best friend and it's so tempting to look for other explanations -- he has anger issues and he's very sensitive; he's filed away some problematic behaviors as his ""coping mechanisms"" for some of the shit he's dealing with and that makes them untouchable, so it's stressful to be around him, especially around other people, because our status as friends makes it feel like I'm co-signing some of the shitty stuff he says/does. 

But I find it grating to be around him even when no one else is around and I know, I *know* this is the same pattern kicking in with my brain again where everything I get invested in just slips away from me. I don't even know if I want to be around him at all anymore. Meanwhile dude has abandonment issues and keeps making comments about how he's nervous about me getting a girlfriend because he might ""lose me again"" (because I won't spend as much time with him), or he's ""glad I'm back"" from being busy with finals. And it seriously isn't helping. I want to tell him to back off but I don't know. Dude's my roommate, he can't exactly fuck off. 

He wants to live together again next year and I know I can't do that. But I don't know how to handle shit in the meantime. And I don't know why this happens with everyone I ever care about. All I know is I should probably live alone from now on if I can afford it."
749,Do They Want Me to Die?,"I have been married to my SO for almost 10 years. I can say I must have mental health issues d/t my depressive suicidal thoughts at times.

750,How Do I Talk To My Mother,"I feel like my mental health hasn't been the greatest in a while and it's really starting to affect my friends too, I'm cutting them off, not going outside except from my room to the bathroom for weeks on end, I'm having trouble sleeping, eating, and there are times where I just feel really unmotivated to do anything except lie in bed feeling sorry for myself. I feel like if I try talk to my mom she'd say something like ""no you're not you're fine you have no reason to be sad"" or she'd act like I was doing it for attention. I'm at a completel loss with this there's no one in my family I can talk to about this"
751,The stigma of mental illnesses stems from the idea of identity?,"I am wondering why people discriminate those with mental illnesses, or for some they don't discriminate, they still find mental conditions hard to accept or face. I don't think I'm the only one who deals with mental issues, fully supports those around me and their mental health, yet still have unresolved difficult feelings about mental illnesses.

So one day I had an idea. Maybe we are fearful of mental illnesses (fear is the real face of discrimination, I believe) because how it is related to identity. Maybe this idea is not new at all, but I still want to try bring it up and describing it. 

Even if the illness itself is not related to identity (unlike, for instance, Dissociative Identity Disorder), it is still likely to affect the sense of identity. Like, people who have been depressed for a long time may say they don't remember who they are without depression. Like, delusions affect our outlook of life and the world.

So if our sense of identity builds on our subjective feelings, our perception and cognition and reaction, our beliefs and so on, and mental illnesses alter these things... Maybe we are fearful of mental illnesses because we fear losing identity? Not knowing who we are anymore? Maybe subconsciously we still feel that mental illnesses are some kind of ""possession""?

(Please note that I am not saying we should fear mental illnesses and those who have them. I just want to explore the possibilities of these feelings.)"
752,A Serious Anxiety Problem I Don't see In Literature,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I have a serious anxiety problem that I have not seen in the literature and therefore cannot solve. Here's the problem. Imagine going to the hospital, you went without an appointment. You enter from the reception and wait in the waiting room. Suddenly the receptionist comes and says our doctor will come 8 hours later and you have to wait 8 hours here, in that chair. You don't have a phone either. Imagine how boring, how challenging, how overwhelming it is to wait for a doctor for 8 hours in a chair. Your mind will count every second. Now imagine that you have this experience every weekday, that is, you go to the hospital every weekday and you are waiting for a doctor in a chair for 8 hours and imagine what horror that will create from Sunday.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that I  experience this waiting psychology anytime and anywhere. 1.5 years ago, 3 weeks after my girlfriend committed suicide, I started a job I had previously contracted and it was a consulting job, the Mckinsey style was extremely intense, the expectation was too big on me, and I was a hard-standing person using five psychological drugs. 7-8 hours before work, suddenly the thought that there is more to the end of my work, you are here at least 7-8 hours has passed in my mind. I looked at the computer clock and suddenly my mind started looking at the clock on the computer every 10 seconds. I turned off the clock. This time my mind started counting the seconds constantly and I felt stuck there for 7-8 hours. I was trying to do business but I couldn't focus, I felt stuck, I was like I was in the waiting room without doing anything for 7-8 hours, I had a panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to quit the job, but this anxiety happened even in my daily life, I was waking up in the morning and I was worried about how it would pass today, because my mind counted seconds, I could not even watch movies or TV series because I couldn't focus.

&amp;#x200B;

After 1.5 years, I re-enter work for a different company and in a different position, but I'm afraid that I will pass this anxiety and go crazy. What should I do? I did intensive reading and exercises on both CBT and ACT, you can suggest from these areas, I am also open to other suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."
753,Honestly Social Media Can Make You Feel Horrible,"You feel like you don't have enough followers/likes compared to peers. You sit at home doing nothing while your friends are living life. It seems like you don't get enough attention, no matter what. It makes you feel stressed, and overwhelmed because you're always trying to keep up and gain status. You can't go away, because you're anti-social, and it's the only place to express yourself."
754,does anyone else do this?,"i catch myself compulsively talking to myself multiple times a day and i will carry on conversations with myself that can escalate to all different forms of emotion. it’s so much that frequently my mother will ask me if i’m on the phone. does anyone else have this affiliated with themselves? is it a ‘bad’ habit? i’ve done it for years, I didn’t know if it was associated with mental health or having to do with anything in relation to it. i don’t have a lot of friends, and do a lot of things alone. i thought maybe that had a factor with it as well?????

755,I was three weeks clean.,I was three weeks clean and happy. I relapsed again and gave the biggest scar to myself and it still bleeds and don't know how to face my psychiatrist and psychologist anymore. I haven't been happy this whole week and question life again. I am sorry.
756,Rough Day to Say the Least,"I've tried to say this multiple times in multiple different ways but I'm not doing a great job at it so I'm just gonna leave this here. I'm not gonna complain about my depression, thoughts of suicide, people in general, or anything else really for that matter. Okay, there might be a little bit of complaining but I just wanna say that since the second I woke up to now at the end of the day there has not been a second in which I wasn't thinking about suicide. Whether it was how, or why, or even just thinking about the morals of suicide within itself no matter what it was, it was about suicide. Sure I didn't tell anyone or discuss it with another person and I could talk about whatever with anyone today but no matter the conversation we were having the thought of suicide was on the back of my mind.

If you're wondering why keep reading, I won't get into detail because there's too much to say if I were too and that would take too long and well... the post would get too long as well I suppose.                                                                         Basically I have no friends and my family doesn't support me. There's a thousand other things that definitely add onto the pain but those are the main ones I'll talk about in this post. I live in a conservative state but I'm not conservative. I'm a bisexual atheist to say the least and I'm not really liked here. It's common practice for someone to say something to the degree of ""f\*gs should be killed"" so living here hasn't been the best. Even with that not in mind, the people who are more open-minded per se often times I don't fit in with either for whatever reason. More often than not when someone says they have no friends they still do to some degree. They just don't have CLOSE friends. I on the other hand, don't have friends. To put it in the most basic/simplest terms I possibly could, if I left my phone alone for a month or two I would not have one missed call or one text message. And I know this because I don't get texts or calls from anyone now when I do have my phone.

I talk to people, sure... But there's never a connection. There's never a ""lets hangout sometime"" moment for me and another person it just is a normal conversation until it gets awkward and we both leave unsatisfied with that interaction because it got awkward in the end. I don't think I'm a weird person, sure I'm different and I do have some mental disorders but the worst disorder I have would be OCD or  PTSD but even then my PTSD doesn't often show up so I'm usually good.  Hopefully I can't make friends because I'm just different from my town or state but I'm not entirely sure. As far as my family not supporting me, my dad walked out when I was 3 and sure I see him once a year or so during a holiday but that's because he doesn't wanna feel like he totally abandoned me and my sisters but he did. We barely saw him growing up and barely see or hear from him now. When we do see him he's insulting my mom or trying to push religion on me so that's fun.

My grandparents (on my mom's side, I've only met my dad's parents twice) disowned me... Well, they called me a communist, said if I was their son they'd kick me out and that they would disown me but then they banned me from ever coming to their house again and I literally haven't been there since. Btw, I was called a ""communist"" because I said if you don't wanna pledge allegiance to the flag you shouldn't have to and that it isn't really a big deal as to whether or not someone does it. Because of that, my cousin said if I hate it here so much why don't I just move to china.

Again, there's way more that I could talk about and explain but in this post I just wanted to say that it's been a rough day. I almost pulled over on the side of the road to walk up the bridge I had passed to jump off it. And while sitting in my car today I had thought about just being in my garage with the door down and just letting my car run because that's gotta be a less painful way to die than to shoot yourself or even take pills, right? I'm not looking to be saved, I'm not even looking for a friend anymore. I just wanted to tell someone how I was feeling because I don't get to do that right now with the people I know. Also, I'm sure there's a bunch of typos and spelling errors and to that I say... I don't care the post is readable enough. Anyways thanks for reading, if you wanna chat I'm always down and if you have any questions or whatever I'll probably answer them. At this point in my life I'm damn near an open book because why the fuck not"
757,She is not my mother anymore,"I hate my mother a lot, a son establishes a deep relationship when he is born ... but in my case it was not like that, my mother always sought the approval of his father even though he was very  male chauvinistand, inherited everything from his son.  My mother in a desperate act of offering her father what her brother had not yet been able to give him is a grandson and that's when my older brother is born, a selfish tool to win the affection of his father, but he only love his  grandson and not her.  She was certainly not emotionally or slowly capable of raising a child, she was 18 by then.  four years later I was born in an unplanned conception, she did not want to give birth to me and declares it without any remorse, she had what her father would say, so she decided to give me a purpose as an investment to ensure that from my  future would live comfortably.  She never saw me as a son, but as an investment.  She raised me and my brother with fear and her pity for herself, when the fear stopped affecting us because she no longer had anything to extort us, she resorted to self-pity, declaring her suffering for raising us, this worsened when my father was on the edge  from his controlling and manipulative behavior, he abandoned me and my brother ... without a doubt I paid more for my father's selfish act.  Family members on my father's side had abandoned me as he did, my mother's family hated and despised me because I reminded them of my father, I received psychological abuse from my mother and her parents.  Certainly I was alone at 14 years old, because of everything that happened I had considered committing suicide multiple times, but I did not do it for my brother since he was in college and I did not want to put him through this ... he does not know, because of the stress  I had developed a hypertrophy of a ventricle of my heart and my mother certainly did not care, I had tried to go to the doctor but did not have enough money for the exams so I am still ill being 19 years old today, she has the ego of ""Good mother  ""and"" Good person ""who is unable to realize her mistakes.  She is a despicable woman, she hates animals, I had tried to take care of some abandoned kittens in the garden because she would not allow me to take care of them at home because according to her they are dirty and disgusting and she tried to tell me that she was allergic to animals (which does not make any sense)  She threw the kittens in the trash when I was in school and recently told me to throw away my 7 year old guard dog because according to her it is useless.  At this point she is at the limit that she can still consider her as my mother, she swore that she would pass the same fate as the dog, if she does something to him. I love that dog more than her, because despite not always being present he always waits for me."
758,I feel like a burden,My mom doesn't deserve to have to deal with me. I get signals that she doesn't like me or secretly hates me. I end up spiraling and start hating myself. I also tend to accuse her of not liking me or not paying attention to what I say. I dont mean to do this I just dont want her to hate me then leave me. I end up pushing her away with mean insults and ignoring her. I feel like I failed her as a daughter. My social anxiety makes it impossible to do anything fun with her. All I do is cry about a different or even no problem at all everyday. So all I do is sit in my house and cry complain or get angry at her. She told me that she is getting tired of hearing me be so negative everyday. I know she has a valid point but this makes me resent her even more. I wish I could just get a grip on my emotions but I can't.
759,Being denied care in PA,"Hey all. Im having a pretty serious problem. I have a short-term solution (my gp is willing to write me a 1 time prescription) but not a long term one. Hoping for some advice or advocacy support. I was recently inpatient for psych stuff. I got put on my old prescription again and instantly felt better. Problem is, they couldn't find me a psychiatrist for discharge! The one they set me up with refused to see me unless i agreed to financially impossible terms (hundreds of dollars a week out of pocket because he only sees patients if they agree to intensive therapy). I called the whole list my insurance company gave me. No luck. Some won't take my insurance, some won't see me because discharge was jacked and they demand the hospital fix it ( they won't) and most won't return my calls. I'm at my wits end. I have a therapist finally, but their psychiatrist doesn't take insurance at all and i have zero out of network coverage. Im already im huge medical debt. I've been told i may have to go back to crisis just to get heard, but even that's a short term and expensive nonsolution. Any thoughts? In Bucks County"
760,Rough Nights,"Hi there! 

I’ve been struggling for a while with anxiety and pretty severe OCD tendencies. I unfortunately have had one of the toughest nights that I’ve had in a long while. 

If anyone has any coping mechanisms for any of these (most importantly though, the anxiety), please let me know! 

Also, tell me something good that’s going on in your life. It could be a big thing like getting a new job, or it could be something small like eating something good for dinner! I love reading positive messages!"
761,Inspiring words from jung," compared the task of recovery to climbing a steep mountain pass, while he suggested those who never make the attempt are like individuals who sit on the pleasant valley road below not realizing that a raging bull is heading directly for them. But so as not to be overcome by despair in the recognition that no easy escape remains, we should remember that a neurosis offers us the chance to discover a path in life that is far more fulfilling than the one we currently tread. In fact, recovering from a neurosis can result in a level of psychological health, and a degree of resilience, not found in those who never endure such suffering. A neurosis, in other words, is only a curse if we remain forever caught in it, but will prove a blessing if we can find an escape. "
762,Why am I such a fickle person?,"I change my mind all the time and Im extremely indecisive. For example, in daily life, I can spend an hour in a shop not being able to choose between two things, it can be simple things such as laundry detergent!! Let’s move on to bigger decisions that actually affect my life. When I was younger I wanted to study political science, I got accepted started and then realized I actually hated it and started ditching class and failed the first year. My mother decided to switch me to Business “because it was easier” (she was paying) and I did (miraculously) pass after but It also wasn’t for me. Fast forward to the age of 29 and I have no passions or more accurately I like so many things and I haven’t decided on one thing and so I don’t feel like I’m passionate about anything, plus I’m not really skilled at anything. I wanted to continue my education so 2 years ago I was going to study communications, but then last year I changed my mind to hospitality, then archaeology and then graphic design and this year I am interested in fine arts. I have always liked the arts but never felt I was good enough to be in art school and be around others who were naturally talented even though it’s something I like. I am also worried that how I’m feeling maybe influenced by my ex who was an artist and that makes me feel like I have no identity really. I’m a nobody, who the hell am I and what do I want? And why the hell don’t I like anything enough to commit to it?? I’m so sick of it."

764,What is wrong with me?,"For context I have severe depression (among other things) and its been awhile since I've consistently taken my medication.

I've been depressed for quite sometime now, but its recently gotten worse with constant thoughts of suicide. The reason I didn't open up to my family about it is because everytime I try I end up feeling worse. I know they mean well and genuinely want to help, but everytime I feel like I'm wasting my breath.

Yesterday I was talking to my sister about how I've been feeling for the past few months, and I don't remember much of what she said but she did say something along the lines of ""well what did you do to better yourself during that time?"" After that I didn't even know what to think. I always get told about myself; what I've done in during fights between me and my family, that I take things to a 10, that I need to control myself, that I twist words so I'm the victim, that I hate my family because I don't open up to them, etc. I know I'm not perfect, I do and say things that I shouldn't, but in the end I always feel like everything was my fault. Even right now I can't tell if I skewing the story in my favor.

So, what was my response to talking with my sister? To try and take a handful of muscle relaxers. Me and my sister start fighting over the pills, while my sister's boyfriend is yelling at me in the background making me feel worse, eventually the police, firefighters, paramedics, and my parents arrive. The authorities try to talk to me but its going out one ear. In the end I leave with my parents. 

I don't know what to do/ what my problem is. I've been crying for days, nothing is helping me feel any better, and my suicidal ideation has only gotten worse. There is so much more I want to say I just don't know how. I'm just tired.

This was more of a rant it was nice to expell some of these feelings, but I would love some feedback. Thanks."
765,Terrified of everything.,"I’m so terrified of the future, i’m 28 still living at home finally landed a good job(doesn’t pay great off the bat but in due time..) and i constantly think to myself what would happen if my parents were to die tomorrow? i can’t support myself right now, always anxious a friend is gonna screw me over, i’ve had so many friends fuck me over and walk over me the course of my life and 40 years old and my stupid bipolar brain can’t enjoy the moments for what they truly are. I go to bed every single night hoping i won’t wake up. Every day is the same old boring bullshit, even my video games are boring and don’t make me that happy anymore and even then it’s just a bandaid. then i lay awake until 4-5am because my brain goes insane. i truly hate living i hate having to work just to survive and not even be happy. i’ve been in a slump for months and i don’t know how to live anymore and i’m scared."
766,Never want to feel anything and when I do I hate myself,"I hate being vulnerable, I hate liking someone cause I know how much of a huge mess I am and I hate it so bad when someone has feelings for me, I feel like I owe them to be around them and have to sometimes fake my enthusiasm so they don't get hurt, but I eventually start warming up to them and it grosses me out."
767,I have no one I can turn to and therapy isn’t really an option. I don’t know what to do,"Hey all. I’ll try to keep this as brief and to the point as I can.  My dad lost his battle with bi polar disorder when I was 9, and that’s haunted me ever since (his last words to me were “see you when you get back”, I was going on a trip. Fucker lied to me). I have a wonderful stepdad and grandfather, but I feel like I’m just another stepson to my stepdad (im not his first stepson and when he talks about him he had a dismissive tone, like “he’s not one of my kids, he’s my step kid”), and my grandfather and I have only been building a real relationship the last few years. Combine this and the fact that my dads dad (who I absolutely loved when I was little, but after my grandma died he remarried and left pretty much the whole family behind) seems to not want me in his life, and you could say I have serious father issues.

Also, since I live with my grandparents and my mom/stepdad live close by, I’m the middle ground when they vent about each other and I hear things about both houses that I don’t need to know. I seem to be the only one they can turn to so I don’t feel comfortable asking them to stop, especially since I did before and nothing happened.

As time has gone on and I’ve learned more, I discover that more and more of my behavior falls under the autism spectrum. But when I brought up to my family that maybe getting tested might be a good idea so I know how I can manage these behaviors that have made my life a living hell, they said that they’ve known for years but don’t want me to get tested because it “marks you” and can ruin your life, and we can’t really trust tests like that because they’re subjective.

So, combine these with depression and anxiety, and I have many good reasons to go to therapy. I have in the past, and ever since the last therapist gaslit me and manipulated me, therapy has been given a bad name in my family and whenever I bring up the possibility they bring that back up.

Now, normally I would turn to friends to vent and ask for help/support from, but I also have pretty much no one! Most of my friends and I drifted apart, and the few have left are either going through stuff themselves or I don’t want to stress them out with my stuff (I have a girlfriend who’s my best friend of 10 years, but I don’t want to turn to her with some of this because I don’t want to risk changing how she sees me).

I have no one. I can’t go to therapy. I don’t know what to do"
768,Should I admit myself to the psych ward?,"I’m not in a very good place right and I’m not thinking of acting on my suicidal thoughts but they are getting very frequent, there’s a lot going on right now and I have time off of school so the psych ward seems like a good plan but I’m not sure how my family would deal with that because I know they would understand but it’s getting close to Christmas and I don’t want my sister to have to spend the holiday without me, I do feel confident that I can cope with these feelings for a while but I don’t think it would be healthy.

770,I needed to get this out,"Roughly 6 months ago I totaled my car and almost killed my best friend at the time. He was put in the hospital for a day or two and I got out with a very minor concussion  and a few small burns from the airbags. I was rarely getting updates from him or his girlfriend at the time. I was already in a bad place and if he died in the hospital I knew that it would push me over the edge and I would have committed suacide. He survived obviously, but he moved away a few moths later. And now that he's gone it feels like all of my old friends that I've known for years have faded away and it's out of my control. Like my other best friend that I've known since 4th grade rarely wants to hang out and do shit, yet alone talk. Everyone has slowly turned themselves into acquaintances. Nobody ever hits me up saying they want to chill anymore, I always have to make the plans and tbh im just tired of it. And I'm always left behind when they make plans. But then everyone sends me a very unauthentic ""are you ok?"" whenever they see me solo drinking. I only drink every once in a while, and Ive heard that shit too many times to care about responding anymore. 

My past trama
My dad tried to kill himself when we met him for the first time in like 12 years or so. I don't know why, he just tried to do it. Just woke up and my grandma was panicking and the cops were there. But he's alive isn't that a good thing you might be asking. I only have 1 or 2 memories of him before that.  But now the first thing I think of whenever I see his name anywhere is oh yea he tried to kill himself with most of his kids in the vicinity. I don't forgive him for that even to this day. And even to this day he hasn't even acknowledged what he did or how it may have affected any of us. Oh and it turns out he was a rapist so thats just the cherry on top. But he's already done his dammage to more than just me. Idk if I'll forgive him enough to attend his funeral. I was also mentally fucked with when I was a kid not by my mom but by my cousin and uncle. I recall one memory in peticular where we were coming home in a truck and I had left my bike laying on the ground. Then my uncle said he was going to run it over with the truck and my cousin went along with it thinking that it was funny. They didn't stop even when I was screaming and crying, they just kept saying we're going to run it over. Then we drove over some bump and they both said something like oh man now your bike is broken. That's all I really remember. I was in tears and cried for what seemed like hours. And I was about 7 or 8 when this happened and it kind of makes alot of sense on why I don't really have the best relationship with that uncle or cousin. They lived near by and things like that would happen often. I heard that one time we went on a family camping trip and something happened between my uncle and I when I was very young and apparently nobody stopped it. I guess I blocked that memory completely out because I can't remember anything and nobody has told me anything except another uncle who was vague about the whole situation. Bad things happened and thats all I know. I want to know but at the same time ignorance is bliss. 
Recently I have been struggling with depression and cutting. I feel empty and lonely, and like everything isn't working out for me. but every time I go out I get really uncomfortable and end up going back home and retreating to my room. Recently I've started talking to a newer friend about everything and they have been letting me vent and help try to motivate me not to cut. They're really understanding, but only talking to them doesn't feel like its enough. I want to go see a therapist, but unfortunately I don't have the money or insurance for it. So I guess the next best thing is reddit. Not really but it can't hurt at this point."

773,Starting to feel extremely low again.,"I keep thinking about ending my life, plan things out when I'll be alone at home, but I never end up going through with it. Death seems like an unfamiliar pain, at least the life I am living  I know what to expect, but in that unfamiliarity I sometimes feel a hope that things might be better after death. 

I honestly belive that the people in my life will be better off without me, and the two people who would be most affected will over come it soon, but over all my presense will not be missed.

I have been trying, the whole live for yourself. Have hopes and goals for yourself, but nothing seems worth it if you in your personal life continue to be misunderstood. I feel tired, drained and just have barely any strength to get out of bed everyday, my life has no meaning for myself or others so what is stopping me from just ending it. I don't feel brave for fighting my suicidal tendencies, I feel weak for not having the strength to go through with it."
774,What was it like to not have mental illness in high school?,"Those that didn’t have mental illness since childhood, like the first time you had mental health symptoms was college age or later, what was it like? How did you live? What is it like before?"
775,Is mental strength that comes naturally to a person or is it something that is built over time?,"I have personally thought that it comes naturally but as I have come to understand people better, I feel that you become stronger with experience."
776,My mum has bipolar and living with her is hard. I try not to be resentful but at times I guess like most mums she really grates at my nerves.,"Frustrated... how can I make us living together more manageable? It’s like I’m constantly stepping on egg shells. She had light so the house is really dark, sometimes if I want to spend time with her I have to sit in a dark room. She starts yelling when I hover or wash dishes because the dishes clang and the hover is loud. No matter the time of day, she will find problems with it if I’m here. If I don’t clean she complains. Every task I do age comments on and tells me to do another way. Our conversations always lead back to her and her pains or emotional states no matter the subject. When I tell her good news about myself she never seems that happy. I’m tired of it! It’s like I gave to revolve my life around her needs and I’m sick of it. And then If I’m not around she’ll complain that I’m not spending time with her. But then when I am she can spend most of the time sleeping not always but some weeks she gets like this which I understand but still.. if your sleeping why do u need me at home?! I’m just a bit tired of it and then If I yell or talk unkindly it’s with some edge in my voice she might end up crying I just can’t man 😩🤦‍♀️zzz"
777,"Stop telling people ""your mental health is bad because you do [blank] all the time"" and start telling people ""doing [blank] all the time is a symptom of bad mental health"".","I used to get this all the time. Even from people who struggled with their own mental health in various ways. I don't sleep well, I don't go out much, I don't talk to people very often, and there was a time where all I'd ever do was go to college, come home, do nothing and then sleep. If I was struggling I would tell people, and so many people responded with 'you're just depressed because you don't do things you enjoy' or 'you're anxious because you don't sleep enough'  etc, and it would ultimately make me feel as though it was my fault that I wasn't well mentally. 

Looking back, all of the things people would tell me were causing my mental health to decline were just symptoms of it already declining. Don't blame yourself if you don't do much. Don't blame your anxiety on a lack of sleep or your depression on your lack of motivation and interest, and don't blame yourself if you do anything else that people say are causing your problems. No one wants to have bad mental health, no one wants to suffer. 

The things you do that are exacerbating your issues are almost always symptoms of your issues, and it takes a lot of work and time to straighten things out sometimes. I feel as though if someone had told me that my negative cycles were the result of an ill mind instead of the cause, I would have understood myself a lot sooner than I did, I would have been able to find different ways to help myself other than trying to suppress symptoms of a bigger problem. Please know that it's not your fault if you're struggling to help yourself, but please never stop trying to get better, because one day you'll look back on your life and realise you weren't well, and you'll forgive yourself for all of the things you struggled with. Happiness is always possible."
778,I am killing my relationships,"I don't know why but for the past year or so I keep on having these fights with all of my friends. I'm always so scared that they don't care about me, and I keep on looking for reasons to see whether I matter to them or not and it always results in a fight..

For example, yesterday I snapped at them. We have two group chats, one where we send memes and another. In both of them when i send something it seems to get ignored, but when this other person shares something everyone is quick to answer.

When we met up, one friend made a joke about how disconnected from them my humor was. It also feels like whenever I do something they lash out but when someone else does the same thing it's OK. 

I've been trying to excuse it but yesterday I lost control. I wrote in the group chat (honestly my mistake, didn't expect them to answer) that I had a question, and one of them answered. I told them I felt ignored and it ended with everyone telling me how its not OK that I sent that text even after I deleted it. I left that group after that. 

I feel like a bad person... But it hurts so much to see how people around me are favored while I'm just sitting there doing nothing. I try to keep it in, I try to not snap and look at the positive but I just can't."
779,Live for someone else ?,"Hey it's my first time here talking about me on the internet. It's been about 5 years since i am trying to deal with my mental health. I will turn 19 in 4 months. 
So i was wondering if i was the only one who is like not ending it because scared to hurt one person in particular ( not talking about  ""family"" ). Or not trying to end it ? 
How do you deal with it ? I feel like i am just a failure human being that is supposed to suicide. I don't see like the point to live. I just don't see it. 
You can't help someone who doesn't want to get help, i tried to see why i should live since years."
780,I’m an emotional sponge. I soak up others’ energy when they rant and it affects me negatively. How do I fix this?,Really trying to remove this facet of my personality.
781,Started smoking,"I started smoking about 3 months ago now because after a year of working on myself I got stuck in a downloop again. It's kinda weird because my mother smokes too and so do a lot of my friends but I was never attracted to it, got kinda sick even when I was  around people smoking. And although I know it's really really bad for you I'm kinda enjoying it and it somehow helps me getting on ease with things.

I'm sure it's just a temporary thing tho. I'm pretty prone to addiction so I don't really have the feeling of needing it but for now I'm kinda chill with it."
782,How do you manage anxiety/anxiety attacks?,"I’m posting this to hear about other’s experiences with managing their anxiety and hopefully get some guidance on what I can do. 

Little back story: I’ve had mild anxiety my whole life. It’s never had a significant effect on my life until this year. The combination of starting nursing school in January and COVID has really led to my anxiety skyrocketing. I’ve experienced a number of physical symptoms that I haven’t really experienced before such as insomnia, headaches, lack of appetite, and twitching eye (due to stress and lack of sleep). The smallest inconveniences/problems can lead to a full-blown anxiety attack. For example, I once made a mistake booking a first-aid class and wasn’t sure how to fix it (it was an online booking and telephone operators wouldn’t be open until the morning after) which led to an anxiety attack that night. Looking back, it wasn’t necessarily un-fixable and losing the money for the class wouldn’t have been the end of the world, but at that time all I could do was (literally) freak out about my mistake. 

I’ve tried counseling, but I didn’t find it effective. It was temporarily relieving to have my feelings validated by a professional but it did not provide much long-term help. I’ve tried meditating, exercising, deep breathing exercises, etc. but nothing seems to work. 

My questions for people who experience anxiety and/or anxiety attacks are:

What do you do to manage your anxiety? 

Why do you do during and after an anxiety attack? 

Have you tried medicine to manage your anxiety? Was/is it effective? 

What are you experiences with counseling/therapy/psychiatry? 

Thank you in advance for sharing your experiences and any advice you may have for me."
783,Going to be experiencing my first time being home alone completely and don’t exactly know how to handle it,"So as you read from the title I’m going to be home alone and I got casual work on that day so, during the day I’ll be fine it’s just night that worries me.

I live in a good part of my town and all and I know to lock all the doors and that it’s just my house is how do you say scary as hell at night, random unknown noises at night all rooms pitch black and I have a terrible fear of the dark, and I get paranoid very easily so any tips and what not I just don’t want to be scared out of my mind all night."
784,Relationships always trigger my depression,"I don’t know what it is but whenever I am beginning to develop feelings for someone I always feel the need to start hurting myself again, I don’t want them to know but maybe i do? I don’t know, I just find I get really bad and my suicidal ideation comes back tenfold , like they don’t speak to me for a day and I feel so empty like I know it’s not normal but I don’t know what to do about this , it always seems to take control of my life 
I have generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder"
785,I am happy and live a good life but I can’t feel myself or my surrounding.,"I don’t know what is happening with me or whether this is normal or not, I ignored this feeling which started with me since the beginning of my puberty (I am 21 now and then I was 10). I thought this feeling is because I became an adult, and that all big people feel the same. However, I am studying medicine and I have gone through some concepts like depersonalisation and derealisation and I was joking with my friend that all people feel the same as in the definition of both these terms but surprisingly they said no we don’t relate to this feeling !! I was shocked because I felt what I feel usually is normal but it appears it is not. I feel like this body is not mine as if I am watching this person living. I feel that my surrounding is fake and cartoon not actual things. However, i am living a normal life and I am a successful student but these feelings sometimes disturb me when I set down with myself so I tend usually to make my mind busy. 
Does anyone share with me this feeling?"
786,Feeling like you want to jump clear out your skin.,"
It’s the feeling I hate the most. I feel as if I want to tear skin apart and jump right out. It usually happens when I get in my head and begin to have thoughts of harming myself and feel like I’m about to lose all control."
787,help :(,"soo these past few months, I’ve been telling myself that I’m okay and I always told myself that I can do all the task even tho I’m overwhelmed with it. Today, all of the stress that were piled-up was released. My mental, emotional, and social aspect were affected. I deactivated all of my socmed accounts and been secluded from the society for almost 2 weeks right now. I don’t know what to do :(("
788,I need help figuring things out,"I've been confused lately about many things and getting even more suicidal and I kind of... don't know why. I don't know why for so many things.

I don't feel like I feel anything at all, at least nothing good, not for too long. Most days I just feel empty or sad or angry for hours upon hours, or could just contemplate suicide for hours, and I don't know why, I wanna fix it but I don't know how and this is killing my slowly.

I know I have depression, therapist figured that out, and I'm taking meds for it (Zoloft I think?) but I really don't feel that they work but everyone tells me I'm getting better but I don't feel I am, and I've told them.

I just... wanna know the source of these things so I can fix them... I wanna fix my lack of feeling, I wanna get better meds, I want to stop being suicidal but I don't know how. My therapist just tells me to try to recognize I'm content but I don't know how, same for everything else. 

I also forgot to mention another thing... I'm very dependent on others for emotion and I want to fix that but I've been trying on my own for so long but I haven't gotten any better... I've probably just gotten worse. 

I want help on figuring these things out... because I don't know what the cause of it is.

Ill give any information I can or feel comfy with giving."
789,Why words hurt me so much?,"Hi everyone. I am a 21M, and in my whole life I considered myself a sensitive person.

Idk why, but in my whole life I waa easily offended. People being rude to me was enough to ruin my day.

Yesterday, in my work, someone was a bit rude to me and I cant stop thinking about it. Just the memory makes me a bit sad. (She said no big deal. She was a bit aggressive to me, but i think the woman had a bad day. Nothing against me).

So, what kind of things I can do to stop being so fragile? Is there any way to become more strong, more resistent?"
790,Alcohol,"Okay but why is it when you’re a person who chooses not to drink that you’re a wimp or need to live a little more get more out there or you’ll have so much fun if you’re drunk 
Why is it not socially acceptable to not be an alcoholic 🤷🏼‍♀️"
791,I feel like such a failure,"
I feel like such a failure. I’ve dropped out of  university twice. I don’t understand why if I’m smart enough to get early acceptance. Why I’m not good enough to graduate. 

Despite working with a team of really nice  co workers I get on well with for the most part I’m so disappointed in myself. I don’t understand how I at 18 was working towards management in a big non profit organisation whilst at university. I had multiple internships and job offers. But this September when I went back to university I broke down crying in my first lesson and withdrew that same afternoon. I’m stuck in a dead end retail job. I don’t understand why I left school with straight A*s (SATS there called in the US I think) but can’t find a decent job. I’ve purposely avoid applying or pursuing anything potentially stressful to focus on my mental health. I just feel like it’s a never ending cycle, to avoid putting strain on myself I don’t pursue anything with long term career goals but since I’ve not progressed I feel depressed. 

I’m on anti depressants and just kinda exist through life. I feel so exhausted even when my moods most stable. I have a loving bf and a mother who is happy for me to continue living at home. I’ve been in different types of therapy for years but still feel broken and tired. I start a compassion group therapy next month so hoping that will help"
792,I'm being pushed to the brink," I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and we have been just barely making rent. My boyfriend doesn't currently have a job right now but is looking really hard to find one. so I'm working 38 hours a week at my minimum wage job and I also have my business at home to take care of. Every day after work I come home and I start making earrings. I'll make things till my hands stop working from exhaustion. I work myself so hard because I'm so afraid of losing the apartment but I'm so stressed out that I can't motivate myself to go to work anymore. People are so mean right now. I even work in ""soft retail"" and it's still so fucking bad. But not only that I have a lot health issues that make me feel like shit every second of the day. I come home and feel sick but I still have to work instead of resting. I'm just so tired and over worked and I try so hard to keep it up at my day job but everything is just crashing down and my pleasing personality is getting crushed because I can't be the best for my boss and my co workers. I'm just not myself. My life is just a blur right now. I just want to quit my job so bad and work from home  I just want to kill myself because nothing I ever do is good enough. I just feel like I'm disappointing everyone around me... I'm so fucking poor, I go without eating some days... But I'm working myself to the point of passing out. Why is society so cruel."
793,I’m really confused... and it is really bothering me... How do I know that I love someone (anyone)? I’m I crazy or weird or my mental health is acting out again?," I care about people but I don’t know if I actually love anyone, I say “I love you”, I’m happy to see them, happy if they are happy... but why can’t I feel it? Am I crazy? or is it the bipolar? I know I’m not depressed I just don’t feel it... 
I’m really confused... why can’t I feel it? Do I feel it but don’t know what it is..."
794,"I used to focus on my traumas obsessively, but now I can't bring myself to feel bad about it anymore.","Idk what the hell is wrong with me. I haven't talked to a therapist in ten years and I've been trying to force my way through my depression. Brute forcing rehabilitation, in a sense. 

My mom died when I was 7, and every day for 17 years I've relived that pain. I used to sit and I think about how she'll never see me marry, she'll never see her grandchildren, or meet my wife. I think about how my grandma lost her daughter and got forced into raising me and my siblings, effectively ruining her life and her plans for her future. I think about how it got to be too much for her and she had a mental breakdown, and how I caused it. 

It's not just the major stuff I think about though. It's every little traumatic experience I've ever had. I wouldn't describe them as flashbacks, but it's pretty damn close to what it feels like. It'll be a normal day, I'll be working and get hit with the mental image of my dead dog, or the last time my mom and I went to the lake together and she had a coughing fit. No trigger, just random, intrusive negative memories on loop. Like I said in the title though, it's not hurting me anymore. Or rather, not hurting me as much as it used to. 

Six months ago I was sat in a dark room, drunk and thinking about sending my brains through the roof. Today, I'm just...here. I don't feel good, but I don't feel miserable anymore. Instead of self pity and anger, I just want to follow what I want. I want to live, and I want to make the most of it. I'm losing weight, I'm buying nicer clothes, I even catch myself smiling sometimes. I wouldn't say I'm happy, but it's like I've found an equilibrium. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, I felt like putting it out there would help me figure it out, I guess. It's just confusing to feel okay again. 

Peace and love, guys. Hope you all have a great day."
795,weight loss or weight gain with prozac?,"So I might start taking 10mg of prozac soon and i’m still kinda scared and not sure if I will yet. However, one of my main concerns is weight loss. I’m already underweight and have been all my life, it’s just how I am. I usually don’t have much of an appetite but I still try my best to get at least 2000 calories a day, but it’s always a bit of a struggle. I honestly want to gain weight but I can never eat enough to gain anything. 

My question is does it make you gain or lose weight because I’ve seen people saying both. If you do lose weight how bad is it?"
796,What should I look into?,"To be clear I know this is not the place to get a diagnosis, I will be describing my symptoms in the hope that other people have experienced something similar or know what this might be, which I can use to do my own light research and talk to my therapist about. Sorry if this is not a good place to do this. Before the age of around ten I showed empathy towards animals and inanimate objects to a high degree, to the point where the idea of an animal in any kind of distress would Bring me to tears. I don't remember if this was a conscious decision but I definitely knew that empathy was the problem and I wanted it to stop. And around the age of ten it did. Now my emotions are quieter and and I have very little empathy. If you have any more questions I can probably answer them and if there are any problems link so I can delete these messages."
797,My sister is actually really good at lying.,"Basically when my sister lies about stuff I didn’t do and is quite a rat sometimes I just feel like I can’t trust her. My mother, who is stupidly strict won’t ever believe me because she thinks only girls are more truthful. This has been going on for years and I sometimes think of escaping my house or my life. I sometimes try to plan on getting overdosed through some pills but I think suicide is dumb. Sometimes I try searching to the internet on how to escape my house which I’m completely NOT ALLOWED to because my parents think I’m still young and I need to finish and graduate from my university to finally get a certificate and get a job. Back to the point; my sister keeps spreading lies about me throughout the house and turns some of them against me. I can’t live like this. I even tried screaming at my parents the truth and they still wouldn’t believe me. I’d say that I’m actually old enough to plan an escape for a whole night just to show my parents and siblings how I feel. Honestly, my parents are just a pain and my mom is just worse and my dad is the best but he mostly doesnt act. My sister is too annoying and i know this may sound childish, but I’m spreading lies about her and spread all the secrets shes been telling me cuz she can’t keep one secret. Now my own parents are always suspicious of me and they try hard to make me confess about something I never did. I was actually beaten up so many times just for all the fake lies my sister has been spreading. Any advice?"
798,I feel sorta guilty,"I keep seeing sad posts about people who had just really horrible experiences.. and just so much stuff they have to deal with.
Yet,they didn't ask for it,destiny simply brought all that sadness upon them.
And here I am...

I asked for this, and I'm happy with it. I don't know if it was a good choice just yet"

800,Should i test for adhd?,"Hii, These past few weeks many people have asked me if i had it, i was confused at this because i never really thought about it. For the next few weeks i began searching everything there is to know about ADHD, and thought that i may have it, but i am really confused. The symptoms that do fit me are hyper, sometimes distracted, concentration issues, making sloppy mistakes on test because i skip over words, i tend to be bored easily and skip for example with books and movies, in class i cant stop talking to the people beside me and i act impulsively sometimes, and keep procrastinating, losing my keys,cards,phone, books etc every single dat y i lose something, While all this makes it seem that i have adhd it could also not be it, because one thing that i came across was that people with ADHD have constant racing thoughts they can’t turn off, i don’t really identify with this for some occasions as exceptions, i dont even remember thinking, and when i think of thinking of thinking i can’t think and my mind becomes blank, i also don’t have sleeping problems because of Racing thought because when i am tired my thohghts turn off, i do have rejection sensitivity and sometimes hearing processing problems, moodswings, but my thought process doesn’t really fot the description of someone with ADHD, i did like 10 online tests and they al said i had ADHD-c, i want to go to the doctor to test it but i am scared that when i say the symptoms that they are going to diagnose me because there is no formal test for adhd its based on a psychologist’s observation, but i may not even have it , maybe all those things are just my personality and some other issue, me being like this has caused me some distress to some degree, but never enough to cause me to think i may have a disorder. As a child i could focus in class because i was scared of being rejected and not having a future, i displayed some of my “symptoms” in childhood like talking excessively, rejection sensitivity and procrastination, sloppy mistakes but because i was smart and such a good student who always payed attention they never suspected anything cus in class i always shut my mouth (when i was younger). I feel as though the symptoms have increased as i have become older. I want to go to a doctor to test it but i dont want to waste their time if i dont have it. Anyways i want to know if some of you relate to what i said, or that i dont relate to you. I probably don’t have it but i could but i probably don’t, when i am at home i shut my mouth, i really started questioning it when i had so much concentration problems when studying for physics and them remembering other times i had that, but i dont have that much concettation and distraction issues atleast that is what i think. I also tend to hyperfocus on things sometimes. Anyways sorry for the long story i am just really confused"
801,Really feeling like killing myself today.,Any advice? I'm constantly planning it in my head lately.. feel like it's inevitable.
802,Please help me,"I'm so tired of everything. I have been crying almost every day since three months and I don't know how much longer I can endure this. I can't talk to my family or my friends, because I don't want to make them sad. I am overwhelmed even by the smallest tasks and have to use all the energy I still have to not cry in front of my parents. I don't know what to do."
803,"So, is this true about psychiatrists today?","Recently have heard chatter that modern psychiatrists today do NOT do any therapy, and they essentially are there to deal with prescribing the right meds. 

Could this possibly be true?"
804,Sleep problems,"Why i go to sleep at 6-7am and wake up at 3-4pm every Day?

Is it dangerous to My health? 

I cant stop this habit!"
805,being straightforward with my therapist,"hey y’all , so i’m on prozac 40mg and like 500mg of depakote 2x a day . i stopped taking both of those because i don’t wanna rely solely on medication. i’ve been smoking weed and i honestly feel fine most of the time. i haven’t told her that i’ve stopped taking it and started smoking. should i tell my psych and my therapist??"
806,i’m tired too.,[deleted]
807,Am I having a depressive episode or am I just lazy?,"I was diagnosed with depression around 4 years ago and I've been on medication ever since, also 
 I know that depressive episodes may come from time to time. However, I never know how to differentiate between me being lazy or actually having a depressive episode. I just got out of a really stressful semester and ever since vacations started I don't feel motivated to do anything and I lay around in bed pretty much all day. I don't feel like doing stuff that used to make me happy and it's just sad because my thoughts tell me there is no point on doing that. However, as I mentioned before, last semester was tough and I don't know if I'm just mentally tired. I've been feeling like this for around three weeks, and I constantly have to force myself to do stuff. Also, my dad was hospitalized about a week ago and that made me pretty anxious, but I was already feeling depressed/lazy by then. My dad is now ok, but I don't know if that may have also affected my mental health. 

My therapist told me that among her college students patients it was common to feel anxious/unmotivated at the end of the semester because of all the exams and projects and stuff. So then again, maybe what I'm feeling is common.

Also, if any of you could help me figure out the differences between a depressive episode and just... bare laziness (?) I would really appreciate it. Thanks"
808,I so regret getting help. Fuck psychiatry,"I regret my decision to go see mental health professionals I hate myself, I hate this system, I just want to cry, I hate psychiatry I hate it all. I’m being out through this bullshit system now I can’t get my driver license back until 3 months, my insurance is going to go up, my family will find out about everything. Reaching out for help actually made my life 1000 times worse I hate how I lost my driver license, my family doctor won’t even help get it back, I need to go find another doctor and more doctor and more doctors fuck this system I hate myself but I hate this system even more. Why the fuck is it so fucking hard"
809,Am I okay?,"sorry if my English is not good

I am a top student in my class and have received an award in front of the whole school.  But my studies have recently become a pressure for me because even when I'm in the first place, my parents always said that the score was not high enough.  I am a person who cannot balance my looks and studies, meaning that when I focus on my studies, I don't care about my appearance.  This year, I have gained 7 kg and my dad said I look disgusting, knowing that my dad is joking, I still feel sad.  My father always wanted a beautiful daughter who studied well and communicated well with outsiders.  sometimes I think that dying is the exit in life because I don't have to worry about anything anymore.  I've always dreamed of a career related to art such as makeup or design, but my dad always objected and said I'm going nowhere in the future.  Lately, I've started to get affected by other people's words, I might be acting fine, but at night when I got back to my room I started to cry by myself until I slept.  I still have close friends who listen to what I share, but I don't find it helpful.  I wish I could become optimistic and strong enough to move forward with my dreams.  every time I became too emotional I started slapping myself and laughing while looking in the mirror, seeing myself in chaos somehow calmed me down to normal.  I go to school from 7 am to 5 pm every day of the week, sometimes until 10 pm, I always lack of sleep and the time to go to relax is nearly not existed.  lately, I started arguing with my dad about my dad not letting me go home late with my friends on weekends (I always have a Sunday night outing every week and I just hang out then).  I feel extremely pressured because the only time for me to be free and happy was taken away. After the argument, I always hurt myself by scratching my hand, slapping my face, and crying to calm down.  am I okay?"
810,I'm sorry everyone,"I'm really sorry everyone I can't message any more of the people having a hard time here, just please keep trying your best I'm really sorry.

I really hope you'll all be okay"
811,I feel like people think that therapy helps more than it (I think) it does and I don’t know why it bothers me so much,"Especially mentally healthy people. 

To be clear, I am not one to burden others with my problems (except on Reddit) because I myself don’t like to be overburdened with things like that, especially if it’s not reciprocal. 

However, one thing I have heard a lot of people say is “you should talk to your therapist about that.” On the one hand, that’s exactly the appropriate thing to say and that’s probably what I would say. 

On the other hand, hearing that bothers me, not because it’s not true, and not because I want them to say anything else or offer validation (usually I take this as a hint that I should stop unloading on them and I think that’s absolutely a good thing to be aware of) but because behind that statement I feel like there is an assumption that just by talking to a therapist things will improve. I guess it’s kind of also the trust people seem to put in healthcare professsionals and mental health care professionals, especially people who themselves have never been to one, as these people who absolutely know best and have a very precise and accurate way of diagnosing and treating things. But in my experience that has been so far from the case. Even the most well intentioned and brilliant therapists and psychiatrists have not helped at all or made things worse. I don’t blame them. They aren’t fortune tellers and the brain isn’t an exact science but I guess what bothers me is the way people say “only a psychiatrist can diagnose you — they have years of training” as if it’s simple like that. 

I have been diagnosed and undiagnosed so many times, put on medications that almost killed me, been re-traumatized and demobilized by talking about trauma in therapy and had so many conflicting diagnoses, suggestions and opinions on how I should be treated for my mental illnesses and how I should process my trauma.

I have even been told by some psychiatrists that traditional talk therapy could make things worse for me! I think what has helped the most is not anything from therapy, or medication, but simply the wisdom I’ve gained from different life experiences, conversations, perspectives and most of all novels and fiction."

I’d get into very bad depression whenever someting upsetting happens, i’d get paranoid and delusional whenever something bad happens, i’d always get impulsive and hypomanic when something great happens. Does anyone know why am I like this?"

816,is it repressed memories or am i just stupid?,"I'd like to preface this by saying that i've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder since I was 4, and like most people i only really remember a few events of my childhood (i'm 15). I can only really start recalling specifics when i get to 5th grade at least, but im pretty sure that's normal. All my family members say i had a normal good childhood but sometimes i try really hard to remember anything outside of stuff that was depicted in family movies and there's just nothing? And then i start shaking and my head hurts. I might just be dumb and worrying about nothing, and in that case im sorry for wasting anyone's time. Sometimes i try and re-live certain memories and i'll get really heavy feelings of deja vu and a lot of discomfort? I'm probably just over analyzing all of this so i'd like to apologize but i needed to express a little nit of what i've been feeling."
817,I did something very bad in my past,"To cut the fat when I was 16 I messed around with a 12 year old on text. it never got too far because her parents texted me like wtf are you doing dipshit. I feel very guilty about it and I’m mot sure how to come to terms with the fact I may be a predator or misogynist or creep or something. I don’t really deserve sympathy here because I’m clearly the bad guy I just don’t know what to do about and I am concerned about my future, it has been 3 years since the incident keep in mind. Any advice and opinions are welcome. 

I’m really worried about the girl and what she’s like now Bc she had to be fucked up to be doing stuff at that age, also I am cowardly afraid of my future and implications this has. Talking to a therapist is not a option rn btw"
818,Does harm ocd relate to harm coming to yourself also? For example scared of “what if others hurt you”?,?
819,Low cost therapy options?,"As most people are struggling financially with the worlds situation, are there any low cost/free options for therapy/support that is somewhat more... professional (for lack of better words) help?"
820,Considering calling the psych ward on myself help,[deleted]
821,Don’t touch me. It’s nothing person just understand I don’t want to be touched.,"I don’t have many people in my life so i don’t have many experiences to have skin to skin human contact, i am mainly stuck with my family. My brother constantly tries to hug me. I tell him no, i am assertive about it, i express my feelings clearly about it but he just doesn’t understand. or he just doesn’t want to accept. i was molested when i was younger. wow that’s hard to type out and further put on the internet. anyway, my brother is aware, but he’ll continue to ask me “god why can’t i just give you a fucking hug?!” and bro i try i have given you that single valid reason many times. i don’t know what to do about it. it makes me so uncomfortable to be touched in any way without consent, even if it’s a simple pat on the back. it fills me with anxiety. yes i can find people that i would be comfortable with touching in any way, and i believe i recently have found someone so i’m thankful for that,, but my brother-he just takes everything so personally. it’s not your fault it’s not all about you it fills me with with anxiety it makes me shake and makes me want to crawl out of my skin and never return i know it might not seem like a big thing to you but please god please understand when somebody fucking says NO."
822,I just want to feel happy or even okay how,"It's bad my life right now is bad I'm in a bad place and it is getting worst every day I'm running out of  time , I'm watching my loved once suffering every day and i can't help them or i don't want to it is hard to know who you love or care about these days I'm starting to see that life from my perspective means that you have to be the big bad boss or the small stupid worker there is no other choice in my country at least but the only thing that i truly hate is that those big bad bosses go to the public and act if we are doing okay and there is no problem with our country but the truth is the opposite and the really stupid thing is that we as normal citizens belive them the problem is so obvious and the solution is obvious too but it can't happen if there is only one of me i need people to understand that we can win that we can do anything if we start it we just need to start it"
823,Telling The Truth,"I will be honest, I need help. It takes a lot for someone to tell themselves that they need help. I’ve been so hesitant to tell my parents about my depression and show them my scars but I don’t know when to tell them. I can’t tell them now because Christmas is coming up and I can’t tell them in January because I have 2 parties I need to attend to make my friends happy and my mom has a birthday is January. I wanna tell my parents sometime in February or March but I don’t know whether to ask to see a therapist or go to a hospital because a therapist helps but hospitals you can get help and meet new people. What should I do and when should I tell them?"

826,a bad few years,"so i’ve had a pretty shitty past few years. so i was very stressed about studying for my final exams about 2 years back and it was around my birthday. my grandfather (who was constantly in and out of hospitals) had been admitted into a hospital for a very small reason he had some abnormal vitals and they just wanted him there for observation for 1-2 days. then he developed pneumonia and it got pretty bad whilst treating this they found stage 4 pancreatic cancer, they put him on life support and he died about a week after that the day before my birthday. i was shocked to say the least just so confused. they had the funeral on the day of my calc final so i had to skip it and take it the day of my eng 2 exam. that summer i did okay i guess i was in denial for quite a while. i started my next year of school stressed and it only got worse i finally came to the realization that he was gone. i mean he was the reason that i steered my life the way i did, so i could help him and now what he’s dead i and can’t do anything. was it all for nothing ? so i started dating this guy to try and give myself a reason to live, he then started hooking up with my friend. my best friend of 10 years tried to kill himself and was in a coma for 2 months. then covid came about and i was completely isolated with my thoughts. then a very close family member died and that pushed me over the edge. i started having regular 4-5 hour panic attacks where i had a hard time breathing and i started to become physically sick from it. i wasn’t sleeping and i had to manage to put up a facade around anyone because i didn’t want to burden them. i started having suicidal thoughts. then i started my current year of school and my issues have heavily impacted my studies i’ve always been a “a-b+” kid but i started failing numerous classes. i genuinely don’t know what to do i thought about going to the mental hospital or going to therapy but i can’t afford it and don’t want to be a burden for others to take care of . i just want input on how to deal with this because i don’t know what to do and i’m afraid of what i could do if the slightest thing happens."

Then due to them not giving my money back my car payment bounced. They supposedly sent me a letter I never got..... Only an email with a warning I ""might"" be in danger at the end of NEXT MONTH. got that email 2 days ago. Today (the day I got paid and I would be able to make another payment)..... They came and fucking. Took my car. At 2am

830,Moving into a mental health care home/supportive housing,"TW! 

Hi everyone, I just joined the group, I needed something to rant too and I want to spread my story I don’t know why but thank you for reading, anyways...

I’m an 18 year old female whose live in the UK, I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, overactive thyroid and Coeliac disease. Aswell as emotionally unstable personality disorder(eupd), anxiety + depression, ADHD+Autism. 

This year has been the toughest year of my life not only COVID 19 happened but my mental health has been the worst.
 In March I went into a children mental health hospital about 4 hours away from me, I was there untill I turned 18 in May. 
Then in June I was diagnosed with eupd, it was so hard to get used to and still am, I’m still learning about the disorder, but it’s hard to read up on it, does anyone else relate to this? I think it triggers me because I know it’s me and i have it. 

Eupd is so hard, draining, and depressing, I end up in hospital(normal hospital) every 2 weeks due attempting suicide. I don’t know many people with eupd so if you do or have bpd please comment below so i know I’m not alone. 

So now I’m December I’m moving to a care home especially people with severe mental illnesses I’m nervous yet excited, being at my home now with my 12 year old sister, and parents. I’m not save there nor my family is not safe aswell, I’m not going to say what happened but it’s very scary. 

Has anyone else moved in a care home? It’s my first time moving out. 

Thank you,

831,Help me understand what's going on,"Hi,

A few years ago I experienced psychosis and paranoia around the time I quit smoking weed. Doctors put me on zyprexa (atypical antipsychotic) and I've been on it ever since. Over the years I've developed, what I think is anxiety, but basically every once in a while I my mind just kicks into overdrive and I start going over conversations and embarrassing moments from the past and it feels like I'm going insane? I feel on the brink of sane and insane. This lasts about a week or two then goes away for a while. Is this racing thoughts and could I be bipolar? I'm thinking about going back to the doctors and getting a diagnosis on this. Just wanted to ask here so I get a general understanding first.

Thanks."
832,I could really use some kind and reassuring words (very long),"So, background story.

My mom's an addict and my dad and I have been dealing with it for about 4 years now. Sometimes on it she can get a little... angry.
Two days ago, after a couple months, she had a relapse. She hallucinates and says crazy stuff. I told my friend about it because I found it almost funny, but she got incredibly worried that I was in severe danger and she caved and called CPS.
CPS came over that day and we managed to keep him out of the house. I didn't know at this point that it was my friend who reported me. I told her about what was going on, because I trusted her, and I kind of laughed about how we BS'ed the whole interview. My mom's fine now, she really is, but CPS doesn't know that and neither does my friend or my grandma who we live with and has the power to kick us out. I came in school for an exam today, which I thought was odd since everything's virtual and I was the only one coming in. Afterwards, I was pulled into a room with a social worker who then proceeded to prod at me. I lied and I lied but eventually he showed me the screenshots of me texting my friend and there was nothing I could do other than say I was exaggerating. He promises mom's not going to jail and nobody is getting into trouble, but my bio-dad (who lives about 45 minutes away) will know, and he's not gonna be happy about me lying all these years, and so will my grandma.
Essentially, here's what's going to go down: CPS will tell my grandma what's going on, but my grandma won't kick me or my dad out, it'll be my mom. She's going to be kicked out and my mom and dad will pretty much either have to break it off or see each other in secret. Maybe she'll have to go to rehab, but that's on her. Since mom has already broken grandma's trust in the past twice I think, I doubt she's gonna forgive her (you may never know), but she has a home both in a house close by and and her parents which are also close by. So, basically, an abusive marriage is going to end and my mom can't be around me anymore, which is kind of what I wanted in the first place. But dad's not so happy. He claims he's not mad at me (he is), but he is at my friend who reported, and especially at my mom. He's freaking out right now and I know I'm fine, but I'm just really upset. I'm so tired of babysitting and protecting my mom. I just wanted a normal life. If you have any words, I'd really appreciate them right now."
833,Anyone else?,"Anyone else's mother cares more about her virtual children rather than her actual, real children? :D"
834,I am so scared what do I do?,"TW: talk of SH

I have a Dissociatives disorder( it’s more like a symptom of another disorder)
Specifically DPDR mostly  Derealisation.

In the last two years I have been waking up with cuts all over my body that I don’t remember doing, I have been open about it with my psychiatrist and through out the years I have developed good strategies(the tipp skill, 5 sensors, dbt stuff) to help with grounding.

However about a mouth ago I woke up to a very shocking cut that ended up me needing stitches, this was terrifying because it has never gotten that bad before.
After this I have been waking up to pretty scary looking cuts. 
Christmas is a very triggering time for me and my physic and social worker is not available through the holidays, I have Contacts to some mental health crises teams but I am scared.

I don’t know what I do in these states I don’t remember Anything.
I am working out with my social worker before they have Christmas break to get me in a
Housing place from Christmas eve till Boxing Day.
 but because I am I’m not in any immediate danger and I have a house that I can live in I have been rejected from all of them so fair (which I understand and is valid)

I am really scared, I don’t know what to do, I think I’m doing everything right so fair but I can’t shack this feeling off, I feel so powerless in this.

What do I do, can anyone help me? Has anyone else had this?"

836,I don’t remember anything prior to 15/16 years old... I just turned 18,"Title basically. I’m terrified by the way my memory and the vast majority of my life just seem to be gone. My friends will bring up past things we did together and I’ll go along with it in the moment but in reality I remember nothing. There are some events here and there that I’ll remember occasionally, but I can’t pinpoint them on a timeline and they’re foggy, I can hardly remember details beyond a basic emotion attached to it. Sometimes looking at pictures taken during an event helps a little but it’s horrible, I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore. My short term memory has become terrible too, the only way I know what I’ve been doing all day is because I got into the habit of documenting everything I do each day - it’s the only way I can remind myself that I exist. 

I know extreme memory loss like this is often due to trauma/PTSD, yet I’m almost certain I’ve never been through a traumatic or PTSD-inducing event that would cause this. I’ve heard of depression leading to memory loss, but would it cause it on such a big scale? I’m only 18 yet I just barely remember 2 of those 18 years. I just want to know what it’s like to not have a blank space where memories should be. It scares me so much."

839,please give some advice for me (tw rape),[deleted]
840,Can teasing be a healthy thing?,"I’m asking because today I got in a conversation with my dad about this subject. Basically in the country he grew up in, it’s considered culturally “normal” for people to constantly pick on each other, even over things they can’t necessarily control, and that everyone is in on the joke. He maintains that it’s a good practice for helping people develop a “resilience” to the harsh realities of the world, like when people join the military and are subjected to certain things. But as someone who experienced legitimate abuse from my older siblings in my youth, I have a different perspective. I feel like the lines between good natured teasing and legitimate abuse can easily be blurred and that this practice may unintentionally normalize abuse and make it harder for people to recognize, and make people less likely to speak up when it is happening. Idk, what do you guys think?"
841,Can this be a compulsion? Also in need of POCD advice,"To give a little input, these thoughts started bugging me some months after I was watching porn one day and suddenly a hentai video started playing with children/pre-teens and I was already feeling turned on from the other videos but I felt some more with that one. I didn't think about it for months and then suddenly ""puff! remember when...?"" (In addition, I heard someone correlating Pedophilia with the LGBTQ+ community, and being a part of it, it was kind of a trigger.)

So I've been dealing with some pocd thoughts lately and so when I'm scrolling through Instagram and see someone I find attractive I frequently need to go in their bio to check their age. Some of them don't have it, some do and are my age or older and there was this one who was 13 (I'm 16, turning 17 next month) and made me freak out (even though I understand it's not that big of a deal). Bedsides, when the person is older, my mind goes like ""well, you only liked them cause they look younger"" which is horrible.
And also my brain has been kinda like ""you were never actually attracted to anyone your age or older that is just a lie you tell yourself"" lately (which is completely untrue but still makes me feel awful). 

Also, I think I have to say that I've never felt interested in kids (I actually don't really like them) and actually have lots of crushes in older celebrities (and am in love with someone my age). 

This is the second time I'm dealing with pocd thoughts and it sucks so I'd like to know:

1. Can that ""checking the bio"" thing be a compulsion? 
2. Any advice on the thoughts? 

I'd really appreciate any help you could give me!"

844,Anyone else absolutely PANICKING over the holidays?,"I’ve literally had panic attacks every year around the holidays ever since I became an “adult.” There’s so much to do and money is tight this year cause of the pandemic. I’ve been unemployed since April and I feel like crap because I of course want to get everyone at least something but I’m broke af. I’ve been applying for jobs since last month, but I yet to hear anything back from anywhere. I also doubt I’ll get a job right before the holidays but fingers crossed. 

My plan now is to just wait till after the holidays when I’ll have a bit of money (because that’s all I asked for this year) and buy gifts then but still. I just hate going to peoples houses for the holidays and showing up empty handed. Anyways, I know it’ll work out in the end but my anxiety is just through the roof.

845,Is it okay for my mom to walk away while I’m talking to talk on the phone?,"This just happened and I don’t know if I was an asshole for thinking it was bad or not but basically, I was on my lunch break and I wanted to go to my kitchen to tell my mom about something on the news, not even mid sentence she tells me to hold and walks away to her office to talk on the phone. I asked my twin sister who was at an angle were she could see her phone screen and she told it was my mother’s boyfriend. I told my mom multiple times that I don’t like her boyfriend despite never meeting him, so she was very known to the fact that I would probably flip out. Like I said I don’t know if I was a complete jerk or if I had a right to get angry about this. I’m honestly just so mad because I know that if my sister didn’t tell my mom that I was angry she wouldn’t of even noticed. I have always been a very sensitive person especially when It comes to mother and fathers relationships and not to mention have the weight of school and moving back and forth from house to house. I don’t know if that makes what I did right (if it was wrong) but I’m just so upset and I feel really sad about this."

So far I’ve gotten 4 piercings in the last 8 months, and am getting another 2 done tomorrow. I got my first tattoo done about 3 months ago, and am going in today for my second. 

I’m just curious if anyone is in a similar situation? Sometimes I question if my motives for getting these done are just for aesthetics or also to feel some kind of physical pain that doesn’t make me look mentally unstable."

849,Possible disassociation episode,"Lately, I’ve been so stressed lately about a variety of things. My beloved dog also passed away unexpectedly at the age of 4, resulting in my heart being shattered. I’ve been feeling extremely numb and incapable of processing emotion to its full potential. Last night my boyfriend came over- we spend every single night together with no awkwardness or anything of the sorts. I felt so anxious in his presence, like I didn’t know who he was. He was doing nothing wrong and was being exceptionally sweet, as usual. He was talking and it felt like i was watching him talk from another perspective, like somebody hiding in the closet. It felt like i smoked weed and got weird around somebody I didn’t know... it made me feel horrible and guilty because I didn’t know why it happened and I’m sure it would make him sad to know I was feeling that way. I figured this must be a result of my stress and anxiety, but either way I hated every moment of it. I woke up this morning still feeling weird because of it. Any thoughts?"
850,Which is an appropriate reaction to someone revealing they suffered or still suffer because of something?,"I mean, an answer that can make them feel better but does not minimize nor ignore the problem. Something that leaves the possibility to face the problem open, without making them worrying or feel inadequate.

E.g. if a person you know reveals you they struggle accepting their appearance to the point they have been to the therapist, what should you say?
""I like you"" makes it all about you and minimize it; ""I understand"" or ""I'm with you"" add nothing, it's not enough if they are close to you; ""That's not true"" or ""You're ok this way"" vanish the whole thing that made them suffer...

852,Mental Health Apps You Can Download/Purchase,"Phones, iPads, laptops, tablets.... everything is about social media these days. We are in the year 2020 and *everyone* owns a mobile phone, even if it’s a Nokia. To put it into perspective, it’s taken over everyone’s life. But, that’s not always a bad thing, it can be highly beneficial. Down below, I will be naming you **THE BEST** Mental Health apps you can have on your phone *TODAY*! Unfortunately, many people can’t afford therapy or counselling and because of that, their health deteriorates overtime. So, what do you do when you’re suffering with anxiety and depression, *but* you don’t have enough money to get professional help? You download an app of course! Some of the well-known app are not free, but that being said, they are a reasonable price. Included in the apps are many different forms of therapeutic techniques you can do at home and much more. **Sal Raichbach, PsyD, LCSW** said that the Mental Health apps have a brilliant potential to reach people who are not otherwise receive the help and support they truly need. These apps remove the barriers to treatments. He goes on to say “* Sadly, only a small percentage of people actively seek professional help for their mental health problems. This could be for any number of reasons: they may not be physically able to leave their homes due to severe anxiety or lack of mobility, or they may not have the financial means*”. 

Firstly.... there are **Suicide Prevention apps**. 

*MY3*

This app is designed for people who are having thoughts of Suicide. Thankfully, this app is completely free. It also lets you customise your own personal safety plan, list your own copying strategies and it also allows you to connect with helpful resources for when you need to reach out to someone. The app also puts you in direct contact with a trainer councillor from the **National Suicide Prevention Line** (24 hours a day and 7 days a week), alongside a 911 alert number. Also, it gives you the opportunity to choose up to **3** people to contact when you’re feeling weak, down and having suicidal thoughts. **This app is free on iOS and Android**. :) 

*notOK*

This app is dedicated to teenagers. Just like MY3, it is a free app. The app was created by a teenager who was struggling with depression, alongside her brother. When entering the app, you would then discover a very large red button which activates and lets your closest friends and family know that help is need. It’s a brilliant tool to have. So, whenever you’re feeling depression or hit with waves of anxiety, press on the big red button on the app, it will then alert your closest people. When you press the red button, a text alert will go out to **5** of your closest people, with the message sent being: “*Hey, I’m not OK! Please call, text, or come find me*”. **The app is free on iOS and Android**. :)

*General Mental Health Apps*

Firstly... **What’s App**. Don’t confuse this with WhatsApp! Once again, this application is completely free to use. The app uses Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and also Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT) methods to help the user cope with different kinds of Mental Health, such as depression, anxiety, stress and more. There will also be a tracker on the app. It is a positive and negative tracker that maintains your habits and also break the ones that are counterproductive. Inside the app, there is a feature called “*Get Grounded*, this particular section contains over 100 different questions to pinpoint how you’re currently feeling. Try it out yourself, today! **The app is free on iOS and Android**. :) 

*Twenty-Four Hours A Day*

This app is based off the best-selling book of the exact same name. This app offers you a wide range of meditations from the book (366, to be exact). This app will make it much easier for people to recovery from different addictions and to focus on sobriety wherever they are. **Free to download on iOS and Android.** :) 

**Apps for people dealing with Anxiety**

*MindShift*

According to Psycom, **MindShift** is one of the best Mental Health apps out there, today. It was specifically designed for adults and teenagers who are currently suffering with anxiety. Rather than let people’s feeling get the better of them, MindShift shows us all the importance of changing how you actually think about anxiety. This app will encourage you, and encourage you more. It will motivate you to take charge of your life, to ride out moments which get intense and how to face challenge situations in your life. **Free to download on iOS and Android**. :)

*CBT Thought Record Diary*

The CBT app will document all of your negative thinking and emotions, analyse the flaws in your thinking and it will also reevaluate your thoughts. This app will help you gradually change your approach to anxiety by including emotions and your different thinking patterns for future situations. **Free on iOS and Android!** :) 

**Depression Apps** 

*Talkspace Online Therapy*

Now, here is the first application I have included that has a price tag on it. To begin with, this application starts off at $65 a week, which is very pricey. But, that being said, here is what’s included... you will be in contact and able to text a trained professional in this department. Not only that, but you are able to text this person as much as you want. You will be getting daily responses. As I said, the app begins at $65 a week to talk to a trainer professional, which I believe is better than paying $200-300 an hour to talk with a trained professional in person, once a week. The choice is entirely yours! **The whole plan ranges between $65-99 a week and is available to download on iOS and Android**. :)

*Happify*

This app is approved by a professional psychologist. It offers different mood-training programmes. It also offers games, gratitude prompts, activity suggestions and more ways to train your brain. Thankfully, it’s completely free and you can try it out today! **It’s free to download on iOS and Android**. :) 

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder apps**

*nOCD*

Brilliantly, the app nOCD was designed by the help of OCD specialists and patients to incorporate 2 different treatments, such as: mindfulness and exposure response prevention treatment. On this app, you’ll be receiving immediate and supportive guidance when OCD strikes. You’ll also be able to assess yourself by taking weekly tests on the severity of your OCD, while having motivational support along the way. One of the users to this app said “it’s like having a free therapist in your pocket at all times”. **It’s free to download on iOS and Android**. :) 

*WorryWatch*

The 2nd app on this list which contains a price-tag, but thankfully, not much. You’re able to get this app for $3.99! But, before you purchase it, here’s what you need to know... this application aims to help its users identify their trigger points for anxiety, to note trends in their feelings and reflect on when the outcomes were harmless. Also, it aims to change their thinking patterns for the future. WorryWatch is like your very own diary, and you’re able to **download it on iOS and Android for $3.99**. :) 

*Breathe2Relax*

Sometimes in life, we just need to breathe and remind ourselves that everything is going to be okay, no matter what. This is what Breathe2Relax is all about. The application was created by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology. It is a portable stress management app that teachers it’s users a skilled called “diaphragmatic breathing”. This app is fantastic for people dealing with PTSD. **Free to download on iOS and Android**. :)

If you have any questions or request, let me know and I’ll be more than happy to provide you with some additional help, support or even another app! :)

853,Having trouble coming to terms with diagnosis,"Hello, I have a question about the likeliness of my diagnosis. I have schizoaffective disorder, I 100% agree with that diagnosis (most of the time, when I’m not in that “I’m not sick, I’m faking it, I don’t need these pills” manic phase). I was also diagnosed with DID more recently (in spring) and I’m struggling with that. Would I know if I had DID? I know I don’t remember a lot, like most things really, but I don’t remember ever missing days until I try to recall them later. I’ve also had multiple concussions and wonder/think maybe the memory loss is more related to the concussions. I just feel like I’ve been misdiagnosed. I took the MMIP and had an interview and a few other test all preformed by a neuropsychologist to get this diagnosis, but it just seems wrong. So I guess, sorry for rambling, my questions are: If I had DID would I know it or at least suspect it? How do I come to terms with it if I do have it?"
854,I'm lost and I need help ...," Hi, I'm a high school student in my last year and when lock down hit, I became a mess of a human being. I stopped attending online school after the first week, my school email is filled with complaints, teachers reporting my all zeroes progress and I'm over here playing pc games, sleeping, watch youtube and do absolutely nothing productive. Ever since I was forced to go attend boarding college prep-school, I was doing great for the first 2 years to please my parents, but since no one is forcing me to do anything. I just, stopped, I stopped talking to people, I dont answer calls, I dont answer emails, I just... stopped. I lack purpose, the only thing that brings me joy is online communities back in my home country, I felt happier playing online games with friends, streaming and disregard everything that is related to my future. I believe that maybe, the pent up anger, sadness, despair I built for my time having to stay with my manipulative mom gas lighting and verbally abusing me for the past 17 years led to this. but, I know for a fact that it was my fault that I cant try, that I'm lazy and just a piece of shit of a human being. As of now, it is the end of the 1st semester, I have completed nothing and ruined acquaintanceship, friendships, relationship and opportunities. I need help...

&amp;#x200B;

 sorry for my half-assed english, I know I'm rambling but I just need help... I have never had any mental health issues up until this year when it hit the hardest. As of now, it has been 5 months since I have been a shut-in and I want to get out of this mess."
855,I recently got into a car accident. Can I still go to a crisis center?,"I’ve been thinking about taking a 1-2 week trip to a mental health hospital to help calm my emotions, which have been at an all time high. 

On Dec 10, I got into a car accident. I broke my jaw and crushed my left femur and left humerus. I’ve had surgery already for my femur and humerus &amp; I have surgery to fix my jaw hopefully in the next few days. 

I’m still inpatient at the hospital so I’m not thinking about going right now, but my orthopedic surgeon said I can’t put weight on my leg or arm for 6 weeks **at least**. 

Would I still be able to go to a crisis center or shorter term inpatient hospital and continue to receive the physical treatment I need on top of giving me the mental health help? 

I can’t just get a therapist because my car was totaled in the accident and I can’t work so I have no idea when I’ll be able to buy another car. Plus, I’ve been at my wits end mentally for a couple of weeks and I feel like this car accident is pushing me over the edge. 

For what it’s worth, I have no memory starting from about an hour before the accident until the day after (Dec 11). I don’t know or remember anything about the accident so I’m not currently experiencing symptoms of PTSD but I am worried that I’ll start to experience the symptoms at a later time."
856,I know something is wrong but I don't want to admit it,"Hello, this is my first time posting something like this. Sorry for the mobile editing format, and sorry if I picked the wrong flair.

I know that I likely have an eating disorder. I feel extreme guilt when I try to eat anything that I wasn't expressly told I can have. I avoid eating in front of others. I am extremely disappointed in my weight even though I'm in a healthy spot for a young man. I actually start to have panic attacks when I try to cook for myself, so I have to stop.

But every time I think of telling my spouse, I clam up.  I can't do it. I'm afraid he won't believe me, even though I know he'll support me no matter what. And the worst part is that as I'm writing this ther voice in the back of my head is telling me that I'm lying.

For reference on if any of these could be influencers: I have major depression and generalized high anxiety, and in the past I was diagnosed with schizophrenia but have had no symptoms in at least one year."
857,I want to badly help my Nephew. He's thinking about hurting himself.,"I (I'm 19, M) work with my sister(in her late thirties), who is the mother to two children. We live in the US in one of the biggest states, popular with immigration. One of her kids is a teenage boy about 16-17 the other is is teenage girl 13-14. Our house has about 9 people in it which is crowded for a small house like ours, but we make due with it. While on break with my sister, I overheard her speaking to her husband about how to help my nephew because he recently told her and his sister that he had planned to kill himself for the longest time. The only reason he didn't go through with it was because a friend talked him down.

I was horrified because my nephew is my best friend. He was the one I spent my time with the most, he would always play games with me, him and his sister would protect me from bullies(Weird right? the older kid needing help from the younger ones in his family?). I noticed that he's become closed off recently much more detached from the world, and even his family, say his sister. I chalked it up due to the death of my mother which had occurred last year plus I wasn't in the right mental space either, my mother and I didn't get along very well and at the time I was suffering from a lot of guilt. However my thoughts began to change when he informed my and my middle sister (his aunt late twenties) that he didn't feel anything. I didn't want to push it because I know that when it comes to mental health, you can't force someone to open up.

Nephew and his sister didn't have it easy growing up. He and his sister were heavily pushed to do well in school, otherwise they would be grounded etc (His mother had lightened up about it in recent years as she saw both him and her daughter constantly worrying about their grades.). Not only that but for a long time, he felt as though there was a bias towards his sister as his family never punished him and his sister equally. And I'm not going to pretend I was great with him either. I would constantly get into arguments with him about the stupidest of shit.

I need some advice please. I want to help him, but I also don't want to break that trust he has with his mother. I don't want him to think that his mother is spilling his thoughts to others. Yes I'm aware my sister should not have shared this info because it's the kind of thing that pushes people with mental health away, but please don't be rude to her. She's a mother whose never had to deal with her own mental issues growing up (Both my sisters are tough people who went through a lot of shit. She knows she's partially to blame how my nephew is feeling right now.), so she wouldn't even know how to handle her son's. How can I help my nephew without telling him I overheard his mother?

Sorry if this post is all over the place. I can't stop crying. I feel almost hysterical, I just want to help my Nephew

My nephew has refused go to an actual Psychiatrist/Psychologist. He has been receiving some kind of mental health help from his high school. But even then I'm aware that they can only do so much themselves."
858,I saw a disturbing image online and I don't know how to erase it from my memory. It has made me depressed ever since I saw it.,Why is life so evil?
859,Seeking counseling internship during a Pandemic: a nightmare of a story.,"My story:

Before the pandemic, I quit my job (of 6 years in clinic) to go full steam ahead at my dream and finish grad school for counseling quickly (or so I thought at the time). Last year I was able to secure an internship and that internship was canceled when the pandemic hit. My program has gone from a 2.5year program to a 3.5+year program. I won't even say how much I owe at this point...

The internship sites are swamped with applicants due to people (like myself) who have not been able to find internship. My school has been of little help. They blame the pandemic, have given us a list of over 50 sites (most unusable or don't meet requirements for the program... some are even in Nevada?), and told us in orientation, ""well... you might just not be able to find placement this year."".

I have an ongoing list of about 25 sites I have applied to and am going to start applying this week to WA state. I am exhausted and feeling disheartened. In the grand scheme of things I am grateful to still have a roof over my head, food in my stomach, and a supportive family, but I feel my time is running out to make my career dream come true. If this goes on for much longer I am going to have to drop out and find a job to start paying my loans back.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I am in the Portland, OR area. I am looking for any help, leads, recommendations, support I can get. It breaks my heart that future therapists are struggling with this due to the increased need and demand right now."
860,Mental breakdowns,"So I have a friend who has severe anxiety and gets panic attacks. She avoided me for maybe a month straight and today out of the blue, explained why she had been avoiding my texts and calls. I honestly feel so bad for her because she has it so much worse than me. But I've had like 7 mental breakdowns because she wasn't responding to my messages, and I realized i need to work on myself and give people some space. But today she also told me that she is going to drop out of college and join somewhere else where the pressure won't be as much (we major in dental surgery so it can get stressful). I'm honestly very happy for her that she decided to work on herself and is headed in the direction to heal herself. But on the other hand, I feel terrible and I cant explain why. My brain has convinced me that now that she won't be there, there is no point in going to college. And I've cried for maybe 2 hours straight now and my head is a bit fuzzy, but I need someone to tell me its gonna be just right."
861,Did marijuana edibles mess up my mental??,"

So months ago in September me and my cousin took edibles, I just got off of working and didn’t eat or drink anything, 30mins later mines kicked in, I had a severe panic attack, my cousins kicked in but he was fine, months later I still feel the effect of the edible till this day, I feel very anxious all the time ( really bad anxiety) I get panic attacks daily with nightmares, my chest hurts a lot now, I feel like reality isn’t reality, I can’t even ride in a car without having a panic attacks because I feel suffocated.. I talked to a psychiatrist but I didn’t tell her what I did in order to get anxiety, so she was confused and thought I was just having regular normal anxiety, so she prescribed me with Escitalopram 10MG, I’m very scared to take it because I feel like it’s gonna change me, and the side effects scary, if I take this medication will my anxiety go away?? Please help me I’m super scared"
862,Worker protections?,"Hi all: 

Is anyone aware of federal or state level (NY) employee protections for us? I’ve been having a rough go lately and have been missing work. I’m BPII and bpd.

Thanks!"
863,Can someone shortly explain the differnce between dopamine and serotonin ?,Could be relevant
864,I'm living a mundane life of misery and it feels like my brain is degrading,"My life has become very repetitive the past few years and it feels like my mental ability to hold a conversation or pay attention has decayed. In the past I would like to think that I was rather well-spoken and creative, but now I struggle to find simple words in conversation and I stutter more as well as I find it hard to focus and I'm slower at problem solving. The way I speak through text is not comparable to how I speak out loud. I have some people in friend groups that ridicule me and seem to think of me as stupid, which just makes me more depressed. I am also stuck living with my grandmother at age 25, I was planning on moving this year with the 10k I saved up over 7 years but coronavirus stopped those plans. 

The way I live now is miserable, with an extremely tiny room in a tiny house and with no privacy as even at a moderate volume, anyone in the house could hear what I'm saying from the opposite side of the house. I feel like its drained my personality away as I am not fond of my family and I don't feel comfortable being myself around them. I hardly speak more than a couple sentences a day. I know I will feel like myself again once I get out of this place and this town, but in the now, I feel like everything I am is slipping away and my motivation is drained.

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place, its a spure of the moment kinda post. I need to vent, I don't feel like I have close friends that I can vent to anymore. Regarding my ability to speak and such, is it all in my head or do I have a problem? Also, are there mental exercises I can do to improve brain function? I am paranoid that since I've put myself in such a mental rut that my brain is losing functionality."
865,I was talking when a friend when they said something so now I want to check,"In your opinion is it normal for a child to want to die , not like edgy way or suicidal one but like , I can't wait for my life purpose to be over so I can die and end this

My friend told me that this means I had depression for much longer than I thought

What do you think?"
866,I think I’m starving myself,"I mean, I don’t know what to say... I mean it’s not about my body image or cause I’m overweight (because I’m not) I just don’t have the energy or motivation to eat. I haven’t eaten anything in a while and now I’m just accustomed to constantly feeling hungry and light-headed.

Even after acknowledging this I still can’t bring myself to eat


I have MDD, Anxiety, and ADD. I’m on medication for MDD but I thought I was getting better. Im up late and sleep half of the day and when I wake up I’m usually playing video games. 

I also haven’t really had water in a long time too. Or anything to drink for that matter. If I’m out I usually have Coke but never water. The only time I have water is just a sip every morning to take my pills with."
867,My tooth was aching.. i took an ibuprofen pill and then i felt elated for some reason.. depression was gone and i just felt good/happy/motivated,"I took another one today and again... It pushed me into a hypomanic state ""which i utterly adore"".. so can someome explain this to me..

And how can i achieve this without having to resort to a NSAID?"
868,Should I be worried about this?,"
* I have struggled with anxiety, OCD, and intrusive thoughts all of my life. My biggest intrusive thoughts revolve around be some sort of sexual deviant or predator, like a pedophile.
* Recently, I came across a manga called How Heavy are the Dumbbells You Lift?
* Long story short, I found myself turned on by and masturbated to several of the adult female characters.   Specifically, https://dumbbell-nan-kilo-moteru.fandom.com/wiki/Tachibana_Satomi, and https://dumbbell-nan-kilo-moteru.fandom.com/wiki/Uehara_Nana
* I kept trying to figure if it was okay or not, as I felt anxiety over the fact that they looked younger than their age. However, I told myself that it was just my OCD and I have nothing to be ashamed or worried about.
* Am I right and my worries are just my OCD, or are my fears legit and I am sort of sexual deviant like a lolicon or something?"
869,Why don't I identify with my physical self,"When I look in the mirror I see someone that isn't me and the only way that I can see myself is my doing my makeup (which is very colorful and alternative and almost inhuman) and getting dressed up. Today my mom told me that I can't bleach my hair in order to dye it, and this caused a mental breakdown for me because my hair is currently the only thing that I can't make myself identify with at the moment."
870,I cant let go of the past,"Im in a bad state of mind and i just need to get it of my chest. 
I grew up with my parents and my brother. My parents were constantly fighting, my dad cheated on my mom and left us for a new family. My mom was emotionally distant and we didnt get along. My brother moved out and i was basically alone in my room the whole time. School was terrible and i didnt had a lot of friends. I created kind of a false reality in my mind when i was 11 where i pictured myself as a teenager/ young adult having fun, lots of friends and having a good time. It was the only thing ive ever thought about. School got so bad that i moved across the country to my dad and his new girlfriend and her family when i was 12. I left my mom alone and i still hate myself for that. But i was obsessed with starting over. Things kind of got better, i made a few friends but my mental health stayed the same. I lived there for 8 years. Im 20 now and i moved back to the city i grew up in. My mom moved to another country, i barely see her. We have a good relationship now tho. I think about the past a lot. I would give everything i have to relive my childhood. I cant move on i cant deal with the fact im never gonna be a child again. A month ago i drove to the house i used to live with my parents. I was so disturbed. I want to go back in time so bad. I know its normal to miss the childhood but i constantly think about it, thats not normal anymore. It just gets worse the older i get. I tried to watch a video a few weeks ago about a family vacation and i felt like throwing up the whole time. When i hear songs that remind me of my childhood i burst out in tears. I dont even know why i am like this. I just cant do it anymore. I dont know how to let go."
871,Crying my eyes out,"I’m not ok today. Everything has caught up to me. I had surgery a week ago and finally checked my mail and saw bills and all this shit. Normal adult stuff. I’m still on the painkillers and can’t swallow. I have no support system and my partner is at work all day.
I feel worthless. Like the scum of the earth. I can’t hold down a part time job. I sleep a lot (even before surgery) and just spend my days alone in my apartment crying and tv and eating. I’ve gained weight. I hate what I see in the mirror. I’ve lost so many friends this year due to fading away growing apart. 
I can’t afford any Christmas gifts to people that I love. 
I feel I have no purpose. I don’t contribute anything to society. I can’t even walk my dog some days. I don’t know what the point is. We just die one day and the world keeps going. I made a plan last night to take a hot shower today, brush my hair and teeth, and at least watch tv in the living room instead of the bedroom. 
I feel like I’m drowning. I feel like if I were to die a few might be sad but life goes on. I’m not one of those important people where they would say “she was an amazing so and so... and volunteered her time... and accomplished this and that...” 
I’m not going to hurt myself. I’m just in a very dark place."
872,I don’t really know what just happened( I think this is the right flair),"Hey guys, first time posting, and idk if this fits here but I also don’t know where else it would fit. I’m 18 and have recently been under quite a lot of stress, I won’t go into too many specifics but, a combination of the whole pandemic with my family being at risk and my long time girlfriend involuntarily going to in person school has cause enough stress, but I also recently got into a car accident that totaled my car and took my out of a job until possibly February or later, and planning to move into an apartment soon and EOC haven’t necessarily helped. And recently my gf was wonder if two of her friends could move in as well, and everybody planning to move in had a conversation, we decided no, but for some reason the conversation gave me a bunch of stress and anxiety, I felt like puking as I was walking to my bed, but I didn’t make it there an collapsed on the floor and tried some deep breaths, but eventually I payed down on the floor. Now normally I’d just chalk this down as an anxiety attack, but then something that’s never happened before, happened. I started, what I can only describe as shivering, but it was only in my torso, neck, back of my head, hand, and most concentrated in my arms. The only problem is that my room is borderline hot, It lasted for about a minute, then it just stopped. At first I thought it might’ve been a seizure of some kind, but after doing research I have no idea what it was, was wondering if anybody could help me figure this out?"
873,So many failures in life I feel like im just a walking C student. That issues feel real... but they aren't,"I hate that I just can't cut it enough in life. Always reminded im just barely passing. Smart enough to pass the border, but not enough to make it to the other side.  I can't stand this... I always feel like ill make it but I never do... I get so many opportunities, but I just don't have what it takes.... im good at everything i do, but im bad at it in the eyes of others.

I feel i work as hard as i can, but its never enough. Im never recognized or respected. Just a placeholder. Or a test or time passing....

Ever since I can remember... highschool 50s,50s 50s.... College... failing, 50s failing 50s. It took my 4 years to get a 2 year diploma. 

I never succeed in relationships.... 

First serious ... she cheated. 

2nd serious... she cheated. 

3rd serious... just a test to see how her family would react to her dating someone like me.... It boggles my mind. How am I to get along with her racist father when he says racially cruel things? I never disrespected him and I always respectfully shook his hand and greet him when hes around, but how can i be comfortable and be talkative to someone like him? But.. because i wasn't she needed to break up. Them or me.... 

4th... I ended up catching clawymeidia. I know I don't cheat so how did I get it... turns out.. she had it in her throat and she had no symptoms but it happened during our ""on and off"" break ups that never last longer than a week. I never had unprotected sex with her other than oral and even when asking if she slept with anyone on her forced ""break ups"" she says no.... after coming clean... its not my business to know her sex life. 

5th... placement.. holder. Why plan to date someone knowing you will leave to work overseas? WHy promise it will work knowing it wont.  Why do I have to follow her overseas? I can't... I don't have a job, how am I going to pay for my bills ? But she promised it will be for the best... i wont get a job thats ground breaking so i might as well come.... i can't. She couldn't afford to go either. So i used my savings and credit card and raked up 15k to help her..... eventually the distance and time apart made ehr realize she can't do long distance.....Breaks up with me this august. The most crippliong thing about it is I felt she was my everything. I was never more attracted to anyone than her, but I wasn't important to her. She even shown it... she would try to hard to be a good friend to strangers, but so mean and rough to me. I know its better for me to be seperated, but I wish she valued me as i did her. 

6th... shes the best thing that happened to me she kind and sweet, but the more she tries to help me and support me I get less and less attracted i am to her. I don't even share these things with her, my mom does against my wishes... and the more she tris to ""support me"" i get more repulsed and disgusted...at myself when I reflect at my past and a bit annoyed to be reminded of it by her. 

finally found a potentially great job. I been out of work since last year... Best I coud ever imagine. Im just not qualified... well learning im not. THe agreement request my education that is 2 years, but they want the 3 year one. I always mention on my resume im a technican. They seem to want technologist....The job ad said work  experience but.. ... not getting it now. Felt like a carrot has been dangled across my face.  On their defense they asked why haven't' i worked as a technologist, i told them its all the same the type of work i did is the same, but... last i heard of them.

always the C student..... im not suicidal or anything liek that, but I swear my issues feel real. Not as if its not happening, but like its a presesnce... that just sticks around me all the time. always sitting quietly and the closer it gets, i freak out. ... I can't even explain it, but sometimes when I reflect on it all, it feels overwhelming..

It is what it is but I just need to say it or yell it... I can talk about it to my mother but shes just always heads in the clouds. I can't even see her anymore becuase of the covid.  Most of my closest friends don't talk to me anymore.... just a gf who i wish just acts as a gf and not a life coach."
874,Cope up with stress and bad decisions?,"Hello! I'm an MBA student and currently a full-time employee.. the department I belong to doesn't have enough man power so I have to work overtime almost everyday for 2-4 hours at most. I have a flexible schedule so I can go to work anytime so long it's within a time frame of not later than certain hours of the day. Due to overtime and habit of not following a consistent schedule it had affected my sleeping cycle. I can't sleep enough and properly. As a result, it also affected my spare time for studying/attending classes.

 I was stuck with my research class and in order to pass it I have to extend my time with the subject which on the other hand causes me to drop my next subject. Although, sometimes after work. I do still have few hours of idle time, but I can't concentrate well studying because I'm already exhausted at work, so I ended up just using my phone or relaxing my body before going to bed. 

I believe that these idle hours I should have studied instead so I could have catched up with my lessons but I did not. Is this laziness? I feel that I could have done better but honestly I'm really tired and I just wanted to rest although I can't sleep yet. I'm so stressed of having a dropped subject in my MBA. I feel that I made bad decisions and poor time management that resulted to this."
875,My mood is fluctuating again.,"I’ve just finished work for Christmas, we had a 5 hour zoom Christmas party session which was lovely, now I’m just sitting in my flat alone willing myself to not cry. I don’t know why my mood drops so suddenly out of nowhere, I just wish I knew the cause. 

Northern Ireland will be going into a full lockdown from December 26th until February, so I’ll be spending my 25th birthday alone in my flat. I’ve always hated my birthdays, and I had decided years ago that I would take myself to Disneyland for my 25th, as I know it is the only thing that would make me happy for the occasion. I’m absolutely terrified about where my mind will go on my birthday in a months time"
876,Feeling Extremely Hostile Towards Girlfriend Without Reasonable Justification,"So I've never been formally been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder but have always matched up with the diagnostic criteria. Extreme polarity in mood, going from outgoing and loving to completely distristing and hateful of people. This has caused me to lose a lot of friends in the process.

I've been with my current girlfriend 6 months. She is awesome and extremely attentive. In addition to BPD I also have extreme fear around infidelity. Recently I've noticed little things like my GF liking other guys FB and IG posts (including her ex) and her talking to other guys on Snap (people she has had sexual relations with).

The infidelity anxiety and BPD mixed together have caused me to become extremely resentful and angry of my girlfriend. This has manifested in me being very cold and distant, unresponsive, unavaliable. Part of me wants to confronting her directly about the aforementioned, but am worried about whether I am justified in my feelings or are they simply a symptom of my skewed mental distortions / mental illness. I also worry about addrressing these behaviours and her seeing me as paranoid / clingy and in effect unattracted to me.

Advice and thoughts very much appreciated."
877,I need to move on from my current employer," I work in union construction and I feel like I reached a dead end at my current employer.  I have been with them for the past 6 years and it seams like the longer I stay with them the worse they treat me. I think they figure that I’m less likely to move on as someone new. They are also really cheap when it comes to providing tools often buying cheap off brand power tools. Today I had to drill some holes in a tight area with one of there cheap drills and it only has 2 settings, off or 100% power. Well the drill bit caught and spun the battery into the side of my face. So now my face hurts and they probably have no work scheduled for the next two weeks.  I think I need to muster up the courage and find a new employer."
878,I think my dad is cheating on my mom,"I am writing this on my main nick, since I don't even care anymore.

I think I just busted my dad on cheating. He was texting on Whatsapp and I saw heart emojis from both and a womans name (think I know the woman). My dad never ever sends heart emojis to anyone and this shocked me.

First I thought that I will have a panic attack, but then after I left to drive back home, it did go to this huge anger.

I know how it feels to be cheated and I don't want anyone to go through that. Now that I think of it, my dad is just like my ex. Jealous when my mom even wants to hangout with her sisters and really secretive of his phone.

Now I just have this brick on my chest that prevents me from breathing normally and I can't stop thinking about this....... Me and my little brother have already moved out, but youngest one still lives home.

I am thinking that should I confront my dad about this or just forget the whole thing.... Maybe talk about this to my psycholigst first...

Everything is already falling apart in my mind and now this. I know that things have not been so well with my parents for quite some time, but if you are starting to fall in love with someone else, you should divorce. They have been together for 30 years after all.

Just ranting, feeling so anxious...."
879,Musical Paralysis,"Sorry if this question doesn’t fit the sub but I don’t know where else to post this.
What do you think causes Musical Paralysis ? By that I mean that you stop listening to new songs and stick to the ones you listened to all your life ?
No more do I discuss music with my peers but they still do. I read that this happens when you’re around 30 but I’m 19 and since I was 17 I stumbled upon the hits from my childhood and I rarely ever listen to any new songs. I feel like nostalgia has a big part in this as it evokes so much memories.
What do you think ?"
880,Living with BPD and other disorders on top of it has become my worst nightmare. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone..,"For years, I have had issues with depression and anxiety.. It wasn’t spotlighted, until I ate a bottle of pills and nearly drank myself to death one day when I was 14. I have suffered from PTSD nearly my whole life, due to some sexual trauma done on me at a very early age.. I will spare the details. 

When I tried killing myself, I was diagnosed with ADD depression and anxiety, then given some drugs and went home. Like most kids that age, I was misdiagnosed and also wasn’t forced to keep up with my medications and therapy, that’s Ironic, since my mom was a psych nurse for over 20 years. I stopped treatment and did what I wanted, until this year (nearly 11 years later) because I just snapped. 

I have had emotional issues and temper issues for a long time, but not to the degree that I do now. When I say I snapped, I snapped. And knowing how uncontrollable that is terrifies me. 
It was like what having a fucking brain aneurysm must feel like.. one minute I’m my old nutty, quirky self.. working a 40 hr a week job, to loosing that job, becoming a hot pool of emotions, irrational behavior and aggression. The pandemic amplified my instability so much so that I was Locked in psych wards twice this year for suicidal behavior and reoccurring psychotic episodes. Since then, I’ve been diagnosed with BPD,PTSD, depression, anxiety, bipolar and more recently.. depression with reoccurring psychosis, or severe schitzoaffective disorder 

To fast forward for everyone, I’ll go to present day.. current day, I’m on 4 medications, trying to fight for social security benefits and a constant burden on my husband. 
We were recently married, after 4 years of being together.. this was before I progressed. 
I still have so much trouble keeping my shit together some days. I wake up angry every day with no one to be angry at. I take my hostility out on the most loving person I’ve ever had in my life.. he doesn’t deserve my shit. I don’t deserve him, we have been on the brink of separation already.. 

I wouldn’t wish for my worst enemy to be in my mind for even a minute. I wouldn’t wish mental illness on anyone. 
I hold an unexplainable self loathing that pours over on to the ones I love. I wake up almost every day with my husband smiling in my face, basically pleading for a good morning with me, just to give him the cold shoulder and a mean attitude. I wish I could crawl out of my skin and be anyone else. I feel like a terrible person all the time and honestly I deserve it, because I make my husband feel like shit. He could have anyone else and he still lets me stay.. 

I’m honestly at a huge roadblock since I’ve started recovery.. I still blame my problems on the world, I still hate myself and I’m still fucking my marriage up with my shit. Pills and Therapy only does so much. I take mood stabilizers, anti depressants and an antipsychotics just to function on a daily basis now. I take enough drugs to kill an elephant. 
I wouldn’t have thought even 5 years ago that this would be where I would end up. 

I have come to the conclusion, that if I do loose my marriage and whatever is left of my mind that I deserve it. I’ve done this to myself. I’ve allowed it to get this bad... 

I hear of some awesome success stories, of people recovering from bpd.. but having the severity of underlying mental problems on top of it, Im scared shitless every day that it won’t get better, that I won’t improve fully.. that he will finally walk away and leave me on my own. The future never scared me until now. I’m very use to loss.."
881,Dealing with some intense issues,So I’m currently living in a city that’s seen a drastic increase in violent crime and just over a week ago was caught in the middle of the 6th shooting outside my house and the second I saw in person. It’s not been easy for me in my life from growing up in a poor and abusive home in the south as gay boy to watching my own brother die at 11 to my parents divorce leaving me alone at 16 with no help then my best friend dying the same way as my brother at 17 to just one abusive relationship after another. It’s been a really rough life and I try to stay positive but over the last few months I have literally pulled away from everyone and I am starting up therapy sessions starting tomorrow as I know I won’t be able to deal with everything alone. Has anyone else experienced these types of traumas in life or has any insight on how to handle the high anxiety and crippling depression. Where I am currently there is no real community that I can trust as there’s far to many that have overly inflated self images and they will sell you out and stab you in the back in a heartbeat to feel some type of entertainment to stay relevant in the community. I will be leaving the area soon and moving to a new city but while I’m here I can’t help but feel severe levels of anxiety just leaving my house
882,Bipolar?,Look i just made this account cuase i don't want my friend to see this but i think theres someome in my head like they can hear my thoughts and see through my eyes and its been a while now and I feel like its changing me how I think and how i talk my friends have told me I have changed a bit but idunno i couldn't find any good answers on google so please just tell me whats going on i cuase i dunno im guessing like its some sort of mental illness
883,Mental Health questionnaire,[removed]
884,I feel like theres always a part of myself that's just spectating,"There is always a part of me that is detached from how I'm actually feeling, it's always analysing. It makes me feel like I'm lying to myself. When I feel awful and dont want to do anything or feel anxious, it's always, in a way cheering these feelings on,  like I want to feel horrible. No matter what, it's there and I want it to stop I want it to go away I want feel properly. 
Does this happen to anyone else?"
885,Life as a concept is not worth it,"

The world’s climate will raise to an unbearable temperature while I am still alive. Our favorite restaurants and businesses we grew up will and are closing. With climate change, we don’t even have that long to live, I’m twenty and I probably won’t die from natural causes/old age. Speaking of, i don’t know what I want to do with my life which means idk what I want to do in school and aimlessly wandering absolutely sucks. I like to lay around and be sedentary. I don’t want to work for the rest of my life...it sounds miserable. This pandemic made me realize we could all die at any given moment. I guess I say all this to say, I don’t enjoy life or the prospect of living. It’s exhausting. I’m tired of taking care of myself. I’m tired of caring for others all the time. I’m tired of constantly working to support myself, and I have a fun, easy-going job. Should I just do heroin and get sick until I die lol? Is life worth it for those of us that think of life like this?"
886,Why Cant I Forgive myself for mistakes I made when I was still a teenager?,I don't want to get into what I did and I don't even know if the person I did it to cares at all or ever did. It wasn't anything malicious or anything illegal. I'm sorry this is really vague I'm just not comfortable sharing it with a bunch of internet strangers. I just want to know if you guys have any steps for self forgiveness or ways to potentially stop self loathing and finding reasons to hate yourself for things you've done in the past? any things welcome :)
887,"I am that person, that can't, coudn't and ""not want"" change myself.",
888,Why do I feel like a nobody?,All my life I've felt like a nobody. Sometimes its like I'm standing there and no one notices me. I feel invisible. In a group of people where everyone's complimenting each other or talking to each other they'll just look at me and avoid me? Why do I make situations so dreadful and my existence is nothing. How do I heal from having to deal with the same stuff over and over and over again without wanting to end it all?
889,is there a specific thing that could be wrong with me?,"i don’t even know how to start this. there’s so much to explain. and please don’t hate or make fun of me. 

about an hour ago i wanted my mom to hug me and she was sitting on the couch and i was in my room and just woke up from a nap so i didn’t wanna move. when she said that she doesn’t wanna move either i got really aggressive. this happens all the time and i used to think that i was just throwing tantrums but i feel like there’s more to it. 

i eventually got up but i was so angry and screamed at her and pointed my finger directly in front of her face. this happens every day. when i’m with my (few) friends i can control it. i’m very socially awkward and shy around other people and barely talk to anyone. 

sometimes i don’t even talk to my own family but sometimes when there’s something that’s not even that important, i explode. it mostly happens when someone touches me at any body part, as i don’t like physical contact. for example, when my mom accidentally touches my feet, i start screaming ‘i told you to never touch me’ and throw myself on the floor. i usually get flappy hands and start stimming to calm myself down. 

today (when my mom didn’t give me a hug) i ran into my room and had some kind of attack, i don’t really know what it was. english isn’t my first language so it’s hard to explain. it’s like cramps in my whole body but i cause it. and my hands move a lot and it’s hard for me to breathe. 

these aggressions are really bad and sometimes my family members say they’re scared of me when i get so aggressive. the thing is one second later i’m completely normal again. i immediately apologize and feel bad. especially when i get physically aggressive and start hitting around me (when someone touches me without announcing it) or i start pinching, grabbing arms and stuff. one time i lost control and ‘accidentally’ hit my friend on the arm. i don’t even know why. 

the second after it i behave completely normal and have normal conversations with the same people. sometimes when i feel really depressed or s*icidal i even hit myself or scratch myself until the point where my arms are swollen. my mood changes really fast. depressed in one second and feeling like i want to punch someone in the face in the other. 

one time i explained other situations on another account and people said i might be bipolar but i am not sure about that. 

does anyone know what’s wrong with me?"
890,Does regular exercise ACTUALLY improve anxiety or depression?,"I know that exercise will make someone happier and more energised, but does this really work for people who have mental disorders? I don't have depression (but have in the past) but I do have anxiety which I have started being able to control to the point where I haven't had a panic attack in probably 4-5 months now which is great, and I really don't want to have one ever again. I do still get anxiety sometimes though, I have it a bit right now as I'm home alone. I often have anxiety around health-related stuff, particularly that I get anxious I will not be able to breathe or have shortness of breath, so I can see how regular exercise could give me a bit of subconscious relief as I would know that I'm being healthy. But, I have noticed that I do get more ""random"" anxiety when I'm stressed about someting. Can regular exercise actually make it so my anxiety is noticeably better? Has anyone experienced this? If so, how much exercise? Thanks!"
891,How to stop fixating on specific thoughts?,"I’m not sure if this is to do with my depression or something but I have a really big problem with fixating on negative/intrusive thoughts for long periods of time until I can check on what I am worrying about and I have no idea how to stop doing it. For instance, today I got into the car to go somewhere and had the thought that I might have left my iPad behind, but my bag was in the back of the car and I couldn’t check if it was actually there, so I spent the entire car journey constantly feeling like I needed to check. I sometimes can’t sleep until I have ‘solved’ whatever is bothering me and if I can’t immediately solve it then I won’t sleep well - I drag myself out of bed to make sure my fish tank is at the right temperature if I can’t see the heater light from where I’m laying and other things like that - it’s like once I get an idea in my head I can’t get rid of it until I see physical reassurance that it’s okay. Right now I’m fixating on thoughts that I might be really ill because of some ongoing medical problems that obviously can’t be solved immediately and I’m losing a lot of sleep which is just making the entire situation so much worse. I know it’s okay to be a bit worried about it but it is constantly on my mind and I can’t do anything to shake the feeling that something is horribly wrong even though it probably isn’t.  Does anyone have any tips on how to relieve the thoughts for a while so I can actually sleep/go like 2 days without having a complete breakdown over what I can’t check myself? I have a therapist and things like that but I can’t really shake the thoughts even with the meditation and stuff she recommends. :("

894,How to get used to happiness?,"Lately I’ve come out of a dark place. It seems counterproductive to find a problem now that I really do feel happy. But...

I’m quite used to feeling sad, even though being that way isn’t enjoyable. It’s like going home after a long day. Not being sad is like going on vacation and not being able to bring your pet. 

It just doesn’t feel right, it feels like I’m walking on a glass bridge far up from the ground. Being this happy and comfortable with my life feels wrong. Not to mention going about my days all happy and easy going makes me feel mindless. 

Being this happy is tiring me out. 

So any advice?"
895,I think I might have PTSD,"\*Trigger Warning\* Mention of self-harm etc.

Ok, so, two years ago, something pretty bad happened to me that send me into a really bad place. Basically, a guy became incredibly obsessed with me, that even after cutting off contact with him, I felt unsafe in my home town and school for *months* and I still do. Ever since, around this time of the year, where said events happened two years ago, these memories have been more present and have been harder to repress. I have the problem of not being able to sleep much (I'm an insomniac already, but it's even worse around this time of the year) have problems with feeling emotions in general atm, meaning I often don't really feel anything around Christmas. I used to cut and the events two years ago were the reason I started and I have been thinking about it again more often recently, just like other mental health-related problems. I feel more anxious and on edge for some reason. And all of this happens around this time of the year. I mean, yeah, I still think about it sometimes all around the year, but it's a lot more present and distressing around this time of the year. I don't wanna self diagnose, but I definitely think there's something wrong."
896,Depressed,So I've been depress alot and I don't really eat anymore and everytime I do I feel sick asf! I cutted couple days ago. And I cry everynight and my boyfriend told my mom and my mom called my school so I had to talk with a councellor and I didn't tell her things because I don't want help! And if I heard correctly she's getting me help by child services or something and idk what they do and I'm scared!!!!!!
897,Should I move back home for my depressed mom?,"I (22F) recently came back to visit my family for the holidays. Talking to my mom, I think she is depressed. She says that besides me and my sister, she has no motivation is life. She has no energy to live for herself. My mom has lived a very hard life. My older sister has schizophrenia and used to take out her episodes on my mom (she stopped doing that recently). My mom and dad's marriage is pretty much nonexistent, and they just cohabitate the same apartment. I even caught my dad cheating when I was a child. My grandma developed vascular dementia about 3 years ago, and my mom has become her full-time caretaker.

It really breaks my heart to see my mom being so sad. She is such a wonderful and kind woman, but life has not been kind to her, and she doesn't get any emotional support from my family besides me. However, for college, I moved to a different state 2000+ miles away, formed new friendships, and got into a healthy relationship going strong 2+ years. I currently still live in that state, and only visit home for the holidays.

Should I move back to my home state to take care of her? In my home state, there are not too many job opportunities and I'm not sure my relationship would survive the long-distance. However, a part of me feels like my mom should be important than any of that."
898,Help. I need help.,"I’m writing this on mobile, I’m sorry. I’m in the US, in Western NY currently (Rochester area, that’s about as close as I’ll get it down to.)

I am having real problems right now, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been going down for a while, but I can’t wait any longer. I should have been here before, but of course I was too stupid to know that. Quick rundown of the situation for anyone who got this far and wishes to help and read further: Autism, ADHD, Anxiety, Schizoaffective, OCD, Depression, PTSD, and Dissociative Tendencies. Those are all nailed down at least somewhat by psychologists, not from WebMD syndrome. And, I’m on Geodon, Topamax, clonidine for sleeping issues, Prozac, and L-Methyfolate to juice up the doses since I have a genetic deficiency in Folic Acid (yes, they even DNA tested me to make sure these meds would work, and they still don’t. Surprise. 🎊) I feel like shit every day, I stay in bed for hours, and if not in my bed, in my office chair just 4 feet from the bed, playing games like my brain still tries to do instinctively like when I was younger, like playing fucking Peggle is going to make everything go away. I’m numb, unless I’m gushing pain, because sometimes I’ll just break out into tears and want to scream into the void that is my room because I have no one to talk to except my dipstick parents who caused some of my PTSD when I was younger and are too stupid to understand what’s wrong with me, and just repeat “if you take a walk everyday and take a shower and do your chores everyday, you’ll feel better eventually, it’s the first step,” FUCK FIRST STEPS, I’M TIRED! Like, they don’t understand that I’m so emotionally and mentally exhausted that I don’t feel like taking a shower and wasting clothes or using up energy unless we are going out for the very limited time we get outside the house during COVID. I will literally walk my happy ass outside, 220 pound drugged up 18 year old female, in a onesie, in the snow, to grab the lunch that my mom sometimes gets me if she feels like it. Anyway, the point of this is, I need help. And not like psychiatric help, because fuck that, I have PTSD from that too (my whole life has been PTSD until 3 years ago for summary, k?) And I cannot get counseling since I cannot afford it and Medicare for my autism doesn’t cover more than an hour a week, which isn’t enough; I know because I’ve been getting it. I need someone to talk to, who’s free, and a friend, preferably a good listener and has some thought of their own, and also preferably not a cult leader (I’ve been enrolled into two cults so far, would not recommend.) It would also be preferable if that were soon because twice already this week my life has been in danger and hospitalization is not an option, so it would be great if I didn’t kill myself before COVID is over. I’m sorry if this is all coming out wrong, I just have been in pain and with no one to talk to except people who keep driving knifes into me when they get the chance, so I’m tired and I just want help. I’ve been through so much shit, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone else, and I need someone to help me that’s willing to take the time with me to get me back on my feet instead of give up halfway and push me back down again. I know that I won’t get that, but it’s worth a shot. Reddit’s full of nasty people, and I’m sure I’ll get another cult or public flogging for this one. But, at least I tried."
899,DEPRESSION RESEARCH - Looking for participants with depression based in the UK,"I am a postgraduate student in the School of Psychology at the University of East London and am studying for a MSc in Psychology. 

As part of my studies I am conducting research that I would like to invite you to take part in. I am looking for people living in the UK who have depression.  

 If you agree to participate you will be asked to answer questions on the following: demographic information, treatments you have previously tried for depression and how effective you felt they were for you, your opinion on a potential new treatment for depression.  

The questionnaire is fully online and will take between 10-12 minutes to complete.  

I will not be able to pay you for participating in my research, but your participation would be very valuable in helping to develop knowledge and understanding of my research topic.  

If you would like to take part, please find the link to the survey here: [https://uelpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_cLSIAna8ZrseEtv](https://uelpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cLSIAna8ZrseEtv?fbclid=IwAR17sFvuGvRjW94j7M06zvPyTQOyS5ge5BYpwXu6bOBvMmgAV4F_5LQCtaY)

900,Hearing voices when I'm sleepy?,"It happens everyday. When lying in my bed at night sometimes (like every night tho) I hear random voices. Most of the times they just say like random things that makes no sense. It's not that I hear them all the time, but it's just like some random sentence every X minutes, idk now. I also sometimes see flashes of light when it's dark(idk how to describe it, just one fast blink of light). I'm afraid this may be schizophrenia, but I also most likely have hypochondrium, cause I freak out about being ill sometimes haha. I als hear that those may be hypnagogies, but isn't almost everyday too often? What do you think?"
901,i am in a self-dug impossible holeimpossim,"  
better formed on this twitter thread: https://twitter.com/LimePotat/status/1340090466339995648?s=20

  
I think largely my failures currently are due to the following problems: extreme social anxiety (to the point of self sabotage and detriment to social life), extreme resentment of any and all authority, and extreme lack of self confidence and control. Some of these, such as resentment of authority, can be blamed on childhood, whatever happened at early ages made me dislike my parents to the point where i hated authority figures in general. I mostly blame this on my father leaving for a few years forcing me to Help raise my two younger siblings whilst my mom worked to keep us from starving or freezing. Bless her heart. My sister called to voicemail BALLING (to the point of vomit) every day for two years. He came back, but as an easily angered grumpy truck driver. When it comes to social anxiety, i can blame this on simple genetics and the fact that we never could live in one place long enough for me to make lasting friendships. This was manageable for most of my life until this year. I lost my job, and thus my way of interacting with Most of my friends, some i could online but this is not the same thing. This year of isolation and lack of in person interaction is whats hurting me the most currently, it is making it an enormous struggle to keep a new job, or uber to said job, i just cant and i hate it, This is where my lack of self confidence and self control come in, i cant force myself to do the things in which i know should be done, such as today, getting a lyft to work since i have no way to drive. They will likely fire me today because of this. Earlier this year Before losing my job (for complaining about said job on social media), i had done some stupid things and got into debt, this debt, along with medical debt now haunts me still. Id much rather be going to school right now to work on my social abilities and get a decent job but I simply cant afford it. And because of this debt i caused myself i cant get a loan to pay tuition. Ive dug myself a hole that i knew would be a struggle for myself to get out of, and i have no idea what to do.   Sure i should ask for help, but for some reason I always feel that i should do everything on my own, even my therapist doesnt know the full problem.

What do i do? Not sure. But as i always say for some stupid reason, ill figure it out, i always do.  Usually i do exactly what needs to be done at the VERY last possible millisecond required.  And i hate it all so very much. Im not proud of the way things have turned out. And im VERY well aware of what is and is not my fault. I reprimand myself 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some additions:  - i lie to the point where i lie from my very soul to get out of situations (when self sabotaging), today i told my boss i had no ride \*trueish\* and would need to walk. and will end up saying something along the lines ""i tried but walking from 10 Miles away is hard."" And will sneak from my window to the front door at the end of my shift to make it seem as though i went. This is not the answer and i know that very well, why do it then? You may ask, because i have to do the least amount of interaction possible with the least amount of questions. A lot of this could be better if i got a job where all my friends work, so i could bare going, but they arent hiring anymore, they may be after christmas, but im already almost a full year late."
902,Does anyone know how to stop emotional eating?,"Whenever I'm sad, stressed, angry anything negative really i always turn to food and binge eating kinda as a way to get back at myself. We are tlaking like mcdonalds straight after dinner or a whole pack of biscuits just stupid quantities of food.

Does anyone know how to stop this or at least reduce this?"
903,Painfully Exhausted From Caring for Others Mental Health,"So I have a younger sister who was recently hospitalized about three times after having mental health related issues and breakdowns. To be honest me and all three of my siblings have had to deal with traumatic experiences so we are all REALLY messed up mentally and emotionally. But right now she out of all of us is having the most difficult time and trying to be there for her has been exceptionally hard for me. 

I know that this may sound messed up to say but her being young and on top of that she’s pretty immature for her age feels like it makes this whole process extra harder. I know that when someone is suffering from mental health it can affect their thoughts behaviors and emotions. But it’s so frustrating that she won’t listen to me or she won’t do anything that is supposed to help her cope. Our parents aren’t the best when it comes to mental health but I guess lately my mother has been trying but still not where it needs to be so it feels like as an older sibling I have to step up once again and take responsibility. I feel like I’ve been putting my own self care on the back burner to help her but she is just non-compliant and I’m not sure if it’s because of her mental and emotional state right now or if it’s just her being difficult. Either way I am so exhausted and frustrated but I can’t not do anything because she doesn’t really have anyone else. Hospital bills are racking up even though sometimes I think it was unnecessary for her to go to the hospital it seems like she doesn’t understand the hospitals are for emergencies only and you may experience unpleasant emotions of course but there’s a difference and it doesn’t mean each time you go to the hospital (noticed that when she gets her period thats when she says she needs to go to the hospital and it’s having a mental crisis or something) Plus its expensive and exposed all of us to COVID.  

I’m just really exhausted and I don’t know what to do and she is frustrating so much. And she has a therapist and psychiatrist now which is already alot of money but she doesn’t listen to them sometimes or just wants do do things her own way. Shes acting really immature to me (shes 18) and idk if I’m messed up for feeling this way. I suffer from depression and anxiety too so it feels like I understand but the way she’s acting feels like shes doing too much but maybe I’m wrong for think that?"
904,Today probably should have been a mental health day but I can't do that right now. Its left me feeling trapped and shut down.,"I have been having a pretty rough week. Financially I am in a whirlpool as my girlfriend started her new job but is making markedly less than her pre covid job. 

I am an essential worker so I have to go in to work which isn't horrible thankfully but I do work in an industry where the vast majority of my customers are highly likely to tell me masks are wrong and require babysitter levels of management to keep them wearing masks abd treating myself and my coworkers with even a modicum of respect. 

My management and admin are ""working from home"" which i have found means pass LOTS of work off to the in office workers. 

My son just destroyed the transmission on his car so I am suddenly under the stress of figuring out how to get him to work abd afford repairs on his vehicle. This will be great because I am already working ab extra shift on my weekend and had plans to catch up on my woefully behind house work on my one day off...but not now. 

My savings has completely drained out this year, from my planned down-payment ammount, down to less than a month's worth of bills. Cut out all of our entertainment budget, dropped our internet down to the lowest, and we are sloooowwwwly getting some money back into the account. 

So I call my coworkers today abd explain I need a mental health day. A day to lay in bed and cry and maybe read or listen to music. Nope. I get it, no one wants to work when Covid is killing people left and right. I can't take a day off without coverage. Someone has to sit in my chair for some reason.

I'm sitting here trying to work but I keep zoning out and thinking how in January I said out loud to my girlfriend ""Holy crap baby, I think we are doing it."" It being getting our lives together. 

What do I do. How do I make it through days like this when I can barely get out of my damn bed but here I have to be, dealing with rude customers and physically fighting to not zone out for 8 hours."
905,I should stay calm but i can't,"Maybe it's because of the global pandemic and the numbers skyrocketing in my country again, feeling so vulnerable and trying to calm down but i can't, thinking of my family, my work from home doesn't look promising anymore, it's like a bizarre mix between the happy holidays and despair with fear. 

It has been a lot of times i've checked my e mail in one day just to see an empty inbox... and checking again hours later just to make sure damn even i felt my throat ache just because the fucking page took more seconds to upload, or crying to sleep just to realize i've been crying over a password i forgot at the moment and feeling like an idiot the next morning. I know this isn't healthy just to sit with the tension making the urging sensation to do something but there's nothing to do especially at night, not sure what i think that way during nightime."
906,Hearing screaming and not knowing if it's real,"I kind of feel like I am going completely insane.

So I got social anxiety and I tend to be sensitive to certain noises, like focussing on them more which makes my ears and head hurt and the noises sound different and way more intense.

Now, I sometimes think that I am hearing screaming when I'm in my appartement, which makes me panic.

I'm always scared that somebody might be in danger and that I will be to affraid to call the police and then somebody might get hurt or will die because of me.

But with the screaming I am never sure if it's real, if it's just a small harmless argument on the street between two people or if I am just hearing things.
When I put my hands over my ears I still hear it, if not louder in that moment. Then it sounds more like something/someone is screaming in my head.
And sometimes it's gone after that.
I really can't think straight in that moment, because I am heavily panicking.

I am scared that I might be ignoring people in need, but I really can't tell if it's just my panic or real."
907,just got diagnosed with eupd,"Hey guys, I really need some advice with this diagnosis, I have no where else to go to and I’m just so confused. So I recently spoke to a psychiatrist which went surprisingly okay and after we spoke she asked if anyone had discussed my diagnoses. And I was so confused because I thought I just had the regular depression. But she says to me that a couple of months ago a psych diagnosed me with eupd, and I wasn’t even aware of it. 

Now thinking back on it I should’ve asked her why I wasn’t told but I was so taken back. And I’ve kind of googled what it’s about but mostly stuff about bpd comes up and I’m just fucking confused. If anyone knows anything about eupd please enlighten me :)"

909,I don’t know what to do with myself,"I (F19) moved out recently and the monotony of work, tv, sleep, work is terrifying. Is this all that my life is?? I used to have so many interests and hobbies but in the last few years they’ve all drained away to nothing. I want to feel like a person and not like a shambling mess all the time."
910,Can’t afford to pay for my antidepressant,"Hi
 it’s been almost 6 months since I graduated college. I moved back with my family I no longer have health insurance nor do I have an income. I lost everything I care about my freedom, my boyfriend, my apartment, my dog everything. I can’t afford my cats litter or food and can’t afford to get myself out of this. I can’t get a job even though I apply everyday everywhere. I no longer afford my therapist and I stoped going to therapy but kept taking medication by asking my parents to pay for them. Every month they give me hard time about it. My mom keeps telling me that I shouldn’t take medication and that medication are going to make me addicted and that I don’t need medication and they’re bad ect. Even though I committed Suicide before and have depression and have been having panic attacks and mentally suffering for years. She still think that I’m not sick and getting help is a taboo so I should just pray and god will just fix me. I’m tired of relying on them for my medication and I want to stop taking it at least until I get a job but I know stopping medication should be done slowly and under medical supervision but I cannot afford that. I live in a country where mental health isn’t really discussed and We don’t have recourse. Can I stop taking my medication slowly without medical help and how?"
911,Does anyone else feel like as a privileged white man your not allowed to have mental health problems? Even though you were raised in a mad house.,"So I'm the classic white, privileged man.. parents had a fair bit of money growing up so we never wanted for anything. Even though it seemed idyllic on the surface both my parents have always been volatile alcoholics so our house was always a complete war zone. My brother tried to kill himself when he was younger as s result and they blame me for it to this day.. even though it was never my job to raise him. I've lost count of the number of times I had to take my mum to the hospital for alcohol related injuries.

Anyway, fast forward to now, I'm gunna be 32 soon and I've been researching the affect alcoholism has on a childs development and it explains allot about why I cant seem to hold down a relationship or why I iether avoid conflict or just be extremely blunt with people. I also seem to feel this sense of guilt for my very existence even though I'm not a bad person.. I'm very nurturing and family oriented. 

Anyone else have a feeling their too ""privileged"" to have mental health issues ?"
912,Not alone but alone.,"There is too much to tell, I don't know where to start. I think it all started when I became conscious of my body. I'm super skinny. I always acted as if I dont care. As if I'm not affected by the body jokes I get. For so long I tried convince my self that I'm not affected. Maybe that's too shallow. But basically I reject almost all invitations, from birthdays, simple hang outs or simply anything social.

I've been having mood swings. I don't even know why.
But I think it's because im stuck in a toxic environment which is my home. My father is super religous and my mother is a gossiper. I never even complain. But sometimes it really sucks hearing them talk about things, being hypocrites. By the way I said my father is super religious,  but I forgot to tell you that I'm gay. I came out to them one day and every other day after that day seems like I never even came out. They never talked about it. They all acted like nothing happened. For sure they didn't like it. My father sometimes talks about being gay and christiany and of course I get the gist of what he's trying to say. They underestimate my job also.

I feel like none of my friends are real. I have no one to vent out to. lol. I feel like no one ever understands me.

I hate my job because of my super
toxic boss and co-workers. Im only 20 and new to adult world and my co worker is the type that waits for your mistakes and tell your boss about it while she lifts herself. My salary is way too low that it's below the minimum wage in my country. My boss knows that obviously but he knows I wont budge because I really need a job and one wrong move things might go wrong. I used to be good at handling my emotions and not give a damn about things that don't really matter. I have thought of quitting my job but I highly doubt I'll ever be able to get another job.  And If I do that we will literally starve.

These things, I think are normal struggles but this whole pandemic lockdown period just made me miserable.  I feel so drained everyday. I don't know whats the point of living everyday. Things seems so repetitive and pointless."
913,Bored to suicide?,"I’ve spent my first 22 years of life engaging in simple pleasures... food... videogames... girls... pot. Now after two months of rehab I find myself bored into literal suicidality. Nothing is fun. I eat sugar. I smoke cigarettes. Watch porn.....Those things make me feel okay for 5-10 minutes then it’s right back to suicidality... I thought I was just depressed but I don’t think that’s it... I’m on 6 different medications right now.... I got my phone back... I get all the food I want... and this problem has never been worse.

Perhaps it’s just that happiness only exists in contrast to pain and suffering. 

If I take a cold shower... I feel great laying in my warm bed. 

If I don’t get laid for a year... I feel great when I have sex.

If I’m starving I feel great when I eat.

Is there something chemically wrong here or do I just need to start doing a bunch of things that suck to feel happy? I find it hard to do anything right now... but I think it might be because I’m mentally weak. Do I need to just go get food at doing things that suck?"
914,the way doctors treat me,"i've had a lot of psychiatrists over the years and at this point, seeing one is just to get refills of my prescriptions.  after getting a general feel for them. i don't pay enough attention to my doctors to compare and contrast, but i've noticed a few trends and remember some of the especially awful things they've said to me.

one trend is that my worst doctors have been strongly religious.  i was basically forced into seeing a jewish doctor when i was young.  i didn't know she was even jewish until a neighbour of hers told me she had two kitchens, one kosher and one not.  she was the absolute worst most vindictive doctor i ever had.  her treatment was 100% informed by a moral judgement and she was a total bitch to all her patients.  later i had a christian doctor who seemed to not understand any of my issues or want to get into them.  our sessions included a 'time of prayer' that did absolutely nothing for me.  my current doctor is a muslim woman who tells me i'm in the wrong in literally every situation because i should remember i'm the one with the mental illness so i must also be the cause of all discord in my life.

there's so much more here, but these are a few of the worst things a doctor has said to me.

1. when i was first diagnosed with the serious, long-term illness that i'm stuck with till i'm dead, i looked fucking rough.  my skin was shit, my hair was falling out, and i was basically retarded from my meds.  i was seeing this absolute shit doctor in a bad part of town and she asked me 'when was the last time you smoked crack?'  to which i replied 'never?' the doctor laughed and said i needed to get honest
2. the same doctor told me i was pregnant after a blood test.  i told her it was literally impossible because i'd never had sex and she said 'well, maybe you just don't remember doing it'  turns out my hormones were messed up from my prescription.  seems like a doctor should have known that could happen
3. after a psychotic break where i wandered around outside for a couple of days, my doctor asked what i'd done the whole time.  i told her i wasn't sure but i'd sat in a coffee shop for a long time.  she said 'they let you do that?' and i was like 'ya?' she laughed and said if it were her she would have thrown me out
4. my parents are awful and i have an abusive past with them.  i told my doctor once i wanted to move out and try to find a place back in my hometown.  she said 'why, what's back home?' i told her friends and familiar places.  she said i shouldn't move because 'what if your parents go on vacation and need you to watch the house though?'"

916,How do you know it's time to change your anti-depressant type or dosage?,"I've felt really low lately out of nowhere, weepy and just generally sad, low-energy, and unmotivated.

I've been told about the Anniversary Effect of PTSD — my event happened in fall, but ever since Christmastime has been difficult for me. So perhaps it's just that.

When do YOU know it's time to change either your antidepressant or its dosage?

Thanks."
917,How can i help my friend who's suffering from bodydismorphia?,"My friend has severe body dysmorphia and i don't know i should help her. She also has a lot of other mental issues. I wanted her to go to therapy because i think it could really help her but i think she only agreed to make me happy because she doesn't seem like she wants to go there and of course i respect that. 

I always tell her how important she is to me and I try to tell her how beautiful she is everyday and even though I truly mean it she can't believe me. I don't know what i can do to make her feel better. I truly love her and I want her to feel special and beautiful. How can I help her?"
918,I'm wasting away and little more than an inconvenience to the lives of my family,"TLDR: I need to go to the ER and my dad suggested that it was a good thing I didn't go today because it would keep me away for Christmas. Also, the current treatment plan would be an inconvenience for several reasons. 

I will start this post by saying that they do try hard for me in ways. They love me and tell me so very often. Even today as my dad scolded me. My parents nudge at me to eat and take my meds. Sometimes they get annoyed or stern. I understand that. It's been 3 years since the (big incident) and I've been struggling within my life and treatment since. I'm 18 just so you know. 

Today, I was supposed to go to the ER for a check-up because I am wasting away and need their clearance for eating disorder programs. I admit that I couldn't get up and was being difficult at the time to leave. I knew the time but I slept all day. After my mom stop trying, my dad came to talk to me. The part that this post is about is that he said it might have been for the best that I didn't go to the ER because there is ""no way"" I'll be released same day and I'll miss Christmas with my family. He also brought up my mom going back to school and how everyone is very busy and essentially doesn't have time to drive me out to partial hospitalization during the duration of the program. 

It's been this way for 3 years: Everyone has their own things to do. I get that but it also feels a certain way. I do appreciate what my dad means to do but this is not the first time trying to avoid something that'll help me for one reason or another. My family does have their own lives, that much is absolutely true. I would prefer something that didn't depend on their time but I'm looking at partial hospitalization because I'm not quite at the point for overnight stay type of treatment. Before now, I did fight for myself at least a little but now I feel like I'm at the end of my story. That's the way I put it. I stay in bed and don't eat and it's not that I'm starving myself. I just don't have the energy or motivation. My own psychiatrist mentioned possibly using the current circumstances as a way to end my life and I don't even know. Maybe I am. 

All I can think about, truly, is that I'm at the end of my line and though it comes with a whole bunch of other issues, at least I wouldn't actively be an inconvenience to their daily lives. I know my thoughts are severe and extreme but my dad took me on a drive to get something to eat and part of me wanted that to be a trick to get me treatment. The gesture is important because I got up but his comments about avoiding the ER get to me. But should I even feel that way if I truly can't get myself to go on."
919,"Feeling really hopeless and anxious, I’m hoping someone can talk me through this.","Hi there. I’m a 24F who suffers from severe anxiety and depression. I’ve had a lot of progress lately with the help of therapy and medication, but my volatile home situation is making me regress. 

Long story short, I live with my parents, my older sister, and her child (my niece). My sister has a lot of issues of her own, including an explosive temper. A couple of days ago, she fought with my parents and stormed off. Yesterday, she sent suicidal text messages to me and my dad, and now today, she’s sending messages trying to make me feel guilty for the argument, saying that she’s now homeless because of it ( I had nothing to do with this argument, btw. I tested positive for COVID on Tuesday, so I had been quarantining in my room).

Needless to say, this situation is making me incredibly anxious. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened, but not to this degree. I’m worried about my niece, and I don’t want my sister to hurt herself/be on the streets, but I also know this has nothing to do with me, and that she has a history of manipulating people to feel bad for her. I’m a mess right now, and I could use some advice or just some kind words. Thank you in advance."
920,Why would my best friend’s whole personality change whenever her parents are around?,"We’ll be chatting and having a good laugh together, but as soon as her parents enter the room, her demeanour completely changes. Her mood goes flat, smile disappears, and her voice becomes monotone. She responds to them with flat, one-word answers and doesn’t even make eye contact with them. It’s drastically different to how she acts around me. But as soon as her parents leave, she’s back to her seemingly regular, happy self.

I’m not sure what to think of it and I’m afraid to address it with her, or I guess I don’t exactly know how to approach it without sounding nosey. Could she be bipolar or have some kind of personality disorder? I’m not sure I can even trust that she’s being genuine with me anymore- what if she’s faking her personality around me as well? Idk what to think, so any advice would be much appreciated!"
921,Zoned out and crash on roundabout,"So yesterday on the way to work I had a car crash on a double lane roundabout. I was feeling very anxious driving to work and felt like i was going to have an accident. I slowed at the roundabout as the traffic was building up and thought i gave way to oncoming traffic. I got onto the roundabout and feeling like i zoned out, as a result I’m unable to be sure about what exactly i did/where i was. I know i was in the outside lane. I feel that though only momentary, i had zoned out and when I refocussed my attention to the lanes I experienced some confusion which may have caused the accident. I’m currently seeing a therapist, as I’m struggling with self harm that has relapsed from about 4 years ago. My question is, is this something that is worth looking into, or does everybody zone out and this was just a bad place that o experienced this. Was it just negligent on my part and could i have prevented it? I feel that my therapist doesn’t recognise that i have a problem, yet, without wanting to convince him of anything, I genuinely feel that i have underlying issues. 
Thank you!"
922,I think I might be hearing voices but idk?,"So 19fusa um I'm just going to get straight to the point here. I can't afford therapy yet but I want to know if what my thoughts are like is normal cause I read something that said it wasn't. So in my head there is me and there are 4-6 things that I refer to as me but not me. Because they are definitely in my body but they are not my thoughts. I can't control their thoughts they just are. And they have been here for several years. It basically in my head there is my thoughts and then there are other thoughts that I can't control but they group them selves. It's actually easier if I refer to them as people so I will form now on.

One for sure is a male or a trans man. He pops up randomly telling me to buy or wear male clothing but personally I don't want to, I do allow the hair cut because my hair is hard to handle anyways so I leave it short.

One is probably just my depression but Its definitely a me but not me. They think me things like I'm useless. They are going to firer me. You should kys. I always fight back saying I don't want to die I'm actually happy for once. I haven't heard her since July but I'll hear her again soon as she always come around after February.

Now this one is the newest person. They showed up after I was hurt in bed by a dude... Since then any adult alone time I have they show up. She isn't like the other thoughts though. She seems younger. Alot younger. All she does is cry i'm scared over and over again. Except once. One time I woke up to what sounded like my bed breaking(it didn't) and her yelling I'm scared I want my mommy.

There are others too but they only come around when I debate big things like a move.



This part may also be totally unrelated so skip to the next paragraph if u want.. but I also have something I call losing time. Well I always kinda had it as when I was little I'd lose myself in books forgetting to eat or sleep just to block out stuff that was happening at home. But really what I'm referring to started in 7th grade. I started forgetting parts of my day. I think it was related to my depression tho. Well it was just stuff like I'd forget what class I was in. If I had homework. What I did in some classes just stuff like that.. but in 9th grade it was sometime before Thanksgiving break then it was like I woke up and suddenly I was walking to my geometry class and not able to remember anything before Thanksgiving.. and what I did remember was like I was looking through most kinda foggy. Nothing big has happened since. Mostly now I'll just be doing something and lose a few seconds to a few hours a day. Idk maybe I just have a weird brain thing I need to go to doctor for but I'll worry about that when I have insurance next month.


So my question is are these voices that I'm hearing or is it just my axiety and depression. Because I never actually hear them it's mostly just in my head."
923,Sunshine Out and Inside (67),"Wake up. New Day. Starting For You. This Moment is New. Say Thank You for being Allowed to Wake Up. 

Everyday is different. Everyday can be filled with trying new things, focusing on tasks at hand, projects, passions, crafts and hobbies. Choose For You with our year wrapping up, we still have **LOTS** of time to realign and work HARD. 

Sore Throat. Waking up this morning I have a sore throat and thats ok. I will be doing what I can for myself to improve that. The only thing I can do is my best. Sending you love and light. 

Give yourself a moment right now to stop and think; What do you want to do before the year switches over? I hope you have been practicing more time for you with the past weeks and with the **HUGE** shift coming on the 21st. 3D to 5D. Do research if you are unsure what that means. Its our time for us to all come together, to be one with each other with love, care and support; rather than ego, lust and being selfish. I hope you can move forward with an open heart.

Start every morning differently. Change habits, release getting too stuck in the same order of the same thing. Life is about radical goal setting, its about radical actions, its about radical learning. Growth is not linear, Growth is not a straight line; release being caught up in that thought.

Yesterday, was the first time I had alcohol in 3 weeks for the celebration of life. In the moment I thought to myself ""hmmm am I going to be firm about my sobriety that I am going to miss a celebration that is only once a year?"", I decided to celebrate. I am proud of that decision. We must not get too caught up in our own selfish needs, **ONLY ONCE IN A BLUE MOON**; be **FIRM,** about them but realize that is ok, 364 more days to focus on ourselves. 

Today: Get outside. Get Fresh Air into those beautiful lungs of yours. Let the sun shine into your Soul, Spirit, Being and Body.

I love you.

924,Mourning my mother who is alive...,"Does anybody ever find themselves thinking about their childhood and just crying? I think it’s happening to me a lot right now because of the holidays. I miss my mother terribly - she lives in a different state and I haven’t really seen her in quite some time. We do talk most days through text or call. She was a wonderful mother when I was little, she was perfect to me and my best friend. And then many years back she was laid off from her job and everything went downhill. For the longest time she was living off unemployment and I was still there, but we lived in income-based housing and when they found out that I was working they added me to the rent and I could not afford it on my own. So I finally had to move out for the first time and to this day she still says that that was the worst day of her life, because she couldn’t really take care of me anymore... And it was the worst day of mine because if I had known leaving her would have lead to all of this I might not have. That was only six years ago, but gosh it feels like a lifetime. Over these last six years she has fallen deeper and deeper into alcoholism and carelessness. As of right now she is living with an uncle of mine, her brother, and his wife. They’re not local at all and I miss her terribly and I just keep thinking about the mom that I had growing up. I want to hug her and talk with her about my life. I have therapy tomorrow and I can’t wait to talk to my therapist because I’m just inundated with emotion right now. My fiancé and I were supposed to get married in October and we had to postpone it until next year. I’m afraid of the mother that’s going to be there. And I’ve always wanted my mom around for everything. I just feel like my heart is partially broken. I feel like I mourn her and she’s not even gone."

926,"I'm so confused, how do I heal when It effects me deeply","
I was raised by my grandmother (authoritarian), for half my childhood. I've been emotionally neglected and was a child with behavioral problems often getting suspended ever since 1st grade. When I think back all I can remember is a feeling of lonliness, like it was me against the world. My mom came back to live with us, things got better, my behavior changed, I became a kinder person. Middle school was alright, I had a fun friend group, I still got into trouble at school sometimes but It completely stopped when I got into highschool.  I went into highschool with high hopes for me, but everything got worse. I havent made a friend, I'm scared to make friends with teenagers, they all seem to dislike me. Being in a parenting and health class this past 6 months has had me questioning my life and my mental health. I've been reading up on depression, anxiety, negative self-talk, self inflicted injury, lonliness, childhood emotional neglect, and It's like reading what I deal with daily, so I ask myself how do I heal from these? I cry everyday over minor inconveniences, I think that sets off my emotions throughout the day so I start crying. I feel sad that I can't connect with my sisters, I feel sad for my mom because she knows its her fault, she feels sad whenever I sometimes tell her about my childhood. My family pictures me as a miserable, mean, sleepy person but I dont want to burden them with another granddaughter/daughter with mental health issues(My sister also struggles with mental health).My mom is the person I love the most and all I want is happiness for her, she doesn't need to be involved in my self healing. I cant fully express my feelings with anyone, I went for a therapy session at my hs earlier this month but I dont want to go again because I dont trust them. But I guess that stems from me never liking teachers, and me resisting counseling in elementary. I shouldnt be scared of them I know..
The first time i scratched my hands until they bled was at age 11, kept that up whenever situations happened for about 2 years. I started punching myself in the face last year, I've only done it about 4 times. Last time today.. over a minor inconvenience(only because i've been feeling worse these past months) Though see im confused, ive screamed/silently thought I wanted to kill myself a few times since I was 8 and have frequent suicidal thoughts when I cry about my life. But I actually just want to live so bad, I want to have fun again. I want to understand myself. I want friends. I wish I had a different personality.. I wish I was stronger.. I wish I didnt quit so often.. how do I heal? Where do I start? Some of these are unfixible, like being an introvert, the childhood emotional trauma that sticks with you everyday. The only things holding me together is my mom, my baby cousin, and my phone(ironic because social media destroys). I have to start my healing journey soon but Im so tired. The future.. another stressor in my life, I can barely cope right now how can I think about what I want to do for the rest of my life? Though I hope to see myself in a good mental state...happy... right now it feels like it wont happen come on its 2020."

928,Does the existential dread ever go away?,"I've been afraid of death since the day I learned we all die. Faith would never console me, everlasting afterlife sounded terrifying. Just stopping existing is also terrifying to me too, though. Sometimes I wish I was just never born, but that idea is also terrifying.

Every moment of my life I feel like time is slipping away from me. I have a whole life ahead of me, I'm not even out of my teens, but I'm still terrified. I mean I guess what I should do is try to enjoy the moment, but my current moment isn't great...

Maybe things will get better in the future, but it's hard to see a timr when I'm not completely apathetic, and where I'm not constantly terrified of time, and where I'm actually happy..."
929,I don’t know how to express things.,"(28F) For the last 10-ish years, my mental health has been all over the place. As of now, I’m officially diagnosed with anxiety and depression. In the past, a therapist I saw for maybe 4 years told me she suspected I had ADHD. She had to leave shortly after because she was having a baby and we never got to look into it further. The next therapist I saw, said I might have OCD. That also never went anywhere because, of course, she had to leave. The previous psychiatrist I met with told me I had BPD. When I met my current psychiatrist, she seemed doubtful (even though she didn’t know me yet).

In the last couple years, I haven’t felt as though my diagnosis fit me. I just have this feeling that there’s something else going on but I have no idea what’s “normal” and what’s “not” in order to explain it to any professional. I never know that something I do or say is considered strange until someone makes a comment about it or gives me a strange look, or they are confused by my response. My luck with mental health professionals hasn’t been great ever since I stopped seeing my first therapist and I feel as though I can never be honest about things since I’ve been shut down whenever I say I “might” have something. I’m never trying to self-diagnose, but I’m allowed to research and suspect the things I could be dealing with if it seems familiar. 

I’m not sure if this all makes sense, but I’ve been thinking a lot about this recently and I have no one to try to explain this to."
930,I want to give up and end it all.,"Hi everyone. Thank you for reading; it's a bit long, so sorry about that. Anyway, let's get on with it already.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a minor (somewhere between ten and 15). As you would expect, the hormones go wild. But when I considered suicide for brief moments, had multiple mental breakdowns, and crying over stuff that wasn't even my fault. I'm the main friend everyone likes (and I know that); it's honestly horrible thinking they might think I'm looking for attention when I talk about my mental health. My parents always say little things like ""You have a lot of requirements"" and such. I'm sure they mean no harm but it feels like getting shot multiple times and being forced to stand. It's hard to explain I just- can't deal with it much longer. It comes in waves- mainly at night but today I was having trouble breathing trying not to cry (I was in the bathroom, but the walls are thin.) because they did something I repeatedly said not to do... it was just not to snoop around in what I was watching with my friends tonight (it was a musical). Honestly every night I just want that day where I don't have to suffer any longer.

It's a little hard to see right now, I'm crying really hard, so sorry for any errors.

Thank you for reading and I wish you a good day/night."

*This is Mental, May I Have Some Health Please?*

*By: Rebecca Wood © 2019*

&amp;#x200B;

I was fine a few days ago,

I will be okay again soon.

I know you don’t think so but,

But what if I told you I actually knew?

Knew your quackery is the best-kept secret around

And silence is my favorite sound

&amp;#x200B;

Smugly you sit with your pills on your pedestal proud,

Proud of your name, that paper, and the shroud.

Shrouding the subsidies and the kickbacks,

The corporation and the siege

&amp;#x200B;

I know you’re Mental,

May I have some Health please?

&amp;#x200B;

What if,

If I am afraid, increase my dose of faith in humanity

If I am depressed, re-inflate me with love,

Simple sounds more like sanity

If I feel alone, show me with your heart I am not

If I am lost in a place you don’t understand

No worries, I don’t need a shot

&amp;#x200B;

What if

If you just be, be compassionate with me,

Until I can explain when I get back

all of the baggage I had to unpack, 

And if you can’t hear or see them too,

Understand that there is much unknown but still true

&amp;#x200B;

What if

much of the unknown

is fictitious  knowing 

I know Nothing, do you?

&amp;#x200B;

We evolved out of an environment of suffering,

We dove deep into the emotions no one else was willing to touch

We are your buffering,

Superficial bandages forced across lifetimes of gaping wounds

&amp;#x200B;

This is mental,

Let’s talk about health,

&amp;#x200B;

Health is optimum physiology

Pretty dependent on balancing out natural bio-Chemicals

Aka our body’s biology

Our natural state is healing,

But something is wrong and we are reeling

&amp;#x200B;

With the flight of our fight, We conquer,

We will teach you as an encore,

&amp;#x200B;

Transmute, integrate, transcend,

We broke until we could bend

For from our flight, we found the light

But out of the darkness we ascend,

No room to pretend,

&amp;#x200B;

Being and Bending

Seeing and blending

If you want to truly heal

Remember the beauty,

The beauty that is to feel

&amp;#x200B;

Embrace the human race

Soak in your truth,

Let it drip from your face

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a mental malady

Just a social fallacy

The warning bells of a culture in decay,

The stress of all work and a façade to play

&amp;#x200B;

Fake and even more false

The way to stay mental is not accidental

Of course,

The solution is rather transcendental

&amp;#x200B;

If you could fly and land

Fall, but get up, stand

There is a level of love beyond measure,

Now yours to command

A fearsome and foreboding pressure

&amp;#x200B;

The house of cards would surely fall and

Bullshit would be the unanimous call

Masses no longer soothed by backwards names

Health would be literal,

Not crisis aversion our only gains,

&amp;#x200B;

Mental health means to mentally thrive

To the fullest extent of being alive

&amp;#x200B;

Through this BackWards quest,

I check you, mate

The answers are the test.

This is taking a lot to even talk about and I'm getting scared! I just turned 40 and don't have a real family (kids,wife) and a very small family to begin with and never had much money and have gained a good 60 pounds with stress from family dying and being sad.

we had a family member die in March and another one is soon because of her age (very old), I've noticed I now a severe anxiety around kids from being in stores or just them crossing the street with the crossing guard or even passing in a car.

I don't have a clue what happened and why? also I know speaking with a therapist they will put me on a list the minute you mention a child. Nothing ever happened to me as a child and again never understood taking that from someone and them having the fear for the rest of their life.

I would always be the one with a sign on the lawn saying we want the child perverts out of the neighborhood and now I'm scared as shit I have become one of these people.

I've never had this fear my whole life and something has happened since turning 40 and I'm scared what the next stage is? 

100% happy to take anti-depressions or anxiety pills or even weed chocolate just looking for a fix to get back to normal life .

I was hoping someone maybe went through this darkness and what was the cure or cause, hormone issue, weight,depression.

Thank you"
934,Why can't I cry anymore?,"I feel like no matter what I do I just can't cry anymore. I have done every single thing that I have seen works, like listening to sad music, pinching myself, thinking of sad thins etc., and I just can't. I feel like the only time I even come close is when I am in front of someone and I am trying not to, but when I am alone and I try to nothing ever happens. My parents hadn't told me crying is bad and you should always hold it in, which was said to be common reason why people can't cry. Thanks for any comments in advance."
935,Is it wrong to genuinely hate my brother?,"I, 15F, have two brothers, 12 and 11. I will refer to the 12 year old as Goofus and the 11 year old as Gallant. 

Goofus is bipolar. He may have been born that way, because even when he was like 2-3 years old, he'd get violently and explosively angry. He's been on meds since he was like 7-8. But when he was 10, he started finding ways to skip his medicine. For awhile he would fight our parents because he snuck onto the computer while we were asleep (and sometimes even when he's on his meds he can't sleep) and found these horrible communities on Tumblr who told him he didn't *need* his meds. It took months to deprogram him from that. He really *really* likes the ""highs"" and insists that he has no lows. \\

This is total bunk - during his lows, he doesn't get super depressive. He has a hair-trigger temper which manifests in two different ways:

\-Eric Cartman (Where he just quietly goes and destroys everything.) 

\-Incredible Hulk (When he tries to destroy everything without regard.)

I know he can't control HOW angry he gets, but no matter what (if he's on meds or what) he just has no remorse for anything he says or does during any of his hulk-outs or Cartman moments. Even if it was years ago, like when he started cutting up my clothes (including a muumuu my great-grandmother made!) because I wouldn't let him on the computer, he will hold no remorse and attempt to justify his actions with ""If you were as angry as I was, you'd understand.""

He says this for everything. As if we non-bipolar people would ever think it's a good idea to rip my Aggretsuko plush's head off because I ate the last shortbread cookie he wanted. Or fry my chromebook in the shower because I yelled at him to turn Captain Underpants down. Or smash the PS4 because you lost a game of Fortnite. Or smash the PC against the wall because of your school's really shitty homework software. 

Even though mom and dad are now *CAREFULLY* supervising his medicine schedule thanks to him going off his meds for months, then tampering with them so he could take them in front of mom and dad while being off them... I think the damage has been done. They just don't seem to have the same effect. I don't know if it's because puberty hit him like a truck or because of the time he was off them, but they just don't seem to do much. He still thinks everything he did is completely justified, and my parents have to constantly press him just to get even a half-assed 'sorry'. 

My parents won't let me simply move my stuff over to my aunt's house. Even though it is next door. Goofus is not allowed inside until he can get his meltdowns fully under control - because my aunt does not want him smashing any of her stuff. (We have to keep anything 'nice' there because of the chance of Goofus's meltdown.) Yet we already had to have zoom meetings over there because Goofus would try to interrupt things on Zoom. 

It's not that he has my parents wrapped around his fingers - it's that he's really worn them down with his explosions and they are constantly overwhelmed. I think I've had a feeling that I just... genuinely hate Goofus. I love my youngest brother, despite how much of an annoyance he can be, but Goofus? He's consciously choosing not to take his pills. He knows what happens when he doesn't take his meds. He knows that if he skips his medication that he will have so much trouble sleeping. He knows that he will get angry at the drop of a hat if he skips his meds. Yet he does not care. He'll insist that his ""highs"" are worth it. 

Is it right that I genuinely hate him? I know hate is a strong word, and I would never pull the trigger to end his life, but I want him to be locked up in a mental hospital where the people who can wrangle him are at least getting paid for it. When I tried to wrangle him last? He threw me off, then tried to break the lock on my door to trash my room."
936,To Everyone,"I'm sorry that I can't help any of you currently..
I really hope everyone is doing well, and to those who aren't, just keep going. You've got this.


I'm sorry, take care"
937,Everything feels like an obligation and I don’t have the motivation for anything anymore.,"Even things I used to enjoy feel like work and I’d rather just lay in bed and sleep to escape it. Even talking to or texting the people I care about feels like something I have to do instead of something I want to do and it’s stressing me out. I keep thinking about everything I’m going to have to do to get into and through med school and I just don’t think I’ll be able to handle it, especially when I feel like I would be so much happier if I could just die and not have to do any of it. As suicidal and depressed as I am I don’t see how I’ll ever be able to accomplish the things I want to accomplish or live the life I want and I don’t know how to make it stop. And of course every time I have therapy I somehow don’t feel as depressed those days and i forget how bad it is when I am so I can’t explain how I feel. I don’t even have the motivation to do basic tasks anymore. All I can think about is how nice it would be for everything to be over. I’m just so tired of still having to go through the motions when I don’t even want to be alive."
938,Idk what's wrong with me ;-;,"Idk what's wrong with me, but I feel like there is something wrong with me, I feel like there has always been something wrong with me.

I just want answers, I want someone to tell me exactly what I'm feeling and why, I don't even care if they tell me how to stop feeling like this, I just want answers. 

I've tried looking for answers. But none of them fit me, some have come close to describing how I feel, but it's never really there. I feel like maybe I'm just lying, everything is in my head and I just want to be Quirky 😜 and Trendy 🥶

My problems are minimal and I'm overreacting. But they can be so overwhelming sometimes, I hate how they take over my thoughts, and how they disconnect me from the world.

I hate how I vent on reddit but whenever someone irl ask me how I'm doing, or ask me very specifically about area is my life they have seen me struggle with, I lie to them. But I don't trust them, and hate relying on other people, so I can't talk to them.

But even so, I kinda want professional help, but I don't deserved it, I don't think I've earned the right to feel better. Besides, I can't tell my mom that I was lying to her, I have to much pride to admit that I want help, that there is something I cannot handle by myself."
939,Masochism,"So um..I'm forcing myself to write this.


I'd be doing alot of things that I don't want to, and that someone my age definitely shouldn't be doing.

I'd been forcing myself into it for so long now, and it's so much too.

It's really hard sometimes.
I hate venting like this. It makes me feel guilty.

Um,I just wondered

Should I be hurting myself like this?
Is it really the best way?"
940,what should i do (trigger warning rape),My friend which I treated as my brother raped me when I was 17 now i just gave birth to my 1 month old daughter. The night when the raped happened we were drinking her sister convinced me to stay over and sleep beside her ( she told me that she wanted me to be safe because its already midnight and she's worried i might get in trouble ) When i woke up i was naked beside his brother / my friend. When i was pregnant i told the guy about what happened and he keeps on insisting that i was imagining things.... I planned on reporting him to the police but i was afraid because i keep on overthinking that no ones gonna believe me so i kept my mouth shut. Every night i overthink and sometimes to the point that i have suicdal thoughts its really hard. I never told my parents about this or any of the family because i had a past trauma of telling my family before because i was afraid no one might believe me.
941,Is it okay to constantly think about harming yourself?,"I can not remember a time in my life that I didn't want to harm myself in some way or another. I used to act on those urges and I would either put myself in ""danger"" or cut myself.

Now a days I still have those urges but I don't act on them. I thought that was normal and ok as long as I wasn't acting on them I was okay.

But was I wrong? I know it's obviously not *amazing*  but is it ok?"
942,I have a lot of friends (personal and online friends) that have been struggling recently. None of them know each other and when they’re feeling down the talk to me about their feelings. Is this a good thing that people go to talk to me?,[deleted]
943,Today is my 17th Birthday (AKA the worst day of the year),"I’ve always disliked my birthday. I always feel lonely and under appreciated. Everyday on this year I question my purpose for being born. I have a twin brother and what hurts is that everyone including my own friends has wished him a happy birthday but completely forgot about me. This year had been the absolute worst for me mentally and physically so I was hoping my birthday would atleast make me happy this year but I just feel the same emptiness I always feel. Sorry, I just really needed to rant."
944,I have too much down time in the psychiatric clinic,"I was admitted 3 days ago and my doctor has made me exempt from all mandatory group therapy sessions because I’ve done them all during a DBT course I completed a few years ago and he believes it could be a bit too triggering for me right now. I’m being treated for attempted suicide and trauma therapy. I’m so depressed that I have no motivation to read the new book I bought, watch a movie or tv show, message any of my friends, meditate, sit in the sun, have a shower, even sit on my phone and look at Facebook/Instagram and Reddit. I lay in bed all day trying to sleep or staring at the ceiling waiting for 8pm to arrive so that I can take my medications and sleeping tablet and try to sleep for the night. Only a few of my friends know I’m in here, and my boyfriend who comes each day for about an hour and has to leave.

I have another week here minimum. What are some ways people have overcome the overwhelming urge to do absolutely fucking nothing?"
945,I've just been told that I've blocked out memories and it's actually got me scared,"I have this memory issue that I just forget things. Huge things. Names, events, places, etc. In short, I'm forgetful as hell.

Lately, I've been remembering these events with another person that I can't remember a name or face for. This isn't uncommon for me, but this one is strange because I started to feel extremely uncomfortable feelings of stress and uncertainty.

I confided in a close friend of mine about it, and he told me that something had happened with me and my significant other that has me so messed up that I've, according to him and a few other friends, ""completely blocked out memories"" of my previous relationship. My friend tells me that I've experienced great stress and apparently some forms of trauma during the relationship. 

I haven't been told what happened. When we discussed this, I started to feel these feelings of stress again and I asked him to stop talking about it before we got into any major details. We haven't mentioned it since.

And so now, I'm finding certain things such as songs, hobbies, and even certain inside jokes with my friends cause me great stress. It's unusual to me, and even scares me a bit that I had these issues at all. I don't really remember this significant other, our supposed relationship, or much of anything at all. Just that I'd go to work and come home. 

I won't lie, I don't want to deal with it either. I don't wanna think about it or find a way to accept it or anything like that. I rather move on and just live as if this never happened. My friends say we'll never see this person again most likely and that pretty much everything we ever had together is somehow buried away.

A side note, I've also noticed my friends hiding a certain person or name from me for the longest time. It's only just after this discussion with my buddy about the issue that I've started to connect any dots. So much has been hidden from me and a lot of them are scared to mention anything about it to me. Which kind of scares me even more."
946,Being misunderstood is the worst feeling,"Today at dinner, my mom was on the phone with my Tia and Grandma and they were all talking on FaceTime. My younger brother was on his phone, basically narrating his Roblox experience to me but in a loud voice (because he's loud). There was a *lot* of noise! So eventually, I grew irritated, I couldn't focus, and I was stressed. I started fidgeting around with my plate and my fidget toy, but I was still irritated and stressed. 

My older brother and I do this thing where we pretend to punch each other (like swinging a punch in slow motion that doesn't actually end up hitting anyone) which is what he did while we were at the table. 

In my irritation, I smacked his arm away harshly and smacked him in the face. I wasn't trying to! I didn't want to hurt him or anything. It's just because I was in a stressed state of mind and I saw something in my ""personal bubble"" and I don't like any sort of physical contact like hugs and what not. Anyways, I felt really bad for it. And after he tapped me back on the face he asked ""Why are you so rude?!"" And I asked him back the same thing in my sarcastic voice. 

Anyways, like I said I was really stressed because of all the noise and I felt bad for hitting my brother and I just needed to be alone. So I went to the restroom and sat in the dark for a few minutes, trying to focus on the nothingness that was in there. I could, however, still hear all the noise, so nothing really got better. Eventually my younger brother started calling my name, noticing my absence, and I realized I couldn't just sit in the restroom forever. 

So I got up, walked out of the restroom, passed the dining table (Where I still had unfinished food on my plate) and rushed to my balcony, locking the door to my room and sitting outside in the fresh air and darkness. I sat listening to music and fidgeting and whatnot. My brother unlocked my door and wanted to see if I was okay and what I was doing. All I did was say ""No thanks"" as he opened the door. I shut it and held the door knob so that her couldn't open it, After a minute or two, he left me alone and went downstairs. 

A few hours later, after I had gone to the store with my mom, she (my mom) asked why I went to the balcony. (Because it's uncharacteristic of me to do any of the above) So I told her that there was too much noise and that I didn't like it, and also told her that I'm uncomfortable being around too many people and whatnot. I told her how I hit my brother because I was stressed and irritated as well, and that I didn't like going to family get togethers (which is what we're doing for an entire week starting tomorrow) because there's so much noise and so many people in such a crowded place. 

Anyways, when I finished my explanation, she kind of just brushed it off as my personality, because ""that's how she is too."" Then she talked about how that's why she raised us to be quiet, because she doesn't like too much noise. However, that's not what I meant, but honestly I did make my explanation pretty bad. It didn't sound like anything was wrong, just that I was being fussy. However, that's the closest I got to telling her how I feel mentally and just in general and whatnot...

I've never talked about my mental health with her or any other people, and I've always been the most academically, musically, and athletically gifted out of her three children. During this Pandemic and the stress of the holidays, I could see why maybe that was the better option. Just to see me as being a bit fussy at the end of a bad year.

But still, here I sit, feeling the after-effects of guilt for something I didn't mean to do, preparing for the upcoming 1-week family gathering, a 13 hour drive, and feeling utterly misunderstood and upset at my pathetic attempt at opening up to other people.

Anyways, sorry for my rant! I hope your day has been wonderful and that you'll have an enjoyable holiday! Thank you!"
947,not pog,"it really kinda sucks. I have a therapist, but if I tell her what I want to, she is legally required to tell my mother. fucking sucks."
948,"My partner may have autism. I love them, but we both need to learn how to love each other the right way.","I want to be very clear about this. I love this person unconditionally , and my post is only to seek out information to make the relationship better and healthier for both of us. I also understand that autism is one of the conditions that varies the most from person to person, so I don't expect a ""one-size fits all.""

A little background if necessary: we have been dating for several years, we are in our late 20s and do not live together but plan to move in together soon, I see myself marrying my partner.

I was talking to my therapist last week. Some of the things we've been working on are overcoming my childhood traumas, and being able to open up and ask for what I need emotionally in my relationships particularly my romantic relationship. I was explaining to him an incident that happens with some frequency where my partner did not validate my emotions or provide me the things I'm looking for emotionally. It's frustrating because now that I have the ability to ask for what I need, sometimes they are unable to provide, which makes me feel worse. 

After listening to me for a few sessions about this, he asked a few questions about my partner and suggested that they are likely on the spectrum, and probably aren't able to respond because they aren't understanding my social cues or how important it is to me. I was surprised, and still am, but things started to make sense. My partner likely has a misdiagnosis of ADHD which I've always suspected, a few obsessions, occasionally says rude things without realizing it because of misinterpreted social cues, emotional meltdowns etc.

After an hour or so my focus shifted. All I wanted to do was wrap my arms around them, and show them love. I've already done some research to better understand the condition, but if anyone has useful resources for autism in adults and romantic relationships I'd greatly appreciate it. My goals are to better understand their limits and learn the best ways as their partner to help them and love them. This is important because my partner is unaware of my thoughts on their condition, and in general people who are autistic tend to find it difficult to understand their own emotions and interpret what they want and need

My partner does not know that I have this idea about them, and I dont want to share this with anyone in my life because I dont think its fair to tell people this without my partner knowing they may have autism  and also potentially tarnishing my partners reputation. Other than my therapist politely telling me ""this is going to be tough..."" I don't have anyone to talk to about my concerns which are these:

I wish my partner showed me the attention I deserve, and emotionally validated me the way I want them to. Over the last several months I've seen our relationship grow healthier. There has absolutely been progress, but I'm worried that without my partner understanding how important this is to me progress can only go so far. How do I teach my partner who might be limited by autism to love me the way I want and need to be loved? Does anyone have experience with this that they can share?"
949,Why doesn’t I feel any pain for the loss of a loved one?,I don’t feel any kind of pain or I don’t even cry when someone close to me pass away. I love them but my emotions doesn’t come out. My mind always thinks that it’s just life
950,I’m sad today,"I’ve been sad for a long time now and wanted to talk to someone. It started when in February my gf of 3 years broke up with me. She got with someone right after and I got really depressed and stopped hanging out with my friends. I started to again after a while and that’s when my friend told me that he though I might be gay. It hit me hard because I was still struggling to get over my gf and I found it weird that I gave off that vibe. I figured it was a one time occurrence after a while until one of my other friends said the same thing. And then another. And another. I started slacking in school and now I’m failing and my parents don’t know about it. I’m going to join the army now that I’ve failed school and am worried that my sadness will get worse. I got with another girl for around 3 months and she broke up with me today. My ex still told me she loved me and hoped we got back together when she was dating someone else a couple months after we broke up. I got depressed and texted my ex today and she blocked me.The same day my cousin, who I’ve been best friends with for as long as I can remember, just told me that he thought I was gay. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts a lot and contemplating the meaning of life. At one point in my life I was completely happy and I know the feeling of being confident in yourself and enjoying life. In the span of a year I have gone from that to feeling like I don’t want to live anymore. I’m not going to kill myself and I never would but I know what it’s like now to not want to be alive. After all that happened today I called my mom crying and couldn’t find the courage to tell her what the reason was that I was sad because she was next to my dad and I can’t have my dad knowing that people think I’m gay (I come from a big conservative house and I am too and maybe that’s part of the reason why I find people calling me gay so repulsive). I told her I’d be okay but I needed to talk to someone. It’s crazy how much your life can change in a year. I’ve always hated talking about my feelings but I thought maybe this might help. Today hit me hard and it was the worst I’ve felt in my life. Life’s just a mental game and eventually I’ll get through this sucky stage I wanted to let this out though."
951,Panic Attacks are taking over my life,"If you've ever had a panic attack even just once you know how mentally jarring that can be. Around 2 weeks ago I started having VERY frequent panic attacks and im talking like, one every 2 hours or so, sometimes less sometimes more. It happens at work, at home, on the street, anywhere and everywhere. I can't live this way. my mind is so bent out of shape from them and I dont know what to do. I don't have many wellness tools to use, the counting and breathing thing doesn't work for me. I feel like I'm losing my mind and my grasp on reality, I've made a doctors appointment but that won't be until after the new year and I can't just put up with them anymore until then."
952,OCD Symptoms?,"Hi, i am a 14 yo girl and after doing some research and listening to experiences of some ppl w OCD, i have noticed that a lot of my experiences seem to match up. before i say anything tho, i know that its not cool to self-diagnose and ofc im not asking for a diagnosis either, it would just be helpful to hear from a diff perspective- whether they themselves have OCD or have seen these circumstances line up in a separate scenario- id be beyond grateful for general advice or shared experiences. many thanks!

now onto my main weirdest habits: i have a tendency to hoard a bunch of things that carry no practical value whatsoever. if they're taken away from me/i lose them, i get extremely upset. this is a habit ive carried from my childhood until now and never rlly had a valid explanation for it until now. 

i also was obsessed w religion a few years back. i don't experience this anymore, as i am atheist now- but i grew up in a christian family and basically forced myself into thinking i was christian, even though i didnt actually believe in the religion. i would find stories online proving that god existed, memorize them and whisper them to myself in a certain order repeatedly whenever i felt ""doubt"" coming into my head if that makes sense. this habit haunted me for 2 years, and id cry whenever repeating the sequence didnt ""work"". i also randomly came up with religious symbols in my head when i was younger (don't really know how?) and would put them in the top right corner of every single test because i convinced myself that if i didnt, god would punish me by giving me bad grades. i still do this today.

this ones a bit more commonly heard of, i think- i check things super obsessively. as in, i set my alarm exactly 5 times before i go to sleep, even though i literally REMEMBER myself already setting it beforehand, i feel obligated to set it again for no reason whatsoever. i check things obsessively to the extent where i literally installed my own extra locks on my bedroom door bc i was paranoid our house would be attacked by burglars in the middle of the night or something. im a super fast reader, but when im taking a standardized test, i need to reread a passage about six times every single time because i convince myself i dont understand it even when i know i do. im pretty good at math, but whenever i take a test, no matter how quickly i finish it, i HAVE to spend the rest of the period checking my answers over and over again, to the point where ill ask for extended time even though im already finished.

last major thing, it might sound kind of odd. i force myself to always have an empty bladder right before i go to sleep. ive done this since i was a kid and have cried over doing it multiple times, where i basically force myself to go to the bathroom every night before i go to bed even if i feel just the slightest sensation, id spend upwards of thirty minutes in the bathroom doing absolutely nothing trying to force myself to go.

well, that's it for me. btw, i was diagnosed by a psychologist with anxiety when i was around 10. OCD was never brought up as a potential cause.

thank you so much for reading! i greatly appreciate it and would be beyond grateful for any advice."
953,Showers,"Any advice on how to get in the habit of taking showers daily again? During what was probably longer than 6 months last year, I was severely depressed. I went months without bathing at a time. Also as a child and teen, I sometimes went 3 days max not bathing because I saw it as rebellious and 'easier'. This year, I've been so much better. Usually not skipping more than 3 days. I've found it hard to get back in the habit of bathing and doing hygiene daily tho. I've read that making it seem luxurious and relaxing helps however I only have access to a shower not bathtub. I've tried things like shower fizzers and they're stupid and a waste. I also have herd mentality and feel the need to take my shower before or after my bf. However as you can probably see, this is bad for one because he sometimes skips a day or two on his days off or when he's really exhausted. He doesn't want to shower with me bc our shower is too small. Please help, thank you."

Somehow I managed to mess up my sleep schedule so bad I fixed it and for like the next week I had super happy and had good sleep. Of course it broke after a while but I really liked it. I want to do that again but the problem is I feel sleepy around 1AM and I wake up at like 2pm. I get a lot of sleep but it’s just not good sleep. I need to figure out how to be able to fall asleep in 10pm and wake up at 5-6. Can somebody tell me how to do that without like dedicating a lot for it??? Thanks

958,Do all moms say they want to die in front of her family/children?,"I think my mom has been having a hard time with us (I also have been quite uh, well, I'm mentally unstable as well so that's like one of the things she's usually annoyed by.) The house right now doesn't have a Christmas feeling due to all of us being busy because of work from home. It's been hard managing time because of it.

Anyway, my mom always complains about us (her children) and that we're ungrateful because we're not doing enough housework, or we're not waking up early. We have moments when everything is a mess and not. It's not that the house is messy, it's just not ""enough"".

With all her frustrations and anger, once again, she said that she should just die. I honestly think she's depressed. Well that, and the fact that my family haven't really made peace with my being mentally ill.

TL;DR, my mom always says she'd rather die, and she says this out loud to us. To add, our family doesn't communicate well. Is that an Asian culture (as I was told) or is that just how it is? Other than communication, what do you think we can do? Thank you."

I never thought in a million years that I’d be posting about my struggles on Reddit, but, here I am. 

Let me preface these next parts by saying that I really don’t want to make this about me. I promise this isn’t a fish for sympathy or anything. Also, I’m sorry if this is choppy and the formatting is terrible. It’s really late where I am. 

In the past year three of my friends have attempted. The most recent hit the hardest, as I’m especially close with her and I think we’ve connected over our shared trauma to the point of no return. 

I’m used to therapizing literally everybody I know. I don’t know why, but it just... happens. People unload their stuff on me and I help them the best I can. I’ve been told that this is unhealthy and, to be frank, I agree. But I don’t really know how to stop. Anyways. This isn’t what this is about. 

I sort of wanted to vocalize how deeply my friends’ attempts have affected me and ask for advice on how to cope or what this is called. 

Despite hardly struggling with suicidal thoughts myself, I’ve found that attempts to consume media relating to suicide (even if it’s a TV show with a scene or two portraying an attempt) I’m met with a fit of tears that lasts up to an hour, or worse, an anxiety attack. I’m not exactly sure when this started but I just don’t know what to do. I want to be there for my friends. I don’t know. 

I’m really sorry this is all over the place but I needed to reach out and I wasn’t sure where else to go."
964,Having A Hard Time,"I had my first major mental breakdown over the last 36 hours. I think I'm finally on the other side of it (thankfully) but I'm left feeling exhausted, empty, confused, and embarrassed. I cried for literally 36 hours straight. The tears just never stopped. I couldn't bring myself to eat even though I was starving, I couldn't bring myself to shower and I couldn't sleep. I was shaking constantly and couldn't finish a thought/sentence. Now that I'm on the other side of it I feel so embarrassed. I feel crazy... I know my family thinks I'm completely nuts and unstable and I feel like I just proved them right. Just needing to vent \ some support I guess. I've never had a mental break like that before."
965,How can I help?,"I'm a programmer who's been depressed and burnt out for quite a long time but can't get a pet or therapy so instead I want to help others with their mental health. I was thinking of making a virtual emotional support animal but I'm not sure about that since most people feel better by petting/hugging their pets. So, what other apps would be helpful to you? How can I help?"
966,This video put what I am going through very accurately.,https://youtu.be/Q9yKaI0vLJs
967,Deleted my Instagram account.,Sick of the fake happiness.
968,What is this of actual pain in in my chest? Is it normal to keep coming over a year later?,"A little background: I (30F) have been having these waves of sorrow that pass through my chest, they are deep physical pain but they end after a moment. They were much worse, almost constant, after I dealt with my ex fiancé (32 M) and my best friend having a secret relationship for a few months. (This is also my close friend and older brother’s (32M) wife (34F) I know it wasn’t necessarily healthy for me to take their happiness on myself and try to keep them in the friend group. I believed and still believe I am strong enough to do this. There was distance for me but there was also a lot of drama and a lot of hardship. I didn’t think my friend group would survive it. We were all so close, best friends for ten years, and now we’re a bit scattered. I had rebounds for the first time in my life to feel ok. And I did feel better after a while. Then she got back together with my brother. He believes she’s his soulmate. I’m doing everything to leave it behind and start new. I’m trying to allow all of our good memories to overshadow the betrayal. It’s not really a part of my everyday life anymore. I adventure outside, I do things that make me happy and have meaningful relationships. It’s been a year and three months and I still fall into these sorrow waves. I still say every day it’s going to be ok I’ve got this. When my mind wanders to slightly painful areas I say out loud don’t hurt me when no one is around. I am so much happier than most people I know or I think so at least? It’s starting to feel like this is the state I’ve settled into, and I won’t let myself start a relationship until I feel like I’m thriving. I guess I’m wondering how bad is this? I’m making it to work, I smile and laugh. I climb mountains and try new things. I sleep a little extra. I do so many things to make myself thrive, and it’s always worked before. I don’t have these tendencies in my life. This is new. I feel good most of the time then I’m just not good. Physical pain in my chest on a regular basis seems a little strange at this point. I looked it up and people are calling it broken heart syndrome or cardiomyopathy, cortisol dumps that may actually affect your heart health. I need perspective. Help. 


TLTR a year and three months after a romantic betrayal and infidelity I’m still having actual physical waves of sorrow in my chest and reactive out loud ‘don’t hurt me’ when my mind wanders into only slightly painful memories. I feel good most of the time but this doesn’t seem normal anymore? I need perspective."
969,Opening dms,"Um..if you ever need someone my dms are open
So uh.. you can just message me if you need someone

I think I need someone too but it should be fine"
970,Really burned out,"I'm really burned out right now. It's been a constant 12 hour minimum work days for me. I work in health care. I take care of people all day and no one's taking care of me. I'm the boss in a private practice and when the employees go home I still work. I haven't had a weekend off in weeks. It feels like more work per patient compared to the pre pandemic times. Cash flow isn't good enough for me to hire more help. In fact I've taken a pay cut and have been consistently running out of money for the past three months because patients kept canceling and rescheduling their appointments. Meanwhile we haven't been able to collect much from insurance companies as a lot of claims are being processed very slowly.

Mentally the downward spiral started about 3 weeks ago. I've been doing anything and everything I could to get back on track, but it's just not working. I can't possibly catch up to the workload fast enough. The work never ends. When I clear my schedule, I don't get more work done. I just sleep. Sleeping a lot doesn't make me feel awake. I'm starting to experience excessive stress and anxiety just thinking about work.

I'm taking some real time off for a couple weeks. I really hope this helps. I just can't go back to work after this break and still be this messed up. My employees want to work during this period and I just said no (their responsibilities are dependent on what I do at the office). It's scary to think if I even slip a little, I could put myself an everyone else out of business. How do I get myself back?"
971,Anyone else been struggling with lockdowns?,"I’ve managed to get my mental health on track this year and have been at the gym and staying away from drugs, however with constant yo yo’ing back and forth it feels like it’s getting hopeless, my progress that I get will be gone in 6 weeks and I just can’t deal with this cycle of bullshit I feel like I’d be better off in jail this is hell and the mental health services are over run so even if your in a crisis it’s 3 months minimum waiting times... I’m in northern Ireland"
972,Deleting tiktok and instagram made me about 2x happier this year.,"I've always been active on socials like instagram and tiktok (my instagram was autismondrugs with 10k+ followers) my account got disabled over a month ago.

I used to cry every week, now it feels like i cant cry anymore and cant stay mad for too long.

At this point im 100% sure these socials are toxic as fuck."
973,"Why is no one here? (TW Dark thoughts, Homophobia, Self Loathing/Criticism, Mentions of False Sexual Assualt)"," I have Maladaptive Daydreaming (intense daydreaming that distracts a person from their real life. Many times, real-life events trigger daydreams). I daydream about having real friends. It sounds so pathetic and it really is. There are 5 friends in the group excluding me. I used to have names for them but now I can’t remember. In my head, I know who I’m talking/conversing to though so it’s not a huge problem. We do things friends do or what I think they’re supposed to do. They’re always here, which is expected cause they’re in your head but no one in real life is here and it hurts. I don’t expect them (people in real life) to be here all the time but they don’t make an effort and when I do, I get shot down. I don’t know what to do. Every time I try, I fail. So I gave up and now it’s getting worse. I can’t do this anymore. I just can’t. I want to go to therapy but I don’t really think I deserve it. My 5 friends are amazing and they actually listen to me (and I listen to them). But then reality hits. 

On Friday, I checked my WhatsApp. No messages, as usual, then I checked my WhatsApp status. Two of my friends, N and Ne uploaded videos to their status. It as them out with the entire friend group and a new friend I only found out about when my other friend, K, (the closest one to me) uploaded a Google Forms link to their status about the friend group saying, “If you’re apart of the friend group, complete the form :).” I clicked on the form and saw questions about the group with everyone’s name there but mine and a new name, J, I was hurt but didn’t think much of it because I already knew they had a group chat and refused to put me in it by awkwardly walking away when I brought it up (happened in 2019) along with other hurtful things. The Form thing was a 0.5/10 to me. I messaged K and asked who was J. She told me that it was a new person from a different school. I brushed it off and later in the convo I found out that the friend group was going out on Friday and she asked if I could come. I told her something along the lines of, I can’t because of the virus and I don’t really feel comfortable. She was sad and said she really wanted to see me but she understood. I knew this meetup was happening and I really should have expected the status updates but what hurt the most was how close they were in the clips. Stupid, I know. When I was around them they would be close but there was always an awkward presence. In the clips they seemed so happy and then it clicked. 

I was the awkward presence. Every single time I tried in the friendship it made them uncomfortable. Every time I tried to reach out. Every time I planned stuff to do together. Part of me thought that maybe they were just forgetful as N had convinced me of but they did it purposely. I’m the problem. They were trying to communicate as little as possible. (I feel like this needs to be added but it might not be of importance) When I first entered the school along with everyone else at the same time, I was labelled the Gay girl after the 1st term. I’m not gay. I’m aroace (no interest in neither romantic nor sexual relationships). I go to a Catholic All Girls school. After my first year, I was labelled a rapist/sexual assaulter and was almost reported because my hands were rested behind my back and someone in my class came to close to me and my hand touched her vaginal place. Her friends gave me some nasty stares whenever I was around them for about 2 weeks. Later that same year I was publicly embarrassed for hugging my friend and squeezing her (squeeze hug). My classmates told me “don’t do that sh\*t here” and “this is a Christian school” along with a look of disgust. Needless to say before online school no one approached me ever and I separated myself from everyone. During this time, my friend group were questioned a lot about my sexual orientation. They told them all the same answer, I’m aroace. No one believed it. No teacher knew of this it was just between students (If the teachers knew that would have been way worse for me). I had people years ahead of me (in school) asking if I was a lesbian. I think that is why they started to detach themselves but some of the members in that group are bi and the others are lgbt allies so that doesn’t make much sense. I’m way sadder than I was before and I can’t seem to suck it up like a big girl. I’m trying to figure out what attribute I have that is not appealing to others. But I know that that’s bad and I want to stop but I can’t. It’s either that or daydreaming about my fictional friends and the bitter pain when I get back to reality.

I apologize about any grammatical errors, I’m not really focused on that at the moment and please do tell me if I need to add anything else to my trigger warning, I’m very new to it. I apologize if I caused anyone pain while reading my post. 

Any advice, thoughts or criticism?"
974,my psychiatrist wrote me new medication and said nothing about it,"Hello, I have been visiting a psychiatrist for almost two months now. On my first visit, she wrote me the antidepressants Asentra and Neurol. After the second visit, we agreed on another date, which was on Wednesday, when I just called the psychiatrist. The antidepressants did not seem to work for me and I increased the dose to 1.5 a day from Wednesday. I confided in a psychiatrist about certain problems and sent me a prescription for medication. Now, from Wednesday evening, I take Zyprexa medication every day. However, the psychiatrist didn't tell me anything on Wednesday and I should have called again today, but she doesn't answer my phone. At the same time, I also go to the psychotherapist, who I showed the new drugs on Wednesday. I thought these were sleep medications. Do you think that's okay and I should ask the psychiatrist?
Thank you very much for any answer."
975,Please need some advice.,"So, I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about over two years, last year May I got to find out she was suffering from depression, during her episodes she is very rude with me, shouts at me for no reason, and pushes me away, I know it's not her fault when she gets okay she always apologizes for her behaviour, now recently it's getting worse by the days she's fine one day and the next day she isn't. Also because of covid it's worse, we can't meet like before. From mid November she started to grow distant, last week out of nowhere she deactivated all her social media accounts and switched off her cellphone, I got worried so I called up her best friend to get in contact with her. Her best friend said she's okay there's no need to worry she just needs some space and she's with her parents now. I was a bit frustrated because at least she could have told me. Anyways yesterday night she called me and wants to breakup with me, says she doesn't have any feelings for me etc. Now this is not the first time she said something like this to me. She broke up with me more than 8 to 9 times in these 2 years and whenever she gets a bit better she calls me up apologizes, and all the time I forgive her and get back together. She's an amazing person and very kind. But during her episodes she's a completely different person. I know she will get back to me after few weeks or so. Dealing with her episodes has taken a toll on my own mental health. I'm not the same person I used to be, like I'm not happy, I don't know what to do? What should I do? And will she always be like this? She's on her medication but it doesn't seem to be working, I don't know. I'm confused does she even love me like before. I feel like crying. I wanted stability in my life. I think lost myself, I'm sad, angry and frustrated most of the time. I'm also very tired. (Sorry for my English, it's not my first language)"
976,How do I know if my diagnoses are real?,"Background: I've been on and off of weekly or biweekly therapy since I was about 15 (I'm 28 now).  In that time I've received TONS of diagnoses. ADHD, Learning Disabilities, OCD, Generalized Anxiety, PTSD, Panic Disorder, Depression, etc.

But here's the thing. I have no idea which, if any, of these diagnoses are real.

I kinda feel all of these diagnoses came because my mother pushed my school so hard for testing and I was able to fake my way through the testing.

More backstory:

Through elementary and middle school I was a star student. I was in all of the accelerated classes and was put in special groups with other ""talented &amp; gifted"" kids. On the weekends I played chess tournaments, read a lot, and just in general explored stuff because I really REALLY loved learning.

When I got to high school I made basically all straight A's with zero effort or studying (I wouldn't even know there was a test that day). Except around this time, there was two classes I started doing poorly (like failing poorly) in (French and Math, if it matters). I can't really explain the feeling but around this time I just felt like really, REALLY, frustrated with school and basically stopped giving a shit. Around this time my mother starting pushing my school to get me tested. She really pushed incredibly hard. She tells me it was because they were largely incompetent and otherwise would have let me go through the system ""mismatched"" for the goals the school was going to judge me by (these are my words, not hers, but this is the gist of what was communicated).

So the testing starts. IQ tests, emotional tests, everything. The IQ results showed &gt;99th percentile in basically everything english/language-related , like &lt;10th percentile in math-related stuff, and 90ths percentile in basically everything else. Because of this, they told me I had a learning disability. But, to be honest I kinda just feel like I really was frustrated with math that I gave up and then semi intentionally flunked the numbers-related questions. They also said I had a processing memory problem but I also just kinda feel like I was in a dark place and didn't feel like answering the questions quickly because I was in a way asking for help.

TLDR: I can't tell if I actually have mental health problems/disabilities or I was just able to fake it through the evaluation process."
977,"Foster parents held me in solitary confinement, is that the source?","Im 26 now, and recently i was diagnosed with chronic depression, ptsd, ocd, suicidal ideation and an unknown seizure disorder. I've started therapy and have been discussing things with her but i have not discussed this yet. I spent most of my developing years in foster care, Just before my 14th birthday my father passed away from cancer. There was no one i was closer to. Approximately 5 months later(early summer) my foster parents, as a punishment for stealing some dumb piece of tech, kept me in a bedroom 24 hours a day with minimal bathroom allowance (they got annoyed if i went too much) for roughly 45 days. My allowances were very minimal i ate when they brought me food, and slept when they turned the light off. Was allowed no contact at all with the others in the house. I just read the books they gave me over and over again. I think part of me died in there. That year was just awful. Now im a mentally ill man trying to put all the pieces together. Would really appreciate input. Thank you for your time"
978,no one gets it and all my friends laugh at me over these things. what the hell is even wrong with me?,"(i’m 14) 

first of all i have a shit ton of mental issues and i don’t know know what’s fully even wrong with me but i’ve been diagnosed with multiple things. the thing that was a big problem today was the way that my brain makes sure everything is a certain way. 

i have to always be wearing socks or else i will be cracking my toes 24/7. i have to have specific pillows in a specific order or else i will suffocate. i have to eat specific foods or else i will be nauseous and it will feel gross. i can’t share my interests with specific people or else i will panic.

tonight i was on the phone with 3 of my best friends and i went to lay down. i noticed that my pillows had been changed out by my mom earlier in the day. i instantly started freaking out. i freaked out because i felt as if i would  never be able to sleep again because of this. i started to sob and i didn’t leave the call yet and so they heard me. they asked what was wrong so through my sobs i explained it to them. they all burst out laughing hysterically. they said a lot of mean shit. this sent me into a fit of anger and i started screaming at them and left. i instantly felt guilty, but then i joined back and yelled at them again. i told them that they pretend to care about mental health but that they don’t really care. 

this stuff happens a lot. i have been called toxic by many people, i’m not sure if i am. i really want to be a good person. i’m too wrapped up into my own brain."
979,Chantix fucked my mind in 2011. Doctors and Insurance suck! Could use some help.,"I've  searched around every now and then and almost had some luck finding a  lawyer til he had a conflict of interest because he represents Dr. Quack. New to reddit and just thought about asking you fine folks. Okie Dokie....Here we go!

Growing up I  was really smart, in all the gifted programs and lived a pretty normal  life sans a little sexual abuse from a neighbor and a verbally abusive  father, got bullied a bit but have always been the guy that got along  with everyone. Partied a lot in highschool but got mostly A's, became a  closet smoker though. I went to college and graduated as the honor  student but had became a full time closet smoker around my parents.

Moved  and took a job for a TV station in 2005 where I was kicking ass as a  camera guy. I wanted to stay in state and close to family so there was  really only one place I wanted to move on to after my current station.  It took me six years but there was finally a job opening at my dream  station that lined up with the opening in my employment contract (a  shitty contract I've been told) in 2011. I went after and pretty much  landed the job, as soon as my contract was up at my current station, the  job was mine.

I smoke marijuana  so I had to clean out my system but had plenty of time. I started biking  and found it to be a great substitute and decided to add cigarettes to  the list. My dentist offered me Chantix one time but I wasn't ready. I  asked my doctor, got an Rx and without a thought, started taking it.

Then. Things. Got. Weird.

I  asked a girl out that week that I had found attractive for years, which  is a big deal for me because I'm super shy, self conscious and have a  negative view of myself. She said yes and we had a great first date. I  then had to go to Wisconsin for a football game and we interviewed a  psychic for a game prediction. She made a prediction about our futures  as well and that fucked with me and still does. She said I was going to  meet a girl and go far. At the game I totally lose my temper because of  the stress of the asshole fans. Things feel a little weird looking back,  but I never noticed it. Fast forward a week and I'm at a football game  and have a complete breakdown and panic attack. I accuse another  photographer of lots of crazy shit and end up getting taken to the  hospital by ambulance. I get out a few hours later and am given anxiety  pills but end up going to the fire station a little later that  evening/morning where a cop takes me to another hospital. I'm out of  there that morning and off to visit a friend at a hospital in Omaha. She  realized I was crazy and didn't let me out of her sight. The next day  we go back to the hospital and I contemplate jumping from the parking  garage. My parents show up, find out I'm a smoker and took Chantix, have  me evaluated and checked in to the crazy floor.

I  get out and a family friend that's a psych gal recommended my parents  take me to this place that could get me in right away. I can't even talk  at this point because so much bizarre shit is going through my head.  I'm out of work for three months dealing with this til I'm back at work.  That girl I liked thinks I'm a creep now and I made a bunch of bizarre  calls to my future employer and had totally lost that dream job. I keep  on a working though and things eventually get to a new normal.

I'm  constantly reliving the weird shit I thought though (im god, everyones  out to get me, the worlds coming to an end, Truman show shit) and feel  totally alone in my town. Depression and anxiety set in but the  psychiatrist I see is a pill pusher (I looked him up) that rapes your  insurance for all its worth with anything he can think of. I get to  where I cant even wake up to an Amazon Echo alarm on high volume (the  original echo with the loud ass speaker). My friend that lived across  the parking lot would hear it go off and come wake me up. I have no idea  what I'm doing when it comes to this anxiety and depression shit I'm  dealing with. At the doc, he has me see a student aid and then comes in  for 3 minutes and signs off on whatever they jot down. I can function  enough to work but struggle and am really burned out. I deal with all  sorts of psychological issues secretly because I don't know how to talk  to a different student aid every three months come med check time.

My  parents finally think I'm stable enough to process their divorce, so  they split and sell our family farm. It's an ugly divorce but my dad  ended up getting the cash from the sale of the farm and mom got the  investments. Dad gives my brother and I each $150k to buy a house. I  still curl up and cry every night because of the loneliness and chaos  that is racing in my mind. I would hang out with that friend that would  wake me up, and we'd smoke lots of weed and pop pills. She professed her  love to me on 4/20/16...but she had a boyfriend that lived with her. We  keep it a secret for a few months until I went on a 10 day road trip.  She couldn't take it and finally gets the courage to boot the dead beat.  I drive back 16 hours straight to her and we move right in together and  start to live a life we can't afford but can because of the $150k I  have. We build a nice life, take some fun trips and can buy ourselves  out of whatever mess we get into. We spent 6 years secretly in love so  we were moving quick and having fun. I ask her to marry me on 4/20/17, a  year after she professed her love.

Work  starts to get really stressful in 2017, around the same time of year I  originally had a chantix freakout. I'm engaged and planning a wedding  and the stress is too much to take. I talk to the counselor I'm finally  now seeing, who is at the same practice as Dr. Quack. I'm beyond burned  out at this point and I wrote my resignation letter to my employer. I  wanted to run it by him and he says ""dude, you're bipolar"". He puts me  on Short term disability so that I still have insurance and takes me off  work the rest of the year. Well my employer is pissed that I'm on short  term disability again for a crazy episode in the middle of football  season. Cigna denies my short term disability clam and the station  forces my resignation at the end of the year. The doctor and the  counselor want $200ish for a visit now and my meds are outrageously  expensive (one was $1400).

I'm now  crazy, out of a job and engaged. We've blown a ton of money because my  soon-to-be-wife is an unemployed pill addict now and I was supporting  the three of us and am smoking a ton of weed at this point. I cant  afford the doc, meds, and life so I said bye to the doc and meds,  supported the family and smoked a little herb to try and keep my sanity.  Didn't work and I went crazy but luckily my primary doc was able to  prescribe psych meds and got me on stuff that was affordable out of  pocket. Things start to get better but by now I have burned every bridge  with the wifes family. All the women in it hate me but we go through  with the wedding anyways...even though the mother-in-law wouldn't let me  walk her down the isle last minute.

The  marriage is difficult. I continue to be the one supporting the family  while the wife now is an alcoholic instead of a pill popper and still  doesn't carry her weight. I'm under-employed and can barely function at  doing that. I spend the last of my $150k and with us now being a family  we qualify for medicaid. I can now go to the doctor as needed and my doc  gets me on a pretty good cocktail that addresses the issues. The  wife...she refuses to seek help. Things go better for me, I land a good  job with weird hours but it still wasn't enough for a family by myself.  If I wasn't working, I was working on building a business for extra  money and the hopes of self-employment for our crazy asses someday. We  still maxed out my credit cards living and when everything completely  dried up, I was a real ball of fury.

We  were fighting daily by this time and one night in 2019, we had a really  big one. She pushed me and I pushed her...first time we'd ever laid a  hand on each other. I stormed out of the apartment and was across the  street unwinding when cops showed up and arrested me. The wife told her  mom I have a gun. What she should have said is ""I own a gun"". It was in  the closet, locked up and pretty much forgot about. I never shot it and  never intended to unless I needed to defend us. I hate guns...but it's  my right to have insurance. I'm in jail for the weekend but the wife  realized she fucked up and her dad had all of the charges pretty much  dropped by Monday. She moved out though and took the kid. That sucked  cus I was a good step-dad.  She was struggling with mental issues all  the time so I pretty much took care of the kid while we we're together.

I'm  now divorced and stuck with all the credit card debt. Things are  finally going good. I moved back to my hometown and that business I was  building is taking off along with another one. I'm successful and happy  and still together(ish) with the ex-wife. She's working on her shit, im  working on mine and we pay our own way. We enjoy each other now and live  an hour and a half apart, so it's special when we see each other. I  still love her and didn't know she was dealing with things to the extent  she was. She's taking baby steps at improving, I'm not interested in  finding a new relationship, and am pretty much her only support in  getting better (her family is really counter productive).

So that's the cliffnotes from 2011-2020.

The  even shorter version...crazy and didnt know it, took chantix, went on a  crazy trip, got hooked up with a bad doc, wasn't properly seen for  years, went down one hell of a trip in life, learned a lot about  pre-existing conditions and insurance, and am finally getting back to  happy.

Now that I can deal with  stuff, I'm curious as to if I would ever have any action I could take  against Chantix for blowing my brain up, Dr. Quack for being a shitty  doctor, or Cigna for being fuckers? I'm a giant, debt ridden,  pre-existing condition. I still deal with the crazy shit that happened  back in 2011 every now and then, am on 6 medications and only qualify  for shitty market place insurance. Diagnosed with Bipolar, Depression,  Anxiety and the counselor I'm starting to see in my hometown just added  OCD to the list.

Feels better to  get that all written out, never put my story to writing before. Time for  a bong rip and bed time. Hope maybe I wake up to some legal advice on  how to unfuck my life. Legal, Medical, Financial...any advice other than  quit smoking cigs, weed and ditch the girl are welcomed. I'm generous,  kind and forgiving...and my doctor is on board with my weed consumption  as part of my mental health treatment and it's use is under  control(ish)...I mostly smoke for relief, not the pursuit of getting  fucked up, though that's nice at times...and quitting cigarettes can  almost kill  you and really fuck up your life right away.

Good Night/Morning. Have a great weekend and thanks if you've read it to this point."
980,I keep getting Intense burst of memories accompanied by other symptoms(Mental Journal),"The symptom
Often I get intense burst of memories with past feelings. (Like guilt, embarrassment, fear, disgust, anger, doubt) They often feel as real or more intense than when the first happened. This can in some case make them feel almost painful. When these burst happen I will often just shut out most stimuli and during intense moments I’ll respond to the memories out loud. (Like saying sorry or stop multiple times) on occasions I pull on my hair. I’m not sure why I assume it’s to try to pull my self out of the memories. I don’t do these actions consciously obviously. They often feel involuntary.

My remedy
The only solution I’ve found is to imagine the memories as a still frame on a photo and burning them in a fire. 

Remedies assumed effect
I assume what this archives is distilling the feeling of that memory into an mental image without any emotional context and then creating a new mental connection of that experience being destroyed.(hopefully this can help someone who experiences the same thing)

This being said most of the experience I’ve had in my life have hardly been traumatic.

Example
At one point I had a recurring memory of me as a child calling my sister a demon for not taking me to get take out. That memory isn’t nearly as intense as others but was compounded by guilt from years of reflecting on my actions. Back then this would send me into a flashback with a metric amount of guilt. Strangely enough I tried addressing the guilt directly by confronting my sister but it continued until I learned of my burning picture remedy.

Side effects
I also worry due to the after math of those events because often time after a burst I disassociate either from the memories or from my self. This can manifest is many ways but one case would be me disassociating from my self in order to calm my self down. Alternatively I can disassociate to a self which insult me and confirms my past feelings. Within my own inner monologue I treat the situation as there are 2 of me. This includes calming my distressed other by reassuring the situation has passed and by other methods which I am unable to currently recall.(will update) As well it can develop to me insulting my self so much that I may end up saying out loud sorry or stop multiple times. 

I am very careful to always keep these interactions as just me talking to me. I do not name these “selves” beyond mean me or nice me. I don’t name them in order to keep controller over my mental health. By naming them I would only be disassociating more from these parts of my self. Without a doubt this sounds like DID where people disassociate in order to deal with trauma. I hope that I don’t fully fall into having DID. That being said the likelihood me having DID is unlikely as symptoms of DID can often overlap with other conditions. (Other “selves” pop up like smart or dumb me but these might just be me actually being a idiot and referring to my self when acting in particular ways) 

Other other selve?
I do sometimes disassociate to other selves such as smart/(emotionless?)me genuinely I don’t know if it’s an actual disassociation or a change of mental state. In this self I am more critical of my mental state(such as now) and less emotional. It does not feel like a separate entity trying to influence me unlike the mean or nice self. Instead it feels like a disconnection from my own emotions through analyzing. Examples include when in distress I may write about the experience and the symptoms in order to get to the cause of them. Like right now.  The core feeling is almost completely removed to the point like now where thinking about my emotional burst I don’t actually remember them as feeling “bad”. Objectively I know it felt bad, It felt horrible but looking back I can’t recall it as vividly. This may also be chalked up to me physically repressing the feelings or memories but I have no way to tell.

The rough part is I call this part of my self smart me because it feels as though normally my head is too clouded to properly be critical of my own mental health. I believe through proper guidance I could acknowledge these symptoms without having to disassociate from my own emotions. Because through disconnecting from my own emotions I grow doubtful of my own experiences and feelings. Even now I am warry to say I have any mental illness and instead commit to the idea that this is all a mere symptom of acute stress. Even to the point were I sincerely doubt any of what I’m saying is real but i can’t explain any of it otherwise. In worst case scenario ignoring this could lead to me developing immense mental illnesses. Which I’d rather avoid.

To be expanded
I know for a fact that many of my mental issues tie together in a complicated large not.Often I don’t know if I have any mental illness at all or if I am just experiencing paranoia. 

Most of these issues are hard to address because i tend to bury them deep into my mind and often forget they happen. I am thankful I can easily forget things because I’d honestly believe I would be insane by now if I remembered every experience. Should this be posted or found either by my self or by family. Firstly I hope I’m not dead and secondly please use my journal to bring insight into whatever the fuck is wrong with me.


(Notes: First of all I’m posting this trying to see if I  can find any leads to my symptoms and to hopefully bring any insight into others mental health. 
Secondly I’m posting this as a mental journal. I’m trying to have my thoughts written down in two places so I can properly process them in the future. 
Lastly I don’t want to heavily edit my statement above as I feel disingenuous editing it in any way. I did clear up a decent amount of repetition and rambling but by editing it my thoughts feel almost like a lie."
981,"Those with depression: when you see a trajerdy happen, does it make you feel more grateful for life?","Recently a distant releative died of breast cancer. It was a long painful death😪
Last week, my boyfriend lost his cousin in a car accident. She was only 18.
For the first 2/3 days after these events I felt sad, but also grateful for life. My depression almost cured in a way, or at least went. I felt grareful for my life, health &amp; family etc.
But this feeling only lasts  a couple days and here I am again, drowning in depression crying myself to sleep feeling so fat &amp; ugly, reminising on my awful childhood &amp; negative life events. How nothing has ever worked out for me, how I’ve always been the fat ugly duckling. 

I feel so guilty, for feeling this way when there are people dying of cancer, a young girl lost her life in her car accident. Why do I not feel grateful for life? Am I being selfish? I cant talk to my partner about my mental health ever again I feel like, I mean he hasnt said anything but me complaining against him loosing his cousin? So selfish of me

Does anyone else feel bad for being depressed when they hear of a trajerdy?"
982,I’m always tired when I go home to see my parents,I came back to my parents’ home from uni a few days ago and it feels like all my body wants to do is sleep? I have depression and anxiety and they do exhaust me sometimes but I literally just want to be asleep and do nothing else. I can’t work out if it’s just delayed exhaustion or something else but it’s frustrating as all hell.
983,Please help - at rock bottom,"I (34F) am getting scared for my mental health and feel like I’m getting worse every day.
Today I woke up from a dream about my ex, feeling very low and rejected and lonely although dream made sense to me. 
I could barely get out of bed; it took several hours and I only did because the sun is out today.

I have so much to do (I’m moving to another place to stay this week, have xmas shopping etc.. as well as chasing up financial stuff, and finding a new job) and it takes so much strength and energy to do anything - I don't even have the energy to shower right now.

I’m in so much pain after a break-up and leaving a country I adored living in, and my mind constantly gives me a hard time about all the mistakes I've made, and keeps reminding me of memories and places from my life before.

I never got the chance for closure with my ex - things had gotten pretty toxic from both ends and he just vanished on me. 
The whole relationship was a mess, but I have such bittersweet memories of the person I had the most immensely close connection with and the good times we did have. I've never been so close to another soul before and there's now just a big gaping hole. I miss conversation, I miss cuddles and kisses and I miss feeling like I knew where my life was going. 
I don't even know who I am anymore.

I think that everyone around me is sick of hearing about my issues and I don't want to keep burdening them. I don't want to be a burden or a victim.

Every day gets more difficult and I can feel myself giving up. I’m in emotional agony all the time and can't turn my brain off, and my suicidal thoughts are returning.
Everything I've tried so far doesn't lead me out of this. I don't feel welcome or safe anywhere, I know one o the two people in my current living situation is sick of me being here, and I can't blame them."
984,I feel uncomfortable.,"I'm not trolling or looking for drama, I'm genuine pissed. Just saw an ""i delete instagram"" post here that really disturbed me. I was calm, now i have anxiety. I hate everyone and humans are pieces of shit."
985,I feel lonely,"it feels like none of my friends truly care about me. my best friend and I don't really text that much and my other friends just never text me at all, even when they're constantly talking to each other. it feels like nobody cares enough about me to even just say a simple 'hello'. they don't realise how much it truly makes my day if they just say 'hi'. I don't know, I just feel like I don't have any proper friends in my life."
986,"wow, my life is shit, please help I guess, idk, just needed to get my feelings out","I literally just cried today because I was seeing some deep comment shit on tiktok and that somehow reminded me of my mom. she has been out of my life for 8 years, I think. she was physically there for me but not emotionally nor mentally. she was ill and bedridden and I just lived my life without her. my dad doesn’t fucking understand, because he has had a mother but I don’t. she left one year ago, almost two years now. time goes by quick. I wanna call her for christmas but I know my dad will let me down once again. since my dad had to go work and my mom wasn’t able to take care of us cps came. our neighbor (call her mrs. b) came in and let us stay at her place for a while until my mom came home from the hospital (after cps came we had to send her to some hospita). YET MY FUCKING DUMBASS DAD STILL THINKS SHE’S SUSPICIOUS AND TRULY DOESN’T CARE ABOUT ME. SHE WAS MY FUCKING GRANDMA, WHO TOOK THE PLACE OF MY MOM AND YET YOU THINK SHE’S OUT TO GET YOU. YOU FUCKING HOE, I HATE YOU. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND NOT EVERYONE IS SUSPICIOUS. YOU TOLD ME TO KEEP WHAT’S HAPPENING IN OUR FAMILY A SECRET. WHY, WHY IS THAT. I NEED HELP, MENTALLY AND I WANT TO GET DIAGNOSED WITH SOMETHING. BUT NOOOOOO, IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU BECAUSE WHEN I BRING HER UP YOU DON’T WANNA TALK AND FOCUS MORE ABOUT HOW IT HAS HURT YOU. BITCH, I DONT CARE IF YOUR WIFE, AKA MY MOM, IS NOT WITH YOU. YOU CAN GET A NEW WIFE LIKE THAT HOE YOU CHEATED ON MOM WITH, WHILE FOR ME I HAVE TO FUCKING SEARCH FOR PEOPLE WHO WILL TAKE ME IN AND CARE FOR ME UNLIKE YOU. YOU DIDNT EVEN GIVE ME EMOTIONALLY NOR MENTAL CARE AND YET WHEN I COMPLAIN YOU COMPARE MY SITUATION TO SOMEONE ELSE’S. I DON’T LIKE IT, IN REALITY I HATE EVERYONE IN  MY LIFE EXCEPT A FEW PEOPLE WHO COULD GIVE AT LEST A SHIT ABOUT ME. I WISH MY MOM WAS FINE SO SHE CAN GIVE US LOVE. THIS IS UNFAIR, LIFE IS UNFAIR. I HATE HATEHAYST SSSD FUCK LIFE"
987,I don't know how to handle my stress,"I (18M) have always considered myself in good mental health. My friends have struggled with there own problems and I have have been the one that helps them, not the other way around. (not to say that other friends do not help) I never thought that I would be posting on a subreddit like this but hey, here we are. 

I was working on completing my Eagle Scout for that past couple months and that was extraordinarily stressful. I was falling behind in school (that had gone online) and was getting 4hr of sleep on a good day. During this I started using carts (THC) to help go to sleep which immediately became an every night ritual. I tried going to bed with out it but I just ended up rolling around thinking about everything I hadn't done, the deadlines approaching, the time I was wasting. I would do this till about 4:00AM when I would give up and get fried just to be able to sleep. I assumed that after I turned in my Eagle stuff  that everything would go back to the way it was. That was three weeks ago.

Things didn't get better, just what was stressing me changed. Now it was all of the late assignments that I have, my 3.8 gpa that's going to be a 3.0 or lower after this semester. I would stress so hard over all of this but wouldn't have the motivation to do anything about it till the last second were I would stay up till 3:00AM just to turn it in late. 

But hey, low motivation, stress, yeah sounds like a teen in quarantine whatever. What has really become a problem is the anger. I was never angry. I just kind of floated through life viben. I haven't been there in months. EVERYTHING pisses me the fuck off. I get pissed at the dogs, at my family, at my friends, at events that happened years ago, at events that never happened that I made up in my head.  Fuck man, I threw my chair across the room, put multiple gouges in my desk, and broke a door off its hinges because, and get ready, my hat fell off while I was trying to do homework. My hat. It fell off. So I proceeded to commit to multiple accounts of destruction of property. 

Albeit this was more of a straw that broke the camels back type deal. It felt like everything I was trying to do just went wrong. Nothing I would do could just work. I tried to calm down and just do homework. This was when the forces of gravity willed my cranial covering from my scalp and onto my work platform, set in motion acts against inanimate objects that Stalin himself would consider inhumane.

I have all of the support I could need in the form of friends and family but idk, I have never been much of the talking about my feelings type. Besides, they all have plenty of there own troubles, especially in theses times. It would be much easier for everyone if I could just learn how to manage myself which ig is what I'm asking help with. I would appreciate any and all advise."
988,My fiance says that mental illnesses are just labels,"We've been together for 5 and a half years. He's supposed to be understanding right? I struggle with anxiety and major depression, i also have bpd. Im not medicated for anything as meds haven't helped me before. Overall im pretty good at keeping it at bay. Maybe im just suppressing them. But i get major flair ups from time to time.

To sum it up, i was overthinking and started following other guys on my other insta because he's doing worse things to me and isnt stopping even when i tried to talk to him multiple times. He got upset, then i explained because hes doing things that hurt me and he doesnt care because hes still doing it. I was overthinking and i knew i did was wrong and i shouldnt have done it. Then i started to feel really down and self hatred.

He knows i have these mental health issues but thinks im choosing to be unhapppy. He thinks i use depression as an excuse. They're just labels for people who choose to live like that. Obviously i dont want to feel these dark emotions? Nobody does. I actually sit with it when its bad and try to process them so i dont do something stupid.

I told him that my mom has these issues more severely and genetics can play a role. He said its bull and that im ungrateful and need to learn to appreciate things more. But i do. Im grateful everyday. I should be feeling like i won the lotto but i dont. I told him to maybe read up on mental illnesses and he said in a rude tone that i dont have to educate him. That were allowed to disagree."
989,Does anybody else feel like they don't fit in anywhere emotionally?,"I've read a similar thing on twitter the other day. 

After years of mental illness I feel like I don't really fit in anywhere emotionally. My mental illness stole my late childhood and teenage years from me, I feel like I'm a child but also a old person at the same time. Like my mental illness has aged me but also kept me from growing up. I'm in no way in the same place as other adults my age, I only get along with people 5-10 years older than me. But at the same time I feel so immature. I'm constantly distancing myself from others, I can't let myself get into a relationship, even tho I wish I could built stronger friendships and a mature relationship. 

I feel so out of place everywhere, I just don't fit in anywhere? I'm in my mid twenties btw."
990,Suicide prevention (SPOILER WARNING!!! Cyberpunk 2077,"So I’ve been playing cyberpunk these past few days and despite the bad press it has gotten I think the story, particularly the endings have been excellent.  Out of the 5 endings I know about I’ve played through 2 and both have hit me right in the feels.  I’ve just finish the “suicide” ending and not so much the ending itself but the messages you get from your friends while the credits roll. I won’t spoil things more than that and I’m sure you can find it on YouTube if you don’t play the game. I just think CDpr have done a excellent job of handling the subject and have certainly given me more food for thought.  

Apologies for my grammar and if I posted this in the wrong place.

Have a nice Christmas everyone."
991,DAE feel like whenever people talk about people who fake having a mental illness they talk about them?,"Every time I see such a post I immidiatly think that it applies to me and the OP talks about me or people like me. I also think that I will eventually find my posts on subreddits about people that are faking mental illnesses. I am not diagnosed with anything and even though I tried seeing a psychologist many times I always stop after a few sessions because I start believing that I am faking evwrything especially since they don't give me a diagnosis. Last time I was seeing one for a few months and even though I said multiple times that I wanted to know if I have something or not they just wouldn't say so I got frustrated and left. They wouldn't say I am fine or what I have. I just wanted to know what was going on to feel more valid I guess. Or to just be told that I am fine.

What I am trying to say is that since I don't have a diagnosis Every time I see such a post I feel horrible because I think that what I think I have is just me trying to be edgy or something. I think that what I feel and experience is not valid. The frustration is so big that I keep thinking of ending it all. 

Does anyone else feel like this when seeing such posts? And how can I stop being affected by them? Reddit is my only social media account and I would prefer to keep it."
992,Does anyone else feel like the nightmare is never ending?,"By nightmare, I mainly am referring to my personal fears over COVID-19. With each new story I read in the news, each new alert on my phone about the lockdowns and restrictions in my area, or references to the 'new normal' it's like a little more fear is injected into me. It seems surreal a lot of the time, a year ago I couldn't have possibly imagined the world being what it is today. 

A lot of things have kind of led to how horrible and helpless I'm feeling today, it was just an article I read about a 'rapidly spreading strain' of COVID that was the final straw for me today. I've not set foot outside my flat since January because I'm so frightened of getting sick. Less than 3 years ago I spent weeks in a coma, on a ventilator, and was so ill I was expected to die, and I'm terrified of being in that position again, or putting my family through it.  Physically I am now actually unable to leave the house, I'm severely disabled and my condition has deteriorated over the last year significantly - so as well as anxiety I'm dealing with chronic pain despite the heavy pain relief I'm on (Fentanyl and Morphine).

Even though I don't leave the house I still have contact with people, like delivery drivers, the person who drops off my medications, my cleaner/carer. Each encounter is frightening. It really got to me last week when my mum was in tears because she's not seen my brother or I for over a year (she lives abroad) and we have no idea when or if we'll see each other again. I am generally one of those people who are quite happy in their own company, and I have kept myself occupied/entertained over the year with courses, and buying a lot of books on my kindle, but the future seems terrifying."
993,I hate overthinking,"I said a single thing. it wasn't rude or with any ill intentions of anything and I've apologized. but instantly my brain has just been constantly overthinking the entire thing. what if they hate me? what if I've just destroyed our friendship? and I fucking hate it. I have no fucking reason to be overthinking it cause they moved on and I should too cause it's been and passed and I said sorry and I fucking hate that my brain instantly goes ""they hate you you've fucked up"" because I'm tipsy and not doing great and it's heightening all these fucking feelings that I can't be dealing with right now and I hate it. I fucking myself"
994,Is this a compulsion? Also in need of POCD advice,"To give a little input, these thoughts started bugging me some months after I was watching porn one day and suddenly a hentai video started playing with children/pre-teens and I was already feeling turned on from the other videos but I felt some more with that one. I didn't think about it for months and then suddenly ""puff! remember when...?"" (In addition, I heard someone correlating Pedophilia with the LGBTQ+ community, and being a part of it, it was kind of a trigger.)

So I've been dealing with some pocd thoughts lately and so when I'm scrolling through Instagram and see someone I find attractive I frequently need to go in their bio to check their age. Some of them don't have it, some do and are my age or older and there was this one who was 13 (I'm 16, turning 17 next month) and made me freak out (even though I understand it's not that big of a deal). Bedsides, when the person is older, my mind goes like ""well, you only liked them cause they look younger"" which is horrible.
And also my brain has been kinda like ""you were never actually attracted to anyone your age or older that is just a lie you tell yourself"" lately (which is completely untrue but still makes me feel awful). 

Also, I think I have to say that I've never felt interested in kids (I actually don't really like them) and actually have lots of crushes in older celebrities (and am in love with someone my age). 

This is the second time I'm dealing with pocd thoughts and it sucks so I'd like to know:

1. Can that ""checking the bio"" thing be a compulsion? 
2. Any advice on the thoughts? 

I'd really appreciate any help you could give me!"
995,Therapy or ideas for helping myself,"Hi all,

I am looking for some honest opinions on if therapy is worth the money. I know it is great for some people but I really don’t like talking about feelings with people as a result i bottle things up leading to outbursts. One outburst happened at work and landed me in trouble and I don’t ever want that to happen ever again. I am not convinced therapy is right for me but I appreciate it really helps some people.

I have been under a lot of stress lately with someone harassing me and stalking me. This has been reported to the police. My sleep is messed up and I feel on edge a lot of the time. 

I was considering the following: set a wake up bedtime, journal everyday and meditating.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any ideas of techniques that might help me to feel better please let me know."
996,My mom is Anti Vaxx and I’m worried for her and I mental health.,"Before I say anything, I have got all of my vaccines and this has only happened since COVID-19.

My mother has recently started to get very irrational in her beliefs of vaccine and their legitimacy, she’s a nurse and would absolutely not call her “uneducated” in the topic except for vaccines. The reason I worry for her mental health is because she publicly shares her ideology with the internet (instagram or Facebook) and I as a veteran internet surfer am worried for her since I know how vial, rude and absolutely disturbing people can get with this kind of topic. I am sensitive when it comes to my family being attacked or verbally and physically abused, I think if any certain group or individuals targeted my mother I would absolutely break down and become a mess, not only I would be upset but also my mom because she is so sweat and caring towards people and is also sensitive, so I couldn’t imagine seeing her genuinely upset because I feel so bad for her and everyone I know that experience this kind of thing. Just the thought of someone telling my mom who I’ve known since I was born and helped me through very intense emotional situations to kill herself or hope harm or death upon her, even cussing would affect me because it still hurts her. I know she shouldn’t be so irrational but she actually sort of has a reason for herself because of the vaccine reaction she had that put her in hospital for 5 months. 

Post is getting too long and I hope you guys can understand what I’m trying to say.

Diagnosis: I’m ADHD, MDD, OCD and type 1 diabetic, In case people wanted to know.

Edit: the hospitalisation didn’t trigger this belief, she truly followed it once COVID-19 hit us."

998,How to deal with a parent who has a nervous breakdown ?,"Hi, I'm asking this because my mom has a nervous breakdown and sometimes she's just being so mean to me. I know she has a lot of traumas and she can't see a therapist anymore (it would be possible in one or two years but not at this moment)

There is days she would just say something rude or with an angry tone, if I ask her why she's angry/stressed, she just deny it and start yelling at me and then says ""now I am angry"".
Usually I just dissociate when she does that but I recently realised I repressed a lot of feelings and memories so I'm trying to work on that. I think I'm doing good but it really hurts when someone yell at me if I am not dissociating. 

I used to think I was the one who wasn't doing good enough, then I thought she was the one who was a toxic person. But one day, she understood what I was trying to explain and she apologised and sayed that I wasn't the problem and that she was. Then I understood she's not just mean on purpose, I think she really thinks what she say isn't mean and that's I am the problem her, or maybe that's some sort of delusion so she won't feel guilty, I'm not sure. I told her it was because of her mental issues and I think she understood, she tried to be nice the next days but today she just forgot again and started being mean again.

I only live with her (my father will come tomorrow for the holidays though, I wonder if it may be why she seems stressed) and I don't know how to deal with it. I can't help her because of my own mental issues. I don't love her enough to force me doing chores if I don't feel like it I think, I don't hate her but she's hurting me so I can't really love her as much as I love my friends, even if it's not really her fault.

No one ever explained me what to do in those cases so that's why I'm asking, thanks in advance and have a good day !"
999,What are people with BPD good in,What are people with BPD good in
1000,Crying,"Crying used to be the main coping mechanism for me but for these few months it just doesn't work anymore. It resulted in me turning to other ways to cope with whatever the hell im going through. Most of them are unhealthy and it worked for a couple of weeks but i find myself slowly losing that relief that initially came with my unhealthy coping mech. It's not that i can't cry, it's just that it makes me feel worse; as if each minute i spend crying i discover another thing to be sad about which just complicates things even more. Same way goes for my unhealthy coping mechanism too; for a few weeks it was all fine and fucking dandy and the next thing you know it just stopped working. Each time i do it i just feel unsatisfied and disappointed in myself. I'm just exhausted."
1001,I don't feel welcome in my home,"So I'm not sure what I want to achieve with this, I guess I just need to vent..

Basically yesterday I flew home to the UK from Spain, leaving my boyfriend of almost 3 years there, we are still together but due to money and the work situation over there this is our best option for now, I'm living here permanently as far as we can tell and he may he moving over at some point. We don't know when we will see each other again, it could be a couple of months, but it could be not until after summer or longer.

Obviously this is bad enough and my emotions are wild, but I've temporarily moved into my mum's again. I was always miserable living here, I'm sleeping in the room where a lot of traumatic shit happened with exes of mine, I won't go into detail because it's intense, so this is bad enough. Though since I've got here my mum has been grumpy and seems very dismissive as if she doesn't want me here. She has barely spoken to me and when she does it's usually about something that's annoyed her.

Usually I have a good relationship with her, but I hate living with her, this is why I moved out at 17 because I just couldn't be here.. I don't know what to do..

To make things worse I have to weed and no money to get any, I know it's not great but weed has been a huge crutch for me these past 2 years of stress and unemployment.. I hate feeling like I'm burdening everyone..

Hopefully when I'm done with my 10 day quarantine I can finally move in with my friends, we're going to be sharing a house together and I'm so excited, but for now I'm must miserable and slipping into old patterns I never learned to break. I've been here one night and already I want out"
1002,Question about a skill,"I have a question about a skill!

It's actually one of my main skills. It's extremely effective.. But I can't figure out a way to use it in a healthy way long-term! Maybe someone has an idea?

My skill is venting. I can be in the deepest, darkest depression. If I just write everything down that comes to my mind and hit send somewhere I feel almost immediately better. I then also enjoy seeing people relate and sometimes people give nice advice or make a funny joke or whatever. It's just really nice! It's 1) attention 2) venting and 3) community/social. Perfect skill for me!

But now to the issues. It can be quite extreme whenever I vent. And I know it's not that serious and that 30 minutes later I'll feel better. Others don't.

So there are places like this subreddit. Fine, right? Yea. And it works pretty well here. But the more people I reach, the more places I vent at, the more effective the skill is. And that is where it can become toxic and I just can't figure out a healthy base.

As an example my private Instagram account. My real life friends are there and food bloggers folllow me. Not a mental health crowd. But I reach a lot of people. I have over 1000 Followers. So if I vent there the 1) attention and 2) venting and 3) community/social aspect works wonderful, but then it gets weird. People take it so serious, they don't get it. I also feel a bit embarassed and ashamed and over-dramatic. I feel triggering.

I've made pure venting Instagram accounts, but there I don't reach many people (yet?).

I don't know.

Back in the days when online forums were a thing it was perfect. They were popular and huge. I was able to post kinda anonymously, yet my name was recognizable.

My main issue tbh is about my main account. I LOVE venting there. But at the same time it's so awkward and embarassing and weird, because my FACE is attached to it. My identity. You know what I mean?"

We both struggle a lot with anxiety when it comes to friendships especially. She's always been a really good friend for me, always there for me, and I've been there for her a lot as well when she's dealt with things and she acknowledges this. She always tells me to talk to her if I ever need her, and I say the same to her.

Over the last couple of weeks I noticed she was taking a couple of days to text me back, yet she would be online a lot on all her social media and would constantly reply to other people (we're in group chats together). It did hurt me a bit but I didn't bring it up thinking there must be reason and you know, people forget to reply, or they need to think of a response, it's okay. I think it just upset me because I was in the middle of trying to talk to her about something and ask for advice, yet it felt like she wasn't really there, but it's okay because everyone has their own stuff going on and they shouldn't drop anything for me, I understand that of course.

Anyway, last week we were supposed to stream a movie together but when it came to the day we were supposed to hang, I hadn't heard from her all day, so I messaged asking if everything was okay and she replied and had basically forgotten we were supposed to hang out and was now busy. As I had already been feeling a little insignificant to her this stung and I will admit I responded pretty bluntly with an ""it's okay"" when she apologized, though from what she was saying it almost sounded like she didn't expect me to be upset, or didn't understand why I was. She also said she was too tired to hang out. So yeah I was just like ""it's okay"" and we didn't talk for the rest of the night. The next day, I was feeling really guilty and awful for how I had responded to her, because I had just responded impulsively through my hurt. I know she struggles with her mental health and though her being tired could have meant just tired from work or something, it could have also meant tired because of anxiety/depression and I just hadn't even considered that because I was too focused on how I felt, and she always checks up on me. I felt so bad so I messaged her apologizing for how I responded to her and how, yes it had upset me that we didn't hang out, but I shouldn't have been so selfish and thought of only myself, but I should have asked if SHE was okay and if there was a reason she felt tired-I told her I would work on this. She pretty much just replied with ""it's fine it was my fault"" and that was the last I heard from her, a week ago. This response just kind of took me aback and I didn't really know how to respond, so I didn't. It felt like that just shut down any chance to have a talk about it. I think I might have upset her but I just felt and still feel way too uncomfortable to reach out to her in case I'm just bugging her. I feel awful, guilty and selfish and I wish I had acted differently but now I just don't know what to do. She's still talking to other people as normal so I'm wondering if she even wants to talk to me. I'm just stuck. Did I really act that badly? What would you do in this situation?"
1006,People in the helping field sometimes lose objectivity and unable to see things from another person's POV (United States),"While I am grateful that someone chatted with me yesterday 

I felt misunderstood, and completely invalidated in the end. Like what I said was wiped out.

IF there is anyone over 45, and you have time to chat, can you DM me? 

Knowledge of Narcissism would be helpful too.

It is due to my age, gender, and my upbringing (social class) where I am no longer a part of. But the experience and the things l learned never left me.

Age = people who are in their 20's to 30's have different concerns and experiences than someone who is above 45 (vice versa)

An ex  that was suggested was, ""just pick up and move to another State""

Take their Medicaid benefits. Disregard what you know because you over think.

""Over think"" coming from a young male to an older female. 🙄

In other words just act like someone who has mania (I don't), and just whimsically move without plans, and show up on the doorstep of social services in another State, where I have no permanent residency established, $200 in my pocket, and get Medicaid, and again, ignore what I know because questions are not permitted

Gender = we have dif health / hygiene needs depending on age and condition

Ex, ""just sleep in your car, walk into any gym and ask for a free day pass to shower before your job interview.""

Gyms are not public shower memberships

Disregard appearances, play ""lets pretend,"" that a Nordstrom vs a Target vs an office job require the same dress code.

Social class = a background that involved a certain level of education, that offered exposure beyond one's own environmental elements. A standard that required discipline, goal attainment, cerebral work, healthy rest and nutrition in order to function. A lifestyle that looked at NET income, and one that involved paying bills on time, looking ahead at ""income vs expenses.""

Ex. ""Just 'take' any job

Ignore the bills, the condition of my car, randomly move to another state with no plans in place and wing it

""Call the hotlines if you are suicidal or 211""

Me: ""Have you personally called those numbers? Do you know how they're funded? The level of clinical training and education that's on the other line by the person working for that non-profit who is fielding those calls? Do they meet all client needs and are they scripted?""

Him: I dunno 

When you dont have money to pay for quality help, you get people who listen to hear, but who sometimes don't understand. They try and they mean well

It isnt intentional to misunderstand

But it shows how the system is designed to keep people poor and oppressed 

Nonprofits don't meet every individual's intellectual levels, income needs, etc.. 

Which is why I cant continue on like this"
1007,Am i going insane?,"I'm very lonely and i am homophobically harassed in the real world since im gay. I'm fat, ugly and broke. I have been struggling with drugs, self harming and suicidal thoughts the past two years. For a 15 year old that sounds fun doesn't it.

 I sit in a 4x4 meter room all my time when im not in school or working. I'd say im a polite and a nice person and i put others before me but i have been starting to have these episodes of just pure anger and rage out of nowhere.

Wanting everyone dead. Shooting up a school or committing a terror attack. Looking at gore and how to do bad things to other people such as how to build bombs and weapons. Cutting and hurting myself. Punching walls and yelling. Curling up on the floor and crying.

I fear that i will act on all of this, i want this to just stop but im going fucking insane.

Feels so fucking unfair that everyone gets off so easy while i have to work for fucking ages to get what others take for granted in the same environment. Feels so fucking unfair that your parents don't love you..."
1008,*OCD-related* Groinal response/arousal (constant) {afraid I have PGAD},"So lately sometimes I get groinal responses/arousal either:

- out of nowhere (or at least feels like it) 
- after I have an intrusive thought (no anxiety sometimes, just the groinal response)

This feeling persists longer than usual, because after maybe an hour or so I still fell something down there. The truth is that for most of that time I'm focused on the feeling, which might be the reason why it doesn't go away, but I'm also afraid I could have PGAD (Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder). Besides, I've seen that this condition is sometimes related to OCD (went looking for reassurance seeking, obviously didn't go well) and now I'm really scared I have it.

Do any of you feel this way too? Could I really have PGAD?"
1009,Is it normal to punch my head multiple times or just pull my hair hard whenever i am angry?,"Okay so um...this has been a habit of mine ever since elementary (i am a college student now) whenever i feel angry or frustrated. Reasons are mostly whenever i cry about something i got really anxious with and the frustrations about myself just built up and i tend to hurt myself at that point and this will go on for about an hour or two with those 2 things i do, i punch my head multiple times till i feel hurt or pull my hair hard (like you push and pull on repeat). I usually can control my emotions when on public because i know it is very unappropriate to show but when i am alone this somehow becomes an urge after a dilemma (maybe something stupid i did that i realised its bad or just i sometimes remember some bullying scenarios i experienced from the past) and i can do it anywhere as long as i am alone. I just realised this habit lately to be strange and i want to fix it up because i don't want it to cause problems for others specifically for my family and friends. I have never went to any psychiatrist so i don't know why i have built up such a thing. So can i ask some of you who has similar experiences?"

1011,Is there a disorder behind my identity crisis?,"Basically as far back as I can remember, I've always been jumping between different personalities or ""characters"" that depend on what I'm doing at that particular moment. The closest I can describe it is like you're an actor who dresses up and gets into character for whatever role they've been given. The only difference is instead of pretending, I really do believe I AM that character during that time. I'll give you a few examples : if I had to cook something in the kitchen, I'll automatically assume the role of ""The Chef"" and dress in typical chef attire with typical chef mannerisms, almost like a caricature of one. Usually to prepare for this episode I would research all i can about chefs and really get into cooking so i can ""get in character"" as much as possible. The same goes for other activities like gardening (i am now ""The Garderner"")  or when i go hiking (i am now The Outdoorsman who is obsessed with hiking). This has gotten so bad, that I even briefly did a degree in IT because my friend asked me to help with his computer course once and I automatically assumed the role of ""The Tech Guy"", where I researched and roleplayed into becoming an IT guy so much (im actually quite a technophobe) that i eventually went to college to do IT, but 'snapped out of it' after a few semesters and did something else. If you look at my wardrobe, it's full of outfits from the different 'phases' i've been in, and i own like 9 different glasses frames to suit each particular character. Obviously imposter syndrome kicks in like a mf since i'm not particularly expert at anything on account of my constantly changing interests, and my college days were miserable to say the least. I just wished i could stick to one single identity and be done with this BS for good. Does anyone have a clue what disorder (if any) might be causing this? I'm planning to see psychiatrist soon, although I'm not sure if anyone can fix it."
1012,23M I use to cry a lot in the last time because my childhood will never return,"You know the scene when the Teletubbies said goddbye and the sun is setting down? If you used to watch this show, one episode had to be the last one you have ever seen as a child, and thus making this scene a goodbye forever.

Those Teletubbies may be friend with themselves together forever, but what about you? You abandoned them because you simply grew up, you got to know other cooler shows like Deckname KND, Ed Edd n Eddy and so on

What I hate about being an adult is that time flows by SO FAST. It's just a matter of some moments where I'll be 85, laying in a bed because of cancer and dying, saying ""goodbye"" like those telletubbies for one last time

When I was like 5, I saw the music video to ""viva forever"" from the spice Girls. This was the first time in my life I understood the concept of DEATH. Because this one boy got trapped in this rubics cube forever. Dad got home at the moment when this music video ended, i basically went to him crying and ""beating"" (like a 5 year old would do) him because i was just sad why it has ti be that way that we all will die

I wish everyone could be like a telletubbie. Up until I was 4 or 5, everything in this world was about love love love 

I don't say that it's bad today, but now there are also responsibilities, anger, Lust, and so on. Which is not bad, but I am just a kid I guess 

I still sleep and play with my teddy bear, I still watch telletubies on YouTube. I try to hug everyone as much as I can so much it annoys everyone 

You know the reason why I don't want tj have children yet is because i still feel like a child, or better said : I feel like this ""me being a 3 year old"" chapter has to be closed.

Hope anyone can give me some advice what I can do

This crying is unbearable, it feels like my heart is ripped out of my chest, a cold electric flow throughout my veins, it's somewhat painful

EDIT: I posted this in r/self yesterday actually but I'm shadowbanned somehow

I simply am very sad about that ""all good things come to an end"". I can't accept that my early childhood came to an end. It's been 20 years and I can't accept it. I've been very emotionally challenged today, nearly crying on several occasions just due to the beauty of it. I myself ""feel"" like a telletubbie, and I ""see"" everyone else as a telletubbie. It's still hurting in my heart and I'm doing my best not to cry"
1013,"So today, I am holding myself accountable to that responsibility by writing in my journal...","A healthy way to get my feelings on paper and process some of the pain and grief I’m struggling with. On days like this, giving myself small goals that I can achieve are key. They may not be what I wanted to achieve, but life is all about adapting with change and riding the ebbs and flows. As much as we plan and think we have control over our lives, there are always going to be challenges thrown our way. Losing expectations and letting go of that control allows me to adapt to those challenges, even when they are persistent.

1014,I wanna say what I did this year,"During my childhood I had many problems with anxiety, most adults did not treat me well for this and others did not know how to help me.

today I know what I had and I can deal with anxiety symptoms much better.

I still suffer a lot for my childhood and today, through meditation and reflection, I know that I never had emotional help and I was always left to deal with my own emotions, until today I have a lot of difficulty in dealing with people because of my emotional difficulties, I feel that I didn't learn to socialize at the right age.

this year was terrible in many ways, but I had a lot of time to think about myself and talk to my family and friends about the difficulties I have, ask for help about myself and thank them for their existence.

I just wanted to talk about this and let you know how meditation and reflection can really help someone. adult life still causes me a lot of anguish, but today I believe that there are many positive ways to deal with our fears

the improvement comes from within, but don't try to do everything yourself.

obs. I am fluent in Portuguese, learning English, sorry if the text was difficult to understand"
1015,Why does it annoy me sm when people talk about mental health?,"I (16f) have a few diagnosed mental illnesses and suffer from two eating disorders. All of which are being treated. However, when I hear people talk about their mental health or the mental state of entire generations, wether it’s diagnosed, undiagnosed, valid, invalid, a friend, enemy or stranger, parent or parents figure, therapist, teacher or whatever the fuck, it annoys me so much. I don’t dismiss what they have to say, the topic just makes me frustrated. Can anyone explain this? 

If it helps, I find it frustrates me the most on social media’s like tiktok, Instagram, Facebook etc."
1016,Why do I feel drunk when I haven't had a drink?,"I keep having this issue where I feel sleepy, uncoordinated, achy, irritable, confused, disoriented, slurring my words, etc. And I'm oversensitive to everything, like a toddler that needs a nap. I haven't had a drink in more than 3 years and I get 9 hours sleep a night, so why do I feel drunk? Is this a symptom of depression or anxiety or a side effect of antidepressants? I'm on Wellbutrin and Zoloft. I also have scleroderma or some kind of related autoimmune disease, they're still not sure."
1017,"if processing trauma and analyzing one’s mental health struggles are the only way to truly be free of them, why does ignoring them make me feel so much more free?","basically all in the title. very confused, need answers. i have a turbulent relationship w/ nparent, which often results in verbal/physical abuse (still not even sure whether this is the right term but i’m pretty sure hitting a kid with a high-heel shoe repeatedly leaving purple bruises, on top of countless hours of screaming at them, qualifies), which makes me feel obviously super shitty (often crises result in hyperventilating and suicidal thoughts). following the crisis, i generally feel completely empty and numb for a couple of days, i find it hard to speak to anybody or do anything at all. however, once the “shock” is gone, which typically only requires a couple of days, i am fine again, almost like nothing ever even happened. this by itself is pretty concerning i think, because it doesn’t involve any forgiveness of self-healing, it just feels like some sort of “hard-reset”. most importantly, though, what concerns me is that i feel so much happier and lighter when i don’t think about any of it. i tried counseling for this as well as anxiety last year but it just resulted in me crying in front of a practical stranger for half an hour a week (since talking about it often makes me have complete meltdowns) and didn’t change my thought processes or coping mechanisms in the slightest. in general i tend to avoid talking about it or opening up about it to anyone, i just bury it whenever it happens. the thing is this sounds super toxic and harmful by itself, but it seems to be the only thing that allows me to function and lead a normal life. 

my main question is, is this all going to come back to bite me in the ass someday? or is it just not real trauma?

thanks for reading"
1018,The Ego is not the enemy,"""It's our biological inheritance"" - Dr David R Hawkins

## Ego = “It me”

*Spiritual intention* tends to bring up its opposite into one’s experience. Like, if we decide to become more compassionate, it seems as if the unconscious now pulls into our life instances and opportunities to *choose* compassion over its opposite.

This isn’t to ‘test’ our intention. It’s simply because something within us that awaits resolution is now invited for examination and healing.

The crux of spiritual work is the letting go of *me, me, me* with all its attractions and aversions, until our attachment to the small, limited self gives way to a deeper realization of our identity.

So, when you think of ‘ego,’ what’s the first few things that come to mind? I’ll go first.

&gt;*Arrogance*  
*Selfishness*  
*Grim satisfaction*

There is also the notion that egos belong to the personality as attributes

*“John’s got a big ego”*  
*“Don’t let your ego get in the way”*

By making the ego *yours* or *mine,* we tend to miss the forest for the trees.

**That it is really impersonal and biological.**

Let’s put it in a broader context:

    Through eons of time, the evolution of animal life, from the simplest to progressively higher life-forms, is also the evolution of the ego. 
    

### The ego as a primary survival mechanism

Dr David R Hawkins frames it this way:

&gt;***“\[The ego\] is our biological inheritance.***  
*Unlike plants (that derive energy from sunlight using chlorophyll), animal life had to acquire the energy needed for survival from its environment…*  
*Survival then established the main core of the ego, which is still primarily involved in self-interest, acquisition, conquering, and rivalry with other organisms for survival.*  
– from **The Map of Consciousness Explained** (p. 98). Hay House. Kindle Edition.

In this remarkable book, he explains that in the animal world, the ego evolved along with intelligence into sophisticated survival mechanisms:

* **hunting**
* **territorial behaviour**
* **possessiveness**
* **competition**
* **mating**
* **pack formation,** among others

Sounds a lot like the human experience, doesn’t it? One difference might be that while animals use teeth and claws, we use Twitter.

### The Ego’s Programs

So, now that we can see the ego differently, let’s examine some dominant patterns.

As we go through this list, all the stuff that we hate in ourself and others now makes sense as a whole. For example:

* The ego likes to take credit, and wants to be the center of attention.  
(*“That was MY idea!”)*
* The ego is the source of thinking that maintains the separate individual “I”  
*(Me vs you, us vs them)*
* The core of the ego is the *experiencer function* of the mind that experiences phenomena.
* The ego is insatiable. It craves novelty and excitement, and abhors boredom.  
*(“All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” ― Pascal)*
* The ego is like an information probe, constantly seeking and processing inputs from the world.  
(*See phone notifications)*
* The ego is the limited self with a *small s*. It thinks in linear terms, like causality  
(*A causes B causes C…)*
* The ego clings to ease and familiarity. It is averse to uncertainty, change and effort.  
*(Why old habits die hard)*
* The ego loves to extract a payoff from negativity; it likes the “juice” derived from being right, and winning.  
*(See football hooligans, violent social movements)*
* The ego enjoys the suffering of others.  
(*See schadenfreude and political theatre)*
* The ego loves pride, anger, force, and winning, and is averse to losing, humility, passivity.
* The ego loves specialness, glamour, control, and possessiveness  
*(Hollywood version of love)*
* The ego loves status, importance, opinion and attention. It is averse to acceptance, letting go, and being ignored. (*See Twitter)*
* The ego would rather change the world than change itself.  
*(“Cancel culture”)*
* The ego wants more (success, money, sex, chocolate...), it is afraid of having less  
(*“The person who suffers from inner poverty is relentlessly driven to accumulate on the material level.” ― Hawkins)*
* The ego clings to the past or frets over the future. It avoids the present.  
*(See the news cycle)*
* The ego loves being right, and it loves victimhood and *being wronged*.
* It loves to hate and blame, and despises kindness, forgiveness and peace.  
*(Contrast present day social resentments with examples of Holocaust survivors who forgave their captors)*
* The ego would rather kill or die than admit that it is wrong.
* Egomania, as seen in the world, is the unbridled entitlement of the infantile mind.  
*(See megalomaniac dictators)*
* **The ego secretly wants to be recognized as God.**  
*(See the megalomania of dictators, plus fallen spiritual or religious teachers)*
* The core of the ego is narcissism. That which the ego hates, it projects into the world, so it can then direct ‘justified’ hate, blame, anger, etc.
* For a society or culture, the inability to recognize the egomania of its rulers can ultimately lead to the catastrophic: large scale conflict, war, genocide, slavery, and every kind of inhumanity that we’ve seen or read about.  
*(See the Holocaust, the Nanking massacre, man-made famines, etc,)*

As I go through this (by no means exhaustive) list of qualities mentioned by Dr Hawkins, I realize how much of my life is dominated by these ego programs.

A TINY bit disturbing.

1019,Do you think this sounds like Imposter Syndrome?,"I have a slew of a diagnosed mental illnesses. Everything from anxiety, to depression, to ADHD, and OCD. But I've realized I have more problems lately that don't seem like my usual issues cropping up. I did some research into Imposter Syndrome and I just wasn't sure if its what it is. The base line is, my relationships. I've always had this creeping feeling in my head that I'm not a good person and therefore undeserving of love. And while that may sound like depression my depression usually takes the form of just intense sadness out of nowhere like my whole world is falling apart even If things are fine. So it doesn't feel like that. I feel like I'm a bad person, like I've done something bad to people. And I'm terrified of people seeing me that way. I bend over backwards and force myself to stay in toxic relationships because I feel I have to make up for something or prove myself to them. Its this painful loyalty which at times has helped but at other times really hurt. I feel like I'm lying to myself every time I try to be a good person. I also really easily accept the mantle of being the bad guy in disagreements. I just assume if someone is mad at me I've done something wrong and they're in the right. And that's the thing, I'm told fairly frequently im a good person and I dont remember hurting anyone close to me any time recently. So I dont understand whats going on there. I just want to be happy being good instead of constantly feeling like I'm lying to myself and others. I dont really have the money to get diagnosed right now or even to see a therapist. So what's this sound like to you guys ? Is it just my depression and anxiety manifesting in new ways or is it something else?

TL,DR I feel like I'm a bad person even though I've always thought about and cared for others. I'm not sure if have imposter syndrome or if my issues are are manifesting in new ways."
1020,Getting mental health help is frustrating when all I get is conflicting info,"I’d like some answers about what’s wrong with me and how to fix it but it’s hard when I get conflicting answers from psychiatrists, therapist, etc. I’m bipolar, I’m not bipolar, that was psychosis, it wasn’t psychosis, I dissociated, no, that wasn’t what it was. Then when it comes to meds it’s all a guessing game anyway and none of it seems to help. I started this journey about 2 years ago and I’ve only gotten worse during that time. Trying my best to hold on to a little hope that I’ll find some answers, but not feeling a lot of faith in the mental health industry right now."
1021,TW: my first few “dating experiences” happened against my will,"As the title already suggests... my (19F) first few sexual experiences with a man (25) happened against my will and it’s been 5 days now.

I’m still trying to process what happened, the intrusions and nightmares have gotten better luckily and I have a great support system. Furthermore I reported him to the police one day later and I went to the hospital to save DNA. Monday and Tuesday were the _WORST_ days of my life.


I don’t know what I am actually feeling. Today I woke up feeling fine and I thought my trauma magically healed over night because I was able to sleep well but throughout the day I still zone out, I still get deeply upset and I can still recall everything he did and said to me. I just want him to get justice for everything he did to me, he knew it was against my will."
1022,How do you help someone who is depressed and has self harm tendencies?,"Some context, I (20F) have a roommate who 1 year ago had really bad anxiety that they’re on medication, but early this year something horrible happened to them, I wouldn’t disclose any information as it’s not my right to tell their story. anyways they went through a rough patch and was diagnosed with both anxiety and depression around March.

During April, Covid hit with lockdown and I left our shared house to go home and she stayed behind. After I left, They seemed pretty okay most of the time, all that I know is that they’re on medication and seeing a therapist. (So I assumed they’re doing fine) But a few months after I left, I received their message asking for help one day, along with pictures of them cutting themselves (it wasn’t deep but it was bleeding) and I was hours away and shocked as there is no way that I could help them through the phone. 

They explained that they’re not feeling fine and have not been for a while but did not tell anyone. They’d have memory loss, and they couldn’t sleep unless they’re sleeping under their bed, and is asking for my help on how to hide the scars. So, I did what I could by calming them down and gave some advice about hiding since I don’t want to push them to talk to anyone if they’re not ready, but I did advice them to see their therapist as soon as they can. 

After that incident, they were fine or they weren’t but did not tell me (I didn’t ask because they mentioned that they don’t like talking about it because it feels like pity when someone asks) , but we still talk time to time. Then a few weeks back, they sent me another message told me they’d been hallucinating and can’t remember a lot of stuff that we did together, or they were not sure if it really happened. They also told me they were very tired and wanted to rest. Me hearing that scared the life out of me, I was so scared that they are going to hurt themselves and I’m hours away not being able to do anything. Everything turned out fine luckily and in the end we talked and they calmed down and went to sleep for some rest.

The thing is, after the first incident whenever I receive a slightly sad or depressing text from them I’d just think of the worst and it’d scared me so much and I literally can’t do anything to help them. 

I just want to know what can I actually do to help them if there is a next time? Also did I do anything wrong with handling the situation in the past?"

1025,My friend physically can't stop lying and they hate it?,"Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.
So I have a close friend of mine. We talk online most of the time, and play video games together, usual stuff. They were always a bit weird and I knew they had mental health problems going on, but I never interfered with anything except recommending them psychological help, which they seem to be scared of. But lately they've been far more weird than usual. First of all they lie about things like ""I stole your (in-game item)"" when they did not  and then admit that they did not steal it and say that they said that because ""they have issues"". They do that to other people we play with too. Today they completely out of the blue replied to one of my messages with "" who are you?"" and then pretended they don't know me. At first I thought it was a prank so I showed them I'm visibly upset by this and they just continued with it and then stopped replying. Later this day they came back online saying they just woke up and when I was upset at them were pretending they didn't know what happened and then saying they don't remember writing that and were asleep when they wrote a completely cohesive message in a different, public chat at the same time as the first one where they lied. I called them out on it, saying how I usually would just brush that off but this time how they were obviously lying and how I'm very upset (I have a lot of fears about being forgotten so they made me panic a lot). After me saying how they lied and them denying it, they finally admitted to it, saying how they pretended they didn't know me because they have issues and want to ruin all their relationships. I told them they could just tell me that they don't want to speak to me anymore instead of this and they assured me that they do want to but that they just they are ""literally inactive"" when that happens. They seem to be very apologetic and upset about themselves (""I hate it"" ""it happens every. single. time."")I want to do what's right for me and them here, because I really do care for them, but I also have struggles of my own. I already told them that they need therapy and that this is not good for either of our mental health. How would one go about being rational and careful in this relationship to not hurt them, but not hurt myself either?
Sorry for a long post. I'll answer all the questions if there are any with details as soon as I can."

1027,"[TW: mortality, mourning] I feel nothing when people die. Do I need help? (A bit long)","Hello.

I'm 31, male. At this point in life it's been several times that people I knew relatively well or my extended family members died.

&amp;#x200B;

First time it was when I was 7, my grandmother was dying, and my father took us for 6 hour car ride to ""say our goodbyes"". I can see him willing to do so, since she was his mother, but I can't really say that I did, I wasn't too fond of my granny, since she was suffocatingly religious and very strict. We arrived a bit late, I was met by my aunt dressed in black, my uncle drunk and in tears so I figured granny was dead. I then was told to go and kiss the corpse, which I did, and this is the point where I - even being only 7 - started to suspect something was wrong with me.

Because, as instructed, I placed my palm to her cold cheek and kissed her on her cold forehead - and I didn't feel anything at all, no sadness, no repulsion, no joy or anything - nothing at all. Granny wasn't looking scary or disturbing while being dead - just cold and pale with a face relaxed and dressed more fancy than in life. After that I was allowed to go outside, and I expected that it's about time I'd be overcome with sorrow, and look at the skies and cry ""NOOOOOO"" like they do in movies, but I didn't really feel like it, so I just went for a walk for several hours (it wasn't uncommon in 1996 to let children be outdoors unsupervised for hours).

Next couple days they performed some rituals, and on a third day granny's corpse was transported to be buried, and I was left for two weeks in ""care"" of my grieving uncle, I was also tasked with not letting him get drunk, but I didn't quite figure out how I was supposed to protect the stash of vodka from him, so he was drunk most of my stay. Let me also note that I like my uncle, he's a great guy, and always treated me really well, but his mother's passing hit him hard and he was an emotional wreck for a month or so after, but even wasted he still took care of my basic needs and honestly didn't bother me that much.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short: years passed, more people I knew or of my extended family died: some of old age related illness, some of cancer, one was murdered. Some of them I really liked, some I was simply OK with. But the common theme was: once I knew a person is dead, I no longer feel sorry for them, I'm not mortified, I don't grieve etc. I wondered if maybe I was suppressing my emotions, but it doesn't seem to be the case - it never affected me later in life, I never had painful memories or anything really. I remember the time I was around the person, I realize that I won't ever interact with them again, but I'm just sort of okay with that, life goes on (for me), thank you for the company?

I can't say I have problems with empathy - I REALLY don't like when people suffer, I REALLY want to help if I feel I can do something useful. But. If a person suffers - I feel for them, but if they then die, my brain is immediately like: ""well, that's life, moving on"". I still feel the injustice in the case of that one murder I mentioned, but it's not a pity for a man that was murdered, he most likely doesn't care - too dead for that.

*EDIT: the part about easily moving on is actually most suspicious for me: I'm a ruminator in other aspects of life, I can remember some random girls laughing at me over a decade ago, so moving on easily isn't typical for me at all.*

I was raised largely on TV-shows about nature. I always had the idea that death is part of life, it never seemed to me like a dark, grim subject. I'm well aware of my own mortality and of that of people I love, I KNOW that we ALL WILL DIE eventually. It's not the most pleasant thought, but it also isn't something I'd feel the need to expel from my mind ASAP. But many people share this understanding, and still seem to be taking people's death very close to heart.

Why am I so ready to move on? I've been this way since very young age, long before any of my other mental issues surfaced.

Am I broken, emotionally flawed?

Thank you for your thoughts!"
1028,I'm so mf unhappy.,"Idk what to do anymore. I'm miserable and lonely all the times.  I just feel like I'm a disappointment and a burden to people around me. I can't keep this in me. I want to give up and just be done with everything.  
Ahhh i can't stop crying. 
I wish things can change, i wish this horrible feeling would just fade away.  
But i won't because that's how life is."
1029,A rant about my current relationship with my family,"I want to get on with my family, but its becoming harder. I am now 25 and a lot of what I'm talking about is from when I was younger, although things like this still happen. Sometimes I struggle to even speak in front of them out of anxiety, nothing is ever simple to say without it causing some sort of issue. 

On the surface, my family acts really kind, in some ways they are, most of the time people would see us as a normal family. However sometimes their kindness comes with a caviat of eternal gratitide. For example, I can tell my family that I'm on a diet, then they'll immediately buy me unhealthy snacks, then they'll shout at me if I say I cant eat them. Eventually I'll give in and then later they'll make a comment like ""so I guess your not on a diet anymore"" followed by mockery. 

I'm also bisexual and trans, this comes with its own issues as they don't know, they would probably try to accept me but it would be difficult. My family is homophobic, they recoil in horror if they see anything remotely gay on TV, and if I ever mention anything I'm laughed at for being ""mr PC"". They do the same thing regarding racist remarks. 

My feelings are also often ignored, I cant name a time my family ever apologised to me. it is always my fault. For example, I was assulted several years ago, leaving me to develop PTSD and a fear of knives. My mum thought it would then be funny to hide her face and chase me with a knife to scare me in the middle of the night. I had a panic attack and afterwards I refused to talk to her for an hour or so until I calmed down. Instead my sisters and dad called me and berated me for ""ignoring my mum"" until I apolagised. My mum never said sorry, it was seen as MY fault for being upset. 

I also remember the time I attempted suicide. My family told everybody I knew, even though I asked it to be kept a secret, they left me nowhere to hide. In fact, no matter what it is, they will tell my secrets to everyone, I have no privacy. I've now taken to never mentioning anything personal.

All of this has left me too anxious to talk to my family, and make me hide who I am from them, because everything I tell them will probably make things worse. I don't know if there is a fix to this, but I dont want to cut contact. I know I've made them seen the worst, but these are the extreme cases I've mentioned. Often its a thousand very small things like this that build up until I cant take it. Honestly I don't think my family thinks there doing anything wrong, and 80% of the time we're almost normal. But thats only because I supress ALOT of how I feel because having g an opinion won't end well for me."
1030,I'm scared that I have schizophrenia but my mother wont let me get it checked out,"I've been wanting to go to a doctor for a long time not because of the possibility of schizophrenia but other reasons,but I've been showing some signs of schizophrenia and its getting me worried,I've told her I wanted to go to a doctor before for other reasons but now I asked her again since I'm worried of having schizophrenia,I didnt tell her why I wanted to go but I told her the same thing I did last time only because I was afraid that she was gonna call me crazy and not see me the same,even then she told me she didnt wanna go because of covid-19 now I dont know what to do,maybe it's my ocd but still I wanna get it checked out,I've only hallucinayed once with my eyes closed,the hallucination was a shape of a monitor and it was sorta vivid but not,I really wanna get it checked out so if I do have schizophrenia I can stop any further damage"
1031,How do you guys handle being scammed of money?,"I’m from a 3rd world country and I recently got scammed a fair amount of money. In our country they have their own Amazon type shipping or online buying where scam is nothing new and I got scammed. It has been a lesson for me since then. Anyone that got scammed money and got depressed, anxious etc? how did you handle it?"
1032,Locked Down At Christmas,"So, this is my first time posting on here... here goes-

So, I live in the UK, and Boris Johnson has just announced that over Christmas so many people won't be allowed to meet (and if we did it would only be allowed to be so many households), and yet my mother has told my nan (who was always in our bubble), that she cannot see us at christmas because she is seeing my uncle. 

Everytime I attempt to explain how she is allowed to see him (not that I completely agree with the christmas bubble, but oh-well), she gets really annoyed with me.

Context:
I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 16 years old (I am now 20). I was a self harmer, yet have been able not to have done so for over a year (even though, right now, that's all I want to do), and last year developed a slight alcohol dependency (which, again, I have been able to slightly control in recent months). My parents and I have never got on. When I found the courage to inform them of my mental health struggles, their response was ""well that makes us look like shit parents"", and ""well, if you want to slice yourself up and make you look really ugly for the rest of your life, go ahead... you're not going to have to be the one to clear up your body after you do it you selfish piece of shit"". I even dropped out of university to get my head straight (and 2years on it's getting there!), to which their response was ""god, now our sons even more of a disappointment"". Everytime I have an anxiety attack over the virus, they respond by telling me to ""shut the fuck up"", and to ""grow the fuck up"", yet when they're worried about the virus if anyone even mentions that they may be overreacting they begin to take that frustration out on me.

Anyway, my nan has been in our bubble all year, and hasn't really seen my uncle, so when the Prime Minister announced that limited households could meet she wanted to see her son and his kids. I get that (trust me, I wasn't happy about it, but I understood). But, she would have been the only one that was at my house for christmas (other than my parents and my overly subservient sibling - their golden daughter), and I know it is selfish, but I really want her here for christmas day. Just the day. So she can keep everything calm. She knows about my struggles, I am probably closer to her than I will ever be to my parents, because she actually cares and sees that her own daughter isn't a great mother to me. I don't know how I'm going to get through Christmas day with them (I know I've spent all year - whilst in lockdown - with them, but that was different. I was allowed to keep my distance, go outside, do some DIY. But christmas is different. I am going to have to spend the day with them; Christmas dinner for us goes on for a while, and them we all play games downstairs. I don't want to spend time with the people who made me want to kill myself. I don't want to spend what should be a happy and fun day, with people who make me feel like utter shit. I don't want to have to smile and pretend to be happy with them, when all I want to shout is ""FUCK YOU ALL"".

To make matters worse, my mother has informed my nan that after christmas (until mid-January) she cannot see us because she has seen my uncle. Please, tell me I am not alone in thinking that is just a childish rebuttal at her choosing to see her other child? I even mentioned how childish I thought she was being, and her response was ""fucking hell, you're annoying me now. Can you please just get out of this room and go somewhere else?""

Now look, I understand this year was always going to be hard, and I am more than happy to sit on my feelings of anger and hatred towards my parents, if it means keeping people safe so next year we can all go back to ""normal"", but they won't even take the vaccine (I said I would, to which they called me a ""stupid fucking sheep. You don't know what's in it. Idiot"". 

So what's the fucking point, aye? I wish I could just feel the knife against my skin again - or feel the bottle of Gin or Vodka burn in my throat. I'm not going to, but I really want to. 





Thanks for reading this (if you did), sorry if I rambled on for a bit... I just needed to get this all out, and off of my shoulders, because i am struggling and don't really know which way to turn (i don't want to burden any more friends with my issues, especially at this time of year)."
1033,Need to vent,"Where I live (Wales) has just been plunged into its third lockdown. With about 7 hours notice. 

It’s needed. I completely get it. But I’m struggling. I haven’t seen my boyfriend for weeks because his parents (we’re young, 16+17) wouldn’t let him see me until closer to Christmas to minimise risk. Now I can’t see him. 

I haven’t seen my friends properly since March and I went to a separate college to all of them. We made plans for Monday but now we can’t. 

These have literally been the only two things keeping me going. 

My counsellor got COVID so my online sessions that were already 3 weeks apart got cancelled and I don’t know when the next one will be. 

I feel so down and disappointed. Seeing my boyfriend and my friends were all that were keeping me going for now. I’m furloughed from my job again, I’m not sure when I’ll be back in college so I can’t get out and keep myself busy. 

It’s just too much at once :/. I just need to get it out."
1034,Do psychiatrists test you for all mental illnesses?,"My current diagnosis is ADHD with secondary anxiety/depression. Although my ADHD doc did mention that the depression could be an independent condition / comorbidity rather than a consequence of the ADHD.

My GF asked me recently whether my pdoc had ever considered the question of bipolar illness. She has noticed that when I'm having a bad day with my concentration that I'll be snappy and can have mood swings.

I think she is wrong (my mood swings are not that dramatic or frequently occurring) but it did make me wonder when, when we visit a psychiatrist or other mental health professional, they consider *all* the possible conditions that could give rise to those symptoms.

Like — if we don't tell them that we are worried about X condition ... could they arrive at that conclusion anyway? Is there any one size fits all questionnaire that they use that could diagnose everything from psychosis to anxiety to depression and everything in between?

Would just love to know how it works."
1035,How to deal with the world emotionally,"The past couple days have been increasingly difficult. My eyes have been open to the injustices of the world for a while now so I'm not even sure why now I find myself breaking down randomly. I see the dreams of the people closest to me slowly being crushed due to our careerist capitalist system. I myself actually started a new job that pays well, where I'm not just a tool of the state to create new weapons, but I now only feel worse. Almost shame that I, someone who is not special and who has not earned comfort, is now no longer in poverty. How do you guys deal with doing well yourself but surrounded by pain. How do you deal with seeing people freezing on the street having to beg for food. With only 1k in my bank and driving a car that barely runs I can't help these people much. I always do what I can but it's never enough. I'm not going to stop trying but I'm crippled by the pain of others around me. I live in a city in the us with the highest poverty rate, 40% of our children are in poverty. I'm only 21 so I have to push extremely hard for people around me to listen, and a lot of the time I have to push so hard that it breaks down the conversation of how to avoid being a tool to contributing to the system that keeps them down. Sometimes I feel like I can't do anything to help so I should selfishly take my own life. I try so hard but I find myself with no hope for the future. Our world is already doomed for destruction, the best we can do anymore is mitigation. The best I can do is put a mask on but that just isn't working anymore. How do I tell myself tomorrow is going to be better when I know for almost certain it won't be."
1036,everything feels completely meaningless but i still try to function,"what’s the point if we are all going to die anyway? i don’t understand why i should try to enjoy my life when nothing truly matters at all. i guess what i mean is that i don’t understand the “point” of life. i don’t really want to try anymore and most days i’m completely down and want to die - but yet i never tell the truth whenever someone asks me if i have suicidal thoughts because i don’t want to worry them

i’m planning on telling the people next appointment how i’ve been feeling -
properly and in detail this time - because last time all i said about the suicidal feelings were “no not really” which was a huge fat lie and i wish i could take it back now. i have so much to talk to them about and i just hope that i can find the words to tell them because i really really am struggling and i can’t really rely on anybody else when they have their own struggles 
and i just can’t deal with life anymore. i don’t want to be anywhere - if u get what i mean

i don’t want to be at school nor home - i just don’t want to be anywhere. if anything i just want to be dead. i hate living this. i am so miserable"
1037,Best course of action?,"I’ve been having issues in therapy. I have a strong sense of other people’s behaviors and I can tell my therapist is going through a lot, I believe this is hurting my own progress because naturally I attempt to try and help the other person and not burden them with my own problems. Should I seek other counsel or how should I handle this?"
1038,I want to help.,"Hi! Looking for some guidance...
I am someone who has experienced and/or dealt with lots of mental/emotional/physical illness/abuse whether it be myself or loved ones. 
After the year we have all had...I want to be a change. In the world. In people. In life.
I want people to know they aren’t alone (even though I always feel alone lol), I want people to know that there are people who care even if they don’t know you, and I want people to know that there is hope in the world...
What I’m looking to do is get involved. Not with a FB donation page, but by physically going out, meeting and speaking with people who have been through extremely tough events in life, who are survivors...and help. Give a hug. Share my love. Be there for whoever needs it.
So...I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on places near NY/NJ, that are allowing visitors, or any meetings/groups I can attend and give support, anything along these lines. I’d appreciate the help.
Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend. 
🧡"
1039,Going Crazy in Quarantine!!!,"Hello all,

I can’t believe I am back on Reddit.  I had actually left Reddit a few months ago (at least posting, more on that below).  I left because I don’t use social media, as a rule.  Years ago, Facebook a d Twitter did a number on my self esteem, so I deleted the a couple of years ago.  I want to distance myself from Reddit, and probably will soon, because it is just another form of social ,edit and a bad one at that.  I just feel like I don’t have anywhere else to vent this.  I am going crazy in quarantine!!!  Three life events occurred simultaneously to lead to a downward spiral that I am desperately trying to avoid.  1.  My wife and I had a child.  An amazing little boy, now a toddler, whom I love dearly.  2.  I got a DUI in early February (due to COVID the legal ramifications of this got pushed back by almost 9 months (my court disposition is finally happening this January).  3.  COVID.  I actually went to rehab at around March/April, so I left that rehab right as COVID was really getting bad.    


If I was dealing with any one of these things, I think I would be fine, but all THREE!!!  I got a call telling me that I got accepted for an online teaching job yesterday which is some good news.  (I know they don’t pay well.  My parents are helping support us financially till I get my feet back under me.

Having a job will help.  But I feel like I am going mad.  I don’t have social media, so I am isolated by not being able to go outside.  I do t want to go through the work of getting back on Facebook, etc.   resides I still think it is bad for me.  I am too embarrassed to email remaining friends and family because I am embarrassed about my DUI.  I kind of want to sweep it under the rug and not tell friends and family who do t need to know.  My wife doesn’t want me working a job outside the house.  Hence support from parents right now and online teaching job.  I feel that if I had a normal job I would at least interact with other human beings.  COVID has been a huge bitch.  Without it, I would be finishing probation by now and back to normal life.    


I feel myself falling back into unhealthy patterns, returning to a porn addiction I had actually distanced myself from and overcome for a few years.  Obviously I can’t drink, so there is at least that.  But porn has grown steadily worse and worse.  Even Reddit doesn’t help, as obviously there are porn groups here on Reddit.

i have a therapist, but I have never told him about my former porn addiction.  We just talk about self esteem a d stuff.  I feel like I am on the edge of an abyss and I can see how I could possibly fall.  My mental health is right up against the edge.  I feel like I could fall."
1040,Would like to chat. U.S.A. middle age,"My recent post from today

I am in the U.S A.

Over 45

Educated

I'm not disabled. I am versed in many areas of business including insurance.

People throw the disability card to middle aged people rather than respecting them and the fact that their health treatable with a living wage and health insurance 

Employers can pay living wages, but they want to give that to the younger people who may have parents or roommates to fall back on.

Has anyone in my age group been kept out of gainful income, entirely?"
1041,How do I support my boyfriend's mental health?,"My boyfriend (20) suffers from depression, anxiety and most likely something else. He recently has been retweeting and liking posts on twitter about how people say they support mental illness untill it is convenient for them. I fear that actions I have recently taken have led him to think this. We are both in our second university and he is not doing well, he has so far failed every assignment set and we have been speaking seriously about him dropping out. I fully support his dropping out if they what he want but I have expressed my thought that he should attempt to pass the second year before dropping out. The reason I say this is so that he will have earned a diploma in his degree, and this will give him so many options for other careers. I pushed him hard to finish our latest assignment and often remind him he has to eat, shower, brush his teeth, etc. I want to support his mental health in everyway I can and I don't want him to think poorly of me, so I guess my question is if I should lay off? Should I stop pushing and let him do thing by himself? Any advice is appreciated"
1042,I don't want to get better?,"I know I sound very insensitive and privileged since I know many people don't even have the opportunity to get better and take care of themselves but I just want to be very honest and get some insight on why I may be feeling this way. I apologize in advance. 

To put it short, whenever I get anxiety attacks and overwhelmed, I try to make it worse by not sleeping, starving and telling myself negative things. I look at myself in the mirror and tell myself how I should've ended it when I had the chance to and I bring up every event that hurt me in the past. I feel numb and nothing gets me smiling anymore. I starve myself for days and when people tell me they are willing to listen, I just talk badly about myself and ignore all their advices and help. I want everyone around me to know how much of a failure I am so they hate me and leave me. I want to push away everyone, remove any source of potential happiness away and drown myself into more negativity and keep crying. I feel satisfied feeling the emotional and physical pain I get by doing all this and I feel like I deserve it. I hate how I am not even willing to seek professional help because I often feel like there's nothing wrong with me and I shouldn't have any problems. 

It's getting to the point where it is interfering with my normal daily life. I try to purposely ruin any opportunity that I am given with. The thought of me being happy and being successful gets me feeling disgusted. I don't want to get better but sometimes it hurts too much and I want to know what is wrong with me.

Sorry I know I don't really make sense but I just wanted to let it out.."
1043,Im afraid of reading books,"Growing up I’ve had a deep attachment to reading and i found that i would form a connection with the characters that runs deep within me. Though with that came restless sleep, distractions from reality and many more consequences that manage to screw up me lifestyle and form unhealthy habits.

When i read a book, and a character really speaks out to me i start subconsciously doing all types of things as a way to keep me connected to them. I find myself dreaming about them, and getting restless at night, i would set unrealistic relationship standards ones that would ensure the person lives up to the character’s standard. I even try to take bits and pieces of their personality and integrate them into mine. I also tend to think about them almost all the time and that attachment scares the shit out of me.

That said, i stopped reading, and when i do i try reading it over long periods of time. But i will always have that part of me that just wants to stay in the fictional world a but that comes with consequence. 

I guess what im tryna ask is whats the reason behind this? Why am I severely attached to fictional characters, and why does it hurt me emotionally knowing that i have developed such a  connection with a fictional character? I mean im sure someone can relate, but does it consume you, and if it does do you feel shameful, scared even?"
1044,I can't stop eating. (Binge Eating Disorder),"The year I started college I developed a binge eating disorder. When I feel bad I consume extreme amounts of food very quickly, sometimes to the point of headaches and vomiting. It's extremely difficult to stop, if I had to describe it I would say it feels like I am trying to fill a bottomless hole with food. I went from being more on the underweight side to being obese within just 2 years. Yes, I am in therapy but for different mental health reasons that are more urgent so we haven't gotten to talk much about my eating problems with my therapist and even though I do of course plan to adress this, the next appointment isn't until January. I know it won't get better due to exams and deadlines coming up so I need advice on what to do when I get this urge."
1045,Alone.,"I don't even know what this is, whether it's a vent, a request for support. All I know is that I'm just so tired right now, and kinda considering the irony of my life. The fact that everyone's an introvert nowadays except for me, but even then, the introverts all have friends. And the extrovert can't even seem to keep one.

I was so happy with the little group I had managed to grow in my last year of school. For someone who's so seemingly dependent on social interaction, I'm pathetically bad with making new friends. And I know what everyone's expecting- the covid hit split us all up, school ended and we stopped talking, but no. That actually made us closer. With school ending we were all so equally lonely, I guess, that we talked almost every day- and whenever lockdown lifted we met up four times a week, every week.

And then university happened.

Of course, what pretty much everyone who's 18+ has experienced, happened. We all split off to different uni's, swore to stay in touch, and then the friendship died immediately.  We still talk, I guess, we still share a groupchat. We made a pact to call every week, just to catch up- but I mean, I don't really see much point in that anymore. Give it forty minutes and half the people have left, if they even showed up in the first place. It makes me feel so shit, it's just a weekly reminder of how little we care about eachother anymore. I realise how alone I really am.

I guess I wouldn't care so much if I managed to make new friends, too, but for the life of me I just... I don't know, I don't get the opportunity to talk to most, the few I do, I can't seem to cross that ""friendly acquaintance"" barrier.

What sucks the most is the person I guess I kinda thought of as my best friend is pretty much gone now too. She lasted longer, but I'm pretty sure that's just because I'm an emotional crutch, as the only person who will listen to her problems and respond with more than just ""F"". Or maybe because she had as much difficulty making new friends as me, at first. Either way, she pretty much only talks to me now to vent, or if she needs something. Haven't heard from her in  a week.

I guess I'm just not important enough to stay in contact with. I mean, I always knew I wasn't, I'm not going to lie and say I genuinely believed the crap she said about staying friends forever and living together when we're older. I've had three people spew that same story to me, and where are they now? But still, it's not like being proven right hurts any less. The best part is, though, I know she'll come back. She'll come back the second her relationship fails, or some family drama starts, or she gets a low grade on a test. She'll fall back on me, I'll help her get up, and she'll walk off again. Because that's what everyone else did. That's all I'm good for.

I know this is a stupid rant on a mental health sub. This is absolutely nothing compared to what any of you go through, I don't have the right to complain about anything at all. And tomorrow I'll wake up and see that I was overreacting to all of it. But right now, I'm alone. *Completely* alone, for the first time in years, and the one person I tried to vent to about this ghosted me, so I guess I'm posting it here instead. I'm sorry."
1046,I am the only one standing in my way,"Like many, many people, I had a pretty chaotic and dysfunctional upbringing. I was only child, my parents fought constantly and sometimes violently and my mother had a temper that scared me to no end.

In every other way, however, I was set up for success and my life has been filled with blessing after blessing, beginning with social skills and a strangely likeable personality, despite my own self hatred at times. 

It’s weird. I feel protected sometimes by an invisible force. I don’t believe in God but it’s almost eery to me how kind people are to me. It’s frankly unfair but it is nonetheless a blessing. I think maybe  I exude a certain vulnerability that begets kindness toward me? I sound manipulative. Perhaps I am. 

But maybe it’s not me. Sometimes I think it’s just luck. There have been a seemingly endless litany of kind, helpful and nurturing people in my life: friends, teachers, tennis partners, professors, bosses, therapists, doctors, boyfriends, coworkers, college deans, host families, even strangers ... My interactions with other humans have been, as a whole, almost *eerily* positive, despite my reluctance to accept that positivity. Still they keep trying. Perhaps this is why I am so idealistic. I’ve been blessed with good people in my life. 

I have been so depressed most of my life and yet I never struggled to attract friends, or partners or to endear myself to bosses, teachers or mentors. I have never felt unwanted by anyone except myself. 

Of course much of this is due to my privilege, being a relatively attractive, educated white woman. I hear and read so many stories, on Reddit and in real life, about the trials of others, who are unfairly and routinely mistreated and betrayed by their friends, partners, colleagues, colleges, bosses, by their communities and by their governments. 

I feel so grateful and almost flabbergasted by my blessing. I think through all of the important people people and connections I have made during my life and I can see how I have only ever been protected, encouraged, accommodated and, on the rare occasion I have been mistreated, I have been promptly apologized to. And I have broken so many rules, made so many mistakes, been reckless and naive and trusting, opening myself up over and over again to potential abuse, manipulation and betrayal. Yet somehow I have been spared! 

This is all quite strange for me to be saying. I have not felt lucky. Life itself has been quite difficult for me. I have been severely troubled and distressed and burnt out and self-loathing. But I suddenly realize that not once has it been because of other people. In the contrary. My biggest battle has always been been myself. And it has been constant."
1047,Depressed but sleeping well and eating normal.,Can you be depressed but not suffer any appetite or sleep changes? Just curious because I rarely have these symptoms when I feel depressed. But I do relate to most of the other symptoms like having suicidal thoughts.
1048,Can there be an underground tunnel built to my basement from a neighbour’s basement?,"I’ve been having terrible anxiety over this. My ex is apart of this 1% motorcycle club (gang) and my neighbour is also part of this gang. They are organized crime. He has claimed that they have accessed my house via an underground tunnel that is built to my basement from the neighbour’s basement.

I know it sounds unlikely, but who the hell knows with organized crime? 

I’ve checked my basement and don’t notice any cracks in the concrete or any openings but I still don’t know."
1049,I hate myself for obvious reasons that i create to hate myself to make it all in cycle,
1050,I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore.,"I obsessively look in the mirror- not out of insecurity, but because I don’t see myself anymore- I look like a stranger, like I see my face, but it doesn’t feel like I’m staring back- like I don’t recognise myself. And after all the shit my mum did this year, I bought her a gift and a card, but the gifts had no meaning- I thought of what she liked and that’s what I got her, but it felt like buying a present for a colleague- she feels like nothing to me anymore. I couldn’t even pick a card that had meaning- I couldn’t even bring myself to buy one that said ‘best mum’ because I know it’s a lie. I feel like my life’s just crumbling before my eyes, and I’m becoming more selfish. I can’t even pretend to see her as the best mum. The only thing I can pretend is to say I’m fine when she asks, smile, and just pretend everything’s fine. I just want to talk to someone, but I’m scared as soon as I tell them, I’ll be an attention seeker. I can’t be an attention seeker. I’m afraid. Why am I afraid. I don’t want to be scared to open up, I can’t even tell my friends who understand what my mother is like: the amount of times I’ve thought of killing myself, but after the first time, I’ve never once told anyone again. Because I was a pussy the first time. Some day old cuts and 3 paracetamol, because I thought they could help me. They didn’t. I just want to disappear. My life has amounted to nothing. Fuck all. I’m not talented. I’ve realised just how talentless I am. I’m a literal waste of space. I’m using the most generic phrase, but it’s true. I have nothing to give to the world or society, my dreams won’t happen, because I’m not smart enough. I’ll just be a disappointment. Probably a druggy if I’m lucky. I can’t air these concerns because nobody fucking cares. My whole fucking family think I’m mentally ill. Because of my mum. Saying I was faking things without knowing because she wants me to be perfect. Yet I still feel selfish saying that I won’t ever see her again- because she’s like every other mother in every other way, but she only believes what she wants. She probably doesn’t give a second thought about my mental health. I think about it every single fucking day, but that doesn’t matter to anyone but myself. She keeps telling my I seem better and more happy, yet I feel worse. So much worse. I just stopped telling her things. It took 3 years to learn from my dumb mistakes. Why couldn’t I have just kept quiet. But I’d didn’t and now I just ask god to kill me every night. Now I’m just a failure. A cutter. I don’t want to be here. I’m so ducked up. I think maybe I am mentally ill. I want her to die, yet I don’t. My feelings are everywhere, but nobody helps me. If this is how it’s going to be the rest of my life- I may as well spare everyone the hastle"
1051,Is Something wrong with Me?,"I (24F) don't know if this is the right place for it, but I really don't know where else to put this out to get opinions. I'm unsure if I should be seeking help or not.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I have depressive episodes since I was 13, I'm not too sure if you would call it depression. I usually just cry for hours during those depressive episodes even though I had no thoughts. Last year the depressive episodes got lesser and I'm having a better time managing it. There are some triggers here and there but nothing too serious, usually just cry through the night and I'm fine the next day. I only had 3 this year.
2. Ever since I was small, I've had some anger management issues. I'm aware of it and I've tried my best to keep my emotions in check and now, I don't usually get angry often. But when I do, I kind of just burst and even though I know it's wrong at the time and the matter is just something not worth getting angry over, I don't have control over it. My mind is telling me, ""stop, this isn't right"" but my body does otherwise. It was as if I was inside my mind, watching it happen through my eyes. I don't know if that make sense?
3. I used to have suicidal thoughts when I was 13 - 21. One of the worst one that I had was standing at my balcony one night when I was 20. I never went through it with it because I didn't want to die. I never had suicidal thoughts since then, but sometimes at night, my mind conjured up ways to die like I would plan out my own suicide (?). It sort of just played out in my head as if it will happen but I'm well aware that it's wrong. I don't know if this is relevant, but I've had dreams of jumping off building since I was in school and I would always wake up before I hit the ground. And for some odd reason, I have a strong feeling that I won't live to past 40 - 50. I don't know if it's because I can't see it happening but I have a strong feeling that it won't happen.
4. Sometimes, I feel that I completely cannot relate to a person or the reality of things, that some things just feel sort of not real to me. It's just that I wonder if this person is actually a person? I really don't think I'm making sense but it just make feel that something feel out of place? Like I don't think I'm having an out of body experience but my mind is just not there?

&amp;#x200B;

I can carry out daily tasks and communicate with people normally. I think I behave normally. And maybe all this is just because I'm just too self-aware that I'm just thinking too much about it. I'll elaborate more if needed to in the comments, if not needed, please share your thoughts."
1052,I’m scared of help,"I have depression and it’s been getting worse, to the point I’m scared of myself but I’m scared of help. I opened up to a teacher at school that I’m comfortable with and had to leave for the day and get a safety plan from my therapist. I felt like I got punished for opening up(I don’t like opening up I feel like I’m putting my problems on others) and now I’m even more scared of it. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m in a lose lose situation. Don’t get help and continue to get worse or get help and be scared because then I’m not even myself anymore and I have to relearn myself. 
I’m never know what to do. I’m worthless and I can’t do anything. Sorry for wasting you time."
1053,My cry for help,"I don't know where I'm going with this post but maybe I just want your experiences or opinions on it. Bit of background I'm a 17yr old male from the UK currently at college (if any of that makes a difference) 

I have always suffered from a multitude of mental health issues, depression, ptsd, anxiety and the list goes on, but I have had meny of these problems since I was a young child my earlest memories of my mental health was in Yr 1 or 2 (from UK BTW) when I was bullied, but what I'm trying to say is I've always suffered from it.

Over the years it has gotten better and worst but the older I get the harder life has become and the more I seem to struggle with it. In more recent years about 1 to 2 years ago my depression has worsened considerably with my worst being minor amounts of self harm and I had fully planned my suicide and was on the verg of going through, to less extremes of constantly feeling low and worthless with a lack of motivation towards life or my future. This resulted in me missing days at highschool that then brought attention to my mental health from the school, who tired to give me school counciling that long story short didn't last more than 2 sessions as the counciler got fired. 

The short period of counciling in high school was one of the most recent counling phases to say that I've been in. From a young age I had always been in on off counling through the NHS and primary school. But it never really went anywhere and was only ever for short periods. 

But cutting to the past year well more exactly October of last year (I was 16 at this time) , I ended up in hospital over night after a mental breakdown. After that it really put into perspective how ill I was and had been for aslong as I can rember and was feed up of feeling this way so I made a big personal step of seeking help. 

I first reached out for help in November of last year, after a couple gp vists and discussion of anti depression medication that I was keen on the idea of we decided I should try and get counling properly. I then reached out to a counciling service locally who I then went in for an initial session but then never herd back from about starting. So then I went to another counling service. This would of been about this time last year and I was told there was a waiting list that I fully expected and understood but it's been over a year and I'm still yet to receive any help and during this time I've maybe had 4 or 5 calls to bascily confirm that I'm still not well and still want to be on the list for help. This also wouldn't all be as bad if I wasn't giving a waiting list time of 3 months and being classed as a ""priority"" case that apperntly means I get short listed because of my current mental state. 

But still a year later and I'm yet to receive any help and like I'm sure you all wull understand I have good days and bad days good weeks and bad weeks but on general life's not going great and I've turned to some unhealthy habits to try copping with life, like drinking more than I should or when I've had a bad day, I've shut off all contact with old friends and become very introverted and just genraly I've noticed I'm falling down a rabbit hole with no help in sight. 

To be completely honsten I'm losing hope, I think I'm to far gone, I have so much wrong in my head and I have a crappy family life that adds onto it all. I'm really losing hope, I'm thinking about doing terrible things to myself as a cry for help as the only people who seem to get help are they ones who cry the loudest and as someone who doesn't cry out for help (apart from trying to get counling) it really feels like I'm being ignored. I've tired going back to my gp and he says because I'm on waiting lists for counling he can't do anything and unless I do something to get submitted to the mental health hospital I really don't know what to do. 

I guess this is my cry for help. Before I do something I know I'll regret."
1054,kinda my own fault,"hey, I am a 17 year old in a highschool. And oof i hate the position i am in. allright this going to be something. I am a former speed user i was intoxicated 5 times a week for like 7 months. I talked about it to a teacher and of course he said to my friends that they should tell my parents. I get that he did that butt I is still feel a little bit betrayed. So the school called my parents they told my parents that i only did drugs twice a month. When i came home i didn't get punished butt they where quiet clear that when i turn 18. i needed to leave their house. Allright i get it. So i don't like it at home. And at school isn't much beter i still have classes from that teacher and i don't know how to react to him. I am having what i would think you would call aniexity attacks. And if you thought this story would end here owm no sis i wish. A friend was raped by an other student on a school trip and instead of helping her the school tried to preassure her into dropping the case. And i want to support her en stuff butt i am so tired. And i know that i just have 175 days left until i have the results of my final exames. butt still that is quiet a lot if everyday feels a little bit more like hell. And i just wanna do 2 things walk up to the principal and ask what are you doing ? what is wrong with you? And the second thing is that i just wanna walk up to an adminastrator and ask what do i need to do to get an external suspencion ? so that i just can go home and sleep. what would you guy's do? and i know i dont have it as bad you guys butt i am just so tired mate."
1055,Don't want to be a woman,"This text may be difficult to read and process, so please be aware. 
Since I was a kid, I realized I don't want to be me, and this later transformed into 'I don't want to be a woman', which happened probably after my first period when I was 12. The thought has been buzzing in my head constantly, getting louder or calmer at times, although it has never left me. Now I'm 21 and still not over the fact that I'm a woman, not able to accept myself. I feel ashamed for being a woman, particularly for the physical processes like menstruation. I feel it is unfair, uncomfortable, embarassing and I don't want to deal with it. There were even times I was considering having a hysterectomy. I don't know how to deal with this and feel like crap every month. I am seeing a psychologist, but still having issues.
Have someome dealt with this problem? How do I start accepting myself or maybe even loving?
Thank you for your time and attention"
1056,Why the hell do I miss my abusive friend?," cut ties in march after nearly 3 years of manipulation, attention-seeking and more. And now I cant stop thinking about the not so bad parts, and i realised that I didnt really hate the drama that much. It was horrible and caused me so much stress but the drama was appealing somehow. 

I dont even know what's keeping me from contacting them."
1057,"I was inches from committing suicide 6 months ago, today I signed a lease for the nicest apartments in my city. Hang in there.","Long story short, over the summer I was planning on driving my car over the edge of a cliff after I dropped some people off on vacation. I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all. Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn’t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I’d get something, sometimes I’d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low.

I made some changes that started with therapy. After that, I got a lucrative new sales job, love the people I work with, practice Muay Thai weekly, work out every day, and am in a much better place mentally. 

If you think this post is about me rooting my own horn... You’re right. I’m damn proud of the progress I’ve made. Whatever it is you’re going through, keep fighting. Keep waking up every day. Keep on keeping on."
1058,I am sick of my mom.,"My mom isn't an ""abuser"" in my eyes. Though she acts like it. SOMETIMES, she will push me. Most times, she will verbally abuse me. I'm sick of it. And she doesn't even realize it. I think I'm about to go confront her, because I'm done with it."
1059,feeling stuck,"Every day I wake up in the evening because I go to sleep in the morning. My sleep schedule is so messed up and I just can't seem to fix it because every time I manage to wake up at an earlier time, at that moment I subconsciously tell myself to go back to sleep because there is no point in waking up and the vicious cycle starts again. I just feel horrible and every day I barely do anything but binge-watch Netflix and avoid thinking about my life, I eat and go back to sleep. Even showering seems like such a hard thing to do and all I want to do is to lay down and not move. I don't have the mood to talk to my friends either and I constantly reply to texts late even though I've already seen it earlier from my notifications. When I laugh after a funny joke in shows or videos I somehow have to immediately frown again because it was so tiring to keep smiling. I just feel like I'm so lazy and I bet that's what everyone around me thinks as well. I have so many recordings of online classes I have yet to rewatch because I slept through all of my classes. I also feel like I'm always going to cry and it'll be over the smallest things. I've also been avoiding social media because I hate seeing stories and posts about the lives of my friends. I absolutely hate it and it always makes me nervous when I open the apps because I might see something that triggers my bad emotions again. I guess I'm also just jealous that they're all happy and can seem to function normally while I can't. They're all out and about and I always criticize them in my mind thinking, we're under a restricted movement order so why is everyone out of their homes going to malls and crowded places? I'm not really sure what's wrong with me but what I've stated above are just a few of my struggles right now."
1060,What does disasociating feel like for you?,Whenever i get too overwhelmed or too anxious i shut down and zone off. I could be hysterically sobbing one minute to staring at the wall feeling numb and like I'm not in my body. I have PTSD and if someome yells at me or and whenever i get a flashback this happens to me..is this what disassociating feels like?
1061,"At my lowest I’ve been in awhile, don’t know what else to do anymore to be honest.","Well for starters let’s just throw what’s all wrong with me out there an go from there, I suffer from two eating disorders, have ups and down of suicide / suicidal thoughts (high rn) I’ve tried harming myself numerous amounts of times. I suffer from bad depression and anxiety that correlates into really bad stress. I’m Also suffering from when I was raped in middle school and the emotional abuse that followed it now many years later. I constantly overthink every situation because my mind or whatever voice tells me otherwise and makes me highly paranoid and skeptical about every situation good or bad. I don’t trust anyone really, I have a really bad problem with trusting people. I’m constantly paranoid all the time. I used to not sleep, the only thing that would help me sleep was weed, but I’ve recently given up on that for the 3rd time now. Probably going to be for good this time but I’m still having issues with that. I tend to use alcohol to solve my problems every other night or so. I know addiction runs within my family considering how they are and also mental illness. 

I’ve mentioned to my therapist about my issues and especially the sleep issues, I would say about a month ago I had a hallucination episode because of my lack of sleep. I saw many of figures in my room and was terrified because I knew they weren’t real. On top of that I had other issues involving sleep issues such as horrific dreams and sleep paralysis. 

I do go to therapy but recently we haven’t really talked about any of my problems more about just breathing. I’ve canceled appointments because of my own problems. 

As of last night of breaking down to my mom she convinced me to pack a back and go stay with my sister two hours away for two days and to quit my job on spot after saying I’ll work. I did quit and didn’t even go to my sisters because it was late and now I’m just in a dark hole. I’m just so lost right now and don’t know what to do really. I know it’s not the end of the world because I have a new job coming up here but I’ve never done anything like that. Plus I’m also a college student with 3 degrees, one major and two minors. I am studying public health administration and getting into epidemiology or just anything health related. Considering the pandemic right now that job market is going to explode so I should be able to have a career if I keep my school work together. 

I’m just rambling at this point sorry if this message is confusing but my head is completely all scattered and I’m at my lowest once again. I do not wish to die but just simply not exist for a little bit I guess Idek it’s hard to depict what I’m even trying to get at. I guess I’m just using this post to get some stuff off of my mind. Whoever reads this sorry if it’s confusing or whatever just someone to talk to would be nice. I don’t have any friends anymore besides my boyfriend and 1 or 2 friends maybe but I’ve just harped it all on them too much an outside opinion may help :/"
1062,tw // suicide,"it's weird to thing that i've reached the point where my only place to vent is reddit. but i guess that's fitting considering i wanna vent about the fact that i'm alone. 

i'm a very depressed teenager (15M). i have no irl friends, and because of covid, i'm unable to go visit my online friends like i do every summer. i feel alone. i have lost all of my friends this year, my boyfriend of two years broke up with me earlier this year and that left me with only three people that i can rely on. 

i struggle with social anxiety which makes it very hard for me to actually get close to anyone, si i haven't been able to meet new people. that leaves me with my two best friends and my ex (we decided to remain friends and we're pretty close). but even if i have the three of them in my life, and i'm very grateful, i haven't been able to reach out to anyone. one of my best friends doesn't have their phone, their parents took it away and we can barely interact on twitter sometimes. my ex and i, even if we remain close, we don't talk that often anymore. when we do talk, it's mostly about what's going on in his life and i never get to do the same.  

as for my other best friend, she's who i'm closer with. i love her with all my heart, and would do anything for her. she's the one that's been there for me for the past four years, and i've been there for her as well. normally i would reach out to her without even thinking it twice, but she's not doing okay and she told me she needs a ""break"" so we have barely interacted in the past week. that leaves me with no one to reach out to. and i don't wanna sound entitled because i understand that she needs time, and i just want her to be okay so i'm trying to stay away as much as i can in order to give her the space she needs, but i still feel alone.

i'm going through a bad depressive episode. i feel like shit constantly, i've had who knows how many anxiety attacks just in the past few days, i have no motivation to do anything at all, i'm overall just... so tired. i can't distract myself with anything, i always end up  thinking about all the friends i lost this year, and how i wont be able to see the ones i have left irl because of the pandemic. that always spirals into suicidal thoughts. i feel worthless, i feel like i'm only a burden to my friends and i'm scared of them getting tired of me and leaving, but at the same time i Know they would be better of without me, and if i just killed myself they wouldn't have to deal with me and i would stop hurting. i also have been dealing with a lot of gender dysphoria. i hate my body, i feel like i'm never gonna be masculine enough, i wanna rip my skin off and die. it's all messing with my head, i feel trapped and i don't know what to do anymore. 

i feel so lonely and desperate, i can't stop thinking that no one cares about me and that if i died no one would actually notice. i miss my friends so much. i wish i could reach out to them, or at least just have a casual conversation with them. i miss my best friend the most, i wanna hug her so bad but i don't know when i'll be able to. i'm scared that maybe she only got tired of me and ""taking a break"" is only an excuse to stop talking to me. i need her, i know it's not healthy but she's the person i trust the most, and she makes me overall so happy, i'm truly terrified of her hating me and dumping me. i really don't know what to do anymore. i'm exhausted and can't stop thinking about ending it. i wanna reach out to someone but i can't. i'm so so so tired.

i'm tired of feeling this."
1063,Not happy for months... Thinking about vanish...,"I see all those who i thought were my friends having fun outside. I'm not happy since ???July? Or more. I have zero motivation to continue my life. I dont want to die, i want to reset my life. 

What a life means if you don't have friends or even social life? They having fun while you lookin them through the screen of your phone. They forgot you and will forget you forever. Because you are an object for the people and will use you in their own benefits. I hate that. Is like im nobody for the world. The lonely starting consuming me and every night, specially in the weekend, it gets harder and harder. Is very difficult to carry with all that because you dont tell any of this to anyone. Then, you feel alone. Then, you realize you are nobody. Struggle to deal with It. Fuck everybody. Fuck all those fake friends. 
I hoped sadness could change me and became a strong man without need somebody but no, it didn't happen and im weaker than never. 

Every """"""""friend"""""""" photo having fun feels like a knife going through your heart very very slow, because you remember all the good time both lived, all that fake words like ""we're friends forever"", ""i will support you forever in every reason"". MY HEART HURTS!!

I started having suicidal thoughts a few months ago. Empathizing with it. Thinking about what would happen if i commit suicide. I cant handle this much more... Im running out of energy. 

No one asked if im okay this year. No one said ""Hey Fran, are you okay?"". I'm crying while im writting this. Seriously, i think i have a big mental problem. 


I confess: at the end of the day, i know i will end my life someday."
1064,I cannot forgive my brother. Our relationship is dead. I have to sever ties with him.,"For the last three years, I’ve watched my world unravel and witness my brother try to clean up his act with his drug addiction, and fail spectacularly each and every time. He uses and manipulates us for his own personal gain, and when he realizes that he can’t keep up his act of being high every day, he wastes my parent’s money by going to rehab to only relapse after a few months. I watched him slowly kill himself with drugs from June-October and it took such a terrible toll on me mentally that I almost got admitted into a mental hospital and had a psychotic breakdown. 

He went to rehab in late October for the fourth time in three years, and I’ve given up hope that he will ever change his act. Every time I’ve had high hopes that he’s going to stay sober and it’s the last time that he will be in rehab, and we’ll never have to deal with this ever again. But now, I just don’t care anymore. I’ve given up this fantasy that he’s going to stay sober, because in all honesty, he’s going to go back on drugs in the next few months. He won’t be able to maintain a job, because he chooses the most high stress jobs possible (nursing) and within two weeks of having that job he goes on drugs because it’s too stressful for him. The only difference this time is that he won’t be living at home and i won’t be seeing him anymore.

I just have lost so much respect, love, and trust for my brother. I didn’t even bother getting him any Christmas presents this year, because he doesn’t deserve anything. He’ll just break it or sell it for drugs when he inevitably relapses, just like he does with all of the gifts I given him. I haven’t talked to him at all since he went to rehab, because I don’t want to speak to him anymore, once he get’s his phone back I won’t pick up to any phone calls or messages he sends me, I blocked his number and all of his social media accounts. I already told my parents I’m not speaking to him when he calls on Christmas. I still regret even giving him the limp hug I gave him when he left for rehab again. I wish I never even hugged him, I wish I did what I wanted to do and just socked him in his face like he deserves. 

I will never forgive my brother for what he did, or has done to me. I’ve tried forgiving him in the past, and after a week or so I have. It’s been a month and a half and I still have not even considered forgiveness. I’ve been getting guilt tripped by my family into forgiving him, but it won’t work. He doesn’t deserve forgiveness, and it’s a joke that my family is giving him another chance. 

I’ve considered severing ties with him in the past, and this is the nail in the coffin. Our relationship is beyond repair, and it’s his fault. I’ve given him so many chances, forgiven him so many times, and I can’t do this anymore. He’s hurt me too many times, intentionally and unintentionally, and I’m not putting anymore energy into salvaging our relationship. I don’t care how much I mean to him anymore, if I’m the reason he’s still alive, it doesn’t mean anything to me anymore."
1065,Can’t focus on goals,"Hey guys, I can’t focus on my goals or what makes me happy because I’m always preoccupied with the negative aspects of my life. My intrusive thoughts, what mental illness I may have and how to fix it. Etc, meanwhile life is passing me by."
1066,Why am I still hung up over this?,"I won't get into much detail, because it's a long story.

But basically, I'm a senior in high school.

Last year, this kid was a huge jerk to me. And this year, I got revenge by slandering him brutally, writing lies about him being a rapist and a child molester and what not.

Despite carrying out this brutal revenge, I still feel hung on him and his original offenses.

How come, despite doing much worse than him, I am still hung up on him and what he did to me first? Aren't I supposed to feel better about the situation?"
1067,How to work on my feelings of resentment?,"I’ve been angry and resentful for a few years now, I’m resentful because my parents were unjust to me. Angry because my brother died even though it’s been 10 years. Angry because I can’t do well in my classes. I can’t go to a therapist -though thinking of taking an ssri- so I have to work through it by myself, I want some steps that I can take whenever I feel spiraling into my resentment mood 
And if you have any success stories about resentment/anger/anxiety because of a medication, please share them with me"
1068,"Is it unreasonable for an adolescent to seek therapy, despite not necessarily having a diagnosed disorder?","I’m 16 and struggling with mental health. I have no idea what EXACTLY is wrong in a clinical sense, but there is definitely an issue. I think therapy would be a really helpful option but I have never heard of a teenager going to therapy without a diagnosis of a more severe disorder (depression, PTSD). That’s not to say there is no possibility that I have something wrong in a clinical sense. I do think its possible that if I did see a professional it would possibly warrant a diagnosis of some kind, but in the case that doesn’t happen, is it unreasonable for a teenager to want therapy without something intrinsically wrong in a clinical sense?"
1069,I'm retiring in Mexico with my family at 25. Bye USA and New York City.,"It all started in 2016 when I touched weed. That's when it went even more downhill. Anyway, I don't actually care about prospering, I assume for what the masses want. I am just a human, living, uninterestingly. I don't have drive, I don't care about getting rich and famous, it's all pointless, as life for me is just being sick all the time. As the years go by my sicknesses just keep getting worse or I develop new sicknesses. 

If I spend one more second in this living situation, I will not freak out because that will just send me to the psych ward a second time. I can't freak out! Everyone thinks I'm crazy from a first glance. But I'm not. I know what it's like in Mexico after I met all of my family. It's fucking relaxing, and I will no longer suffer, in a so called ""on top of the world city"" that just makes me feel worse because I will never prosper in such a city. It's not sad. I'm sick and I need to push my self away from all this madness and COVID and this hell. So long suckers."

1071,Can't get myself to draw.,"Hi, I'm not sure what sub to put this in so I'll try it here since I think my problem is mental health related. So I really struggle to get myself to draw, I'm really talented (I have a never ending list of compliments, dropped jaws, etc. From people seeing my work ever since I was little), but despite that I can hardly get myself to draw at all anymore (even though I really want to), and when I do, I don't seem to do very well (some of that is probably that I need practice, and also being overly critical to the point I think I can't do it and so I don't try) or find it too hard to try my best because it I just can't seem to kick things into gear in my head, or am just too hard on myself or hold myself up to too high of a standard, or something. Like, as soon as I sense any sort of challenge, I shut down, despite probably being capable enough or that I can simply get better at it by practice and learning, but I can hardly get myself to do that. Anyways, I've been diagnosed with major depression, Cptsd, ADHD, and GAD. I also grew in a bad home, bad parents, abuse, neglect, etc. I think I'm really hard on myself, overly critical, but also my mental health issues make it so much goddamn harder, I love drawing, I love lots of things, but these things have made doing them, especially to my best ability, what feels like nigh impossible now. I'm getting treatment, and while the meds seem to help a bit, etc. Yeah, I'm just gonna leave it at that."
1072,Not satisfied with life.,"I’m not satisfied with my life. (20 - Male)

- I’m in a good career and enjoy working despite the stress that it brings. I get on with my colleagues etc. 

- Never been in a relationship, but don’t have much time / energy to seek one. I don’t do anything social in the ‘real’ world. I live in a small town so it’s hard to get out. 

- Have a good circle of friends, we don’t meet in person but we play games online daily as they are at University.

- Don’t have any long term goals. I live for short time enjoyment. 

- I’ve been depressed in the past but not in the last year, I still wouldn’t consider myself ‘happy’ though. I also get very little sleep, which is a huge drain to my energy. I’ve got something called delayed sleep phase disorder, no matter what I do I can only sleep between around 04:00 - 16:00. I have to get up at 7 to work. I’m not suicidal and don’t do self harm or anything like that, I’m just.. dissatisfied. 

I don’t know what to do."
1073,My dad is in the hospital and I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack.,"This hasn't been a good month. My grandmother had heart surgery, then a stroke, then a few days later another stroke. She's okay (relatively speaking) now, and recovering at home, but it took a lot out of the family. Today I got a phone call from my dad telling me he thought he was also having a stroke. I took him to the hospital but it's almost impossible to get things done timely because of how overbooked hospitals are right now. I feel like I can't take all of this. It's also stressing me out because I am a disabled veteran and live with my dad, and the thought of losing him is already bad enough, but if something does happen, I am homeless. Not only that, but I can't even go into the hospital to see him due to COVID-19 restrictions. I feel like I'm about to break in half. I feel helpless. The time for clot busters has passed since it was about three hours ago, he still hasn't had anything done. Feels like I'm short of breath and my heart is pounding."
1074,How do I stop ruminating?,"How do I stop ruminating? I keep thinking about individual and how our interactions went. There are a lot of unanswered questions that will never be resolved because the other individual wants nothing to do with me.

1077,Help!!!,I am at the brink of let my self go. I am tired of my life. I live a horrible life because my parents mentally torture me by yelling at me constantly and threten to kick me out of the house for stupid reasons.

1078,I Think This Is It,"I literally can't stand to live at my House anymore. Noises are bothering me so much. I have Mental/Physical Health issues that make it hard to Work at the Moment.

1081,My memories don't feel like mine,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here but I don't really know where else to post this. Anyway I've noticed in the past yearish or so all my old memories are fading and the ones I do have don't even feel like me. I feel like a spectator in someone else's body to the point where I can't connect feelings to those moments. The same goes with memories as soon as like 1-3 years ago and memories with other people, I just don't feel a connection with myself and what happened in the moment. It worries me especially with other people because there will be a moment we had together that I have no emotional connection to it's just like it happened and went on. If I see a picture or moment I don't feel like I ever experienced it, like I know cognitively I was there I wouldn't have these memories if I wasn't but I can't feel anything about them I don't really know how to explain it. Same goes with friendships, I know I should have this connection with them and I have memories with these people yet when I'm with them I can't seem to find what I'm supposed to feel giving a really bad habit of just forgetting that they exist and I have to stay in contact all together. I already know I have pretty bad general anxiety and social anxiety but this I've only started to notice recently. I've tried googling it but nothing really comes up so that's why I'm posting here, I don't really know what to do"
1082,Mothers attitude exhausting me,"I (22F) have been through a lot this year, more than anyone can imagine and trauma I don't want to share because I am not comfortable sharing it yet. That and then straight into lockdowns. 

My mother who's obviously depressed as fuck and won't do anything about it (I have begged), is driving me insane to the point I'm questioning whether I am even happy being in my family. She hasn't been sleeping in the same bed as my father for about a year now, they argue all the time, and I literally can see why because my mum's just so negative and will go nuts 100% to anything. 

She's vulnerable with her COPD and won't let you forget it, she expects us to do every single thing for her and if we don't', were disgusting, horrible people. She won't leave the house and uses the shielding as an excuse, but she'll also sneak to the shop to buy and hide whiskey in her room. I'm so over it. 

She bitches about every single thing; the next door's doing something - slags them off to me, Co-worker (Who was a close family friend at one point) does something (She works online)- Calls them horrible shit to me. These could be things that shes hyper-analysed. I'll come up to her to hang out for a bit, but all she'll do is read something depressing off the news and then complain if I seem 'not to care'.

I'm on medication for my trauma, and I started specialist therapy. I am home from Uni, and we have just gone into another lockdown. I really don't know how I'm going to cope anymore. I really love my mum and feel so sorry for her, but it's all emotionally draining with her, and I'm starting to avoid her whenever I can. 

Tonight she was complaining about how she's treated like shit at work, and I said very kindly, I'm sorry you're experiencing that but other than doing something about it, you're just going to make yourself ill. Suddenly I'm a shit person, and all I want to talk about is me. I didn't even reply because I'm so exhausted from her, she carried on making me feel like shit, and then I told her to stop and google emotional incest, and I left the room. 

She came downstairs after googling it and had a go again saying that it's for children and I'm 22 years old and I should listen if I want to get treated like an adult. 

Honestly, if this is what adulting is all about then fuck this. 

I wish she'd reach out to other people and not rely on offloading everything on to me. She knows about my year, and what I'm going through, I wish she'd talk to dad about it, but I know it's because he offers solutions she doesn't like, and all she wants to do is bitch. 

Sorry for the rant. I needed to get my head together. 

Can someone suggest ways I can go about in trying to encourage her to get help? Like she's the same with my dad, and I honestly fear one-day I'm going to wake up to the news that he's topped himself."
1083,Why is my depression so bad?,"I am 27 and have been dealing with extreme depression for the last couple of years. I am a military veteran and a survivor of child abuse, so I suffer from diagnosed PTSD. I hadn’t always been a depressed person, actually quite the opposite. But as of lately, my depression has only gotten worse. 

I am currently in a JD/MBA program in NYC and I have been feeling like I’ve been going crazy since I started my program. My wife and I recently had our first child, but I haven’t even been able to enjoy him because I am literally glued to my bed and sunken in despair. 

I have gotten therapy every Friday since May, but it hasn’t helped tremendously. I have used drugs in the past recreationally, and that would usually make me feel at peace with myself and the world, but now whenever I try them, they either make me feel worse or do nothing at all. I feel like I have tried everything at this point; I meditate everyday, I read the entire Bible, I read other spiritual texts to find a silver lining to my situation, I exercise 3-4 times a week, nothing is working and it’s just scaring the hell out of me. I recently have been so depressed that it is driving my wife away from me because she has been trying to comfort me during this time and it has just been exhausting for her, especially with our kid in the picture. 

I feel like most of this feeling is from being estranged from my parents as well as the mental exhaustion from my school program. I am not interested in rekindling a relationship with them because every time I talk to them, they tell me how I’m a horrible person and how they didn’t abuse me as a child. I honestly just want to graduate so I can provide from my family and not feel like this worthless slump that is bringing everyone down. Does anyone have any tips?"
1084,breakdown," 

The lights were so bright raining down on me with the intensity of a tornado. Seth struggled to make conversation with me while I alternated between sitting and standing in my hospital bed. I associated everyone with someone. The nusrse was my second mom, Tina, Everything is fuzzy but I remember test after test and the confusion of all the wires and and why I couldn’t go to the bathroom without supervision. Seth was in the middle of fraternity duties and some finals so as a distraction he let me watch Lois CK on his laptop. Louis was talking to me directly he spoke through the laptop, jumping off the screen it was live and I was his focus. Everything pertained to me. As I went rolling from the waiting room to the room in a wheel chair I heard “think about her Grandmother”, What about her Grandmother” “she died and your selfish”. Waiting in the chaos I had no concept of what I was doing there. For me I was higher than the stars. Well, to be accurate, I ran the gammit of emotions. Myhirled like an eddy, epihany after epiphany. I was on top of the world yet so low at the same time.  

Then a shot and I was out. I woke up alone in a cold dark room and suddenly the highs had all dissolved into lows. Where was I? What did I do wrond?"
1085,I have to call but I’m just so scared,"I’m scared but I’m also tired of suffering

(18f) I’ve had a really awful couple of months. Along with GAD, I have an extreme case of emetophobia (fear of vomiting) thats been a part of my life for as long as i can remember but recently has become completely debilitating. I had an incident 2 months ago where i woke up and had a panic attack that caused me to dry heave. Since then I’ve been nauseous every day with no breaks, which is torture because of the phobia. I never see my friends, my relationship fell apart, i can’t eat more than oatmeal, crackers, and peanut butter, and can barely make myself shower once a week. I’ve been having ~2 panic attacks a day and and I’m so tired. The sick feeling is never the same as the day before and I’m constantly terrified. It’s not a physical problem, as I’ve done multiple tests and my GI system is healthy. I’ve been trying new anxiety and panic meds which do nothing, zofran (antiemetic meant for chemo patients) only works about half the time. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve never felt closer to suicide than i do right now but i don’t really want to die i just need this feeling to end. I’m supposed to start a partial hospitalization program soon but it’s 10 weeks away and it doesn’t feel like enough. I haven’t really told my therapist about the suicidal idealation because i live with my parents and don’t want them to hear. After doing some research i found that the program i found for php also has a residential program for ocd/anxiety thats well regarded and is usually successful. I think it could help me but I’m scared to have to call and tell the nurse that i think i need more care. I’m also scared of having to face all of this shit and I’m scared of going through treatment just to have things stay the same. Any advice or words of encouragement are appreciated. 

tdlr: i have severe emetophobia, was supposed to start an outpatient program but i am suicidal idealation-y and i think i need residential care but I’m scared to call."
1086,Is This Seasonal Depression/Anxiety? And Has Anyone Ever Gone Through Something Similar?,"Hey guys! First time posting here on this sub and I hope to get some proper motivation and takeaways from any possible responses.

So, to make a long story short, I received my first major panic attack last week. On Wednesday night. Never had one. Felt immensely great before that, enjoying my year as troubling as it was due to the current scene. What I thought to be a heart attack, since it was on the left side of the chest and arm, was actually not that. After the ER ran numerous tests that is, and found no blockage of the heart or anything to signify a heart issue. Healthy. After that, that very same night I went back home and felt great. Relieved. Slept well. Only to then feel continuous anxiety throughout the day. Went back to the ER, felt instantly better after speaking to a nurse. Seems like all I needed was to vent all the stuff I've gone through my life up until that point. Nothing traumatic. Except a very stressful family life.

The day after, I went to speak to a therapist. And since then, my path towards recovery has begun. Since the weekend that passed, a few days ago, I have felt better by the day with my anxiety. It was faintly there until I no longer feel it completely. Not a single hint of heaviness in the chest or fear. Nada. Which in hindsight, is a very good thing. 

Only it's now replaced with an apathetic feeling sometimes. Which is weirdly as unfortunate. Since Wednesday, I have been feeling really bored, tired and empty. I've noticed I feel way better during the morning times but after the sun goes down, I feel iffy. And at night? Bleh. But again, ""sometimes"". Thursday and yesterday, the Friday? I felt the same but just a tiny bit. Only for it to vanish when I was at work and I felt really damn good. As well as earlier today. Now, it could be due to yesterday night's beverage of a Gatorade ending in a night of barely any sleep but at the moment, I went from feeling glad to down to glad again only to feel down or apathetic. It sucks. But it could be just me being exhausted.

I've also been taking medication for my anxiety that the therapist said doesn't seem like I need but gave the option nevertheless for. I accepted it just in case. And I just started taking it yesterday. It's Zoloft to be exact. Although I have felt good without it, I said: ""Fuck it, why not try to see if it works""?

So, I ask, is this normal? Has it happened to anyone else? For my anxiety to slowly disappear only to turn into apathy or a mild depressive feeling? Could it be due to my body distressing itself and kinda returning back to the motions? During the winter time, years beforehand, I vaguely remember feeling somewhat less energetic compared to other seasons but I still enjoyed my hobbies. it seems it really hit me this year because now I don't even enjoy games. And is it because of well, the winter time? Or the meds, perhaps as a side effect? Sorry for asking so many questions. This is a new experience for me so anything helps! Thank you!"
1087,I enjoy being alone,"A few months ago I was desperate to have friends and cling to the ones I already have. I was so scared to be lonely. If ever I didn’t have plans on a Friday night I felt like a failure and would instantly badly of myself. It’s as if I was seeking validation from others. 

Now I enjoy my own company and I have realized that I don’t need anyone. Friends are nice to have but I absolutely don’t need them because I can so much fun on my own. It took me a whole pandemic and a national lockdown to finally make peace with my own company and truly love spending alone time."
1088,my story," 

Crawling on my hands and knees around the aprtment looking for my cat. It was 8am, I had been up all night and I knew something was wrong. I felt disconnected, like I was outside of myself looking in. I called into work, they called me in anyway. At work everything was a blur, I apparently shredded a bunch of papers and threw a clipboard. I was sent home. Two to three days later With no sleep and no contact with my family and friends, people grew concerned. My friend came to check on me and quickly called my brother to drive up from richmond. I hadn’t eaten, the apartment was trashed and I had burried my phone in box so the government couldn’t track me. I was taken to the ER and after observation and a shot of Haldol, taken to a nearby hospital in Maryland. I stayed for two weeks and slowly came out of psychosis. I was fired and the depression that followed was crippling. I lost myself completely, I couldn’t eat without feeling like the motions were foreign. I walked differently, stiff with a shuffle. I talked in a monotone dribble. I was numb, void of personality. I was miserable.  

That was my first psychotic break. After that I came home to live with my parents. I got a job, worked for two years, things were ok but that vital piece of myself was missing. I was hollow. No emotion flat and I knew things would never be the same. I had my second break I was up for days with racing thoughts and I decided that the thooughts needed to end , I overdosed, went to the hospital and was admitted to a facility in West Virginia. After that it seemed like I could only hold a job for 2 years before having yet another break. My symptoms at work consisied of extreme paranoia and anxiety. I felt exposed, I was on display and I felt like everyone knew my struggles.  

I’ve been hospitalized 9 times and each one took a part of me away. In 2019, I spent 6 months out of the year in hospitals and I wasn’t sure I was going to make it. I’ve been in seclusion and restraints. I was assaulted and I spent the other part of the year starving myself because I was so depressed I didn’t think I was worthy of food. I heard voices and had persecutary delusions and even believed I was God.  

Over the years i’ve been on various antipsychotics, mood stabilizers and antidepressants. I’ve had side effects such as weight gain letargy and tardive dyskenisia. I have attempted suicide and have been aggressive.  

All this led to profound guilt and shame.  

2020, though a strange year for the world, has been a year of recovery for me. I have been on a steady and good combination of medications. And I learned the importance of compliance. I see a psychaitrist, a therapist and I have peer support along with friends and family. I found that parts that had been missing and slowly put the pieces back together. I have scars but I am healing. I still hear voices but i’ve learned to better cope. I use mindfulness and I listen to music and the t.v. I use positive self talk every day and i’m working toward a balanced. Life.  

Schizzoaffective with depression or Bipolar is my diagnosis along with Attention Deficit Disorder. I still struggle and somedays are harder than others. However I have an important thing that was missing for years. I have hope.  

We all struggle differently. But we are strong. Resiliency is inside each one of us. We have the power to accept the reality and move forward with greater knowledge and understanding of our illneses. We are capaple of living happy and healthy lives, We are not our illnesses."
1089,Anyone chat?,I feel v stressed and anxious right now and could do with chatting with someone
1090,How do you deal with heartbreak,"It’s been a hard year for majority of people. This year I lost my grandad, my dad cut me off  off bc my step mum is a manipulator and got my step sisters to block me online. So I won’t be going for Christmas, but I’ll be off to my brothers. Then there’s the stress of uni online. And 3 weeks ago my nearly 2 year long relationship with my boyfriend has ended. 

About 2/3 weeks ago I was so close to ending my life but I couldn’t do  it. I thought I was okay until we broke up, now I’m feeling the stress of the whole year at once. Grief and sadness.

He was my best friend. I left bc he didn’t know what he wanted and it made me feel not Good enough and He needed to be alone and figure stuff out. Even now he says he doesn’t know what he wants and there’s a part of him who would like for us to work out. I don’t know what to believe. He just knows he needs to be alone atm to sort himself out. I’m that person who convinces myself that he doesn’t care or love me but I know he probably does.  We’re still close I guess he stayed over twice this week as he went home for Christmas today. He tells me he loves me lots and misses me loads and He wants to see me after Christmas I think. But I don’t get why if we’re broken up. 

I’ve never felt this type of pain before. He was perfect in many ways we clicked so so well. the only downfall was that he wasn’t very emotional compared to me and so it caused problems as we had different love languages. I can’t help but think I won’t ever love anyone as much as I love him and I’m always going to compare people against him bc he is literally everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m crying nearly everyday and feel my heart racing and my body shaking. I’ve suffered with depression and anxiety but this feeling is new and I’m not sure how to cope with it and if I’ll ever be able to move on. Everything hurts and I’m scared bc I only saw him yesterday and I know as the days go on it’s going to get worse and I’m gonna feel more heartache and I’m worried. It doesn’t help I overthink too much and great scenarios in my head or answer my own questions like I wonder how he feels convincing myself he’s fine and doesn’t care and stuff. I want the pain to stop"
1091,Nothing will ever be enough to make me happy,"I have had everything in my life and I still wasn’t happy. It made me feel even worse because I didn't have a reason to feel unhappy. Now, I have most and I feel like my life is falling apart again and I'm more comfortable like this because this is the only way I know how to live, in pain just waiting for the time to pass."
1092,Confusing Times,To Start off I’m 17 years old and I suffer from anxiety and depression (depression is very on and off tho) so currently right now I’ve been feeling really lightheaded which is super on and off sometimes I’m good everything feels real but then I’ll be like done with school or work then my mind just goes light headed my emotions are good again I know how I feel but mentally I get really confused with everything to the point I just get really sad with my life when I want something good. It may have to do with how I donated blood for the first time 1 weeks ago and then I’ve been dealing with another kind of bleeding so maybe that’s the cause just it’s a confusing time for me. Just thought it be to speak my thoughts out loud.
1093,2020 has been a rough year and is coming to an end so I’d like to reflect on my year,My 2020 didn’t start out the best. My boyfriend instead of choosing to break up with his girlfriend at the time choose to cheat on her with me keep it a secret make it seem like she was crazy and stalking us then mentally abuse try to make me change myself manipulate and rape me. Him and his mother both told me I was a failure and that I would never go anywhere in life. I now have had a job as a car parts salesman  since summer. I have a new phone for the first time since middle school which I still have because I’ve created so many memories on. I will soon be reaching a huge milestone in life! I will be able to qualify for a credit card which means I can build my credit and get my dream sports car or even a house.
1094,Over-thinking,"I remember when I was younger I was told how amazing it is to have thoughts and ideas that are mine. I've had many of them and am proud of my decision making skills and over all common sense because it has been something I have built on my own. Without getting too much into it I've never had structure in my life its always been just me. I'm about to turn 27 and im sure I've found my career job, I absolutely love it and the motivation I have to succeed here is unparalleled. 

Today my boss told me my biggest drawback is how I overthink everything. This is not the first time someone's mentioned this to me and im actually starting to get pretty worried its somehow gonna mess my life up. Its funny because I can literally see myself doing it everyday, like right now while writing this. How the heck can I combat this? My buddies say its anxiety but I never considered myself an anxious person at all but what do I know ? How would I even deal with anxiety if I did have it ? This is all so confusing to me I don't even know who to talk to about it ? A doctor? A psychiatrist?"
1095,I’m clowning myself,"I keep telling my therapist my eating isn’t an issue and worming out of her request for me to get a nutritionist but I’m almost underweight and I just fucking bought baby food because it’s low calorie (I really like crunchy food so those puff snacks are amazing tbh). I’m going to fully be back to where I was in high school/college and I’m unsure if I should tell her cause I kind of wanna keep losing weight :/ and maybe if I lose enough, that’ll be better than me killing myself.

Why am I like this. Sorry, needed to vent."
1096,I am at an all time low,"I'm feeling really bad about myself and my self confidence. For the past 2 months have been insane. I take sertraline 100mg, and it helps loads, but its my body weight, I've gotten so overweight. Last time I checked I was 20 stone. Which is very bad, as I was saying the past 2 months I've delayed dieting oh I failed ill start next Monday. I have no way of sticking to it. I don't know what to do. I really want to get healthy but I hate salads and fruit. I'm really struggling"
1097,"Please help, I don't know if I am going to be alive in 6 months","September 2018 was the beginning of the end for me. I asked out this girl to homecoming who told me no. It's not that big a deal. Sure it stung, but hey I moved on. 

By November I'm pretty sure I checked out of reality, I started believing that everyone at my school thought I had taken a picture of the girl's ass I had asked out. It drove me crazy. I was avoiding everyone and going crazy. I remember crying about it for a long time. Then, I went sideways. I started believing I did that to my sister. That I had taken a picture of my sister's ass. It drove me crazy. I was thinking about suicide constantly, I remember thinking that this might be the end. It was a secret, but I would've had to hold onto it forever. I can't stress how suicidal I was, I thought about it constantly. To be clear, I remembered it as a memory. I was obsessing over timelines, asking friends what they remembered around dates, etc. 

By around mid-April, I had thought through this event. I had convinced myself it was a false memory. My anxiety didn't improve though. I thought that I was a narcissist, I thought that I had autism and that everyone was lying to me, madness. In retrospect. Since then, my life hasn't improved. I went off to college. Please, I just want to be happy again. I feel so disconnected from reality. I feel so far away."
1098,I feel like I have no one,"Hi. This isn’t something that I would ever do but I just need someone to talk to. 

I’ve been dealing with depression for awhile, but last year I made a new friend and he kind of helped me out of it. He’s my only friend but I haven’t seen him since may due to me being deployed and then him deploying before I got back and recently I’ve been spiraling again. 

I started dating someone new in October and that kind of helped with me not feeling so alone but that ended yesterday and I’m now more depressed than I was before. 

It scares me because I have thoughts all day long about not wanting to be alive. I won’t do anything to act on them, but it’s a horrible thought to continually think about wanting to be dead. I have no family or friends in the state I’m stationed in and I can’t tell my parents about how I’m feeling because I just don’t think they would understand. 

I also can’t seek help from medical professionals because it will affect my job. I don’t know what to do. I just want to be happy, but no matter what I do people keep leaving me."
1099,Is it possible that I want to be treated like a child in adult relationships because of emotional neglect growing up?,"This is really messed up and I don’t know if this is because of childhood trauma but I feel like a child mentally. I’m 19F and in premed, I’m smart but in a relationship I want someone that makes me feel stupid. I want to be taken care of and put in my place and put down in a loving/teasing way and I don’t know why. I always look for a partner that is controlling and makes all the decisions for me because I don’t like to make decisions, I’m extremely indecisive. I was emotionally neglected, whenever I cried my dad would  just go “cry, (my name), cry”. I had major meltdowns to the point of going to a child support group for what my parents called anxiety at around 10/11. At this age I was compulsively washing my hands to the point they were cracked and bleeding. I told my mom about suicidal thoughts when I was 13, I was also self harming but left that out, she invalidated me. She told me it was normal and I didn’t need the therapy even though I asked for it. It was a conversation that led me to never open up to anyone fully again, I recently brought it up and she doesn’t even remember it. I recently told her about the self harm and she said that’s only for people who have been molested and was confused why I did it then as there was nothing wrong with me. I gained 40lbs in a few months and spent years spending every second not in school in my room from 16 to 17, never socialized despite having opportunities and missed over 40 days of school in a year. My parents continued to insist there was nothing wrong with me mentally. I feel like there’s something majorly wrong with me but I can’t figure out what it is and have never been able to get a diagnosis because I’ve been told my whole life that I am normal. I feel like all of my issues attracting controlling and terrible men stem from undiagnosed mental health issues."
1100,Please remind me to get help,"TLDR down below, I need some motivational help

I have been dealing with very confusing and complicated mental struggles for at least the last 6 years. I have lived with it without too much complications this far but it is getting worse. I have been putting this off for years but I think I really do need professional help. 90% of the time it doesn't really bother me, but the other 10% it gets really really bad. Everytime it gets bad I realise in how much trouble I am and how much terror this could create. That is when I realise I need to try to stop this right fucking now.
But then things get better and I simply (want to) forget about it. Life goes on ey. Well this actually dangerous game of procrastination needs to stop. 

Someone please just message me the next couple of days to check on me. Check if I committed to this post, check
untill I have made the cal for professional help. Yes, I already know what number to call, what to say, and I know it is the right move. I just have shoved it forward for at least a couple of months, and it's been enough. Please help me clear this mental border, I really can't permit to talk myself out of it again

TLDR; I need professional help. Please message me the next couple of days and tell me I need to make the call. No more postponing this bs."
1101,Asking for advice,"I'll try to keep it brief.  Last week my husband started showing some worrying symptoms, having delusions, believing I was in extreme danger and that people were coming to hurt me.

This all came to a head on Friday morning and I asked a friend to come help me sit with him while I called different facilities, tried to figure out our insurance, etc as it became clear he needed more help than I can give him.

We took him to the emergency room and he has been there since then, admitted medically for now but has undergone a psych evaluation and will probably be transferred to the floor tomorrow.  It has been around 8 hours since we have spoken and I'm really struggling with feelings of guilt and anxiety.

Because of covid, I had to leave him in the ER waiting room confused, scared, and alone.  It was the hardest thing I have ever done.  Any advice on how to manage my own self care during this time?  The guilt and anxiety are becoming overwhelming.  Also, how can I best help him once he is released?  I am worried sick, he is the love of my life and I will do everything I can to help him."
1102,Should I stop seeing my therapist?,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure this has the right subreddit, I hope so, but here is my problem. 
I've seen my therapist 8 times so far. She tells me we are still into the get-to-know phase, at this stage I'm not feeling much relief and we are yet to make a plan or a progress whatsoever.

She gave me tests and tasks to complete and I executed. This week she gave me the task of writing down 'the chapters of my life', 1 page, 1 year she said, but I don't know how to do it, I don't really want to either, my mind goes blank and I get discouraged because this means that before we start actually doing something to improve the situation, there will still be some time to get-to-know. 
Friends of mine going through the process told me that their get-to-know phase was much quicker, averaging at 4 times, so I was wondering if I should stop seeing her and look for someone else or if this is normal. 

Should I tell her I'll stop? How can I be respectful about it? She seems such a nice person, I don't want to make trouble for her. She is a cognitive behavioural therapist, I've been advised by my mother (clinical psychologist) to switch to a systemic therapy approach, do you have anything to comment on this?

Thank you for reading."
1103,How can I know what’s wrong with me,"So I’m pretty sure there’s a number of things mentally wrong with me, how do I know what"
1104,Is it normal?,"Is it normal to have a huge fear of failure? Because if i get something wrong it will haunt me and i will spend ages just thinking about it and feeling embarrassed about it 

Also if it helps it started around my first year of high school (S1) and I’m now in my second year (S2)"
1105,Is this wroth ending my life for,Message me. I will tell you
1106,Past thoughts creeping in,How can I move past a stupid decision I made that luckily I learned from but scared me mentally. I still beat my self up about having semi sex with someone I know for a few weeks with no condom 2 years ago. Thank god after my physical and blood work I’m healthy. But ever since I find a way to eat at my self on daily basis for the past 2 years not a day go by where I don’t think about it. I haven’t reached out to mental health professionals because I feel Its something I can do myself with the right tools. I consistently think of How my life could’ve been damaged based on a dumb decision. Any advice on how I put a stop to this it’s so tiring of how I torment my self.
1107,Is this normal?,"If someone says something negative about me i will agree to it and think that about myself but if someone says something positive about me I’m most likely to just not believe them and think that they’re saying it in a sarcastic way even though it’s obvious it isn’t 

I’m also like Over-Apologetic and say sorry for just about anything and have a hard time saying anything else if the person I’m talking to is angry once i even said sorry for saying sorry and another time i said sorry for talking about something i like"

1109,Need help with my brother,"My (25-m) brother (30-m) has experienced a noticeable mood/personality change over the past 4-5 years, becoming worse in recent years. I’m not a mental health expert, but his symptoms do not appear to fit an obvious diagnosis. If anyone has any experience with the following symptoms, please let me know. I want to support him in the best way possible so that he can get the help he needs to turn his life around.

- He is outwardly very happy. Whenever you see him, he has a huge smile and is eager to start a conversation.
- He has very little motivation to do anything productive in his life. While he is very smart (he has a masters degree and an incredible memory) he has not been able to secure a full time job. He’s applying for teaching jobs, which are very competitive, but he doesn’t appear to be angry/sad/let down when he doesn’t get them. He is perfectly content to watch TV all day. He’s currently studying for a certification test that he’s already failed, but he’ll study for maybe 30 minutes per day and spend the rest of the day relaxing.
- He needs help with everything. Opening doors, carrying things in the house, pouring glasses of water. Today he fell in the snow getting out of the car and lay flat on his back, waiting for me to help pick him up. When I did, I was carrying his entire weight; he wasn’t even trying to get up.
- He doesn’t have a social life. Even before COVID, he rarely saw his friends and hasn’t had a girlfriend since he was 23. This has been especially noticeable because he used to have an extensive social life, spending tons of time with a large group of friends. Now, his best friend is my grandmother. Again, this doesn’t seem to bother him.
- He has never lived away from home and has no motivation to move out. In fact, he often “jokes” that he’s never going to move out. He has had emotional breakdowns when my parents have talked about moving into elderly housing in the future.
- He is incredibly nostalgic about the past, reminiscing about mundane memories from 15+ years ago as if they were major moments in his life.
- He can seem emotionally immature. At family parties, he’s most like hanging out with my young cousins.
- He is completely unaware of basic social conventions.
- He used to smoke and drink casually, but now he doesn’t smoke, drink, or even drink coffee.
- he has no ability to overcome the slightest bit of adversity.

Before, he was a relatively self-sufficient, social young adult with concrete goals (he even talked about moving hundreds of miles away!). Now, it’s clear that something is off and his life has taken a turn.
 
I love my brother and would appreciate any and all guidance."
1110,Why do my parents who usually care about me randomly start hating me,"I usually love my mom and dad very much however once a week or so me and them get into huge fights. Now i am the first to admit that by no means am i the best kid. I habe my issues but generally my mom and dad are very supportive.

My mom somedays will always make these snide, under her breath comments that get under my skin. I generally have low self esteem to begin with so they can really get to me and ill start small fights usually as it really hurts me. Again i am the one to usually start stuff but then this is when my parents become what feels like emotional manipulators. Ill ask my dad what i did wrong and inturrupt him by accident and he will become a drama queen about it and make a big deal about it and ill profusely apologise to him but hell just give me the silent treatment. Then my parents will punish me but not in a normal way. They go out of their way to do it, like the will either give me no warning or warn me not to do somthing AFTER i had already done it. And the ignoring OMG I CANT TAKE IT and my mom will say somthing insanely hurtful to me and my dad will just stand there doing nothing bit as soon as i verbally retaliate his jaw will drop like he cant believe what ive just said. Whenever i start to respond to anything i just get told to dhut up or else i will be further punished so my emotions just build up inside me.  They never listen to me and i cant take it anymore i love my life for the most part but i dont want to live where i nust have to take this. I dont know what to do anymore"
1111,Problem with immediate neighbor and dying mother,"Hi all, not sure where else can I rant out. Please excuse my English if it is not so good (Malaysian here).

I lost my very close aunt to cancer in 2013, it was a blow to everyone in the family as she was the magnet during gatherings and get together. In April 2019, I lost my grandmother (79yrs old) who was so healthy but gone too soon. My aunty and my grandma was my main mental support as I can share anything with them.

1). Yesterday, I visited my critically ill mother at the hospital and although the family has been informed in advanced but hearing from the doctor's own mouth feels like a blow. My mother has throat cancer stage 4 whereby the tumor is now the size of a tennis ball. Nothing can be done as it is an aggressive type of cancer. She is very thin/fragile, has tube in her nose for milk intake (only milk as food source), 2 days ago she had 2 bags of blood transfusion and she is in extreme pain. She can't talk so she has to write to communicate. I had never cried the hardest until I left the hospital and reached home. It is tormenting to see loved ones suffering like this.

2). My immediate neighbor has been giving hell for years. They threw prawn and crab skin into my house, threw smelly plastic that smells like fish has been kept inside and everyday now throwing cat shit + litter sand into the drain in between our house. There are floating poo in the drain water. They have been neighbors for 20 years. In the past when I was a teenager, their son mess around with our bras and undies (mom and I) until my mom caught them red handed by putting tons of flour at where they will step to reach the lingeries. The footprints lasted for more than a week because of rain hardening up the flour. Footprints also led to their steps so it is like a spotlight for other neighbors to see.

There was a whole year I did not live in this house as my family moved out (house not sold yet) and this neighbor took the opportunity to park their cars in front the house gate (free parking daily + convenience), I moved back because I have dogs and it isn't easy to find a place that will accommodate my dogs.

3). I am trying to sell off this house but because of covid it makes it harder, in the meantime I don't wish to live here for another year. Sorry for the long rant, my community group isn't very helpful as they ignored my messages. I don't know how to find peace in this wellbeing."
1112,"[27M] Have a bad relationship with sex, never fully got what it's all about. First I discounted it for the conveniency of porn, then ridiculed as it's not a legacy building endeavour, then overanalyzed it to exploit trends and movements to arbitrage the sexual marketplace.Now I can't get aroused :(","I'll quickly explain the phases:

1) 13-20 years: Started masturbating to Divas wrestling cards of all things, then quickly to lesbian sensual content on youtube, finally into porn. I never really desired the real thing, the conveniency and the great ability to load porn , fap , aim and shoot could not be beaten. Best bang for buck as far as orgasms go.

2) 20-23 : Porn withdrawl (with relapses). it was a self improvement and self discipline thing, worked to a point. But at the same time I began scratching my head to the amount of time and resources men waste to pursue sex. Those who diverge like Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Bill Bellichick ,Lee Kuan Yew seemed destined to become world class, the #1 in their respective fields. So why did men accepted the gap from the #1 to grow to such wide, all this for sex? What an absurdity! At the end of the day if you ain't first you are last! When you are #1 and you still want sex you can recoup if you want.

3) 23-25 years old : Started to analyze trading strategies in the sexual marketplace, this is parallel to me analyzing trading strategies in the stocks and bonds marketplace. I started making assessments assigning ratings 0 to 100 to girls (never liked the 0-10 scale, very imprecise, unless you use decimal points). The entry price in terms of time and effort to lay a 85/100 and up girls. The diminishing returns from 85 to 100, and the elasticity of supply and demand due to season and the menstrual cycle which make girls more or less receptive and thus raises or diminishes the effort needed for a lay.

4) 25-26 years old: Think I have a good understanding of the sexual market phenomenons, I know exactly where to travel, how to carry myself on social media and real life to execute, also the moment to enter and to exit the market to minimize shifts. Have a good confidence I can lay a couple of 85/100 girls per week at a very good entry point, also know when to exit a trade and the entry and exit signals.

In the meantime during the 4 phases progression my libido went more and more downwards and in the last year it dropped almost parallel to the y-axis , now I don't even have it.

I attribute it to the 4 phases above, well actually the 3 phases beyond the initial fapping which is done by many and doesn't damage the libido of many people (you only see those who suffer from it posting online due to the sampling bias). 


Mostly it's the phase 2-3-4: My brain started seeing sex as something to avoid to save time/resources and outcompete people to be #1 in legacy cementing domains such as science, data analysis, business or trading . Alternatively something to do , but not for the pleasure of the act, but the pleasure of outcompeting other people at it and then look at the data to see how I had outcompeted them and get a kick that way.

I'm also worried about lack of Nocturnal Penile Turmescence (wet dreams) and morning wood, mostly I'm worried because the post ejaculation clarity gave me lots of good ideas and now without ejaculation I cannot possibly get the clarity and It seems like I'm missing out of lots of good business and trading ideas.

is there some literature on these topics, I want to know what i'm up against"
1113,Mentally Drained all the time,"Hey all, I have a topic I would appreciate some input and advice on.

(21M)  Let me explain.
I have noticed basically throughout my entire teen and young adult life that I am always mentally drained and do not have the capacity to concentrate, think clearly, and am always achey in my joints and stomach etc from the moment I wake up to the time that I go to bed of a night. I believe this is trauma related.

I have had somewhat of a traumatic upbringing with my mother being a very abusive non functioning alcoholic, my parents were never together since I was born and my father commited suicide when i was 8 years old. Ive been homeless and grew up around drugs and criminals most of my lifetime. I briefly went through the child protection system and left my mother to live with my grandparents at the age of 13, and they have since passed away. A range of other things in this story aswell but these are the main points.

I have seen psychologists over my lifetime and have been diagnosed with Reactive attachment disorder as a child and more recently been clinically diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, CPTSD and cannot regulate my thoughts or emotions efficiently. I have nightmares and flashbacks at minimum every 20 minutes during my days (which cause me to have severe bodily jerking reactions and very angry or sad outrage episodes in which i cant see my thoughts) this has gone on for some years now and seems to be getting worse. I've started to see another psychologist longterm to attempt to manage my situation as effectively as possible. 

But I'm always tired and drained and cannot even physically hear people when they speak because of my intrusive thoughts and it feels as though im always in survival mode or fight or flight, are there any management tips that others in my situation could offer? Ive checked all of my health markers by doctors and they all come up perfectly, i meditate, exercise and read often. I do use the internet too much which im working on as we speak. I dont use alcohol or drugs at all and my diet is on point with as much healthy food as possible. My instincts lead me to believe that this brain drain is caused by the exertion on my body and brain of being fearful and unsure/ fight or flight constantly. I imagine this takes an incredible amount of energy to sustain and is only designed to be used in a truly life threatening situation but through my traumas is activated on a far more regular basis than the average person. 

If you have any input I sincerely appreciate your opinion and ill try anything at this point except drugs, ive tried a number of antipsychotics and antidepressants with very little positive effect over the course of years."
1114,Currently working through childhood toxic stress and navigating life with severe depression/anxiety. Struggling with brain fog and looking to engage my brain more.,"Does anyone have any favorite brain game websites or apps? Or have any tips for slowly getting your brain back into being able to function without feeling like you’re in molasses? 

Also looking for maybe some mental health support apps to work on self confidence and regain a sense of identity? Specifically struggling with self worth and abandonment issues so I’m trying to work on changing my toxic anxious based mindset about life and relationships. 

Not looking for therapy apps, more like journaling or affirmation all type things. 

Thanks!"
1115,I'm either awake too long and become a sleepless zombie or take the meds oversleep and feel sluggish all day. Can't win,I just want a standard routine instead of 40 hours awake then 2 hours sleep fooled by 24 hours awake then 12 hours of drug Induced sleep that leavese feeling worse
1116,I’ve realized I have no one in my life who truly is there for me.,"Yeah I have company, but I still feel this loneliness. It fucking sucks tbh. Like I never grew up having a loving, supportive family. It was always me who had to cheer myself up, give me the emotional support I needed to be happy. The only other person who really , really cared was someone who isn’t in my life at the moment. So here I am crying on the bathroom floor out of pity for myself. It sounds pathetic. I just want to really know what it’s like to be loved. I want people around me but at the same time I’m like fuck it, I don’t need anyone. Such a contradiction."
1117,I've been dead inside for years,Yeah
1118,My mood is always over the place,"I dont know if anyone can relate, but my mood switches from depression symptoms to overconfidence or anger, multiple times a day. I also struggle with reckless behavior like self harm and things like suddenly buying presents for everyone I know?

Does anyone know what this is called? I’m going to a therapist in a couple weeks but have been diagnosed with ADD in the past"
1119,I don’t know if I am experiencing trauma,"Hey reddit. Im 22 years old and i feel myself questioning my relationship with my mother and if im experiencing some form of emotional trauma. She was extremely hard on me my whole life. There was never any physical abuse, but i feel like my relationship with her caused me emotional/mental trauma. I dont want to get into specific details...but every time id try to come to her with something big or small, id get screamed at and blamed and she would make it about herself. if i got in trouble for anything, i would get screamed at. don’t get me wrong, i was not and am not a perfect person, and i know i have been in the wrong too. over time, this recurring theme of her screaming at me every time something was wrong, i began to hide things. i wouldnt tell her things, regardless of what it was. im off living on my own, but im in town for the holidays, and i find myself scared of her. The thought of her screaming at me, and even just reflecting back on past circumstances with her from years ago gives me extreme anxiety. I don’t know if i have some sort of trauma or what. I feel like i do, but i could be overreacting. Idk. I dont think i am tho, i cant feel this way for no reason. I have two younger sisters, and she doesnt do this to them. Which confuses me. Like why me? Anyway, i would love any advice or insight."
1120,Anybody gotten through depression and anxiety? Would love stories on the other side of this,"I recently started to take medication for a severe doubt of depression and anxiety that seemingly came out of nowhere in July. I tried everything before resorting to taking an SNRI - therapy, neurofeedback, increased exercise, etc. Nothing was helping and I kept falling into the spiral / hole again every few weeks. With this anxious depressive episode being so up and down, it’s been hard for me to even enjoy my good days anymore because I don’t want to get my hopes up that I’m finally ok now and the storm has cleared. 


I live in constant fear that the depression anxiety and intrusive thoughts are going to return.

Did anyone else have this fear before the got better? How did you get through it?"
1121,I don’t have friends anymore.,"It seems that over the last few years, I (28f) have forgotten how to make friends. I thought I had a few, but they were friends from work, and have hardly spoken to me since I left. I try to find people in groups on reddit and discord who could possibly become acquaintances at the very least, but I’m very bad at keeping the communication going. Sometimes I wonder if it’s better that I don’t have friends. I usually end up getting hurt in the end, which deters me from getting too close to anyone. The problem is, there is no one for me to reach out to or to chat with about common interests or about things that are on my mind. It’s lonely. I’m afraid of anyone trying to get to know me but at the same time I wish someone would. I’ve been going through some things lately (just vague realizations about myself) and I have no one to try to explain them to. We’re getting into winter now, and I know it’s only a matter of time before I sink too deep to have any interest in communicating with anyone at all. I’m just...so lonely."
1122,Why do I hate it when people are in my room?,"I (22f) don't know if anyone else feels this way **but I cannot stand having people in my room.** It doesn't matter the situation or the relationship, the second someone enters my room I get very defensive and angry and I can't explain it. The rest of my house is fine but its like my room is completely off limits. 

Why do you think this is? My parents always respected my room when I was a kid and I can't seem to find an explanation for it. 

I have pretty bad anxiety so I thought I would post this question here."
1123,Thought of jumping,"So I had a little housewarming kinda party tonight because three friends of mine are going to live on their own. We had a really good time and it was real fun (and yes it was COVID proof)

But long story short, we had a couple of beers and used some drugs too, ketamine and cocaine. We went to the balcony to take a smoke. Once we stood on the balcony I just got this weird feeling. Something in my mind was telling me ""Dude, Jump, what's the point even, just do it.""

I'm not sure where it came from. It was a really good night, something I really needed in a while because of COVID. When the others were done with their smokes I told one of my friends about the weird feeling I got. He's pretty easygoing about it and he kinda knows how to deal with it but still I'm a bit ashamed about telling it to him...

Luckily I didn't do it. I don't want to give up and om not going to so I'm kinda proud about that."
1124,I want to fucking die,I don’t want to kill myself... I don’t have enough courage. Just want to die. Curl up and die. Get hit by a car. Skid on some ice and slam a tree. Bridge collapse. I just want to be done. Fuck. How did I get here. 23 male.... losing all hope
1125,[20F] Not sure what to do?,"TW: Illness, possible ED? 

I’ve always been terrified of being sick. Ever since I was little, I’d go into full panic attacks when someone would cough, sneeze, or belch. 

I used to punch my brother hard when he did that because he knew it bothered me. 

I’m now twenty years old and am in my third year of college and I’m struggling hard. 

Not only am I deathly terrified of being sick (especially in the the middle of a pandemic), but I’ve now resorted to cleaning all the time, and I’ve never not been seen without putting hand sanitizer on every three to four minutes. 

The worst part, however is that I’m so scared to eat because I don’t want to get sick. My parents tell me that I’m just being silly and acting for attention- but in reality I don’t know what’s wrong or why I’m doing this. 

I want to eat. I can manage a couple of bites before I start panicking. This is just on repeat, all the time. 

I’m just not sure what wrong or why I’m suddenly like this. I was eating normally before, I didn’t just think about staying healthy all day long- this just isn’t healthy. 

I don’t want anyone here to give me a diagnosis, I just need some encouragement or just someone to validate my issues because I don’t get that at all from friends or family. 

TLDR: My fear of illness is now so crazy that I’m too scared to eat and can’t stop cleaning my house and hands."
1126,Medication,"Just Recently my doctor started me on antidepressants, and I’ve been going in once a month and every time I explain I just feel worse on this medication she just ups the dosage. It’s reaching a point where I don’t care anymore and would rather stop taking the medication. But it’s just as bad if I just stop, but I’m tired of suppressing how I feel instead of making actual moves to get better. I feel like she’s not taking me seriously."
1127,Regretting after talking,"I've been having this problem. Why do I feel regret after telling people personal things? I always feel like I could take back what I said. It has nothing to do with the people I tell, because they're all people I trust. Would anyone have any ideas about how to get over this weird shame--or why I even feel this way?"
1128,I decided to distance myself from my friends in fear of hurting them.,"I dont really feel like writing at all so my writing is going to be shit. I have been so exhausted from work and college these past few weeks that I absolutely cannot focus in being the best version of myself to my friends. This entire Saturday I was extremely full of anxiety because I just finished finals and my internship is going to end in two weeks, so knowing I have or will have nothing to do is driving me nuts. On top of that, these weren't very healthy situations either.

I feel like I need to have better coping mechanisms at work, especially when I dont know anything. I need to learn how to take breaks. I need to learn how to take criticism. I need to learn how to forgive myself. I also especially need to learn how to learn. Without these things, I won't make it in the future, and neither will my friendships.

My friend noticed a behavior I was picking up recently. When they would try to explain something to me, I would totally dismiss it or be rude to them about it. They snapped at my for my behavior and my personality changes. I told them that I was going through the problems above and I was probably taking out my frustration at them. They are also kind to me, so I totally snapped when they continued to do so.

This person, I talk to every single day. So my hope is that they forgive me for taking the next few days to prioritize my mental health and learn to be my own best friend again. To learn how to relax, how to sit still, how to take things one at a time, how to shower and eat food and live in the moment slowly and carefully. The last thing is completely losing my friend while I am not emotionally sane. I went as far as deleting the means I use to access them so I can truly embody myself in these moments and be at peace in my alone time."
1129,Less stressed,"Life is odd. Finally wrote my suicide note. Life is strange. Not sure if I’m going to die, the ball is up in the air. Don’t care if I sound the same as everyone else here. I don’t want your help. I really am used to no one hearing. I wonder if I’m doomed. I think I might be. Life was going great and just as it thought it might be. Problem it’s still as it might be. I’m kind of fucked. I could be happy but I think I might just really want to die, I’ve planned for this my whole life."
1130,My anxiety is crippling me,"I have had this horrible feeling of anxiety, and it's about most things in my life, work, money, girlfriend any thing that effects me. I have anxious attacks when I can't talk to my girlfriend because work gets in the way, it usually spurs the most negative thoughts that I have sitting in the back of my head "" she's cheating on me with her new roomates"" ""she doesn't love me anymore"" "" she didn't send a picture of herself today what's she hiding"" no matter how many times I tell myself no she's not like that, when has she ever given you a reason to doubt her. I'm probably more of the culprit to most of these things because I masturbate when she's not around, some times to her some times to others. It's so hard to get these thoughts out of my head though. I wish I was working closer to home alot of days but I wish I could find a job closer to home. When I am around my fits of anxiety turn to anger because I don't believe she is as good as she seems. But I know she is that honest and kind. I wish I didn't get angry but it hurts me so much to have these negative thoughts in my brain. I wish I could see her right now face to face just to feel the comfort of her soul just a little longer each time I'm home. Please give me advice. I just want to love her without my doubtful mind getting in the way."
1131,What am I experiencing?,"So I'm not sure where to even post this. For background, I have diagnosed PTSD relating to my childhood, and I'm now 19. I've experienced this feeling for a while now and I have no idea what it is or what to call it. Suddenly and at seemingly random times it's like I just ""shut off"". My eyes become fixed on a random point and it feels almost impossible to move them. I can't really move but I can force myself to move very unnaturally in a way that almost feels like I'm telling my body what to do instead of just doing it. I am mostly unable to talk during these events. They are sometimes short and sometimes longer, and most of the time I can fight through them and force my body to move itself. 

My boyfriend doesn't understand. Every time I have one of these events he always thinks he's pissed me off somehow (even though I don't even get like that and usually if he pisses me off I tell him directly, so I don't know what he's thinking honestly). I get really frustrated because I don't know how to explain what's going on and he won't stop acting like he's in trouble around me. I'm not mad at him because I know he just doesn't understand what I'm going through. 

I did some research and found out about dissociation but I'm not sure if it fits but it's the closest term I've found to describe the feeling. I don't really feel like I'm out of my body, I just feel like I can't really function, and doing anything, even just looking up, is a huge struggle. If anyone could just give me an idea of what this might be called I would be so grateful!"
1132,"My mental health takes and takes, I dont see my next step forward, I can only see darkness","My mental health makes me feel unworthy of life, unworthy of happiness and although I should'nt strive for this."

1134,Over stimulation? Sudden bout of depression?,"For years now I’ve been experiencing this...
I will be with friends, or walking down the hall at work, and out of no where I get this sinking feeling. It’s the deepest depression, my soul literally aches, I can feel it in my chest. It hits suddenly and it’s like I can feel my chemicals changing. It lasts a couple seconds or minutes and then I’m fine. Often times it happens when I’m happy or with people having fun. I mentioned it to my counselor and she said that maybe it’s overstimulation and my brain reacts by just shutting down? It doesn’t greatly affect my life, but I’ve never heard of anyone else feeling this.
I would love to ‘diagnose’ this, not necessarily to treat it, but to understand my own brain better. To understand what’s happening, because I think it’s fascinating. 
Has anyone experienced something similar to this? It’s not bad days or hours, it’s literally just a couple minutes of the worst feeling ever, and for no reason. Have you been told what it is?"
1135,I need everything to stop.,"Hi🖤I am a 20 year old female. I can’t process through anything. I can’t even begin to think about anything. I tried to break up with my boyfriend today because he had done some terrible things to me in the past. If you’d like to know what happened please visit my profile and see my posts on it. I don’t have the mental capacity to explain or even be writing this, so I apologize if this doesn’t make any sense. 

Anyways I ended up not breaking up with him because it was a mess and he was crying and it just broke my heart in a million pieces. I told him I’d think about it for a while but I can’t think about it. Everything is happening so fast and all at once and I can’t process any of it. I’ve been trying to process through the traumatic things he did with a therapist and it’s not working. It’s all I can think about and it kills me inside. 

I went from a 4.0 student to failing two semesters in a row just because I can’t think about anything else than all the pain I have. I’m consumed by it. I feel so confused and desperate to just feel release from this pain."
1136,dont know if im a bad person or not,i always struggled with self-hatered discord friends tried to help but i didnt listen i could not listen one friend tried to get me to make a flowchart about my feelings he would get frusturated when i did not do things right and he would say ffs when he was frusturated i feel like he was really trying to help me but he just keep stressing me out and i keep burning out this other friend with my breakdowns and shit and he put a deadline and if i did not meet it he would leave the group and not talk to me his deadline was in november but because i wanted to play among us with him i through i could have finished it by october 31st well i was so stressed out because he wanted me to do stuff a certain way and i was mean to him i said no im not gonna do it he said i was not trying and before he blocked me he said maybe you will try next time and he blocked me i had a full breakdown in the gc then the other friend left he said he wanted to move on and he gave me two weeks before he blocked me my dumbass kept trying to explain to him what happend and why i was feeling that way and he said im sorry but i dont want to hear it and i kept trying to explain to him why i did what i did and he said you know what i dont need two weeks and blocked me i think he kept trying to tell me to stop but my dumbass would not listen october 29-31 were the worst days of my life i had trouble sleeping i yelled at myself self-harmed myself (no blood) i am  very scared of fucking shit up. i feel like a toxic piece of shit
1137,Why do I only care about one person,I have struggled with mental health issues all my life and felt like my life had no purpose until I met the girl of my dreams when I was 15. When I met her I felt like my life finally had purpose and for the first time I got to experience genuine happiness and didn't have to fake a smile. I'm  17 now we got engaged back in June but she left me 5 weeks ago. I want to die I've been in and out of hospital for suicidal ideation and attempted suicide since she left. People say if I get better she will take me back but I feel like I need to be with her to get better. Everyone says they don't want me to die but they are pushing me over the edge. My family are struggling so much because they know I could kill myself any day. I don't want to move on I just want her back. I write letters every day to her. She is the only person I truly care about. My family don't understand why I can fake being fine one second then go cut myself the next. I'm scared she will realize she loves me if I die and I'm scared if I stay alive I'll wake up one day and she will have found some1 else and I know I couldn't handle it. I'm letting everyone down because she is the only person I care about. I don't want to get better unless I know I'll be with her. I'm trying to give myself a chance but it's so hard. I'm pretty sure time will bring her back to me but there are constant what ifs lingering in my head. I'm living in fear and pain. I just want her back but how do I keep going until she comes back to me. I live in Australia but my brother wants me to go work for him in Hong Kong but I don't think I can do it till I get her back and she says she is okay with being long distance until she finishes school. I'm too unstable without her in my life. I know that having someone's whole life evolve around you must be stressful so I understand why she would get stressed by it. I'm lost and I have no one that I can talk to comfortably. She was the person I told all my problems to and she never said the wrong thing and always listened. My love for her just keeps growing even though we aren't together. I just need advice on how to get her back and how to find happiness in other things as well as start caring about other people.
1138,I'm about 99% sure I have paranoia and I don't know how to act normal.,"My family has been paranoid for generations, making it very likely with how I act that I too have paranoia.

I make detailed plans for every little bit of my life and every possible scenario.  I freak out and self-disgnose myself with cancer or something from period bloating.  I get weird looks from these things and I have had some people straight up laugh at me when I start freaking out or try to come up with a detailed plan for a small thing.

I just want to know how to act normal without medication.  I have a huge crush on a boy (I'm a teen) and I have a feeling that something might start between us sometime soon.  Usually I feel more of a need to act ""right"" in a relationship because I do try to make it apparent that I don't date for fun, it's for marriage.  And I don't want my future kids having to deal with my freakouts



How can I stop freaking out so much, or at least hide it?  I really don't want to mess up my life because of something I didn't ask for."
1139,"How to tell my parents that I’m getting therapy, without worrying them?","I’m in my early 20s, in the USA. Ever since the pandemic I’ve been living with my parents, who I have a pretty good relationship with. 

Next year I want to start seeing a therapist, partly for what I believe to be mild/moderate depression (that I’ve had symptoms of since I was 16), and partly because I just feel like I have a lot of things I keep bottled up that I need to unpack. Even my closest friends don’t know everything about me or the things I am/have struggled with, and neither do my parents. I’m hoping therapy will teach me how to be more vulnerable and open with the people in my life. 

I got a referral, and my health insurance from work will cover (virtual) visits. The issue is, I’m not sure how to tell my parents I’ll be starting this. I know they’re not opposed to therapy, because my brother has more severe depression and they got him a therapist immediately after learning it. But I don’t want to explain that I have been feeling depressed since I was in high school, because they’ll ask why I never told them, and like I said, I feel really uncomfortable talking about my mental health problems in real life. My mom especially tends to worry and I don’t want it to be a big deal. (Yeah, I’m aware this is exactly the type of thing I should be going to a therapist for, lol.) 

Yet, because I’m working on being more honest (and logistically, because I’ll be attending appointments from their house), I feel like I should say something about it to them. Is it wrong to minimize the issue by saying I’ve been just feeling a bit down / stressed about work recently, or that I just wanted to try therapy out because it’s free through my new insurance? Anyone been in a similar situation? Thanks in advance."
1140,Have never felt this lost and zoned out,"Hey all, I know we are all going through hard times due to the current world situation. I had a huge meltdown in September and have not felt right ever since. I’ve always had a history of severe anxiety/paranoia since I was a kid(also dealt with a lot of childhood trauma but the anxiety began before the trauma itself which intensified it with age.) I kind of  chilled out for the most part when I got into my early 20’s, but turned 30 recently and I’ve now done a compete 360. I’ve had issues with alcohol for the last 10 years, and I don’t know if this has now caught up to me or what. I have these moments when I feel like I am losing my mind and am going insane. I constantly am paranoid that nothing is real and that I’m making things up in my head, along with having intrusive thoughts and my brain will not shut off. I repeat sayings out loud over and over again to calm down. What scares me the most is that I do this without even thinking(but not around people, only when I’m alone). The things I am saying lately are, “I cannot do this anymore”. I begin to get teary (and I never cry normally) and lately have been sort of making plans to leave. I’m not suicidal to the point where I would ever act on it. I have never felt this bad and in these moments I just do not think I can go on like this. I am physically ill over the anxiety and paranoia and get so nauseated, along with all of my muscles getting tense with no relief. I recently cut back on drinking a lot, but sometimes I have to go on a nightly bender just to chill the F out and feel good for once. Then the following day it accelerates the awful anxiety episodes for hours until I have to take a Xanax, or just hope to eventually sleep it off. I don’t have any friends or anyone I can talk to. I did start therapy not too long ago which helped a little, but does nothing currently. Everyday feels like Groundhog Day and I constantly daydream and am so zoned out. I could really use some support, and perhaps insight as to wtf is wrong with me. Thanks for reading &lt;3"

1142,i can't keep a happy relationship,"this is gonna be lots of rambles but that's okay

i think it's far too soon to decide this, because ive been in three relationships, but i can't keep a relationship i feel like. the first was when i was young and stupid. we were both toxic. the second was when i was older and more mature, but i ended things because we drifted and felt as though we were just friends. my current relationship is with the same person as the first one, but i feel like i just am useless here.

i have such a fear of being considered toxic, but im so exhausted. we have drifted quite a bit too. we text, maybe not as often as id want to, though. it feels like we don't have much to talk about anymore. we don't have many common interests, we don't play the same games, listen to the same songs, etc. there isn't much to work with. and i think a big reason for my fear that i am being toxic is the fact that it upsets me when they apologize so much. they will apologize for me reacting to little things in a normal way, such as if we are just talking normally, they will apologize for something. which is fine, but at the same time, it upsets me because it makes me feel like i am coming across as angry. but i consider myself understanding, i don't know why im losing my patience with such a little thing, even if i don't be rude about it or anything, i just assure them it's fine, im worried it's toxic that i care so much and get so upset about it. 

man, i want this shit to last, but it's exhausting. we get no where when we talk about things, and im so worried it's my fault."
1143,I hate the games we play with each other.,"Everyone is so goddamn fake all the time.  I don't get why people can't just be fully honest.  I'm not necessarily talking about opening up and being completely vulnerable, I'm talking about people playing the social games.  I see it with my sister the most, she has tons of friends but all she does is complain about them.  I try to give her solutions like don't talk them or tell them you don't like them, but she can't do it and neither can her friends.  I saw the same thing much more frequently when I was doing in-person school.  I'd see people talking like they're best friends, then later they would come up to me and complain about the other one.  One of the examples of this was with this one that half my class hated, but never said anything.  The only person he knew didn't like him was me, and I think that's part of why everyone hated him.  They would act all friendly, and some of them almost like fangirls to this guy, giving this gigantic fucking ego, making them hate him more because now he thinks he's the shit.  If you don't like someone, just tell them or don't be around them.  Don't act like you're best buds.  If it hurts their feelings that one person doesn't like them, they need to grow some fucking balls and realize that not everyone is gonna like them"
1144,Most days I enjoy being single...,"But sometimes I miss companionship.... I then start wondering if something’s wrong with me, then realize it is definitely ME"
1145,possible dissociation ?,"i have severe brain fog, and have always ""turned my brain off"" frequently since my POTS got worse around puberty. 

by ""turn my brain off"" i mean i sit and stare at the floor and just don't think, i don't feel the need to, i have to force myself to have thoughts, and i don't blink and my eyes don't even start to itch or feel like they're drying out. 

i just had this weird moment a couple hours ago where i felt like i had run into jello. and i had to consciously make make an effort to think and move. i wasn't scared, or confused, nothing. i was just kinda like ""huh..."". and even then that ""huh..."" was forced. 

i told my boyfriend about it and he told me it sounds like dissociation. he's no expert by any means and i know everything's different for everyone but he dissociates, so hearing that coming from someone who knows they dissociate is a little concerning to me. 

i have POTS, as i mentioned, which also causes depression and anxiety for me. i also have OCD. also probably worth mentioning i have never experienced any trauma, aside from being ""backstabbed"" n such by ""friends"" lol

this has happened before but i never thought about it afterwards like i have been this time. i don't remember when or how it stopped, but it did. i was just building a house in the sims and i might have been listening to music but i don't remember 

any input would be greatly appreciated, thank you. i will definitely talk to my counselor about this next time i see them"
1146,Questions regarding my view of myself,"For as long as I can remember I've had a burning hatred for change. For  reasons upon reasons, I hate it. Anything changing, weather it's my age, my shoes, my room, my house, to things no one cares about, such as a building I've never gone into renovating or changing. It feels off, as if something isn't how it should be. I don't just go, ""Aw, that thing has been in my life for a while"" and move on. I consistently will think about it, till I'm either brought to tears, or I force myself into thinking of something else. Here are a few recent examples:

A. My room was recently completely changed (and I mean new walls, flooring, the whole room setup, etc.). We had to get bunkbeds for my little sister, meaning the bed I've had all my life is gone, which tore me apart. Every night all I think about is how much I miss the comfort of laying in my bed, with the same music I would listen to every night playing softly next to me. The walls were painted a different shade of white, the flooring is no longer carpet and is now wooden flooring, my room layout if completely different, and lots of my childhood things were taken out. Nothing feels the same, including myself. It doesn't make me feel like me.

B. My shoes have been the same pair for the past three years. If I go out in any other pair I don't feel like myself, instead being a different person. Same goes for my outfit honestly, and my clothing style. No matter how old and how badly they're falling apart every month, I'd rather get weird looks from peers than feel the sadness I'd feel getting rid of them.

C. My fathers truck was sold recently, and this for some reason felt like the end of the world to me. I remember having to put my sunglasses on so no one would see me cry. That same week we got rid of all my childhood stuffed animals, which already made me ball for weeks.

Soooo yep. Now, I would chalk all this up to me being emotionally attached to objects, people, and places, and I wouldn't have even asked this on reddit. But what I wanna know is this: Why does it effect my personality, and who I am? 

For some reason, I tend to refer to myself as a character. I do activities I think ""Abby"" (my name) would do, or clothing ""Abby"" would wear, and stuff like that. And even locations make me think, ""Abby doesn't live there."" So why is that? If anything changes, ""the story changes."" Aka, my life. In my head I'm not a person, I'm a character created by me, and her name is Abby. I've made my personality, my locations, my friends, my weaknesses, and my views as if it's a fictional tale. The issue is I don't have much control over these things, so if something even small changes I can't take it.

I know this is long, and quite honestly don't know if it's a mental health issue. All I know is I want answers, or atleast someone elese point of view/perspective on this."
1147,Is it safe for me to start these meds late?,"A few months ago, maybe even a year ago, I got prescribed 20mg of Fluoxetine but was too scared to take them.
I’m aware now that they’re not scaring but I’m not sure if I can still take them, I’m not on any new meds or anything like that, should it be fine? Or should I go back and ask my doctor, still depressed so 👍"
1148,Epilepsy and Wellbutrin please help,"When I was 15 years old I had 4 or more drug induced grand mil seizures in the same night, one at my friends at 3 at the hospital. My doctor had me get a MRI scan, a cat scan, and a EEG, he then diagnosed me with epilepsy. I’m 20 years old now and he has me on Wellbutrin because every single ssri and snri didn’t work for me and reacted really bad to my body. One of the side effects to this medication are seizures but I’m on a med and have been on for years benzodiazepines to control my seizures and anxiety. He doesn’t tell me anything so basically what I’m wonder is what made him diagnose me with epilepsy and be so strict on the fact I’m still epileptic I’m legitimately still prone to having seizures or not. Note: I dance with a led whip but only on solid, I cannot handle most lights if they are flickering or flashing, certain noises are triggering, Wellbutrin is also still giving me severe anxiety. Is this a lifetime thing? I’m on 150mg Wellbutrin, 5mg clonazepam, and 50mg quitepine but I rarely take the 50mg. If there’s any other subs I could post this on please let me know in the comments."
1149,Question about getting anti-depressants,"Hey, I'm a 17M and next month I turn 18. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since middle school. To be fair, I did have some good two years with this girl who I knew since elementary but never pulled a move till high school (we were both introverted and anxious messes). But I broke up due to not feeling that connection anymore and it has been two years of feeling like I have no direction again.

Last year was my most self-destructive. I failed every class and lost joy for my hobbies. I find any recreational activity I do today pointless and do it passively. Then I get these random thoughts of regret and think of alternative futures of me being happy or in love again. It seemed like that kid who had a passion for computer science is gone and this imposter who would rather sleep all day and live in regret takes his place. I just listen to the same playlist everyday, watch videos to pass time or in some cases force myself to sleep.

I wanted to ask if I can get anti-depressants without my family knowing?  I know I should talk to them but that is the last thing I want to do. I truly just want this to be as anonymously as possible between a doctor and me. This would be my first time talking about my mental health issues since my old teacher told me to meet him after class to talk privately. He noticed a kid who usually averaged B's/go from F's and was just asking questions. We were both suprised when I had a breakdown before his eyes. That was the only time I cried in my teen years. Just his questions of what was wrong and how I felt and just him repeating it over and over. These flurry of emotions just came out and as hard as I tried to keep my emotions in I couldn't fight it. He sent me to this counselor who only saw me a couple of times. I have difficulty and anxiety talking about these issues with others I don't trust. My family is great but I don't feel comfortable talking to them about this. 

So if you can tell me the process of getting anti-depressants to relieve some anxiety? Can I get them online? How much is the cost? Is there some that relieve anxiety?

On a positive note, I'm doing better in school. I managed to stay on top of my work and I'm gonna try to get in this trade school. I just am not happy or at peace and don't know if that will stop this. I told myself if this doesn't get better in 10 years I will leave everything behind and become a drifter in LA as a joke but I might do something drastic in the future if nothing changes.

Thank you and if you are struggling, I hope you get better."

I can't even get any sleep
It's happening every week
Like why you do that
Push him away when you know that he won't leave ur brain
Why you do, why you do that
Act like you want him but run when it falls into place
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it
But just know it's a part of me
I text him him I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
When I know it's my fault for ruining things
But I ain't did shit but be the real thing
You know I'm the real and I will never change
I've never been the one to try to explain
While he catches feels I'ma sip on this drank
It's easing my pain
I got real shit to stress about you know i ain't worried 'bout shit
Remember that I was a real one, now I ain't worried 'bout shit
I got real shit to stress about you know I ain't worried 'bout shit
Remember that I was a real one
So I found me a new thing I'm not as lost as you think
Gotta plenty dudes in my dms, all they want is me and that dank

1151,"Considering ending a relationship while in a clearly unstable state, fluctuating view of my s/o","I don’t know what to do. I feel like normally I idolize him and make him out to be a great, simply misunderstood person. And now I am fucking seething, so angry over him not getting a joke I made. That’s all that happened, he just didn’t get a reference, and suddenly im seething with hatred for hours. Why can’t I just see him normally?? Why did this change even more when I got into a relationship with him?

I’ve had this happen with other friends but it’s happening so intensely with him. It happened in the past and the same thing happened except I did break up with him, then regretted it later.

I don’t know what to do. I feel so fucked up and confused right now. I just want to know how I actually feel so I can make a choice and move on."

1154,How do you go about finding a good therapist?,"I’m UK based and due to covid I’d probably have to receive it via zoom which in a way, I actually don’t mind because that opens me up to therapists that aren’t in my area.

1156,Currently pregnant and its taking a toll on my mental health.,"I'm currently 6wks or so pregnant. My last baby is currently 2 and I really struggled with mental health after she was born. I've always struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a kid / teen. Once I had my daughter I was diagnosed with postpartum depression, anxiety, ocd, rage, and psychosis. Before I got pregnant I was only really struggling with anxiety and rage. Now that I'm pregnant I'm struggling again with bouts depression, anxiety, rage, mood swings, and paranoia. The paranoia really scares me. I'm scared it will become full blown psychosis again. 

My husband is currently working out of town and I can't help but feel like he's being suspect. I feel like he's cheating on me even though I know deep down he wouldn't never do that. I feel like I can't trust him. Part of me doesn't feel connected to him anymore. I honestly just want to get an abortion, file for a divorce, and start over again. I don't feel like myself anymore. I know its got to be a combination of the pregnancy hormones and my husband not being here. I feel so alone. I feel like my ex husband is out to get me again. I experienced this postpartum with my daughter. I hate these feelings. I don't want to go on antipsycotics again. They make me gain weight or have horrible side effects for me. 

I'm scared to tell my husband how I'm feeling because he mentioned in a previous conversation that if I was feeling suicidal he's put me in a hospital. I don't want to go to a mental health facility where I'd be away from my two kids. My youngest still nurses. I just feel lost. 

Has anyone experienced psychosis while pregnant? I just needed to get this out. Not really sure what I'm looking for."
1157,Mood swings,"I have been diagnosed with ocd, anxiety, and depression in the past, but now I feel like there is something else going on. I know I get mad easily to the point my heart pounds and chest hurts. I have noticed my mood changing a lot lately. I feel numb, then happy. Happy the aggravated. I will want to be left alone. I feel like screaming. I feel like I cannot express myself. I have urges to do stupid stuff, I will have the urge to hurt myself or break something. It is getting annoying. I want to be left alone but I don't at the same time. I am getting annoyed easily."
1158,I'm gonna do the right thing tonight.,"I'm a pathetic leech living in my parent's house. I struggled to find a job for years and I spend all my time on my computer because I don't have any local friends. My father and mother hate me and I have to feel it every day. They only keep me around because my dad is sick.

My online friends cut me out of their lives after I lied to and manipulated them and after my ex had a meltdown over something insignificant that I got blamed for. She got away with everything and gets to be happy while I rot from the inside. I tried to apologize and I just got blocked.

I'm lonely. I just want my friends back. Instead the few friends that I still had abandoned me today and convinced me that dying is the only good option.

Im supposed to go to a psychiatrist next month but I won't make it. I don't have the strength and I don't care about calling for help. I don't know what else to do. Everyone just said 'Dont do it' without reasons why, or something that I could do. I'm done. I just want to stop being a burden to everyone around me. It wont get better. My plan is to drive to a large bridge I know and jump into the water, which should hopefully kill me and relieve my family."
1159,Recurring bad dreams - no theme.,"Just looking for some insight i suppose. Ive read that  bad dreams/nightmares stem from PTSD, and even just anxiety and depression which I believe i have all 3, maybe bipolar. I was abused til I was 19 and since I moved out its been where I need to be but it hasn't been easy, I've been through some shit. 

The first year I started having nightmares directly replaying the events that made me leave my parents house, that would wake me up in tears and unable to breathe. I haven't had one like that in years now but I'll have periods maybe once a month, sometimes longer where I just have bad dreams every night, like really intense action movies. Nobody close to me dies or anything like that, just a lot of like, running from bad guys type of thing, to simplify. Really ominous feel, like how it feels watching a horror movie right before the ghost pops out. 
They don't wake me up anymore except rare occasions but ill usually wake in the morning with my heart beating fast and fully on high alert for whatever danger I'd just been dreaming about. 

Really just curious if anyone has an idea for the cause of this, just loads of mental issues and stress maybe? I've never had a problem sleeping as it was my coping mechanism but starting this year its becoming hard for me to fall asleep without being completely exhausted, and I've been waking up more at night and staying up. Like right now, its 5am and I've been awake since 230. My anxiety has been worse the last month, I just feel like I can't calm down at night and if I wake up at all after falling asleep I either lay there feeling like I'm running a race or I have to force myself to fall back asleep..."
1160,Getting zoned out when with a group.,I am getting zoned out and getting the feeling of left out even when I am with my most dearest friends or my close cousins. I want to leave and be alone. I am experiencing a feeling of insecurity that no one is interested in me. I recently gained weight which decreased my self esteem. I don't like how I look currently. I am not being able to confidently meet or talk to anyone. This makes me dislike gatherings. I don't want to meet anyone but at the same time I feel lonely. It feels like all my shortcomings are getting magnified and making me feel like they are the reason no one talks to me. I started doing diet and exercise and I hope I lose weight and gain my self confidence. I was once used to be very confident.
1161,"I have been depressed for a third of my life, and I am afraid it will never end."," 

I am thoroughly and completely broken, all the time. I am stuck in a loop that began very subtly, and, frankly, also purposefully, because I was a child indulging in the only feelings available to her. I find myself protecting my childhood innocence as if she is present and presently needs protecting. I am 25, and she is a broken rib that I am bent over in pain trying to protect from any mild harm that could make the pain worse and the deafening eternity of life seem longer.

I find myself debating *how* I could even begin to undo all the harm that was done to me. 

I reprimand myself for feeling sorry for myself, but that does not stop me in any capacity from feeling sorry for myself, it simply adds a layer of self-hatred to the preexisting self-pity. 

I have spent a decade of my life confronting former guardians who have failed completely at guardianship, and received apologies so empty that they reveal a black hole that oozes terror and consumes anything that is good.

I have lost interest in everything that ever excited me. I am not able to share my body with anyone in love or passion. I am dead in every way but physical, and I want more than anything to enjoy a sense of normalcy and my youth. 

I am beautiful, intelligent, fun to be around, and I generally try to bring joy to the people around me, but for some reason, I cannot convince myself to live. I am in too much pain. 

I have tried to speak to psychologists but it seems every new motherfucker wants to give me a new diagnosis and bunch of pills, and I have now had four different diagnoses from different psychiatrists, and nothing has helped me get my shit in order. I am terrified.

I am very aware that so many people live their lives in pain much more haunting than mine, but the fact of the matter is I am so stuck and I am really trying not to kill myself, and I am very tired of being dismissed. I don't know how to help myself and it seems no one else knows either."
1162,How can I be there for my girlfriend with her mental health issues?,"We’ve been going out for half a year now but have been really good friends for a long time, and things have been really good, but she recently came to the realisation that she had been groomed by one of her previous boyfriends. It’s really taken a toll on her mentally and I don’t really know what to do. She can shift from really nice and affectionate to completely unresponsive and snappy almost out of the blue sometimes. This is one of the things I wanna get a handle on better because I think it upsets me way more than it should, because I know she just needs space sometimes, but the abrupt change can make my anxiety-ridden monkey brain go “you did a bad lol” and I really don’t want it to since it upsets her to see me upset. I’m a very paranoid person, and I usually have ways to sort of lessen it, I just really don’t want to screw this up.

I’ve asked how to help and she says I can’t really, not in any substantial way, so I’ve just been doing my best to let her know I hear her and I’m here for her whenever she needs me, and that I’m going to stay with her through this because I love her and I think she’s worth it. But if any of you have more concrete advice or just want to give any opinions at all, I would appreciate it to no end.

For context, we both struggle with mental health. We both deal with anxiety and depression a lot, and she’s had to contend with eating disorders. I’m also on the spectrum, Aspergers specifically. I’ll try answering any further questions.

Thanks in advance."

today is my birthday, i hate birthday, i hate everything, i hate social media, u know, everything looks fake, ive seen my friend reposting their story saying happy bday etc, i have some close friend but when it is my birthday, nobody give a damn. i have hundreds of friend on instagram, only 3 of them replied to my 1 and only stories saying happy bday to me.. im 25, and yeaah, i need to find real friend. im always worried about everything, tho it is better than a year ago, i still take my meds, and i use social media quite rarely nowadays.

I am currently struggling with dealing with expectations, both from me myself and from my friends/my family. This is resulting in me becoming completely burnout and nervous and tense when I want to be more chill and be able to enjoy life and the present more and being someone fun-loving that can be a positive presence... This is my objective but I cannot pinpoint what exactly has to change in my mindset and how I should change it. How do you find the right balance? Because too much expectation is toxic but honestly I do not think that removing all expectations on me is a solution at all...
I humbly thank you all in advance and have a nice day!"
1167,I dont feel like myself anymore,"It's been around 4-5 months that i have been feeling very weird.

I'll try to keep it simple, but overall i feel alienated from the people and the environment around me, everything seems so strange and different, and i started having memory problems that can be very annoying, i also feel numb most of the time, the only emotion i can still perceive is anger from time to time and im always irritated.

For context, i'm a 22 years old Male, i live with my family in a muslim country, but i'm not one of them anymore, i have suffered from anxiety and depression for years now, i treated the depression but the anxiety stayed, especially in the latest weeks, i've had immense phases of anxiety because of various causes that i cant really pinpoint.

I just dont like staying like this for longer, i want to feel normal again and to be engaged with the people around me and not live my life in the 3rd person.

Any advice on what's happening? Or how to deal with it?"
1168,"Is my trauma legitimate, and do you have any advice?","So, the title is a bit misleading. I never watched this movie, but I was told the plot of it as a kid. To this day, the movie is a serious trigger for me. The main problem now is if I see the movie poster. And if I were to see a picture of the movie, I would have no clue how I wouldn’t handle it. It would probably cause me to cry &amp; heave uncontrollably.

The movie is called h*man c*ntipede. Please excuse me not being able to write the whole name out, but just looking at the censored name makes me feel disgusting, and the whole thing would be really hard to look at. I should note that this was several years ago that I was traumatized by the plot of this movie. I am now 19, and I am still feeling the effects of it, well over 10 years later. I am now extremely enamored by the horror genre (even the goriest, most fucked up horror movies). But this movie has stuck with me for far too long.

When I was very very young, I was told the plot of this movie and it shook me to my core. For a long time, I was deeply triggered by the number 3, bending over, centipedes &amp; caterpillars, the word “human”, and any stitching on human flesh. (These are legitimate claimz, I promise.) To this day, I find myself a little bit better at handling these triggers. I am able to say the title of the movie out loud during the daytime, and I even had the courage to ask my friend to read me a plot description (something I deeply regretted that night). My main fear is ever seeing a picture from this movie. That is my biggest fear in the whole world.

The other day, I was wearing a white face mask, and upon realizing that having a mass of white stitching around my mouth was reminiscent of that movie, and I jumped so hard, the car I was driving swerved. I still have nightmares about this movie’s plot. I had to unsubscribe from my favorite youtube channel, Deadmeat (which reviews horror movies) because I became far too afraid that he would review this movie and put a picture of it in the thumbnail. Please help me!

My main problem is that people who carry trauma have been through legitimately traumatizing events, but the deep scarring I carry with me is just from a movie I was merely told the plot of. I think it hurt me so deeply because it was a realistic story that was far more fucked up than anything I could ever have imagined. The issue is, if I had learned about this movie today instead of back then, I would have been the one who made my friends watch it &amp; laughed at its ridiculousness. Do you have any advice for handling this trauma? Or does this even count as trauma? Is this all in my head?"
1169,"I had hope, the only hope, for me to live on and I lost her","I thought I had something going on with a certain someone I knew online but she broke up with me because of her mental health issues and she was all I had. I don't blame her.. but she was my only hope to live. Now I have no one to love.. I was just not meant to be loved, everyone I've ever cared for has eventually left. 

(Everything was perfect, just.. the time wasn't right for her, she has alot on her plate so I don't blame her at all..)

I had so many future and life plans with her and now all that's left is the emptiness of her leaving and I don't think anything can fix this.. I don't even know what to do with my life now. All my plans were with her..

I can't study for shit and studying is essential if you want to survive in this world, let alone be ""happy"". I don't even know if I'll be done with high school this year or not. This year has been terrible for my mental health and I couldn't study anything the entire year, and the finals are getting closer and I have nothing prepared plus now I got a heartbreak to deal with. I think I'll fail so hard. And then my family will fuck my non-existent mental health up.

I have an abusive family and so I don't even have that going for me.. I just got no one at all. I just wanted someone to love and be with and care for each other, love each other, tell each other secrets that no one in the world knows, be loyal to them and them only, respect them, take care of them, and have something that's fixed In my life that actually brings happiness, other than the sweet release of death (god I sound so emo lmao) but apparently that's asking too much.. 

I used to self harm regularly but my ex made me so happy that I just stopped, but I think I'll start cutting again too, as hurt as I am rn.. 

I just don't think I will live for long.. this was my destiny, to kill myself one day, probably.."
1170,best antidepressant for me? (advice),"
Im 26 years old and want to try antidepressants finally, after waiting for so long and doing anything to get better by myself.

In my last couple of years i drank alcohol pretty much every weekend, went to a lot of parties, tried some stimulants and felt like shit afterwards everytime, but it was always ok after 2-3 days. 
Now since covid-19 and the last months im in a downspiral without seeing any hope anymore. 
I sleep like shit, sometimes i cant sleep for DAYS. 
My thoughts are not structured anymore and i cant find inner peace, like theres always something holding me back from being happy and living in the moment.

I don't care about any of the positive in my life. I am a miserable human being and I hate my mother for pushing me out of her cunt into this horrible existence. Let me explain why I am so miserable. 

I am.behind in school which is my fault. I work in retail for a boss who always reminds me that I no matter how hard I work, it's never enough. The customers suck, I get robbed all the time, threatend ect.. Needless to say my job is very toxic. My mother always hounds me when I am not at work, the bitch asks why I am not workingshould be happy considering my circumstances. I live in a nice home, I am healthy( recently got into good shape via losing weight and lifting), I am employed when so many arent, ect. In spite of my attempts to count my blessings I am still miserable. So I have decided I won't be seeing Christmas this year. I have some Xanax I will take with some vodka. Hopefully it will kill me. I will undo the damage my mother has done to me. Goodbye everyone. My pathetic life is ending soon. At least I'll be high when it happens."
1175,Sad rn,Need someone to talk
1176,Theres no help when you're stuck in the middle.,"I've recently been waiting for a psychiatrist appointment, in the hopes it would give me some extra help and the possibility of changing medication as this was a recommendation of my GP. When I had the appointment, I came out feeling so broken and lost. I couldn't tell if I had put my expectations way too high for the appointment leading myself to get disappointed, but fuck has it broken me. Theu essentially reiterated everything I've been told before ""do CBT"" (which I've have on my record that CBT doesn't personally help me) and ""call helplines if you need them"". I feel like I was just expecting so much more and feel so completely lost and not listened too, I feel so alone. My counsellor is the only one I have at the moment and they want me to change that, but that would be going onto ANOTHER waiting list for idk how long and I really don't have the strength to do that. I have an appointment with my therapist to talk to her tomorrow, which I already know I'm gonna bawl at. I just feel like theres no help when you're in the middle? I'm too depressed for the basis care but 'not depressed enough' for hospitalisation or further care and it hurts. I feel like no one wants to help me. I've spoken to my therapist about these thoughts, but I've told her before that in times like these, I get these thoughts that I almost have to do ""something really bad"" for someone to actually listen. I don't really know where I'm going with this post, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel so stuck in the middle and this hurts. It really hurts.

TL;DR I constantly feel like I'm stuck in the middle, I'm too depressed for the basis care but 'not depressed enough' for hospitalisation or further care."
1177,Mental health on the decline with no one to turn to,"***TW: selfharm and depression***


Im struggling with university, but I thought to myself 'at least its christmas'.
Then my country went into lockdown, but I thought to myself 'at least I will still have my surgery'.
Then my surgery was cancelled and I thought to myself ' at least my family will be with me'.
Then they cancelled their flights because they felt it wasnt worth the risk (which is fair).


For the past two months my mental health has gotten worse and worse. I moved away from home this year to start my first year of university and its been really hard, Ive had mental problems before but felt that I had already recovered, that I didnt need help anymore. But I just cant keep up with the workload, and I dont want the university to know about my problems, I dont want them to treat me like a fragile nutjob.


The people I normally turn to arnt avaliable; my therapist is on holiday, my mother has broken down crying, the stress is just too much for her and I need to be strong for her, same goes with my sister. I have to be positive for my family, everyone is feeling low so I have to make them happy, I cant cry, I cant be angry, I cant breakdown.


I feel the same way I felt when I was self harming, this bottled up feeling, like Im trapped in a narrow tunnel and cant breathe. Ive been clean for a year now, I nearly relapsed last month, I dont want to relapse again but there is no one I can talk to.


One after the other, the situation gets worse and worse but the worst part is that I cant show how much it hurts, because my family is also hurting and I have to be there for them, especially my mother. Shes going through so much stress right now and I have to support her.


I dont know what to do, I feel like one tiny breeze will be enough to push me over the edge and try to hurt myself, I know Im in a dangerous spot, and I know I should call for help but there is no one to call.


I suppose this is more of a vent than anything but some words of support would be appreciated, there isnt much advice to be had in a situation like this, I just need to try and survive this."
1178,How to stop taking myself and others so seriously?,I’ve been like this since I was a kid. It’s always been hard to relax and have fun. I’m always overthinking myself and everyone and everything.

Depersonalization?","I've looked up depersonalization and disassociation but the descriptions don't really capture what I feel when I look at myself in the mirror at times. It's not triggered by anything in particular, as far as I can tell. But I definitely lose my sense of self.

When I'm in this sort of state, I feel like I'm a universal consciousness where ""I"" am not an individual human. It feels bizarre and constraining to be in a human body. When I look in the mirror when I'm like this, it's very jarring.

My boyfriend knows about all that but I think he doesn't understand and thinks I just don't want to talk to people, cry for no reason because I just overreact and self harm because I'm dumb. I can't explain how it really is to him simply because I don't know how to. Would sending articles and asking him to read it be a good idea?"
1183,Looking for some guidance,"Hello everyone! 

I’m new to Reddit, so please bare with me! 

Basically, I believe (after doing some research) that I might have a mood disorder

To give you some context about me, I used to be a very calm and collected kid. I was always regulated, my mood was generally the same and I was never too happy or too sad

Now, I did have absolutely horrible social anxiety, I was not able to function fluently at work or school, so eventually I was put on Lexapro 10mg. 

The lexapro worked somewhat in the months that followed, but my social anxiety (and inner confidence in general) was still so terrible. I started smoking pot, per my friends suggestion and after smoking nightly for months boyyyyy did it make a difference. My social anxiety had made a huge improvement 

Fast forward to about one year later, and my smoking habits have escalated quite a bit. Most days, I smoke when I wake up, follow up multiple times throughout the day, and then just smoke as much as I want before bed. 

After that happened, this is how I feel now:

- I have no social anxiety whatsoever. I never ever have any problems talking to people and am so confident in myself.

- Most of the time I feel like I can take over the world and no one can stop me 

- I have an intense, un-ending motivation for my job. I have so much energy while I’m there, and can handle anything and know I’m doing a great job 

- I don’t care what people think about me, my own progress validates myself 

- I am so so so extremely happy. There is not a minute of the day that I don’t have a smile on my face and I love talking to random people as much as I can 

- The one bad thing is that my anger has also escalated a lot. I am so irritable now out of nowhere and literally turn into a complete asshole when I feel like someone has wrong done me

However, that usually lasts for about a few days to a week, and then I will suddenly crash.

When this happens, everything is terrible again. I’ll wake up in an anxiety attack, have no motivation to even shower or brush my teeth (on these days, I go to work without even getting ready at all) and constantly feel doomed going into my work day. When I get to work, I’m quiet the whole day, depressed, anxious, I’ll constantly go to the bathroom throughout the day and just sit there for a few minutes feeing like shit, wishing to god that for some reason ill get sent home for the day or something. During these times, I feel like I am just like broken down and can’t function like I usually do.

I know this is probably mostly caused by my weed usage, as I smoke a lot, but I’m confused because it really does help me so much. I love the times where my mood is good, I’m so much more powerful of a person than I used to be and I really am excelling at my job and my parents are very happy about that.

Thank you guys in advance for reading! Any guidance and worldly experience would be appreciated"
1184,How can you tell if you’re releasing [built up or not] stress?,"I question this because when I look it up, like ways to reduce and “release” stress, it says things like: write it down, meditate, exercise, etc. 

Which, don’t get me wrong, I agree with most of them, it’s just how can you *physically* tell that you are indeed releasing stress, instead of just putting the current stressfulness in the back seat while you focus on those things?

Because for me, I struggle with generalize anxiety, which basically means I’m in stress mode constantly. I’m always on high alert &amp; worry about every move I make. Trust me I wish I could control it, but that’s just my makeup. 

Anyways, when I do one of these tasks for ‘stress release’—say I meditate—I may feel a bit less stressed in the moment, because I’m obviously not focusing on my stress, but afterwards it’s like I’m right back to square one. Stressed and tense AF. 

I understand that meditation specifically is meant to help you get out of that headspace, but for the overall stress reduction techniques, they all temporarily release or maybe just hide the current stress that’s being experienced. 

So no matter what I do, I will still always be stressed. If I were to live a more stressless life, I would have to live my life IN meditation, or DOING exercises, or WRITING the whole time. 

And I also understand that stress is inevitable, that it’s not all bad, but I just want to understand how you know that you’ve released stress. 

Because having a heart condition, makes me extra worrisome of letting myself get so stressed all the time in fear my heart will give out due to the constant stress I experience. (Yeah I’m 22) 

Like, is just the feeling of relaxation the sign that you’ve released stress? Loosened muscle tension? But then I go right back to being tense so it’s like almost pointless (in a sense) to do these if you will just feel stressed right after.

(I’m not at all trying to combat any stress release techniques, I’m just really curious how to know when you’ve released stress inside you so I can personally look for it myself &amp; just understand better)"

1186,Need someone to talk to,That's it 😔
1187,Crippling anxiety and panic attacks,"Recently I have been having pretty server anxiety and crippling panic attacks, to the point where everyday before going out into the public I have a panic attack. I can feel when I’m having a panic attack, my stomach starts to ache, my heart feels like it’s going to beat out of my chest, my knees and arms start to feel weak, I stat forgetting things, and I start to have a shortness of breath. I don’t feel comfortable telling my parents about this. Is there anyone else out there that understands me and can tell me I’m not alone?"
1188,A worried boyfriend,"So firstly this post is not about me, but my girlfriend (long distance relationship, lockdown is making it difficult to meet regularly) She's been sad/depressed for the last 2-3 weeks. Talking about being moodless and unproductive during her days even though she's always doing something I'd consider productive. Like baking, her school work or other stuff. But she also stays up a lot more late (than usual) and wakes up in the afternoon if she doesn't have to wake up sooner. Even if she has to, she usually sleeps through her classes. It's getting progressively more and more difficult and today we had an argument. I'm just worried about her. Bad moods are not uncommon but never this bad. Any help/advice? Thank you."
1189,"I know that I might sound spoiled while I say this, but please, just listen","So, I'm a minor so I live with my parents. The other week they told me and my older sister that we're going to Turkey for the entire summer. Ever since then I've be stressing over the approaching day.

To understand my stress, you first must understand me. I am a 14 year old man who has a cat named Leo that I love very much. I've had bad mental health since forever and my Arab parents have not helped at all. But, I've found ways to escape from my problems. I got a PS4 for my 10th birthday and got a Nintendo Switch Lite for my 14th birthday. I'm a gamer, and I often use video games to escape from reality and imagine myself as the character I'm playing as, who was usually a badass that doesn't take shit from anyone. I also often just spend time with my cat, and I often joke about him being my therapist. I don't know how I survived without him, and I'm damn sure that if we never got him, I'd probably be dead by now.

So now that you know about me, I think it goes without saying that I don't want to be anywhere without video games or my cat for more than a week. If we were only going for a week, it's fine I guess, the country may or may not be self imploding by the time we get there but, it's only a week. 3 whole months? Absolutely not. I don't know how to tell my parents that I don't want to go without sounding like the most spoiled and un-thankful piece of shit in the world, and if we do end up going, I know for a fact that I'm going to end up dead.

Thank you so much for listening and one last thing, my DMs are open for anybody that's struggling because I find that helping others is one of the best ways to make yourself feel good."
1190,Is my paranoia just my anxiety? And whenever I bring up my paranoia to my psychiatrist she brushes it off and pretends I’ve said nothing and that it’s 100% anxiety.,"For more background: I’ve been slightly paranoid since I was around 11/12 but it’s gotten increasingly worse over the last 4 years. Sometimes it’ll be fine for a month, other times it’ll go for months at a time. I’ve brought it up to my psychiatrist but she acts like it’s just anxiety… is it? She also believes I have PTSD but won’t diagnose me with it for reasons I don’t know. (I was quite paranoid before some traumatic incidents). I almost constantly feel bugs crawling on me, a demon in the corner of my room (an entity so can’t see him but can sense him), everyone wants to hurt me or kill me, people watching me despite me being alone - all of these things follow me into my nightmares too which are very graphic and disturb me a lot. Sometimes though I’ll just feel as though people are watching me, and it might be like that for a couple months, next thing I know it’s the whole lot thrown in for months at a time. I don’t know if I’m just over thinking it or just want it to stop or if I just want answers honestly."
1191,I need to know if anybody else has this,"I feel depressed like out of no where and then ill feel completely normal and be my happy self the depression lasts for like a week or 2 maybe even 4 sometimes and then the happiness the same, I get violent and fucked up thoughts in my head out of no where the where I start to think to myself that I'm a literal psycho, I shut myself off from people because I don't like myself like this and I doubt they would aswell, anyone else like this or no somewhat of wtf this shit is 🤷🏻‍♂️ bc its getting pretty fucking hard lately"

Has this happened to anyone else? Am I alone with this? And how long did it last for anyone else? I’m scared I’ll be like this forever and I don’t know what to do"
1193,How do you deal with intrusive and obsessive thoughts?,"So I'm 19m and up until recently my mental health has been relatively ok. Currently though I've been experiencing some very worrying thoughts of a graphic and sexual nature. It's really getting to me and I'm finding my mind to be more like a prison, as normal chains of thought are often being completely derailed by these intrusive thoughts. 

I've wanted to see a therapist for months but face to face is still unavailable and I'm not really comfortable with conversations over the phone. 

Just really frustrated as these thoughts are making feel like a terrible person. Does anyone have any advise on how to deal with this? 

Thank you in advance"
1194,Sex is the only reason why I pursue any relationship.,"I am very lonesome man, an introvert by choice and don't really have or had much friends in life. I never wanted it and never really missed on not having a social life. I had a ton of issues in life that I needed to work on and I didn't have adults to help me with them when I was young. So, I never really learned to trust or share my life with anyone at any age. 

Today I am 27 and was introspecting my life and I realized that without sex, I don't really care for a relationship. Probably, when I was younger I accounted this for my age then and never really worked on it. But, as I grew older I learned how to be in healthy relationships which is a big deal for me because I was born in a toxic home and was getting myself in toxic relationships and I was personally toxic too in the past and I wanted that to change. The part of my life that I have a choice in, I wanted it to be for my best.  

My recent relationship was the most healthiest one I ever had in my life. It ended last month, lasted over a year and we never had a toxic moment; it was an achievement or a life goal come true for me. When she broke up with me, I wasn't sad (I should have been) but instead I just moved on. That's when I realized that I don't seek for a relationship if I am not in need for a sexual partner. 

Now, this is the interesting part, I am sexually numb. Sex is more of a compulsive act for me, I don't personally enjoy it. I have never felt even a kiss. I just want that high of making my partner cum and then cum after her. My father raped me when I was 5 and that was my first ever sexual encounter and back then I didn't know what sex was. But, as far as I remember it I didn't enjoy him or even was aware what he was doing and it wasn't that often either. Also, it happened 22 years ago. 

I believe I have all the right ideals for a relationship in my head. I have worked over the past years of my life on emotional maturity, financial independence, communication skills, being proactive, choosing risk free sex life, making sure that I don't make decisions with my member and worked on everything that my parent's never worked on in their marriage. I did all those to hopefully one day wake up and tell myself that I didn't become like them. But, here's the punchline; emotionally, physically and spiritually I can't connect with human beings other than for satisfying a meaningless compulsion for my sexual gratification."
1195,"Cant feel any emotion for 1 week, whats happening to me.","For the last week i've nonstop been feeling nothing or emptiness and i dont know how to combat it, every single day feels like shit, i always wake up at 4 in the afternoon or later, I cant get enough sleep and instead left with thoughts like ""Im a dissapointment"" or ""No one cares about you anymore"" and even if someome acknowledges me for doing something good i'll just think that what they said wasn't ttue and it was just self pity that made them sag this.Often i just feel sick or im just tired but for 1 week long that this is happening? It's beginning to rot my brain and destroying parts of me.



If you're wondering about how and why im in this mood i dont know either, all i know is that im always feeling pain, every single day just nothing but sadness and doubt all over me, I've also become quite anxious about my actions on what will happen there or that, and sometimes I just dont talk at all.

Please if you know something please tell me, I just cant take it anymore."
1196,What should I do to avoid numbing myself when I feel pain?,"I didnt get good sleep last night and I'm feeling super down and sad.

1197,Is it possible to take tics?,"It’s in the title, but I’ll elaborate. 
Last night I was chatting with my mom. I just ticked out of the blue, as it tends to be. It wasn’t a dramatic tic, just a head twitch. She said “oh come on, you don’t have a tic” 
And now I feel like I’m faking it. I don’t think I’m faking it. Im not trying to get attention, I don’t want attention. It’s annoying when I tic. But now I feel like I am faking it. Is it even possible to fake a tic?"
1198,How do I tell my mom that I might need to get back on my meds...,"Normally I take 100mg of zoloft, but the past month or so I've been trying to get off it because my friend has gotten off his anti depressants. But ive discovered that for me zoloft isn't so much a antidepressant as much as a anxiety medicine. I have really bad sensory overload, it's gotten to the point multiply times where I physically can't get the words together to talk. The part that sets it off the worse is people saying things multiply times to me. Stuff like getting instructions multiply times or hearing the same thing multiply times makes me get very frustrated with people. It just gets to the point where I answer with a very short ""ok"" or ""sure"" to whatever they say. Ever since I tried getting off zoloft it's just been getting worse, especially around my mom. She often repeats instructions multiply times to people which dosent fit in well with my problem. It gets really bad while driving because she'll tell me multiply times in a few seconds to do something and I end up snapping at her and then she just tells at me for 20 or so minutes about it. I don't know how to tell her that I need to get back on it because I feel like she's gonna bring up how my brother was able to get off it fine because his was just antidepressants and he didn't have nearly as bad anxiety as I do"
1199,Is This Normal? Could It Be Seasonal?,"Hey guys!

So last week, I had my first major panic attack. Never felt anything like it before. Before last week, I was very energetic and unbothered by my issues. Felt normal and good in other words.

But last week brought all that to a halt. And after that, for a few more days I began feeling very anxious. It was all a constant and continuous anxiety fueled sensation in the form of a heavy feeling on my chest and breathing. During that time, I seeked help and after finding out my health and asthma was fine, I spoke to a therapist who gave me the option of taking medication. I accepted. And after speaking to them in another session and venting about some issues, I felt instantly better. To the point where the last few days, the anxiety could be considered almost gone. I no longer worry about another panic attack. Nor the heaviness in my chest. And I decided to not take the medication since my therapist also said it doesn't seem like I need them long-term.

But here's the catch. When I'm not distracted or feeling well, which admittedly does happen sometimes during the day which is good, I feel a sense of apathy. Not sadness. But not happiness. I don't get excited about my games or shows like I used to. I just feel like I'm rolling with the motions which sucks. Due to that, I began taking the medication (Zoloft) two days ago. But I feel like it kinda worsened my mood. Hasn't allowed me to sleep well and I've noticed I feep much emptier. Which is why I stopped taking it today.

So until I speak to my therapist again, I decided to ask if this was normal? For anxiety to suddenly appear but then go away? Only for it to be replaced by bouts of apathy? Could it be due to the winter? During the spring and summer, I'm the opposite of this. Very cheerful and so on.

Any input is appreciated! And thank you!"

1203,(this is long but i needed to give some context) Just had a really bad anxiety/ panic attack now i feel like something inside of me wants to hurt me???? i’m really scared,"Hey, this is my first post on here, something happened today and i’m pretty freaked out and scared and i’m hoping someone has gone through something similar and maybe knows what could help or what this is called so i can do some research on the topic.

Im 21 and i’ve had a rough couple of months last year and fell into a pretty big depression and for the last 6 months things have gotten better and have been trying to figure out if the depression had left and I was just dealing with some leftover symptoms or if I was still going through the depression even though my overall life situation had improved.

I started going to gestalt therapy about a month and a half ago but I couldn’t feel a real difference, but I just figured it would take some time.

Last week’s session was the hardest one I’ve had for sure, did some visualizations to try to relate my feelings with certain body parts and see how they react with eachother and when I had to pay attention to my stomach (turns out I feel most of my emotions either in my stomach or my chest) I saw it as if it was vacuum packed, brown and in a really bad state overall and when my therapist asked me what I would feel like saying to it, all I could say was “You better suck it up, you better keep working through this, everything is really shit right now and I need you to work. I wish I could do more for you but right now I can’t help you”, and we related this to some things that I’ve had to say to myself in the past when going through tonight times.

Either way, my therapist asked me to pay attention to my stomach throughout this week until my next session, see what I notice. And even though the session was really tough, i’ve been having pretty normal days. 

This morning I woke up, went to have breakfast with some friends (i live in spain so we can do this rn with some restrictions) and when i got home, made some coffee for my boyfriend as a surprise since he had just woken up and got into bed to just chill and cuddle.

Then slowly I started to feel kind of weird, like emotionally numb but also kind of sad, I told him about it (he’s well aware of my mental health lately and he supports me a lot), so he asked me if I wanted some space or if he should stay, so I asked him to leave me alone for a bit so I could have some time to myself and see if it would pass. 

Then I just basically started spiralling and thinking a lot of negative thoughts about myself and how I’m not doing enough to achieve the things I want, about how I’m truly not happy and just generally bad stuff, and feeling both super sad and really numb at the same time.

After a while my boyfriend came back in to cuddle with me, asking me how I was doing and trying to figure out what I want, how he could help and what I wanted to do, but at this point I couldn’t even speak anymore (this happens when I get in this state but he can usually coax me out of it), then I just started crying and freaking out very quietly, I started biting my finger and the cover in a very anxious manner (i don’t think he could tell as I had turned my back to him and he was hugging me from behind). I was just jumping from crying and lowkey freaking out to feeling incredibly numb and getting really scared at how I was spiraling and being unable to show it or express it or talk about it. 

Then I started feeling a kind of depersonalization that I hadn’t felt in a really long time (when I was going through the hardest part of my depression I used to depersonalize a lot and it hasn’t been happening for a good 5 months) I got quite scared and sat up, my body started cramping up and I began to hyperventilate and get really scared, my boyfriend started trying to calm me down, trying to get me to breathe and at one point I closed my eyes and kind of felt like i was falling while my body was separating from myself and it scared the living shit out of me. 

I was panicking at all the things I was feeling and experiencing at once (my biggest fear since I was little is going crazy or losing my mind and not being aware of myself so mental health is a big big deal for me).

Finally after a couple minutes my boyfriend was able to calm me down and then I just sat there for about 30 minutes in disbelief, sadness and fear of what my brain just made me go through. Meanwhile my boyfriend was trying to talk about things with me, trying to get my mind off of things. 

Eventually I forced myself out of that state cause I could feel like I wasn’t getting anywhere but since this happened I feel like I’ve seen a part of me that’s been trying to hurt me, like a really evil “energy” it even feels like a presence and now that I’ve recognized it I feel like it’s inside of me watching everything i do it think or feel and it’s just waiting to fuck me up again, and I’m terrified of going to sleep and letting it get to me and spiraling again. 

I don’t believe in this sort of stuff, I know this is something that’s in my mind, but I can’t shake the feeling and it’s really creeping me out. I’ve never imagined or felt anything like this ever before,I’ve only ever gone through depression, anorexia and self harm, and this right know feels fucking terrifying. 

I just need someone to tell me if you know what this is, if I can shake this feeling, if you’ve gone through something similar or whatever, I have therapy on wednesday and I don’t think I can handle feeling this way till then. I’d really appreciate any insight because i’m really fucking scared."

I'd been feeling ok until then, until she told me that I should fake being happy, and I need to stop being miserable and find a way to fix it. 

You can bet I felt fucking fantastic after that.

I'm currently working on Christmas presents. It's so slow and time is moving too quickly and my stupid fucking perfectionist brain is telling me it's all shit and I need to do better and do stuff quicker. My bf (who the gift is for) told me to not bother if it's putting this much stress on me, but then I'll feel so very guilty like I always do.

Literally as I'm writing this, mum just came in to have a chat and gave me a solution that I don't want because it isn't what I wanted this to be and it isn't something I picture bf liking. This isn't going the way I wanted it to and I fucking hate myself. I should've done this and that and everything different, it's my fault it's all going sideways. I just want to crumple everything and give up on it and curl up and cry and not talk to anyone in this shitty goddamn house again.

Cheers folks."

She doesn’t like the medication, doesn’t believe it’s december, doesn’t believe people close to her are who they say they are, and also doesn’t think covid is real (totally unlike her) I’m scared. I never ever ever thought she’d have these intense of mental illnesses. Plus doesn’t help our family is Italian american and she was raised to not believe in mental health. Even though everyone now is telling her to take her meds she’s paranoid about everything. I feel so helpless and alone and at fault for this."

If I didn't take melatonin on the weekdays I would do it then.

My room is literally next to theirs. I can hear them, clearly. And after they got the attic room, it disgusts me when they run up the stairs and he spanks her thinking no ones around because everybody is asleep. Im not..

She always shouts on me for not interacting with him. Hes effing 52.. shes 36. He cheated on his wife with her. And hes using ber for her body because he has the money thus the power!

I curl up in my bed crying and screaming into my pellow after hearing them, hearing her moaning like that.. knowing he married her after only 3 dates because he has the money for it, hearing the bed squeaks, the giggles, the spanks, the fucking moans, I hold my hair almost tearing it all whenever I recall them, whenever I remember them, cry, scream, no one to talk to about cause were religious.

She calls me autistic, stupid, depressed, kid, useless, because I refuse to meet him when he visits us, and hide in my room for the entire day just not to see his face. And that THAT ""makes him sad""; because ""he feels like he dont fit in, since whenever he comes over you fucking hide in your room! and even when your sitting with us! your not even talking to him or giving him any attention and burrying your face in those lame books!""

I cant tell her that I dont like him because, I dont have a reason. The man is great, respectful and he helped us a lot. There is literally no reason for me to hate him to give as an excuse. 

I dont know how to tell her that I hate him.
She always asked me if I dont feel right with him, I said no, because Iv never seen her happy like this before. And if shes happy then Im happy. But I cant keep pretending anymore.. hearing them doing it is driving me crazy, im so disgusted.

maybe hearing others storries will bring me peace.
iv tried everything really,the only thing left is to confront them. thatd be hard because were religious and these things are hush-hush topics, also, telling them I could hear the spanking the moaning and giggles?

I cant.. itll be more awkward for them but.. I dont have the courage yet.
I might need to remind myself that im not alone.. its why im reading the stories here, I also need some supoort.. Thank you ❤"
1215,My dad keep calling me.. I want him to stop :(,"Since I was little, my dad never really was around.. I never really liked him. 
When I was teen  he used to lock me in my room and always get angry for no reason ...
He was drinking and smoking 

My parents got divorced  
And all my 26 years he never really talked to me.. only at my birthday. He gave all his attention to my little brother 
I guess he wanted a son 

Lately he keep calling me 
At first I was trying to be polite  and answered 
But it got worse and worse 
He kept calling more and more and I stopped answering.. 

My mental health cant take this .. Im not used to a father .. and he think that he can just call me and talk like nothings wrong.. I cant take it 
And Im too weak mentally to tell him to leave me alone.. I feel sorry for him.. 

I keep crying every time... I dont wanna talk to him... but its so painful to ignore him everytime :("
1216,University Breaks &amp; Mental Health,I noticed that after exams are over and if I am not working I get inside of my head too much. How can I stop this?
1217,How do I exercise?,"I'm on medication for high blood pressure and depression. I bought a Fitness watch and I don't get more than 3000 steps a day. I sit 4 hours at work, walk to get food, sit another 3-4 hours and then sit on my pc at home for 3-4 hours every day. How do I get my ass up to exercise? I hate exercising, it's a chore and not fun at all. It gets worse when I do it with other people, I'm only ashamed when I can't keep up and get very, very angry with myself. I hate my body, I'm ugly as hell, fat (175cm and 85kg, go figure) and I can't break through my depression, anxiety and self-loathing to go out and walk or ride a bike or whatever. Is there any way for me to start moving?"
1218,"Can a human can create an unbreakable, self sustaining mechanism that locks them in denial? How can one (alone) undo such a mechanism without knowledge of the specific reality that has been altered?","It could permanently change their perception of the world (or their ability to perceive it), their behaviour, who they are and more"
1219,I really wanna scream my head off.,"I have so much stuff going on it’s ridiculous and I don’t know how I’m handling it. Basically not only do I have MDD,BPD, and severe anxiety. I also deal with a shitload of physical/ chronic illnesses. Like I just got up for the day and I’m already exhausted because of my parents making me do a bunch of things, my 3yr old nephew running around and not listening and my mom arguing with me because I told her I wasn’t going to get my nephew dressed and in the car right now since I was tired from doing things. I’m just honestly so pissed off about everything and have been getting more easily annoyed lately. I mean last night I was in so much pain because of my fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathy and I couldn’t really get much sleep. My mom knows this and still decides to scream at me in the morning for not waking up. Just everything is so frustrating and I’m trying to do my best but It feels like no matter what I do something is gonna go wrong and it’s just this never ending chaos. I’m so tired."
1220,How can I calm my nerves down?,"I am extremely introverted person, usually stay calm and don't react where others would have. But I get extremely nervous in these tense situation where you are required to talk. Like in viva exam or talking while being angry/nervous or approaching your crush etc. 
I can not decide what to say. In viva I would just blank out and don't remeber subject name even if I get nervous. I once waited a girl 5 minutes just to be my friend (that girl was patient enough not to leave or slap xD) .  When I talk being angry, usually I don't but when I do, I lose my nerves and can say/do worst things. Also in these cases not only hands even sometimes my head would shake like its frozen or something. 
I had severe fear of public speaking which I overcame somewhat due to regular presentations in varsity. But I don't remeber last when I gave a viva smoothly. 
It is really affecting my life and career. If anyone can help."
1221,Annoying,"Do people really want to talk to me? I have one person who I know for sure doesn't just talk to me out of pity. Thank you for that, •••••. Everyone else however is different. I know they don't make me feel like a burden on purpose, don't worry, ••• and ••••. But I just feel so annoying. I'm a burden to them. I bet they talk to me out of pity. I bother people everyday. Everyday I annoy them. If I were to ask if I annoy them though I would be convinced they were lying if they said no and feel even more annoying for asking. Why? Why does my brain think like this? I just want to feel wanted by the people I adore. The thing is it's all me. Have they actually told me or hinted at me annoying them? I don't think so, yet I'm convinced. Why? God I'm so annoying."
1222,Going into hospital today - not sure what to tell my parents,"Today I have decided to check myself into an inpatient psychiatry ward. My mental health is spiraling, and I need support that cannot be given via my friends and relatives or through homeopathic treatment. 

My husband is in full support. As a physician he not only was able to look at the situation subjectively, but also objectively. 

Now, this is where I need advice: 

My parents are not fans of my husband. They our relationship as a negative. They are aware (through me) that we have been having issues. It is my fault for involving them, and it is my fault for allowing them to form such a detrimental opinion. It is also Christmas, and I am expected to be at my parent’s house... with or without him. They prefer without him. If I tell them I am seeking care then they will not only blame him, they will also claim that I show a lack of maturity and an inability to deal with life challenges. They will point to problems I had in the past with breakups and reprimand me. I will also feel guilty because I will be ruining their Christmas. 

How do I tell them that I am hellbent on going into care? To protect my sanity I would rather not call, although I do know that that is usually the best option. I wish my husband could tell them, but I’m afraid that they will blame him for pushing me in this direction or not listen to him. 

Tl;dr: how do I find a way to tell my parents that I am seeking care, and that it is for me and not due to immaturity or anything like that?"
1223,Environmental illness - EMF,"This might not be the correct sub, as people will argue environmental illnesses are not mental health issues but what if they are?

I know a person that has struggled with their mental health for some time, but now EMF and multi chemical sensitivity has taken center stage and its escalating. They have been out of work due to this, and potentially lose their job. They can't leave the house without the worry of becoming sensitive and becoming ill, this is obviously having a huge impact of their life and I just don't know what to do in order to support.

I'll be honest, I want to believe them, well I believe the symptoms they are describing are real but not that it is caused by having a light on, or the TV and so on.

Can anyone shred any light on this, whether that by with clear evidence it's real or ways I can support more"
1224,"I’ve dropped 13 pounds in 3 weeks, am now at 97lbs at 5’3”","My anxiety has been really intense lately and I haven’t been able to eat much at all. In fact, it feels like my stomach has shrunken and even when I am hungry I can’t eat as much as I want/need to because it hurts. My stomach feels distended and painful when I eat more than 1/2 a normal serving size. 

I weighed myself today and was shocked that I’m under 100lbs. I usually weight about 110. I haven’t been this low since I was struggling with disordered eating and restrictive food intake. 

I don’t have much of an appetite, and I can’t eat a whole lot without feeling really, really sick afterwards. 

Are there any recommended foods to help me put on some weight? Even if I don’t eat a lot, what can I eat instead to help me get up to a healthy weight again? I do better with liquids/drinks than I do with actual solid foods as well.

I really need to gain this weight back. Not only is it unhealthy, I don’t want to trigger my disordered eating again. Would really appreciate some suggestions. I am seeing my doctor about this soon as well."
1225,I’m just not okay anymore.,"I’m been dealing with an array of mental health issues most of my life. I’m struggling now. I see a therapist, it only helps so much. I’m gonna hopefully starting some meds in January. My depression and anxiety are taking a real physical toll on me. My wife is at the end of the road with me, she says she just can’t deal with it anymore. I don’t blame her for it. I either can’t sleep or I sleep all the time and the only thing that is keeping me going is my son. 
I’m told I need to have compassion for myself and allow myself to grieve for the struggles I’ve had in the past I just don’t know how. I don’t know how to feel compassion for myself when I hate myself for all the mistakes I’ve mad. I’m just so overwhelmed and I don’t feel like I have anyone to turn to."
1226,Suffering in silence,"This is going to be short and sweet. Last night I(f25) was checking my Facebook memories when a status id made 8 years ago popped up. I knew instantly that I made that status right before my first suicide. So I instantly got flashbacks and upset. It was just me and my boyfriend(m28) having a few drinks and I mentioned it to him. I tried opening up to him about how I was feeling and what I was feeling back in the day. I even mentioned im glad it was a failed attempt or I wouldn't have met him. He looked at me and said, ""can we not talk about this right now"" . Now this has happened pretty much this exact way in the past and he said the same thing. So I of course got upset and left to go inside. Well now this morning I mention it to him that it hurts me when he tries to shut me up about what I struggle with. He said its because I ruined the good night by bringing up that shit. I broke down once again and felt like I am worthless. I understand that not everyone understand mental illness but thats just plain rude. I feel like I can't be myself and express my feelings when it comes to my struggles in life because it makes him feel uneasy and uncomfortable. I told him I'd never bring it up again and just suffer in silence. Thats not what I want to do at all but I also don't want to make him feel uncomfortable. What should I do? How should I handle this?"
1227,Does this sound like body dysmorphia?,"It's something I've been struggling with all my life and one of my friends mentioned it could be body dysmorphia but I can't get any good resources to confirm or deny this 'claim'.

When I (f22) was a little kid, I was always one of the tallest girls in my class. I got my growth spurt quite early, so I always had the idea that I was just objectively tall. I was also on the heavy half of the healthy weight range, which made me feel relatively big. 

During my childhood years, I was right in seeing myself as big and tall, because I was. But then puberty began to hit my classmates and they began to grow and also got bigger. Even so most of them now are taller than me. But I still feel like a giant when I'm around people. I feel big and tall, even though most of the people around me are taller and I'm not overweight. I can't seem to see myself as 'normal', because actually that's what I am. Not tall, not short, not big, not skinny. 

All the clothes I buy are unintentionally oversized. Also because I like the fit of oversized clothes, but a big reason is because I can't imagine I fit a US size 6. When I see other people with US size 6, they seem smaller than me (which is not really true when we actually measure our waists etc) So I mostly buy like an 8 or 10 because I think that's the right size for me (aka my 'i feel like a giant'-size)

So around peers I feel like a giant, but when I'm around older adults, I feel so incredibly small (short). I can't imagine that the body I have is tall enough to carry a baby or be considered an adult size, even though when I stand next to other adults, they are nearly the same hight as me (some taller, some shorter, because like I said, I'm so average)

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound like body dysmorphia? For a long time it didn't really bother me, but now I've become so selfconscious about my height and how much space I occupy in a place that maybe it's time to do something about it..."
1228,It literally doesn't make sense,"So I've been feeling really secure in the fact that I have depression &amp; anxiety for about a year now bc I started to see a therapist and everything that comes with it. I know Covid has probably taken a part in this, tho I can't help but notice how many ppl in my life are showing the same symptoms. Idk what to make of that. I also have derealization and it just adds to the feeling of fakeness all around me. Like, how likely could that even be? I don't know. I feel like nothing makes sense anymore. Maybe I really have just adapated my depression from knowing that it runs in the family and now i start to rub it off on everyone else? How likely would it be thag my brother has the same thing after he's been a normal kid his whole life? How come my best friend's life is dramatically changing and them becoming just as depressed and anxious? Idk if I'm being delusional or if there are actually ways go explain it. Maybe I'm overreacting. Idk"
1229,Nervous to call for residential care,"I’ve had a really really tough couple months (I’ve written hella posts about it so if you want more background just check my profile) and my therapist recommended me to a partial hospitalization program a few weeks ago. They called and their waitlist is literally 10 weeks and i can’t live like this for 10 more weeks. I contacted another program which supposedly had crisis management that i could get into sooner but my screening is two weeks from now because they’re so booked up. I feel like i can’t suffer the same way I’ve been suffering for much longer and i know i need to call the first program about their residential help. It’s specialized and has worked for people with my issues in the past, and I’m totally in crisis right now. I’ve eaten a piece of toast today and that’s it. I’m experiencing some suicidal ideation, I’m not actively doing anything but i can’t stand this level of panic on a daily basis anymore. I know i have to call, i have the number and everything but I’m scared they’ll tell me they won’t take me or that the wait list will be just as long. I just need a little encouragement or support right now, my family is on board with getting me treatment but i don’t want to have to tell them about the more serious stuff and I’m 18 so legally they don’t have to know. I need it but I’m almost scared to admit to myself how much help i need. Any kind words would mean a lot to me right now"
1230,hi... again,"i was talking to my friend, and finally decided to ask my mom for help mentally. ive been putting it off for awhile now, as i was scared (i still am) of being invalidated, or being told it’s “nothing”. my mom was trying to understand and ig be supportive but i could tell she didn’t think it was anything serious and that it was just a phase that would resolve itself. i’m almost certain it’s gonna be swept under the rug again (i asked a year ago but nothing ended up happening). i’m not sure y, maybe it’s cause i don’t fit her stereotypes or that i’m not acting the same as my sister (she was diagnosed with depression around half a year ago), but idk what to do. honestly, i’m not even sure if i’m “sick” enough to seek help and at this point. ive been trying to trigger myself since i told her, and i’ve thought of self harming again just bc maybe if i’m doing worse i could get help or be taken seriously by her (for context, i dripped hot wax on my arms before to release some built up stress cause i could never go through with cutting and i heard it doesn’t leave nearly as many scars, which it hardly left any, i’m not even sure if that counts as sh, but :/ it worked ig). god, i don’t even know what to do cause it’s like on and off “episodes” where i’ll feel okay and then it’ll all get bottled up and i’ll breakdown. anyways, what i’m trying to ask is what should i do?"
1231,I'm terrified to share things I like.,"Whenever I try to show someone something I like, if they don't like it I can't ever enjoy it again. Some of what were my favorite songs, I can't listen to anymore because they just remind me of the one bad moment that involved them. So, I just can't share things I like anymore."
1232,Can someone explain whats up,"This isn’t something really serious but just wanna know what going on and how to overcome it. Basically whenever im listening to or watching something im really excited about my brain goes nuts, i just get anxious and worry about something intervening it, and then whatever i do i feel like my experience of it has been ruined. I just wish i could not care and then i would be able to enjoy these kind of things. Is this a common thing? How do i overcome it? Any help whatsoever will be much appreciated."
1233,"I'm scared to talk to someone about ADD, incase I'm fakin it","Hey! I know that you can't tell if someone has ADD over a text on the internet, but I would really appreciate if someone could give me some advice. I apologize in advance for any spelling and grammar mistakes, my first language isn't english.

I (F18) have always struggled with a short attention span as long as I can remember, and especialy when I'm bored (such as in school) I end up daydreaming and not focusing at the lesson at all. I always procrastinate when I'm supposed to do something I find boring, like doing homework or cleaning my room, and often end up not doing it at all. I don't think I've done any homework that isn't graded since elementary school, and I'm in high school now. My parents and teachers haven't noticed since I'm a pretty fast learner, and have somehow kept  reasonable grades. 

Since I'm in my last grade of high school I have matriculation exams coming up, and I've really tried to study for them, since I know I won't pass if I don't actually study. But I just keep procrastinating, and when I finally sit down to study I keep zoning out. It's really frustrating, because when I do something fun like playing videogames or painting I can do it for hours, completly losing track of time, and even forgetting to eat at times.

I've been telling myself that I'll talk to the school counselor for over a year now, but I'm scared that I don't have ADD, and that I'm just trying to blame my laziness on something, and that the school counselor will think that I'm just seeking attention. Again, I'd really appreciate someone else's thoughts on this, thanks in advance!

(I forgot to mention that I suffer from trichotillomania (I'm not diagnosed), which is often associated wirh ADHD)"
1234,My ex called me in the middle of the night saying he will kill himself so I answered,"I couldn't go to work this morning because he kept me up and then couldn't sleep because I was stressed about it. 

I forgot to turn my ring off. He woke me up at 1:30 a.m. I ended up getting sucked into his bullshit until 3:00 a.m.

He was saying he needs to have surgery and the only reason he was mean was because he was in pain. I told him I forgive him, but I have my own issues I am dealing with. I have serious mental health issues. He would just minimize my problems and feelings and say his pain is more important than mine. He kept saying no one listened to him about his pain, including me. That's just not true. 

I should not have talked to him. I just didn't want him to kill himself."
1235,"Called in sick to work, I feel so guilty, I'm not sick physically, but mentally I feel close to death","I called in sick to work a bit ago, I feel so guilty because I'm not actually sick I just needed a mental health day.
The days I'm not working, my girlfriend always monopolizes my time. I'm doing housework, or I'm at school. I don't usually get to the point where I can't function but today was just hard. Really hard.
I don't really know what I have, but I assume it's anxiety/depression with either bipolar or a very very very acute case of schizophrenia. I knew my coworkers wouldn't understand so I said some bs about having a fever and whatnot.
I plan to tell my boss privately about what really happened, but my coworker answered the phone, not her. I need a doctors note and whatnot, understandable but crappy.
I'm not suicidal, I'm a guy. They wouldn't have cared that felt like shit, just that I wasn't showing up to work. I feel guilty for lying but I also just don't like talking about that stuff and letting people know. I can never shake the feeling that they're going to tell other people."
1236,Depression won.,"Well, it won. I’ve gave up, I gave up on school, keeping friends, happiness, &amp; hope. I’ve taken every advice I was given, wrote it down, talked to someone, watched advice videos, everything. But for some reason I’ve gotten nowhere, &amp; I’m tired of hearing the “things take time” excuse, I want it OVER with now! I mean fuck, it’s going to be a new year, but I’m still in this shit hole. I’ve been in this state for so long that I’ve became comfortable in my depression, sadness is the only thing I know now. I can’t even keep a friend around without pushing them away, or just getting cut off. Gosh, why couldn’t it be over with the first time I attempted, I was ready to die that day. I just can’t take it anymore, the misery &amp; feeling hopeless. Life is just so shitty, and the only time I feel happy is when I’m making fake fucking scenarios in my head to escape from reality. I just feel so down bad, and the worse part about it is no one decided to “care” until I didn’t want help anymore, because it’s already too late."
1237,I'm Not Sure I Can Just Keep Holding On,"**Trigger warnings for suicidal ideation, terminal illness and death**

I'll try to be brief, about two years ago I (34m) was manic and desperate, and at an ultimate breaking point.  I was starting to have routine thoughts of hanging myself by my belt in the stairway at work as I sat at my desk.  I had to leave stand up meetings with my team on a few occasions, because I started tearing up.  I knew I needed help, in fact had needed help for years, and I sought out help desperately.  I pulled every counselor on my health insurance plan, and ended up calling through a list of over forty, who were all either full, or had closed.  My brother, who I lived with at the time, ended up forcing me to go to the ER with him to be evaluated.  They released me that day with a small prescription and recommended an additional list off-insurance.

That was probably the second hardest time in my life, and to be honest I'm not sure how I survived it.  Work was extremely stressful at the time (I was given one of the hardest projects our Team was undertaking, on top of my terrible emotional and mental distress), my few friendships were fraying, and I was entirely lost.

My reason for writing this is, I feel I'm heading in that direction again, and I'm not sure I'll weather things this time - Or more importantly, what can be done to increase my chances.

A few quick bullets on how I got here:
- I was widowed in 2016; My Fiancée and I had been together almost ten years, and owned a home together.  She had battled ovarian cancer her entire adult life.  I held her hand as she passed.
- I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at age Twenty, after failing a single semester at University (I had basically become horribly depressed and secluded) and being academically dismissed
- I was also diagnosed with an acute condition of Inattentive Attention Deficit Disorder at the same time; I had been having short-term memory loss, so impactful that a neurologist thought I had a brain tumor.  They ultimately concluded that I have an underdeveloped frontal lobe (if I recall correctly, in the range of ~60% developed)
- I grew up in a fundamentally religious household, and while both my sibling and I were fortunate to grow up in relative comfort and had some social normalcy, I think we were considered socially maladapted by many of our peers.  We were those kids who were forced to spend three days a week at church (a quite traditional one at that, where some women still felt compelled to wear head coverings while men were in attendance)
- My whole life I've been extraordinarily self-effacing, self-deprecating and insecure.  One of my oldest memories was hiding in a pile of dirty laundry near the washing machine, listening to my family talk in the other room and imagining how their lives would be no different with me gone.  I was seven.

When my Fiancée passed, I became bitter and cold.  I blamed myself for her death, I blamed god, fate, or whatever other nebulous entity I could.  I moved across the country to be closer to family, during which for a moment I truly hoped I could start fresh.  Four years later, my Fiancées parents have passed, her Step-Mother due to terminal cancer, and her Father due to a drug overdose.  He had also battled Stage Four Lymphoma.  I have somehow managed to keep the new job I had taken after moving, but it's been truly difficult at times.  My brother has since moved to Grad school in another place (which I'm extremely happy for him about), though it does frighten me that I'm living alone now, in the event my condition does deteriorate as I fear it's set to do.

I spent the year of 2019 going to weekly therapy (when my job didn't interfere), as well as making checkups at county mental health services.  I was put on a few different prescriptions, but I halted them after suffering a few destabilizing bouts of additional depression while on new drugs.  I ended up at a place where the prescriptions were not helping, and my therapy was both too costly (about $1k/four one hour sessions) and not really impactful outside of learning a few important reframing and grounding techniques.

And now I'm here, I guess.  2020 was largely uneventful, which I guess is good considering the alternative.  I still feel deeply hurt, still depressed, largely lonely without many friends, and I feel like I scrape by at my job (I'm a software engineer).  It's not that I don't like what I've become - I've never liked who I am, in my entire life.  I never understood what my Fiancée saw in me, why people gave me a chance in jobs (somehow without a formal education and severe ADD I've made it this far).  I spent much of our relationship trying to support her, and I lost any brief glimpse of who I actually was.  Besides work promotions, I have never had the positive indicators others have had to motivate them - No Bachelors' diploma, no successful entrepreneurship, merits, academic or professional recognition.  I've never had a 'win,' so-to-speak.  My prospects for the future are currently not any brighter - I've learned through multiple therapists over the years, and prescriptions, that I just can't surmount this depression.

And I'm getting more and more angry at myself, and bitter at those I see in the surrounding world who have had every opportunity to live a normal life.  To have families, to have careers, to fulfill their goals and not constantly be fighting with everything they have to stay afloat.  It's certainly not my intention to take away from the struggles many hold internally, and I know I am certainly not the only person with physiological difficulties, or who has undergone serious trauma.  My heart deeply aches for every loved one of a Covid victim out there, among any other person who has lost someone.

But this is the crux - I'm keenly aware that this mindset is at best dishonest and toxic, and at worst completely destructive and shameful.  I'm not a violent person at all, and if anything I'm overly weak and accepting (something that has bothered many I've known for years).  I just don't think I'll be able to withstand another major descent into the place I was in back in 2018, which lasted nearly the whole year.  I'm just so lost, and I'm not sure what possible options are out there besides therapy (which even with good insurance and a promising counselor, I simply cannot afford now), and medication (which again, has so far only made things worse).

I apologize for the rambling nature of my post, and truly appreciate everyone who both contributes and comments in this sub."
1238,Getting my Christmas gift (one of them) today,"I am hella nervous right now.

Our eldest daughter had a cockatiel, Koko, but she had gotten out and lost. She is most likely deceased because it is Winter here and Rochester, NY had gotten some snow. :( RIP Koko.  


I just met my new feathered friend: a yellow cockatiel (female), whom we named Twinkie (thank you to our 10 year old for that name....it stuck lol). She is pretty but I am nervous about handling her. She didn't have a very good life (alone in a cage and little interaction with her owners) so I am hoping that she can learn to trust me. I have a reason to be happy...my new baby. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Just thought I would spread the good news! She is part of my Christmas gift (and for the whole family) and I am happy as heck. She will have lots of company, as I am home all day and so is hubby. Even when the kids go to school again, Twinkie will not be alone. She will have a good life here.  


Merry Christmas to me and my family!!"

1240,I just don’t know anymore.,"In 2017 I moved from my home area to Los Angeles with my wife. When we moved I started to feel alone. Friends disappeared and became strangers, my family didn’t visit me when loved 15 minutes away, they aren’t going to visit for sure now that I’m 4 hours away. I have my in laws in LA but I feel so alone. 

Over this past year my depression and anxiety has gotten worse. I feel like I am just a ball of emotions. I feel bad for my wife to deal with me and as a burden. I don’t know what to do anymore. Thoughts of self harm aren’t there but I don’t want to be here. I want to run away and not cause anyone any more pain. 

On my wife’s birthday we had been told someone who dropped off a gift tested positive for COVID. I had a panic attack and freak out. I ruined my wife’s birthday and the plans I tried to make. 


I am in between therapist and it’s been harder without someone to talk to."
1241,Washed / brushed my hair today; for the first time in three weeks,"I last washed my hair on 29th November, I started feeling a bit down and a bit ill and hadn't washed my hair  and last brushed it on the 4th when I REALLY felt ill on the 5th Dec, turns out I had covid. 

Managed to wash and brush it today, had to 'empty'my hairbrush out 8 times , from the amount of hair that came out and it took me at least and hour and half to brush the knots out. 

I don't feel 100% but i feel better. 


Hope you guys are doing well too."
1242,Depression and Kids,"Hey guys,

Posted this on r/depression but guess posting the rant on here would help me blow off some more steam and get some more opinions. Guess I'm too broken. I'm writing this because I don't know who to speak to, can't speak to my friends, can't speak to my family, so I'm here talking to people who may be able to understand me.

Got diagnosed with depression a year or so ago, but had it for far longer, just never went to the doctors for it. Saw a lot of shit as a kid that you guys all may have seen too, abuse, unfaithfulness, all that jazz. That lead me to not wanting to ever have kids. Doesn't help that my family were poor as fuck growing up, so I worked my damn ass off to become the best possible person I could be.

I'm 22 now, from the UK. Got into the best med school in the country, worked my ass off for that, especially since all the schools I went to were shit. Got therapy, got the medication I needed. Found a girl too, great girl, albeit had a sheltered life. She was a national championship in taekwondo or something, that doesn't matter.

Anyways, I never open up about my depression, I don't like to be a burden. She said she wanted kids, I said I didn't, and we stopped talking for a few days and said it's over. For the next few days, I had a think about everything, why I truly didn't want kids. Turned out I did want them, I was just worried that a) I'd pass on the depression to my kids because of genetics and all and b) be a horrible father because I've never had an adequate example. Anyways, I messaged her back and told her I had rethought and did want kids, and also wanted her back.

So anyways she asked me why I never originally want kids, and I decided it may be worth opening up after 22 years or so of my life about what has happened to me through my life. Told her exactly why I didn't want kids, the abuse I went through, the fucked up stuff I remember. How I didn't want to screw up a kids life. How I didn't want to bring a kid into this world. I was vulnerable, for once, with someone other than a therapist. Long story short, she said it was too much for her, that she's seen firsthand how parents with depression handle their children, how difficult it is for them to manage a child who is depressed. I felt shocked, literally felt like I was being treated like I was infectious and should never be around any young person.

I guess the reason I am writing this is because no matter what I do, no matter who I become, I'm always going to be defined by my depression. I could be the best damn doctor the planet has never seen, but I'm never, ever going to be worthy of love or children. Safe to say she fed into the exact reason I didn't want kids, and now I definitely will never be having them.

Take care reddit, thanks for reading."
1243,Some ideas for better thinking... hopefully.,"Hello there, 
This may or may not be helpful but I thought I would share. 
I had a rough patch in my life where I thought of throwing in the towel, I had tunnel vision to enter that sweet void of nothingness. My mind was putting in the extra work to make me feel like I was worthless, lazy, and that there was something wrong with me. I still battle with depression and anxiety to this day but I have a much better grip on them, understanding the warning signs as they creep in. Some of these things have helped me to get back on my feet and hopefully it can help 🤞. 

The day that I just wanted to end it, instead I decided to get a meaningful tattoo (recommend getting something small or using a marker if your don’t want something permanent) that would represent that day. I got the tattoo, and now when I see it I reflect on it, if I would have followed through I wouldn’t have been able to experience this day, and then I come up with something I’m grateful for in that day. It’s a little cheesy but I feel it has helped. 
I got the tattoo and the next thing I worked on changing was my thinking. You don’t have control over how situations will play out, you don’t even have control over your body (diseases and stuff), the only thing you can control is your mind and how you are going to react to the situation. (Good book on this is The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday) Philosophical and medical readings have helped to get a better understanding. 
Going for walks helps. Look for new experiences and explore. Nobody is better than you and you are better than no one. You can learn something new from every person you meet. 
Try not to take yourself so seriously, nobody really knows what they are doing, or what they want. We are a bunch of primates on an organic space-ship plummeting through space. Just try to enjoy this tiny blimp of time we have on this rock and make some memories. 
Hope this helps! You are all kicking ass, cheers!"
1244,What does it mean to be an individual?,"Start off by saying I'm schizophrenic. Struggle with auditory hallucinations (and visual hallucinations when off certain medicine).

I had a breakdown at work yesterday and left early, for the past 3 years people have gotten to know my bright cheery side. Lately I've been having off days more frequently. I think I need medication changed but just swapped to a new psychiatrist and its the holidays so can't meet up until later.

I've been going out of my way to treat holidays special to try and brighten peoples days by dressing up. If I get one smile or laugh thats enough to fuel me for the day...at least thats what I tell myself and everyone but I don't know what that really means. When a customer gets confrontational my mind begins to shatter and I struggle to keep from crying.

In truth I shut myself in when at home and have difficulty speaking my mind. I cant look people in the eye well because the voices have me convinced everyone is judging me. I have to work with customers so I just forced myself into a position where I convinced myself I'm okay...but after today I don't think I am. 

Its like I wear a mask everywhere I go. A mirror mask where I try and reflect my expression to match the mood of everyone else. I like to believe I have a strong empathetic sense to where I can put myself in many peoples shoes and try and see from there perspective. I think its what helps with that mask forming.

Today though everything came crashing down. I couldn't hold the facade I think I've pushed myself too hard for too long. Every first thought: normal, second thought: just kill yourself, third thought: you don't want to kill yourself, fourth thought: stop looking at me WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?! (Dressed up as a reindeer, antlers, even a tail, so of course I stood out like a sore thumb). Everyone I work with could tell something was wrong. They were concerned for me, I know, but that doesn't stop the voices from calling it pity and that they think I'm some sort of freak. When I left I felt like I couldn't breathe anymore like a noose was around my neck that I couldn't get off and everyone was just staring at me. I dry heaved when I got to the car and I just stayed there head to my knees for like 30 minutes.

Now its 5 am I've been up all night and I can't figure out who I am anymore. I keep asking myself questions. What makes me, me? Was that happy bright side all a facade? Was that the real me? I've used masks for so long throughout my life I just don't know who I am. To this day its why I have never looked for someone to date because I don't feel like I'm worthy of anyone's time. I've lost touch with what was a lie and what was the truth. 

What does it mean to be an individual and have a personality? I feel like the ""regular"" me is so boring in comparison to what I view as everyone else's normal, but even that what is ""normal""? I've kept people at a distance for so long never letting them in that I don't even know what friends are. I feel like I'm not worthy to call anyone a friend. Am I an acquaintance who has similar interests?

I'm having an identity crisis at 29 and its scaring the shit out of me. Hell I don't even think anyone is going to see this and bother reading it...I just felt I needed to bleed some of this pain into words even if it was left in the aether. 

How do I face my coworkers on Monday?"

1246,I just had a horrible dream,"So basically i have symptoms of pyromania which includes urges to set stuff on fire.

1248,Resetting Circadian Rhythm + Emotional Dreams?,"I am at a breaking point with my sleep schedule. 
My husband and I both got sick in November and since then, my sleep schedule has shifted from 10:30pm - 8:00am to 4:00am - 2:00pm.

I have tried melatonin, Nyquil, no screens after 9pm, extra exercise, went 1 week without my adhd meds, pulled all nighters so I am tired enough to fall asleep at a normal time, etc. Nothing is working. 

It is effecting every aspect of my life. I am waking up with extreme guilt for sleeping so late and just feeling overall exhausted. My husband is having to pick up the slack from me not being alert during normal day light hours and it is starting to effect him too.

In addition to the new sleep schedule, I have been having extremely vivid emotional dreams. I find myself waking up with overwhelming emotions and wanting to go back to sleep so I can ""reset"" and wake up in a different frame of mind.

If you have overcome this, please, please, please share what worked for you! ❤️"
1249,is this anixety or something,"i randomly feel very intense fear for little to no reason (phone ringing, person walking up stairs, window open, person knocking on door, spider/incect, computer errors, turning on a device when i havent used it in a while, real life erros, real life time moving incorrectly, and sometimes when im alone even though i love being alone) i start to panic, hyperventilate, feel like something very bad is going to happe, shout at people whos phones are ringing etc to make them answer it.  wtf is going on because this isnt normal."
1250,There is so much hate inside of me,"I’m feeling so low right now. After almost two years of meds and going to therapy, all of a sudden I realized how much anger and hatred I still have inside of me. It’s so heavy and I’m angry at myself for still having it. I always compare myself to people, thinking things like “I fucking wish I could be that happy” and “it’s all fake anyway” or “I don’t even deserve/have the capability to be happy or love myself like that” and I know this is just a reflection of my own insecurities. Maybe I haven’t brought it up in therapy enough. But man, it’s my own fault but it’s a kick in the gut man. I don’t know where to go from here, I don’t know how to let go of this hate, this anger towards myself I unjustly pour onto others. If anyone has any advice or input I’d really appreciate it. I feel so damn angry and hopeless right now :/ thanks if you’ve read this far anyways :)"
1251,Got diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I still don’t feel like I really have it.,"Got diagnosed for depression/anxiety but I still don’t feel like I really have it.

Idk if I just had a bad psychiatrist or something but it was basically a 30 minute phone call where they asked me some questions and then prescribed me some medication. Honestly I’m not sure what I was expecting because I knew that it would probably be exactly like what the meeting was like but it just felt too easy. 

I feel like basically any person in the world could get diagnosed with it if they wanted to. While it was a bit more complex than this, they basically just asked a couple questions and then said that I had depression and anxiety and to take the meds. I felt like they just didn’t know my situation well enough to make that sudden of a diagnosis. Also, while I didn’t lie about any of the questions, you very easily could.

This makes me question the legitimacy of my diagnosis since anyone could get a diagnosis if they wanted to or they could mis diagnose. I kinda suspect that I do have some sort of depression/ anxiety but I feel like it’s not that severe and idk if I should take the medication or not. I kinda want to take it to just try it out and see if it helps but I also wonder what would happen if I don’t need the medication but take it anyway, could it mess me up. 

Also I am seeing a therapist but i’ve only seen them for an intake session and am not seeing them again for a bit so I can’t really ask them about this. Thank you for any help!"
1252,where do i belong,"this year, life has shafted me. 

i feel like no moment has ever been truly happy. everybody hates me. i am an embarrassment to everyone around me. i'm useless, and i'm nothing. 

i wanted to kill myself a few weeks ago at university. i didn't have enough painkillers to do anything, so i didn't. the worst thing is that i'm also too scared to kill myself because what keeps me alive is the thought of what shit people would talk about me at my funeral. if anyone would even go. if anyone would miss me. 

and now i'm at home for Christmas. and it's so much worse. all the horrible things i think in my head about whether what i'm saying isn't funny, or if it's weird, or if i'm fat and strange and useless are all said by my family, and i just can't take it. and i want to kill myself. 

but i can't bring myself to do it. because my family would be so embarrassed. 

i just don't know where i could go. i don't know where i can be happy. 

i feel like i'm living with guilt and shame and it's so painful. 

i'm just venting idk if this even makes sense, i just needed to put this somewhere. sorry"
1253,Searching for answers,
1254,I don’t think I’ll ever have a friend,"People just bounce off of me. No one sticks. No one reaches out. And in the past year (graduated high school, started uni online, not being able to meet anyone, quarantined) I’ve realized that I’ve pretty much lost all the friendships I had in school. Thing is, I didn’t even want them to last. I wanted to start over in college. But still, I can’t help but be hurt by this. All those years in school and not a single lasting friendship? What does that say. 

Maybe things will feel better once college actuallyy starts, not just online. For now I just feel so fucking boring. And annoying. And all the reasons why someone wouldn’t wanna befriend. It’s dumb. I’m not that bad. But I’m so bland. There’s nothing cool or interesting about me. Ok that’s not true either. But many times that’s how I come off. I mean, I still think I am pretty fucking boring, but when I feel low, I just become the most boring thing on earth. Which makes me feel even worse, and becomes a self-feeding cycle. Then when I feel good and come up for a breather, I feel AMAZING. And I notice people around me react better to me. Big part of what I notice might be in my head because I just feel better. But it’s really real, not sure to what extent. But then one tiny negative thing I think I notice in an interaction, and I go back into this cycle of “no one likes me” -&gt; become weird af -&gt; more bad interactions -&gt; “no one likes me”. 



I’m not sure what anyone can say to this. I mostly just wanted to vent, but if there’s anything to be said, feel free. If anyone sees this anyway, not sure how the karma thing works"
1255,Things to talk about to my mental health professionals that are helping me.,"I'm more addicted to porn on my MacBook Pro then my iPhone XR. Masturbating and watching porn put me in the mood to have oral sex with bananas. I shot a video on my iPhone in 2017 of me jumping up and down on a chair when I was naked. If I never masturbaited or watched porn, I would have never had oral sex with bananas. I live with the pain of regret. I regret touching myself and watching porn."
1256,Currently feeling a little dead lol,"I can’t find anything fun, I don’t feel like hanging out with anyone and I just want to lay in bed all day without even changing. I’ve tried keeping myself busy, tried to keep drawing even if I don’t feel like it and even tried watching a show I like, but i don’t find any genuine interest in even trying.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore, not even sure if I’m going through a depressive episode or if maybe it’s the hormones fucking with me again but I just want to sleep all day."
1257,Is this kinning?,"I wonder if there are people who create a second “body” or “shell” for themselves when they’re feeling anxious, weak or exposed.

A body you imagine to transform into when you’re feeling bad. It’s a coping mechanism for me but I can’t find much information about it. It sounds similar to kinning, but I feel like it’s a little different, because it’s more about feeling strong and safe rather than relating to a character or person. And it’s more like activating a shield, or a sanctuary, despite being in public, personally, I feel like no one can really see me.

I can’t find much about kinning to know for sure though. 

And if it isn’t, is it healthy?"
1258,feeling like shit. needing to vent.,I’m not doing okay. I finished up my last final yesterday and I thought I would feel better - lol. I think I did well but I still feel like a complete failure. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

1260,Overthinking ruining everything!!,"Hi, so i have been struggling with overthinking literally anything and it is destroying my peace of mind and happiness. I have tried to control it and it might have worked for a bit, but i always go back to overthinking. It can be about a person, situation or myself. It is as if my mind is constantly searching for what it wants and the answers it want which are always negative :( 

I always expect the worst instead of seeing it from several perspectives and my brain cannot accept that i wont always know the truth at this moment and find closure. 

I really need practical tips on how to stop it or atleast live with it in a healthy way, if anyone has struggles like me please share your story :)"

1262,Why am I so uninterested in others?,"I don’t even really like my friends... I don’t hate them but I don’t like them and I’m not excited about when they text me or anything like that. I feel very neutral, even with the people I’m close to. 

I can talk to my relatives and what not but for the past two years I have just been very disinterested in people other than my family. It didn’t concern me at first but it’s been quite a while."
1263,Does anybody else start feeling sick when meeting new people?,"Hi all, 

My first post here. 

I've been single for many years due to a personality disorder, my mood swings are constant daily so I find it hard to maintain relationships/friendships. Most of these have been affected due to my mental health.

Recently I've been on dating apps looking for someone, but talking to them online is fine but when it comes to meeting in person I'm fine until the day comes. Once the day has arrived I start getting cramps in my stomach, I start to feel sick and get the feeling like I need to poo. I start sweating and my heart feels like its gonna explode out of my chest. This then leads me to cancelling and then it's a repeated circle.

Is there anything I can do to prevent this? 

I'm currently on meds from my dr, quietapine if it helps. 
I've mentioned this to my drs and they have recommended 1:1 therapy but I'm not sure how this is gonna work because I'm sh*t scared to actually go to the appointment."

I keep telling myself ""it will end soon."" But it doesn't and I cry because i cant take it here anymore. I save and save and save and literally I go nowhere. I just want to be happy"
1265,What can we do?,There is this girl at my school who always wears hoodies. One day me and some of my friends sat with her at lunch and we noticed she had blood on her hands. We asked her why and she pulled back all of her sleeves( she was wearing two hoodies and a long sleeve) and there was cuts all down her arm. She told us that can’t stop cutting herself. What can we do to help her?
1266,I hate myself so much it physically hurts,"Im completely worthless, alone and unmotivated. Im filled with anxiety, theres no-one I feel comfortable talking to, not even my parents or close friends. I want to self harm so bad, but I cant because I still live with my parents and I cant risk them noticing bruises or cuts. Im such a burden to fucking everyone around me already. I will never find anyone who could actually love me, and I dont deserve to either.

Just needed to vent a little bit... sorry"
1267,Is this common? What's the matter with me? This always happens and now I feel like faecal matter," Every day I wake up in the evening because I go to sleep in the morning. My sleep schedule is so messed up and I just can't seem to fix it because every time I manage to wake up at an earlier time, at that moment I subconsciously tell myself to go back to sleep because there is no point in waking up and the vicious cycle starts again. I just feel horrible and every day I barely do anything but binge-watch Netflix and avoid thinking about my life, I eat and go back to sleep. Even showering seems like such a hard thing to do and all I want to do is to lay down and not move. I don't have the mood to talk to my friends either and I constantly reply to texts late even though I've already seen it earlier from my notifications. When I laugh after a funny joke in shows or videos I somehow have to immediately frown again because it was so tiring to keep smiling. I just feel like I'm so lazy and I bet that's what everyone around me thinks as well. I have so many recordings of online classes I have yet to rewatch because I slept through all of my classes. I also feel like I'm always going to cry and it'll be over the smallest things. I've also been avoiding social media because I hate seeing stories and posts about the lives of my friends. I absolutely hate it and it always makes me nervous when I open the apps because I might see something that triggers my bad emotions again. I guess I'm also just jealous that they're all happy and can seem to function normally while I can't. They're all out and about and I always criticize them in my mind thinking, we're under a restricted movement order so why is everyone out of their homes going to malls and crowded places? I'm not really sure what's wrong with me but what I've stated above are just a few of my struggles right now. Maybe somebody has an idea of what's going on with me? Maybe it is even hereditary"
1268,Should I leave??,"Ok so basically, for a couple of months I've been dealing with contamination OCD that's torn my life apart. I can't live day-to-day life normally anymore, nor can I eat or drink regularly. My mom seems to think I'm doing it for the sole purpose of pissing her off. And I often find myself torn between things like - 'If I use too much soap mom will get pissed, but if I don't use a lot im gonna be really agonized for a while.' Sounds weird, i know, but it makes a lot more sense to me and im sure others with the same thing. But another thing is my mom's outbursts are really terrifying. For example, she'll threaten to send me away or take me to the hospital regularly. And then one minute she'll be comepletely fine, and the next she'll be going apeshit on my ass about the most random things. She is also my only guardian. Well i have my father who has half of my custody, but he never requests to have me (probably for the better oh boy lemme tell you) I assume it's because he's incredibly financially unstable and he doesnt want me to see him like that. Hes also actively manipulative and really just straight up fucked. Hes also often intoxicated which leads him to be aggressive and psychologically abusive. Which means if my mother disowns me, i have a chance of going with him, and it will hardly be any more desiresable. I know that I cant keep living with my mother because she obviously has some problems and is evidently bi-polar though she hasnt been clinically diagnosed. (I swear our family is a myriad of mental disorders lmao) I often find myself debating suicide because its an easy out, but at the same time i dont want to die. its just that i feel like i dont have a choice.   


So ultimately what I'm asking is this; should i leave my mother, and if so, how?   


A factor to take into account is that im only 13; so im not old enough for emancipation. im also wondering if maybe im overreacting? maybe im just chilling in self pity so much that i cant see that my situation isnt all that bad? At least i have my bro, but he will probably move out soon so that aint long term. okay at the time of writing this he just told me he goin to college soon so oh boy.  


I also apologize for the quality of this paragraph, theres probably many typos but hopefully its still somewhat comprehensible"
1269,I'm glad I get to UNWRAP presents this year!,"I know it sounds selfish but every single year since I was 10, I was always given necessities and shoddy (almost paper) holders with pre-packaged clothing or tiny plastic gift bags which made me feel left out all the time.

I have a small family. Significant other. 2 almost 3 year old child. I should be happy. I'm not. I was ok back in early November. But as time went on and I grew more and more unhappy and sad. Well now I'm just a mess. I have a therapist. But the last time we spoke things weren't this bad. And we won't speak again until mid January.

I don't know how to describe what's wrong. It's all small stresses. Small things that all have added up to feel very huge. And I keep acting like a giant jerk to those closest to me because I just can't handle it. 

I try to open up. To get the bad feelings out. But I just cry and that's not fair to the kid. 

I don't know. That's probably long enough. I'm in pain. Emotionally. I'm sadder than I've been in a long time. I have no thoughts of hurting myself or others. I mostly just want to drive very far away and check into a fancy hotel (no money so not gonna happen) and drink hot cocoa and watch movies until it's all over. 

Then come back and find out how it all went. Or just stay away. Idk. 

Anyway. Just thought maybe someone here knew what I meant. Maybe someone had something to say that might help. Maybe I'm desperate. I don't know. I'm sad. Help?"
1272,Intense depressed/anxious state - Normal PMS side effect or serious mental health issue?,"Sorry if it's too long! Context: I've been struggling with mental health issues for more than 2 years now, on and off, my worst downfall being a burn-out episode at the end of last year. However, I was doing noticeably better few months afterwards, thanks to therapy and meds (I was prescribed Xanax and Wellbutrin after I had a panic attack that took me to the ER), good enough to improve my social life, and I even landed a new job. 

Then Covid happened, and I took quite a few blows because of the economic/general situation, although I did my best to manage that and I did survive the first phase of lockdowns quite alright. I got off the meds by the end of the lockdown, and I didn't experience any withdrawal symptoms. I was doing okay over the summer as well, but started feeling weird during August (mental numbness, lethargy, inability to focus or feel like doing anything, spending a lot of time in bed). I kind of dismissed it because at the time I had just moved back in with my parents, and as I had to be extra careful because of the Covid risk and the fact that they're older, I couldn't really have a social life, so I thought it would pass as soon as I got used to the new situation. I started doing way better in September and October, I even managed to work out almost every day, which was unthinkable for me, thinking that I could capitalize on the extra me-time I had to focus on my well-being. My social life was, and still is, almost nonexistent, as I work from home and I now live in my parents' town away from my friends.

Unfortunately it didn't last for long, as things started going awry again. When I got my period at the end of September, I went into a small but pretty intense depression episode. My brain was filled with nothing but dark thoughts, and although I didn't attempt anything, that ""I wanna die"" mantra was continuously in the back of my mind, making it  impossible to think or do anything. It was so bad it physically hurt, and I was so scared of ""losing it"" for good. I thought it could be related to work issues I was experiencing at the time, because it had never happened to me before, despite how bad my periods have always been in terms of physical pain. Things got better again at the end of my period, but as soon as I went into PMS the following month, those symptoms came back, and that time it was my anxiety that peaked. I was relieved as soon as my period started, because I was feeling less anxious and I knew that it would be over soon. However I wasn't able to pick up workouts afterwards, and the anxiety made me fall into bouts of binge-eating sometimes at night. Now I just got my period again few days ago, and I can see that it's only getting worse: 1) It was almost 1 month late 2) The depression hit way harder this time. In a matter of days, I went from being very productive and having a clear mind to spending the whole weekend in bed, unable to eat/sleep/talk properly, or even clean myself. I have nightmares at night, and I wake up several times, sometimes crying. The first thought that crosses my mind as soon as I open my eyes is ""I wish I could die and finally be at peace"". My whole body aches, especially my back and my legs. I feel nauseous and full even if I hardly eat anything the whole day, while I usually have a big appetite when I'm on my period. Obviously it's also taking a toll on my work, my relationship with my parents and even my future plans as I'm trying to go back to school abroad and I have to submit applications.

 I'm at a loss over why this is happening to me, and I'm increasingly living in the fear of going through such episodes again. I don't know if it's a normal side effect of PMS for people who had struggled with mental health issues in the past, or it's because PMS patterns change over time, or it's related to the stress and dissatisfaction I deal with at work, or whether it could be related to a physical condition. I got the physical aspect of the investigation underway as I'll soon be getting tested for hormonal imbalance, vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism, but I don't know if it's relevant to see a psychiatrist as well, especially since it's currently difficult to see doctors and I'll have to figure out a way to travel if I want to visit the one I used to go to for my burn-out syndrome. I would really appreciate it if anyone could share their experience or help me figure out what I should make of it. I really want to get out of this."
1273,Being present,"How to battle existential depression and chronic awareness of the macro-world, its horrors and its apathy? I'm rarely if ever mentally present because of that and I only find genuine, long-lasting enjoyment though music, other forms of art and escapism in general. Close and meaningful relationships with people work too, but that's kind of stifled now with the pandemic going on. I think (overthink) a lot and that habit managed to make me detached from my surroundings in a way that desensitised my immediate perception and made me feel ""less alive.""
I'm pretty sure I've got ADD too, not sure if it's connected. I'm not sure how to exactly describe the feeling, but it's like feeling things through your senses but not wholly. I see, but I ""don't"" really. It doesn't feel like I'm there. I can't focus."
1274,Well I never... thought I’d be happy to listen to a sim poop instead,"I’m at the point where I’ve had enough of everything and talk of ‘that virus’ makes me furious so I end up playing sims4 and listening them sing badly and poop 💩

1275,Dealing with anxiety,"Hi All,

I am 32 year old male and have suffered with anxiety/ depression/ mental health issues for a long time (UK based). I used to be bullied growing up which meant I had very little self-esteem. After graduating from university and making progress career wise I started feeling a lot better about myself and slowly the low self-esteem and poor self image started to disappear. Last year, I had a panic attack. I was feeling overwhelmed at work and broke down in tears after having to work another weekend (it was more the responsibility of my work than working the weekend). I had CBT which helped for a while but I find myself doing these things since Covid:

- Always looking for validation
- Make a lot of little mistakes
- Being overly harsh on myself when I make a mistake e.g. I incorrectly typed a number next to a graph for a presentation to senior management (it should've been 4 not 44) and felt crap about myself for an entire weekend.
- I become easily distracted/ struggle to concentrate on anything for a long period of time - anything more than 15 mins).

My work superiors know about my mental health issues and are extremely supportive but I want to find a way to concentrate better and feel less anxious. I feel like being able to concentrate better will lead me to make fewer mistakes and be more productive making me feel less anxious/ insecure about my work. 

Any ideas about being able to concentrate better and feel less anxious/ dealing with my anxiety would be really helpful.

Thanks in advance for all your help."
1276,Why the hell do SSRIs take me 3 years to cum?,Like how can I get around this? Super annoying
1277,Are these symptoms of ADHD?,"So I recently saw a tiktok compilation about adhd and I realized that a lot of it was like super relatable (I never really considered the possibility that I might have adhd bc I thought fidgeting and always losing focus were just things that happened to everyone) I’m not trying to self-diagnose I’m just genuinely curious and I might ask my doctor abt this too. I find that I’m often unable to concentrate on things at school and at home (often when I do worksheets I literally stop writing in the middle of a word or number and start working on a completely different question without realizing i wasn’t finished) But when I do focus on something it’s almost always obsessive (like i have to bring it up in every conversation and i think about it 10 times a day) these obsessions usually wear off after a week or so and I just completely don’t care about it anymore and move on to the next thing. I also like to fidget (although not as much as people with severe adhd) but sometimes I find myself subconsciously moving/shaking or humming (sometimes I shake my leg without realizing it and my mom or my grandma gets mad at me bc it’s ‘bad manners’ even though it wasn’t my choice and I can’t really control it) And I was also diagnosed with mild autism when I was in preschool so that might have something to do with it as well. The other thing is that I get bored very easily, like on weekends when my family doesn’t go out and everyone just does quiet activities at home I’m always SUPER bored and it drives me crazy. I feel like I always have to be doing something new or fun and/or energy-consuming and anything else is a complete waste of time. Plz comment if you think these are symptoms of adhd or something else or if it’s just completely normal and I’m overthinking it."
1278,Meaning of liking old things?,I would to ask if it's any meaning of likening old things like fashion music and time? Because others think's that I'm ill because I'm obsessed with old stuff.
1279,I'm not safe at home (TW: suicide),"Since coming home from my boyfriend's after the second lockdown (he didn't want me there anymore) my anxiety has been through the roof. I live with my mum, stepdad and sister. Arguments are very common here and they usually escalate to really high levels. It's usually when my anxiety or mood swings act up, I try and hide it and deal with it on my own but someone finds out and gets annoyed. Because they're annoyed, that sets off my already-bad anxiety and mood swings to crisis level, which makes them even angrier. I get very strong impulsive suicidal thoughts and feelings, and I've already attempted suicide once during the first lockdown. I felt there was no other escape.

I have frequent nightmares of it happening again, and I feel under so much pressure to be perfect so I don't start another argument. There's usually an argument around Christmas time so I'm incredibly anxious at the moment. I'm scared of what's going to happen in the next one. If I'm stuck here for the next lockdown, I don't think I can take it. I could move back in with my boyfriend but that's only if he allows it.

I would stay in my room all the time and avoid everyone, but we have to have dinner altogether and it's hard to avoid people when going down to the kitchen to get food. I just really don't know what to do anymore, I don't feel safe as my suicidal feelings are so impulsive. I want to stay alive for my mum. I'm just so afraid and I feel so trapped here."
1280,Im feeling guilty for being born,"Im 23 old guy, was raised by seemingly completely normal family from my perspective. I have two parents, and a younger brother. My dad beat me quite usually during my childhood until one time my mom told me, if he puts his hands on me one more time, she going to divore.

 During my childhood I was always a quite problematic kid. I always escaped from home. One time I escaped I was going with a bike down a hill when my brakes suddenly  didnt work anymore, I crashed straight into a brick wall, nearly died from it but luckily I survived. Just right after I got out of the surgery room, I was eating my ice cream with my mom, and some kids started to laugh at me because my face was irrecognizable..They found it quite funny..

The other time, I was probably 3-4 years old, i was sitting in the bath and suddenly I pulled the hair dryer into the water, but I survived.. 

 Years went by, my dad had a quarrel with some people from my village (that time they were his friends), and decided hes cutting those friends from his life. A few days later they wrote this thing onto our local grocery store's wall: "" ""My mom name"" "" whos children are ur husband raising"". That time i didnt really understand anything from it, I was really mad that someone could do this to my mom, why would some people make up such things?? 

Again, years went by, I was a college student and I was quite dependent on drugs. At 22  years old, a friend of mine who was and my classmate in elementary school told me, that my dad isnt my biological dad, and apperantly im his cousin, It was a shock to me but couldnt really understand the whole thing because i was on drugs.. 

But the next day, I felt all the pain.. My mom knew something is not alright with me, so we started talking, I told her everything, and she told me this is a lie and im my dad's child and they make this up, but its not true, I saw my biological dads picture and hes just like me, im not even similar to my dad in terms of anything, apperance, interests, nothing. everyone fucking knews it but in that moment she still didnt admit it. My parents live in a completely happy marriage. But I don't know how, but im really happy for it..

Even tho my dad beat me in my childhood, but he wasnt beaten by his dad in his childhood, he was clearly was traumatized too. Now im 23 and have quite good realtionship with my dad, he raised me up..

 Did my dad got lied to him in his whole life by my mom?? But I think deep inside he knews it.. What should I do? I dont want to ruin their marriage, but its tearing me up inside, I cant find any joy in my life and im constantly sad, I dont have any idea what should I do..I dont even know where I belong anymore.."
1281,How do you feel today?,"Hi how is everyone feeling/doing today? I am new to this group.

I hope things are better, and you are feeling well. YOU matter, and although the holiday seasons are some of the trickiest, this time will pass. There is hope, even if your brain tells you there isn't.

I am always open to listen if anyone needs to get anything off their chest, and remember, take it day by day!"
1282,Is it possible to have trauma from something you did?,"3 years ago, I commited something pretty horrible to someone I love, and I just can't believe that I did something like that, I feel genuinely horrified and disgusted by my behavior, and everytime I remember it I feel guilty to the point I have self harm thoughts, depresion and anxiety. In a way I feel I deserve it, in another, I feel tired, I know I'm not that guy anymore, and I'm really trying to get that out. Should I seek help?"
1283,Is it too much to want to feel wanted and appreciated?,"I really wish sometimes that I felt wanted by someone. I’m not just talking about my family, of course I feel loved in that way. But that doesn’t stop me feeling lonely. At this point I’m pretty sure my only measure of worth is based on other peoples opinions of me, so it’s natural for me that I might only feel happy if someone actually shows an interest in me and likes me. The problem is that I’ve never felt that way. 

I’ve tried dating a bit but I usually never get past the talking on the app stage. It feels like no matter who I match with, I don’t find any meaningful connection or any indication that someone is actually interested in me and wants me. I fall hard and fast when it comes to dating so I’ve really taken an emotional beating. It’s as if the people I talk to think I don’t have feelings. I’m fine with being let down and told that it’s not working, but to be ignored or lead on constantly really hurts me. I have feelings too, I feel rejected, I hurt like everyone else. 

Seeing lots and lots of people around me easily find relationships and dates is great. I’m really happy for them I truly am. But I just want it to be my turn. My turn to feel wanted, my turn to feel like I’m interesting, my turn to feel like I’m worth loving. Because I feel like that’s all I have. And the sad part is that I’m only 19.... I’ve barely lived my life yet and I already feel let down by the world. Maybe I just have too high expectations for my age. Maybe people will tell me that I have plenty of time and the right person will come along eventually. But I’m so sick of waiting because nothing else in my life is the way I want it. Nothing else exists around me that I’m genuinely happy with and can invest my time and energy into. I just want someone to come along and pick me up out of this hole and love me and make my life happy. And I truly just want to love someone. I want someone to make happy, someone to experience things with, to share things with, to love with all my heart....

It’s really taking it toll on me now. I’m having body image issues, trust issues and so much more. Of course I don’t attribute all of it to not feeling wanted, but they’re just getting worse as a result of it. I just want to be happy, I want to be wanted, I want to stop feeling this way"
1284,I’m so tired of caring if anyone actually cares about me.,"I’ve been really struggling lately. I’ve been binge eating like crazy and having thoughts of self harm for the first time in my life. I’m someone who has a lot of people in my life. I’m married. But, there’s just never anyone there for me. In the moments when I could really use people to show up, I feel like I’m abandoned. 

People would claim they like me. And it might look like I have plenty of support in my life from the outside. And maybe I do. I don’t know. But I feel completely and utterly alone. 

I do my best to reach out to people. To be good to people. Just be a good human overall. But, it’s exhausting. I know you shouldn’t be a good person so other people would be good to you, but, man, it would be nice sometimes. 

I’m starting meds tomorrow for the first time in my life. I’m nervous about that. I was going to wait until after the holidays, but somethings got to give. 

Part of me is hoping they give me a “f*** it” attitude to where I truly stop worrying about whether or not anyone gives a crap about me."
1285,Tired. I’m so tired.,"I feel like shit, I have an expanding list of mental illnesses to combat, I haven’t eaten, I haven’t gone outside in weeks, my self esteem is at an all time low, I can’t get out of bed, I feel like I’m going bald, every waking second is a struggling to exist normally. How do I stop this OCD-depression-anxiety-pessimistic fueled spiral? Or stop it long enough to let me eat?"
1286,I am afraid of my online friend and thinking about them makes me extremely uncomfortable .,"
I made an online friend over the quarantine and we quickly became pretty close and exchanged some personal info. At first I really trusted them but as I opened up to them about some issues I’ve had with anxiety they became kind of dependent on me. They said they began to want to almost “take care” of me, do things for me, they were unable to think for themselves, and they said I gradually took control of their life. 

This really scares me and makes me uncomfortable.. first of all, I obviously never wanted them to do any of this and I feel like they’re kind of blaming me for it. They said they’re physically and mentally ill because of this and have had to go to therapy. Every time we talk lately they just mention how unnatural our friendship was and it makes me really afraid, I just wanted to have a casual conversation friend, not whatever this is. 

Secondly them telling me this makes me feel like I am a toxic and manipulative person, and also like I can’t open up to people about my personal struggles because it will make people want to “fix” me. I also feel like they’re making this a really big deal, I never wanted an online friend to interfere with my real, personal life.

At this point I am honestly scared of them and I really don’t want to associate with them anymore but they are following me on several social media’s and I know if I left them they would miss me. I am really confused and scared and I don’t know what to do."
1287,I'm beyond exhausted. How do you go on when you're so exhausted mentally? I feel like I have to cry all the time.,"It's not like I feel better when I wake up. I'm just so tired. And I feel like I'm going to cry anytime anywhere. I'm trying not to cry because I'm in public and I feel like I have to and I don't know why. 

I know I can't die because of loved ones, but I really hate life still. I'm so so tired.  

I know I need help and at the same time I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't even know what's wrong with myself."
1288,My dad tested positive,"Last Saturday, my Dad was coughing a lot after work and said he had a cold.  The next day he had a headache, stuffy nose, and cough and for some reason i knew he had covid but my mom kept saying “oh he has a cold” but last time i checked, a cold is a bacterial illness not a weather one.  He got tested at work and a day later and he told us he tested positive which was yesterday.  I was angry at first and then cooled down but today i am disappointed and annoyed because everyone is in the living room watching tv and im in my room chilling and my brother, mom, and dad think im crazy for not being around them.  While there is a great chance i have covid, i feel well and great, but i just feel like i am the only one who is taking it serious in my house.  Am i tripping?  Thank you"
1289,How much is a hospital stay if I end up in the ER for my mental health?,"TW: Depression, self harm








Hey, I’m wonder how much it might cost me if I end up in a suicide watch/hold if I need to go to the ER for self harm.

I(M24) have had struggles with depression and self harm for over 10 years. It’s been about 4 years since I’ve hurt myself but in the last few months the urges have spiked. I can’t eat, can’t really sleep. My dreams often have me waking up in a depressed mood. I’m losing enjoyment in things I like to do and am currently out of work. I know I probably need to be hospitalized but I don’t know if I can afford it. My parents paid about 15k when I was in 10 years ago. I live with my mom and 4 other family members. I can’t afford to live on my own and if I end up needing it, I’ll be set back for when I actually am able to get my shit together. I don’t know what to do at this point. 

I live in Minneapolis if that helps for reference. I do have health insurance but I’m not sure what the coverage is."
1290,Has anyone tried writing down/keeping a journal or diary about the things that are making you depressed and anxious?,"I have been thinking about keeping a diary so that I can write down the things that are really bothering me at that time. My head is so scrambled and confused with different depressing thoughts and things that are causing me serious anxiety. I can’t organise these thoughts in my head. Every day, something else is added to the huge whirlwind going on inside my brain and it’s getting so overwhelming. So, I thought that if I could write them down, it would help me to get that thought “off my chest” and for it to be acknowledged. I think intention of this diary would not be to look back on things, but to simply acknowledge how I’m feeling and help me to move on from that particular intrusive thought or anxiety.

Has anyone ever tried something like this before? If so, would you mind sharing how it worked/works for you? Did you find any benefit from it, did it make a difference, or did it not help at all?

Also, I’m sorry if this post doesn’t make much sense. I’ve been awake for 40 hours and I’m so exhausted.

Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply. This is my first post here and have been writing this post over and over for nearly two hours trying to find the right words."
1291,It’s getting to me,"I’m gonna fucking snap. I feel like I’m going insane. I feel like I’ve just been angry all the time lately. Normally I’m just very down and out. I have thoughts of suicide and stuff. Lately though, I just wanna let loose. I just wanna hurt those making me angry. Hell, anyone in the room could be a fucking victim if I’m mad enough. I feel like I can’t take much more. I’m starting to have physical symptoms of the stress that’s building up. I’m gonna end up hurting myself and/or others. Hell, I’m already hurting. Worst of all, I can’t seek treatment. My fucking parents are so dense they think this is all because I’m a rebellious teen. I swear I’m gonna just break any minute. I feel like putting a hole in the wall. Just punching straight through it. I can’t be bothered to give a fuck anymore. Also, I’m starting to hear shit. I hear people saying things (unintelligible) when no one is around. I hear things moving that are staying still. Hell, for the first time today I saw a person that wasn’t there. I know this shit ain’t real (at least I think it isn’t), but only after talking myself out of believing that it happens."
1292,What is wrong with me? What should I do?,"When I was 12 years old I told my mom I think I was depressed. I went to the doctor and I remember he then took out a booklet and started asking me multiple choice questions based on depression.

I remember one of the questions specifically asked you if ever think about the ""big question"". And at the time I did but, I was terrified to admit that to my doctor. Not because of any reason other than I didn't want him to judge me for thinking that way.

I remember beginning to answer my questions very precisely, because I wanted him to make sure that he knew I was depressed because from all these questions I can tell I was depressed so I wanted help... But I didn't want him thinking I was *really* depressed, because I was so ashamed and embarrassed of that.

By the end of the appointment it was basically established that I was depressed but it was nothing to worry about.

Years and years went by and I suffered more and more but the shame and embarrassment grew stronger. It got to the point where I was known as that girl that was always happy and smiling, when really I was the most depressed person in the room by far because I was so terrified of letting people know how sad I was.

Once I turned 21, I wasn't getting as depressed I found. I was living my life a lot more truly to who I was rather than this person that I thought everyone wanted me to be. I felt this burden kind of lift from my shoulders, but also at the same time this feeling of anxiety grew more and more.

Now I'm 25. I almost can never leave my apartment anymore. I almost can never come to socialize in public. I cut almost everyone off. I lost my job (and the one and only reason I can even afford life right now is because of the COVID relief program). I am scared to use my own elevator in my own building in fear of being stuck in a small space with someone. I can't make phone calls or take phone calls. I am too scared to be even looked at while I walk or drive. The fear of being judged literally in even the slightest potential way, or being the center of attention or even just the thought of crossing someone's mind potentially can cause a crippling panic attack.

I'm terrified for my life honestly, I really don't know what to do.

I can't even call my doctors for help because I'm so terrified of calling, let alone sharing my problems.

When I do find the courage, I try for help but every single time I hear the voice on the other side or see the face of the person, I find myself immediately putting on a mask and LYING to make things seem not so bad. I'm so fucking good at it that I convinced myself and when I leave and go back to my car after the appointment or hang up on the phone and I immediately look at myself and think what the fuck is wrong with you!

When I'm alone, I'm utterly suffering but when I try and reach out for help when I can, something possesses me almost to never let anyone know.

I've even gone as far as writing down all of the awfully dark things as they are happening and was just going to straight up just read it to a doctor whether I liked it or not. When time came, I couldn't even do that! I looked at it and was just utterly embarrassed and ashamed and it felt like it wasn't true. Even though I knew full well I wrote it when I was feeling that exact way. 

I feel NUTS. I'm scared to get help. SOS."
1293,"Anyone have advice on dealing with irrational thoughts, that you are aware are irrational?","Particularly with being anxious or paranoid? It’s like one side of me is so aware that a “irrational thought”/fear isn’t rational. However, at the same time these thoughts come w/ a separate feeling that seems to linger. 

Here is an example of what I mean: 
Let’s some some girl or boy that you knew hates you and is out to get you and always lies to you, etc., told you that your SO cheated. Now while you rationally know that’s not true, pretty much absolutely certain and can be reassured, when you hear that you still feel like weird about it. How would you make doubts and fears about it go away? 

That’s just an example and doesn’t even relate to me, so I’m speaking more generally— How do you deal with icky feelings created by irrational thoughts that aren’t true. 

Thanks for reading and I appreciate any insight."
1294,feelings of fear,"hello. first time poster here, so i apologize for any mistakes.

i'd like to start off by saying that i've never really been to a therapist, as i can't really afford it. i also don't have any previous diagnoses.
so, i've always been a slightly anxious person. nothing too bad, just the ""did i leave the oven on?"", ""are they laughing at me?"" overthinking type of thing. it's hardly ever been overwhelming for me and it would go away after a bit. i'm also a pretty ""free"" person and there aren't many things that can make me feel fearful or unsettled.

however, in the past two months or so, it's become gradually worse. i've started feeling very fearful and jumpy, along with feeling worried/anxious about everything. the quietest of noises can make me think that there's something bad about to happen or that there's an intruder, and it usually results in me shaking and becoming really tense. and in the mornings i wake up with a pit in my stomach, as if i'm waiting for something stressful to happen. lately it's been affecting my sleep schedule, and even now, as i'm writing this at 3:35AM. i either stay up very late or don't sleep at all. any help is appreciated, as i really don't know what's going on."
1295,i'm having something of a bad day.,"i woke up this morning at 2:30 am and immediately began to have anxiety attacks. i'm not entirely certain why, but i know that i kept thinking about how much i hate myself and how i'm not a priority in anyone's life. i tossed and turned in bed for several hours until i was finally able to pull myself out of bed around 11 to shower. i've never experienced something like that--a several hours long anxiety attack. it was crippling. i felt so inadequate and was filled with self-loathing. 

generally, my mental health this year has been bad since my ex walked out on me this january. later, one of my good friends (who i lived with) told me that i was better off dead when i was reaching out for help, and have had to move back in with my parents due to losing my job because of covid. 

i did find a therapist that i clicked with, however they are unexpectedly moving out of state and will no longer be able to practice where i live. so now i'm back to looking for help. i'm just worried about the downward spiral i seem to be in.

i've tried getting back into the dating world, but have been largely used for sex, with most of the folks i had gone out with only wanting a one night stand (contrary to what they had told me previously). i've been seeing some one for almost two months now who has told me that they're not ready for commitment and that they need to work through their own past trauma, which is understandable, however i've developed feelings for them and it eats me up that i'm more invested than he seems to be. 

i feel really lost and anxious all the time. i don't know what to do and i'm scared that i'll have more mornings like i've had today."
1296,This might sound a little crazy...,"Over the last few months, I’ve started suspecting that I have either ADHD or even be autistic. I’ve thought I might have ADHD before, but never once did autism cross my mind until much more recently. It’s really hard to explain because I’m bad at expressing things properly sometimes, but it might help to talk to someone who experiences one or both of those. Since I’m a woman, I know that it will be more difficult to find out whether I’m dealing with it or not, just because of history and stigma and everything. I’ve done a little bit of research and it just makes me think about it more and more. If there are some good resources for me to learn a bit more about things, I would also appreciate it."
1297,I’m saying what I’m saying. An open note to health care professionals.,"I’ll say it. 

First of all, without question, the health care professionals serving as front liners during this pandemic are real-life superhero’s and we owe them a debt we can never repay. They showed up. They sacrificed for us. They are carrying an incredible weight. They keep going. There is no debate here. Let me make so clear that what I will say here, in no way negates this. But it is simultaneously true. 

And I will say this now unapologetically. Because I was making noise about, doing advocacy work, fighting back, standing up, working to create change in the health care system BEFORE the pandemic. And this doesn’t change what I saw from our health care system (in Canada) before COVID-19 hit. But it sure as hell holds the potential to lead to a better way after. 

“After” this COVID-19 pandemic, I don’t want to hear about one single mental health care patient walking in to receive mental health care and being treated how they have been treated before it. 

Not by one single health care professional who worked through this pandemic. 

I am reading and hearing everywhere about the anxiety, depression, trauma, panic, PTSD, stress, addiction, self-harm behaviours, and burn out health care professionals are suffering from from working through this pandemic. 

From an article I read today:“We are seeing increasing numbers of staff becoming ill and not able to work – both with COVID-19 and other illnesses,” the letter reads. “While we are coping and planning for redeployment, we are seeing more illness and stress and hearing about the toll this is taking on people’s families…(Frontline workers) are exhausted, they're emotionally and physically exhausted.”

That will change you. 

THAT SHOULD CHANGE YOU. 

If you feel the need to make degrading and derogatory comments to me while I am in a mental health crisis and taking responsibility and seeking help for it, you can now say those comments to your co-worker who is having a trauma response and behaviours from working through COVID-19. 

If you feel the need to downplay and diminish the suffering of my friend, a human being, in a mental health crisis, and say they are wasting your time and shouldn’t be here, say that to your nursing school bestie who had depression from working through COVID-19. 

If you feel the need to say, “Oh, it’s just anxiety, you’re free to go” and not provide any ounce of support, resources or referrals when clearly my family member’s “just anxiety” is flooding and overwhelming to the point where they are here, desperate for help, say that to your brother who has anxiety from working through COVID. 

If you feel the need to mock, humiliate, harass, the mental health care patient you are treating who is panicking, go do those things to your superior who is having a panic attack from working through COVID-19. 

If you feel the need to aggressively tell your patient to “get over it,” “snap out of it,” say they are faking it, say they are attention-seeking, say it’s all in their head, it’s not real, and physically handle them roughly to “snap them out of it” when they present with disassociation, go put your hands on and tell your co-worker with dissassociative attacks from working through COVID-19 to make them “get over it.”

If you feel the need to make a public display, example of, discuss the patient like they aren’t even in the room, walk right in and loudly and openly discuss the patient with visitors present or other people around, breach the privacy and confidentiality of your mental health care patient, may you hope that is never how you are treated when you need care for your PTSD from working through COVID-19.

If you feel the need to provide sub-par care, handle roughly, work slowly, not advocate for, speak crassly to and dehumanize the addict on your service, provide that level of care to your daughter who followed in your footsteps when she ends up in your ER from her addiction from working through COVID-19. 

If you feel the need to write up the patient, note in their chart, flag their file, dismiss the patient for advocating for themselves or even for others who are there supporting and advocating for them, write up and flag your “work-wife” for advocating for their own mental health and seeking care for the overwhelming stress they are enduring from working through COVID-19. THERE ARE ALL REAL SCENARIOS OR BEHAVIOURS THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED, WITNESSED, OR BEEN TOLD ABOUT DIRECTLY BY THE PATIENT. 

We, the public, are constantly being asked to think of you, give you accolade, follow public health directives to relieve the burden on you, honour your sacrifice and commitment, praise you as heroes. 

And that is deserved in this pandemic. 

But I am a heart patient. And have received world-class care at a specialized facility for my heart conditions.

And the treatment and care I have received as a heart patient was VERY different than the times I was ever interacting with the health care system in regard in any way to mental health.

And I mean both being treated as a human being and also medically.

Which, really, combines inseparably into the care you provide for a patient.

The level of effort and attention and time given to patients, urgency and importance placed in treating patients, occurrence of negligence and medical error, support for family members, patience and empathy and compassion shown, respecting privacy and confidentiality, displaying basic human decency, being respectful to the patient and caregivers, carefulness with physically handling a patient, support resources offered, ease and speed for gaining access to other specialties or departments when needing their services, how it was to navigate any further services referred to as the patient, wait times, communication between departments...the list goes on, all of it.

I have witnessed first hand the incredible difference in care received for what appears to be, I don’t know, more favourable patients and diagnosis, than less favourable ones for many health care professionals?

It’s 2020; there are endless campaigns, efforts, fundraising and movements in support of changing the conversation around, view of, and stigma around mental health and getting support for mental health. It’s everywhere.

Yet, the health care system and medical community is severely impaired in providing mental health care and providing dignity, human decency, and respect in working with mental health care patients. You are failing mental health patients. So why would anyone ever reach out for support and seek treatment? To be treated in the ways I’ve witnessed patients treated and have been treated myself?

If you choose to continue to be a health care professional, after being a front liner, this is your time to wake up and see what is now irrefutably happening around you with your co-workers and people you care about.

Let this move you today to take a moment to reflect on your own bias and provision of care for mental health care and patients. 
This is the chance of a lifetime to grow in your humanity, compassion and empathy in this way. 

Take it. 

Do better. Be better. And be the best health care provider you can be for your patients.

You must self-reflect on if you are a person who is able to hold onto basic human decency, compassion, empathy and placing value on respect and dignity for others, when holding this position. And if you are able to fulfill this great responsibility to your fellow human beings in being a health care worker.

Again, I will repeat, without question, the health care professionals serving as front liners during this pandemic are real-life superhero’s and we owe them a debt we can never repay. They showed up. They sacrificed for us. They carried an incredible weight. They kept going. There is no debate here. Let me make so clear that what I have said here, in no way negates this. 

But it is simultaneously true."
1298,Coping with childhood abuse &amp; how to move on a an adult?,"For clarity &amp; interest in making this user-friendly, I'm going to try to be very straight forward here. When I was a preteen I was sexually abused by a direct family member, someone older and in a very high position of trust. When my parents found out, they did not take things seriously, as my understanding to protect the abuser. I don't wish to go into further detail about that, however, I will say I do kind of understand due to the abusers mental state and position within our family. That is in no way to justify or excuse, just to point out I can see the situation as being extremely complex and that most people would have had trouble handling this set of circumstances. 
I am now 29 years old and living with a ton of depression &amp; have anxiety when facing just about every day if my life, even the days off. My GF left a while ago because she just couldn't live like this anymore and I get that. I struggle to go out of the house except for work. Even getting groceries I avoid because I feel like my car will break down or something. I cope by smoking marijuana when I am not at work, all the time since I was 15 years old. All I want is to get right and be able to afford my own house, be able to get a pet and form new loving relationships. I continue to fail at obtaining all those goals. Does anybody have any advice or anything similar they dealt with? Thank you so much for your time."
1299,Confused with reality and my dream state,"I’ve always been getting very confused with what is real and what I have dreamt, I have needed a few people to provide me some “reality checks” and I ask them if something really happened or if I dreamt it.
My dreams seem so real that sometimes I don’t even consider if it happened or not until someone mentions something to me and I say “oh this happened this way” when in reality it never happened or it was completely different..

It’s starting to get the point where it is making my head “hurt” trying to decipher what is real and what isn’t. 
Sunday night I had a dream about things that happened at work and conversations but the only reason I knew they weren’t real is because I work during the week, so it couldn’t possibly have happened because I wasn’t at work. 
Everything is so realistic it makes me so confused and I feel so stupid when I make a mistake and get them mixed up in front of people.

It’s a hard thing to talk about mainly because I don’t know who to talk about this stuff to. 

I’m getting really mixed up with somethings thinking I’ve already done it but it was just a dream... example I went to the freezer and chucked out a plate of strawberries, three days later me and my boyfriend were doing a quick clean out and they were there again? I was confused because I could have sworn I chucked them out... but turns out I didn’t, I can remember so vividly the visuals and movements on what happened and me taking them to the bin... but it never did. 
So it’s making me more forgetful only because I think I’ve already done it... 

I really don’t know how to cope with this stuff as it’s starting to effect me daily, it actually becomes so draining as it feels like I don’t get proper sleep when I have these realistic dreams. It just feels like I’m awake in my sleep and I’m doing my regular day to day activities (if this makes sense) 

I don’t know how to handle them and how to constantly keep track on my reality, has anyone else experienced this? I don’t even know what it’s called and how to further explain it besides it feels like I’m living two lives, one in my dream and one in reality."
1300,I don’t know what to do,"I can’t stop shaking or crying I don’t want to be here anymore just make it stop im so stupid I always mess up i love him why am i such a dumbass I constantly mess up my life its all my fault, i feel like im gonna relapse but I can’t i gotta stay strong for him i just wanna sleep for a year"
1301,Anxious because of family,"So I’ve been really anxious that my family is going to basically turn against me. They like to pour over every little thing you say and use that against you somehow. I’ve started calling them “witch hunts” because that’s what it feels like. “Oh you said _____ that must mean you are trying manipulate _____ so you can stab them in the back” in other words you are the witch who will be burned at the stake. 

My family has never been good with trusting each other (probably why I have so many trust issues). It’s always been about talking about each other behind their back and seeing who is betraying who. All the while saying how family is all you can trust ironically enough. 

Just today _____ and ____ were talking on the phone and as soon as I walked out of the room they start whispering about something. I didn’t catch all of it but I did overhear “alright hurry up he’ll be back soon”. It’s just got me really anxious thinking what they were trying to say behind my back. 

I don’t know, it’s hard to explain I do care about them but at the same they really aren’t great people. Even more annoyingly they are deeply religious and like to get on their high horse acting like they are absolute saints who can do no wrong (To be clear I have nothing against religious people as a whole, it’s just the ones who use god as an excuse to be shitty people that I’m referring to)."
1302,What’s the difference between trauma response vs mental illness?,Can anyone explain?
1303,Toxic Family,"I've known for years that most of my family was toxic. They all gaslight me constantly and invalidate my feelings. When disagreements come up they all band together against me (and whatever my position is in the drama). It's my dad and stepmom and their kids plus her family. I've always felt like an outsider in my own family. The few times I've tried to express these feelings I'm told I'm ""seeing things"" or that I ""shouldn't feel that way"". Classic gaslighting and it's made me feel like I'm crazy for 32 years. I finally took a stand (respectfully) after family drama a few days ago. The problem is, honestly if I don't roll over and play the prefect little stepdaughter (aka doormat) again I'm pretty sure my dad is going to cut me out. I asked him multiple times to go check the video message I sent him - that I need to have these things resolved before I agree to come up for Christmas with my kids (his grandkids) and he's stubbornly refusing. I'm not going to change my mind - but he is such a control freak that it wouldn't surprise me if the just flat out refuses to. I'm having a really hard time with all of this. I can't speak to him in person because he will constantly interrupt me, my stepmom will belittle me, and they will both invalidate my feelings. I'm so torn up about all of this."
1304,mental health going down,"I started working a few months ago as an immigration paralegal. I have no experience in the field (first job after college). I normally do well with thoroughness and completing tasks, but I've recently made a mistake that is going to result in having to refile at least 2 applications. One of the clients is super crabby and mean and I'm not looking forward to speaking with him, and I hate that my dumb mistake is going to delay his process for 1-2 months. I'm in the process of applying to law schools, which is going really well, and I hate that I'm gonna be successful academically and financially yet I'm making these dumb mistakes that are going to hurt underprivileged people who rely on me doing my work competently. My law school app process also hasn't brought me any joy or pride in my success. I just feel super numb about it. 

I started self harming again. (Can I talk to my therapist about this without being at risk of being committed to an inpatient center involuntarily?). I got bad medical news that a heart condition I have is worse than they thought (nothing too bad, but it's gonna complicate a surgery I'll need in 5-10 years). My sister's metal health is really bad and she recently had a friend die by suicide and I'm worried that I should be there for her more but I feel like whenever I'm around her I just stress her out more bc I'm stressed with work. I really want to leave my job but it's just me and the attorney and I know the clients would be worse off without me there. I also feel super weak that I'm just a couple months into the working world and it's already taking such a toll on my mental health."
1305,Regrets and the sort.,"i've done some messed up things in the more recent past. i regret these things a lot, to a point that makes me feel sick or want to cry. as a quick way to clear things up, this is not about hurting myself or anyone else. I've just done some questionable shit that I really regret.

i'm just a kid, barely old enough to use this website, and i know im prone to doing things that are kind of messed up. but regardless, i still regret a lot of things. i wish i could go back in time and say ""hey!! thats not a very good idea and is kind of messed up!!"" and i would've listened instantly. i hate that im about to put some of the blame on my parents here but i honestly wish they were more restrictive. I've been exposed to a lot of shit i probably shouldn't have been exposed to at this young of an age. they honestly dont seem to care that i was exposed to it.

i could go on a tangent about my family, but the title says regrets, so i guess ill talk about it later/in the comments. thanks for reading"
1306,"Dungeons, Dragons, Drugs and Depression","The holiday season can be a particularly challenging time for many people all across the globe, so I figured it’s about time I finally shared my personal journey on the mental health strugglebus. Unlike my other articles this one won’t include a clean and concise list of bullet-point takeaways, because it has been anything but. However I do hope that you find something worthwhile in the following text whether it be acknowledgment that your struggles are valid and that you’re not alone in how you feel, a continued hope for light at the end of the tunnel, a rekindling of your connection to the RPG community, or even just to get to know me (Aaron, The Alpine DM) a little bit better as a fellow human being.

I can’t tell you exactly when it started, but for the longest time I felt like I wasn’t present in my own life. It wasn’t all thunderclouds and rainstorms; in fact from the outside it probably *seemed* like everything was perfect. Loving and supportive family? Check. A handful of close friends? Check. Academic success? Checkity Check. 

Yet there was an inescapable apathy deep within myself that I couldn’t seem to shake or explain. As fucked up as it seems, there were days when I wished a horrific tragedy upon myself. At least then, I told myself, I would have some justification for feeling this way.

It wasn’t that I wanted to die. I just didn’t particularly want to live. 

In 9th grade I got introduced to Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e through my brother and some of our mutual friends from LaserTag. After spending 45 minutes laughing non-stop at how ridiculous and silly the entire premise was, it finally “clicked” and I understood the appeal. It was like playing some of my favorite video game RPGs but there weren’t any restrictions on what I could try, and I got to enjoy the story with friends.

These Friday nights became a sort of safe haven that I looked forward to greatly. There was no need to hide my nerdy interests or shy-away from the weirdo that I truly was. Naturally I didn’t openly talk about this at school because, being 14, I was concerned with trying to be popular and kiss a girl. I’m not sure where I picked it up (*mainstream media in 2008? idk)* but it was ingrained in my head that ‘Dungeons and Dragons is for hopeless losers. God forbid I associate myself with that publicly. 

Fast forward a few years and along came drugs. It was like a light-switch turned on, “*Holy shit… I feel great.”* I’ll gloss over some major details but I quickly became addicted to the thrill of pushing myself to the limit –  mentally, physically, and emotionally – just to see if I could get away with it. The best way to describe it is like speeding down the highway and closing your eyes while taking your hands off the wheel (Yes I’ve done this…please don’t be like me). You know everything will *probably* be fine, but there’s the distinct possibility that things could go catastrophically wrong at any second. However I was willing to take that risk because feeling *SOMETHING* seemed a whole lot better than the emptiness I had grown accustom to. 

Annyyyywaaay…I wound up in the hospital (and this wouldn’t be the last time either) and got the fancypants diagnosis of polysubstance abuse. Now what exactly does that mean? Basically that I wanted to be fucked up all the time and didn’t care how, or alternatively it “*refers to a type of substance dependence disorder in which an individual uses at least three different classes of substances indiscriminately and does not have a favorite drug that qualifies for dependence on its own.*“

In college the pressure to “be cool” grew stronger than ever, but so did my yearning to once again play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and feel comfortable in my own skin. For whatever reason I felt deeply ashamed of my love for the hobby and kept it hidden from virtually everyone.

Sure the non-stop crazy partying was a lot of fun (*cue more ER visits…*), but I wasn’t doing myself any favors in the mental health department. I could barely get out of bed in the morning and drag myself to class – in fact many days I didn’t. Just thinking about existing and interacting with the world was completely draining. “*How do all of these people do this every single day?”,* I distinctly remember thinking to myself.

I found some solace by hiding away in my room and rolling up different characters that I came up with. With these characters I would go on adventures, get into barfights, and explore randomly generated dungeons (all by myself of course). Eventually I was enthralled by the idea of *actually* playing again and decided to check out some posts in [r/lfg](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/). I continued to completely hide the fact that I was interested in playing D&amp;D, despite now actually meeting up with people to play it regularly. Admittedly it was weird to meet up with complete strangers and start a campaign, but everyone turned out to be awesome people and it reminded me of why I loved playing D&amp;D so much in the first place.

Despite this, things went downhill pretty quickly after graduating from college. Staying up until 4am railing lines of coke and downing bottles of champagne. By myself. Only to wake up and do a few more lines before heading to work. While avoiding something I was passionate about I had inadvertently became that which I was trying to avoid. I had become a hopeless loser.

It didn’t take too long to realize I was plummeting towards rock bottom, so I quickly started cleaning up my act and decided to move across the country for a new job. It wasn’t an easy or perfect process but through mindfulness practice, plenty of water and exercise, help from a professional, and of course slaying dragons, I was able to get myself back on the right track. Shortly after, I found a new D&amp;D group full of awesome players and was inspired to create this website. 

Could all of this have been avoided if there wasn’t such a (perceived) stigma against Dungeons &amp; Dragons and discussing mental health? Sure, maybe. Regardless, this hobby has repeatedly connected me with new friends and continually gives me something to look forward to.

1307,I have executive dysfunction; what mental health problem do I have?,"So, it's currently 4 am and I haven't managed to pack and clean a few weeks worth of dishes because I kept getting hung up on how to start or to do it, it got so bad that I think I got an anxiety attack because of it and now I'm doing this to have a break of dealing with it. 

Basically I experience what I am pretty sure is executive dysfunction very often, with most tasks or things I do really. It is also a biggg problem with having to write essays or do other projects in university. Exams itself are fine, nice really, maybe not the studying beforehand so much but I'm good at cramming, and timed essays are the best (even though I go hog wild during them lmao, but somehow when it's timed I do my best work, in almost an adrenaline-filled rush which leaves me exhausted afterwards). I also just overthink absolutely anything ever, I want to take all the possibilities onboard, and often when I have to explain my thinking process about something, people look at me as if I'm crazy for how many things I think about when it's about something simple, and how many unfollowable bridges I make from one thing to the other that to me seem perfectly fine, although I tend to forget how my train of thought started altogether. I also tend to be very pessimistic and doomthinker-y, mostly because of fear. Kind of related to that is that I always want, or almost need, to do things perfectly, I can't really comprehend half-assing something when I think about it, although now, because things like perfectionism and executive dysfunction happen, I still end up half-assing a lot of things in the end. This again stems from fear, mostly a huge fear of failure, and fear of guilt and embarrassment I think. This fear aspect has some roots in how the family I grew up in was and how I coped with it, but I wonder how much of that is nurture, and how much of that might stem from other things, and maybe point towards a particular mental health problem that I had basically my whole life maybe?

I know that executive dysfunction can happen with depression, but I have been diagnosed with a major depression which was years ago and I feel so different now, I don't feel like I have depression, or at least not nearly as strong. I also just feel like there is more going on, because this doesn't seem to be tied to how I'm doing at all, it seems to happen whether I'm feeling depressed or not. 

I know that it's a symptom of ADHD but - okay this might sound weird, but I have always been a really slow person, or at least I feel like I experience the world slower than other people? I don't know. What people described who talked about ADHD, and the people I personally know who are diagnosed with it, seem very different to me. 

I've also heard it's an autism thing, and that's something I've been wondering about. Autism seems so broad though, and I have a hard time even understanding what it fully entails if I'm honest. I do think that there are a lot of random social media posts about things that people with autism experience that made me go ""huh, I think I do this"", moreso than with ADHD, but still there are things that I don't feel like I have. The biggest being that I am I think very good at reading people and reading their emotions, which seems like the opposite from people with autism? I do feel like it's not a very intrinsic skill but something I've learned, but I learned it myself very early on. I remember being in kindergarten and deliberately """"studying"""" other kid's reactions to me and each other lol. I have also read a lot about how people born as women are underdiagnosed with I think both ADHD and autism, that they ""mask"" their behaviour more so it doesn't show as much, which I think might have been the case with me? I did live in a quite abusive household as a child as well, and one of the very first memories I have (also from that time) is me trying to act differently than how I felt inside in order to not get in trouble with an abusive family member. Also if you're wondering based on this, yes, I'm pretty sure I have some trauma-related issues too, pretty heavy ones I think, but I have never been diagnosed for it either because frankly there were always more pressing mental issues to work on with the depression and all. I also think(???) that I have some anxiety disorder if I'm honest but once again, the therapists I was seeing just gave me the depression diagnosis and we went from there, without really looking back at possible diagnoses, just trying to work on things, mostly with CBT. I honestly feel like there's just a lot of stuff I never got around to.

Are there other reasons someone could experience executive dysfunction I'm missing? What do I have/what could I have?"
1308,Virtual Therapy/ Therapy in NYC recs??,"Has anyone ever tried virtual therapy?

(better help or talk space)

Or anyone know a good therapist in NY area that won't cost half my rent"
1309,Seeing Yourself (69),"It takes time. Growing up as a ""cis"", I always thought that my life was figured out. I thought that this is how I am and the things I felt; Body Dysphoria, Gender Dysphoria, Sexuality, which some I didn't even know what they were at the time, were all things I can learn out of. I always thought that eventually I would become ""normal"", whatever that means........

It took 22 and a half years until one night on a walk without any expectations of it happening, saying out loud ""I'm Trans"". Wow, what a mix and rush of emotions. It felt good, it made me feel down (thinking of other peoples opinions) &amp; everything in between. **WELL NOW, I AM HERE SAYING I AM PROUD TO BE TRANS. It makes me feel finally at home in my body.** It makes me feel finally understood by myself why I have felt and experienced all the things I have since such a young age of 15 years.

8 years later, Here, I am.

The journey and the road for anyone; Trans, Non-Binary, Gender Conforming, Gay, Bi, Lesbian, Straight, Cis etc., is a difficult and challenging road, with many ups, many downs, many hardships and everything in between. We must continue to celebrate ourselves which ultimately allow us to celebrate each other. I was thinking about this blog post last night when  I was in the shower. Thinking how meaningful our lives, our souls, our spirits, our beings, our bodies really are. I know the world is still learning and coming to terms with it, but the way that **WE** can have an impact, is by being our true and authentic self. 

I just want to make things clear as well, I am sitting and writing this all, but I still struggle everyday. Struggle with living my full truth, waiting for my time to receive my estrogen pills and testosterone blockers, I still struggle with gender and body dysphoria but what I have learned and become to accept, is that even though this is who I am right now, this is not who I will be forever. With every moment, second, minute, hour, day, week, month........we get closer to living our true authentic divine sacred selves. It takes time but its all worth it.

I love you.

1310,Me and my girlfriend lost someone today.,"Me and my girlfriend were were in a poly relationship. And she loved both of us with her whole heart. We often joked how she had a heart of gold to love us both. Her other boyfriend passed away this morning. Or last night. More then likely In his sleep. She found his body.

She’s been crying her eyes out all day today. She told me she’s contemplated the end of a gun. I’m doing the best i can to be there for her. I just hope I don’t lose her too."

1314,Autism and medication,"Hi im a 24 F and Ive been een diagnosed with ASD since a young age and have always struggled a lot with it. I end up hurting my family and anyone who gets close, not on purpose but I dont understand them. I know its said Aspies experience empathy and I do but rarely otherwise I dont feel much of anything maybe stress and a little flutter once in a while otherwise its like being numb.This has caused a lot of issues in my interpersonal relationships and I wanna change to be better. I also think past emotional trauma has contributed to this but overall its something I've always dealt with and masking has just been an exhausting lifestyle and I feel like im about to break sometimes. My mom however suggested anxiety meds and I've read about a few as well. Have any of you tried anything that helps? I've heard Risperidone helps."
1315,Making a list of things I'm good at to prove to myself: I Do Matter:,"I've been in a really dark spot lately, with my mum going to hospital, my relationship with her bouncing between her screaming that she hates my guts and then being my best friend. My insomnia is flaring back up and I've lost 7 kilos (worried my eating disorder is returning after 3 years clean). I'm having night terrors every time I fall asleep, then I'll finally sleep solidly at 7am and wake up at 3pm still exhausted. I feel like I'm at my breaking point with stress from school work over the holidays and I dont know if I can do this shit much longer. I feel like I'm worthless, like nothing I do is good enough or has any importance. I think if I can make a list of things I'm good at now when I'm not feeling too down maybe I can look back on it and get myself out of a bad spot.

1.) I'm a good writer. I enjoy it and I should do it more for fun, not just school work.

2.) I have a pretty good sense of humor.

3.) I can identify pretty much an song I know within a second.

4.) I'm a nice weight. I do not need to lose any more. 

5.) I can read super long books in a single sitting (depending on what book it is).

6.) I know a lot about history and can rant about it like nobody's business.

7.) I'm half decent at art."

1317,Working from home,"It sounds amazing, it's what I'd dreamt of doing for so long and now do due COVID I had the chance to experience this. The first few weeks were spectacular. I can get up later, save money, no more commuting and do the things I need to do around the house and get work done.

Fast forward 7 months and home is no longer my safe place, it's a work zone. Everything I once enjoyed, I now feel guilty for doing because I am unable to seperate home from work. Even going to the kitchen and watching my TV show during my lunch break feels wrong. 

I've tried walking everyday, joining a gym, walking to the shops instead of driving and attempting to get outdoors but it's to no avail because I end up coming back to work instead of relax and unwind. I'm currently seeking a counsellor to help me through this process


Just wish people would stop telling the home workers how lucky we are to be working from home because ""that's amazing"". Much prefer to work from another location and return home to feel relaxed and comfortable"
1318,Why this happens to me?,"TW: suicide

Why I have intrusive thoughts telling me that someone around me is going to commit suicide? It's fucking annoying, thinking about that is making me sad and I don't want this to happen. 

I don't believe this gonna happen and I'm always the person with this thoughts so I don't know what to do. There's something to stop thinking?"
1319,Random feelings of laziness despite doing nothing? Why? How? Wtf??,"Just now I was chilling in my bed, watching netflix while somehow scrolling through my phone. Out of nowhere I suddenly don't feel like doing anything, even doing the bare minimum of just watching tv. Even got tired of my phone. Why the sudden random wave of laziness? Is it common? Is it something to worry about? Anyone relate to this?"
1320,Nobody cares because I’m not mentally ill and I have fine grades,"Okay I’m having a bad day so I’m gonna vent here if that’s okay. I couldn’t sleep at all last night, usually I can only sleep 4 hours a night, but I couldn’t sleep at all, it’s just been downhill from there. I wish anyone in my life would listen to me when I talk about what I’m struggling with but people don’t seem to care. Most of my friends have diagnosed anxiety or depression so whenever I try to talk about what’s bothering me they’re like “oh, well I have depression, so what you’re going through can’t be that bad.” I used to self harm back in middle school (my parents know btw-  they had me see a therapist for a couple months and then my mom decided to take my therapist and still sees her to this day.), I also low key attempted suicide (it wasn’t really that big of a deal tho) and I tried to go to a school counselor about how I was feeling and she told me to drink some tea and I’d feel better. I did not feel better. 

I also have a lot of trouble feeling nervous. I have arachnophobia really bad, not just I’m scared of spiders, but I have trouble leaving the house or going on vacation or going somewhere I’ve never been before because there could be a spider there. It’s so difficult for me just to go outside but everyone just thinks I’m being annoying and being a brat. 

Also, I have a lot of trouble eating. I really just have no motivation to eat. I don’t really enjoy food and I downright hate most foods. I even hate water, I won’t drink it. And everyone tells me I’m super privileged and bratty for it, and I know, but that doesn’t help the fact that I have a lot of trouble the the color and texture and taste of it (I know it sounds stupid). I’ve lost quite a bit of weight over quarantine and my parents are really mad at me. I’m trying my best to gain weight but I just really hate eating. 

I’m just having a really hard time and whenever i try to talk about it, people minimize my feelings because I’m not mentally ill. And I know that my friends with depression and anxiety and adhd have a hard time, I acknowledge that they probably have a lot harder time doing day to day things than me. But I wish anybody would listen to me. Counselors tell me I’m fine because I have good grades. My family tells me I’m privileged. And my friends tell me that they have a harder time because they’re mentally ill.

I’m just hoping someone here can understand. Maybe validate me a little, because I’m so tired of being ignored."
1321,how does one change to a new therapist?,"i know that usually you'd have to go through a few therapists before you find one that you feel is the right one for you, but how does that process work?

i've only started going for therapy in september this year, and although this is my first therapist i like her and can see sticking with her for quite a while.

but i'm curious, how do you know if your therapist isn't good for you? how do you know that, ""hm i think i should find a new one.. i don't really like this one"" can you tell immediately from the first session? or do you have to go for a few sessions (maybe 3-5ish i don't know) until you can see for yourself that they aren't good for you?

also, let's say you find another therapist which you feel like is better for you than your current one. how does that go? how do you tell your current that you want to stop seeing them? do you just straight up tell them that you don't want to see them for therapy sessions anymore? or do you hint that you found a better therapist, etc

i'm sorry if this post is full of unconventional questions i'm just really curious and i'd like some advice, just in case i need it for the future. so i'd like as much info as i could get on this and i'd really appreciate it a lot!"

But I'm scared, I don't know how to do this, I don't want to seem weak, I don't even want to ask for help,  I don't know if I deserve it but I think I might benefit from it. 

Also I really don't want them to make fun of me for asking, ""weakness"" is not taken well in my family, you have to be strong. I don't know where the line between being vulnerable and being weak Is, but it is a fine line that I don't really want to cross."
1328,What gives you life?,"Hi, I am super burnt out.

I feel like nothing I do is really fun. I always feel tired and always emotionally depleted. I work generally from 9-6, but I can’t help but worry about work after hours. I always find it difficult to sleep during this time because there is more on my plate than I can handle.

I’m staying with my parents at the moment. They don’t get along with my grandpa who is also living with us. They had large argument recently which ended up in some broken dishes and no one is happy which breaks my heart. I feel stuck in the middle having to console all parties involved.

This is making me super depressed and worsens my burn out. I feel like my family is super heavy to carry as I can’t remember the last time everyone spent time together without some sort of argument.

I feel resentful to my parents because it feels like I was just taught to study and work hard, but never how to be happy nor how to deal with relationship conflicts properly. It’s perhaps unfair to blame my parents for being imperfect, but I’m so frustrated by everything. I feel so drained by work. I don’t feel like I have strong relationships. Stress from work keeps me up at night and keeping my mental as well as physical well being in check feels impossible during these times.

I’m just trying to take care of myself, but I can just do the basics like eat fruits and veges and go out for a walk and brush my teeth. How can I replenish my spent soul? I feel like an over heated engine. I feel like I am sputtering car out of gas. I feel like there is a frog stuck in my throat. I feel cheated of my youth, as now should be the time for me to meet and date people (online since there is quarantine).

I was able to take a couple week vacation, fortunately, but all that time was spent worrying how I would survive at my job once I got back from vacation.

I feel like I have no control over my mood. I feel like my time off and weekends are useless in terms of rest and recovery. I will sleep in, but it doesn’t make me feel much better. My mind and heart is in pain. I just want to run away from all my responsibilities. I frown all the time and feel hopeless.

TLDR;

I am burnt out and nothing I do or how much time I take off feels restful.

Now after that rant, I am curious for those who are loving life, or have suffered and in a much better place now, what’re you doing that is helping you emotionally, mentally, and spiritually? What are you doing that is giving you life and how did you find it? How do you get out of this pit of emotional exhaustion?

Thank you for reading this plea for help and advice."
1329,"Anger problems, as an adult","(Skip a bit to go past my life story, iidn't realize how much I wrote)

As a kid I always had outbursts. Violent usually. It could be over something totally menial and I would get so worked up I would hit family, tore multiple holes all over my room, and gave a teacher a concussion right after turning 12. I then went to a long term facility (was at a short term multiple times before) across state, as the school system would not let be back before going.

During my time there, they diagnosed me with PPDNOS and called it a day essentially. I was specifically with other kids diagnosed on the spectrum, so tbqh it wasn't nearly as locked down, but they did jack in terms of ,""rehabilitation"". They had a *forced* Sunday school, as it was a christian group, and I would meet with someone once a week. I literally got told the same stuff I had at short term facilities - Count to 10. Breath through your nose. That was all I remember out of it. I didn't have any outbursts though, to be fair, which was likely 1. You'd get restrained immediately, and I was when I got there. I was literally unable to breath and almost passed out. And 2. I kinda though this was my life if I was like this. If I kept acting out, I wouldn't be able to be with my family. Etc. 

Since then, I've graduated high school. I'm emotionally and socially stunted and fucked, as I have never made a true ""friend"" (the closest coming during my long term stay) and I was in a separate class for the ""trouble kids"" my entire school life, never socializing or anything. 

But that doesn't mean it's all good. I sti struggle with other stuff, mostly around anxiety. It's... Manageable at least. For a while I thought my anger problems/outbursts  were just anxiety manifesting differently. And now it's just purely anxiety. but it's definitely not just that.

Almost two years ago, 17, I went back to a short term place. I was in a shit mood from SOMEthing, punched a hole in the wall, and just.. wanted to break something. It was always premeditated, and still was. There's time in my mind I could cop out. But I don't. There's time between anger and breaking the wall. I know I shouldn't. I know the repercussions. But I still do it.

(Backstory over)

Now 19, I've still done it twice. Once I kicked the shit out of my wall, *which had already been repainted from before*, for again some reason I don't remember. Now, I destroyed a TV I just fucking brought by punching it. I got way worked up over being shit at a game I've been trying to get good at. Again, both times they were somewhat premeditated. I knew what i was doing. But the second I did, the anger starts to fade. But especially in the moment, there is absolutely nothing I can do to get that anger out another way. 

When I'm less worked up, I just want to get it out. Maybe a less destructive way, but still. It's not always an option to go for a run or exercise to help, but sometimes I have that option. 

There's meds for anxiety. That can be worked on, it keeps me from having a regular job but again, some work and meds and it can be fixed. But what the fuck is there for anger? I have the opposite personality type as how I feel when I get mad I feel. Like i'm very quiet, passive, anxious but like calm otherwise. 

I really want to try dating, I have for years since I accepted I'm gay. But I completely fear a relationship as I don't want to get mad at them. I don't at all want to even risk my anger coming out around them. Not only would I obviously be embarrassed but I wouldn't want to hurt them at all. But I know I just repaired and repainted that wall. I know I just spent money on that TV just a week ago. I know the costs of those things. I definitely don't get as worked up as when I was 10/11, where I would actually attack even my mom or dad. But what if I did. Around someone I love. 

Like what the fuck is there for anger issues? I went through so many different programs and therapists, literally until I was 18, and never got more than ""yo just calm down when you're angry"". There's no medication to even try to see if it helps. My anxiety and anger problems have been getting worse - the last two incidents I mentioned were the past month or so, the last short term stay was the last time I got that mad, which was two years ago. And that was pretty much the only other time since my long term stay in 2012 ish.

I am way more angry and impatient than even a year ago. I feel like there's just this festering ball of hatred, even just at myself and the fact that I AM mad. And anxious. Etc. But it feels like there's absolutely fucking nothing I can do. I can't even afford therapy, which would be online anyways and wouldn't do much because of that. 

Ughhh"

1333,"Healing from PTSD is, to my dismay, going to take a long time. And I loathe it.","I won't say specifically what happend. It wasn't sexual, and it wasn't military. I hit a bad point in my early twenties, bad events resulted...and only at 29, start of 2020, did I return to my adolescent home with family.

Before this, I was a wreck. Bi polar, anxeity, social anxeity, depression. But I got by. Just a happy, yet flawed severely young adult. Very naievé to the world.

It broke me. I'm on top doses for my anti-anxeity meds. And they BARELY work. Panic attacks, flash backs are common. Fluctuating moods every few seconds. Extreme disasociative issues. I can barely function some days.

In a year, I've healed decently. I'm happy about this. Started learning screen printing, on the path to my own business. Helped my aunt, who's older, around the house. Keep her company. Got on meds, got a psyche. Started rebuilding me life.

But, I'm severely damaged. I could NOT hold the simplest of jobs. My anxiety states are too unpredictable. And too severe .

My only option is to make the buisness work. But anyway, I had 5 years of daily hell. I'm honestly scared, of just how long it will take for me to ""feel"" again. To not exist in perpetual numb emotions, anxeity, and inhibiting depersonalization.

1335,"[TW] Well, Christmas is gonna suck...","More of a ""Need Support"" post, but I feel ashamed to ask? idk.

I hate holidays. My alcoholic step-dad is/will be off work. Mom's never home anymore. I get to deal with hearing him slam shit, speak to himself in some kind of incomprehensible rage, blast the radio and phone at the same time max volume, and that's when he's ***not drunk***. Yeah.

I grew up with this asshole, and I'm now diagnosed with schizo-whatever-doesn't-make-sense-diagnosis, because I developed extreme, and I actually mean it when I say extreme, anxiety (due to a sudden, powerful depressive mental state) when I was 16. My thoughts went off like a machine-gun 24/7 at that time, and I couldn't sleep. My ex left me, and she was the only person I had. Suddenly, I also had muscle tension, and ever since I learned to relax it has been showing the damages.

I'm just sad and miserable. 25 years old, didn't finish school, tried multiple times to do ***anything*** in my life. Poker is probably the thing I'm best at, and I hate it. Not even actual poker. Poker inside video games like RuneScape sites and Puzzle Pirates. I sell the in-game money, but I've kind of given up on that. It makes me exhausted. Anything I do makes me exhausted. And I can't rest for whatever reason. One reason is my step-dad and living environment, but then I also feel like I want or need something, and it's not there for me. I want to be told that things will be okay, that I can breathe, relax, and I don't have to feel guilty for taking the things I need to heal. But all I have is the guilt, these people, this environment, and nothing else. I get food, rarely warm, never actually healthy.

And I guess I can say that I hate my parents. I hate them. Both of them. My step-dad for being a raging moron, and my mom for sticking with this idiot, for her obvious complacency. The hate I feel has at times been strong enough for me to contemplate ***some pretty bad things***. Suicide would be the second of the horrible actions I'd take.

Life is meaningless. Just some kind of torture.

I wake up at 22:00 to 00:00 at night. Stay up until about 15:00-17:00 and hope he doesn't come home before I fall asleep. Else, I use headphones to pretend no-one exists.

Psych units are horrible. Psychiatrists lie and push pills. Psychologists are smart-asses, as I doubt they ever know what's wrong with anyone they treat.

I keep having this wish to be stuck in a bed of some kind of bright, loving-feeling room. People come to visit me, and they're patient and loving towards me. They bring me food. They make me feel safe. Calm. I don't have to think much. They remind me that everything will be fine. And now it gets hard for me to explain, because this is what I'm missing. I guess the continuation of this thought is what I can't find anymore. What's the illness they'd be treating? And how will the world look like when I've healed? And why should I care?

Probs a bit of a derailed rant at this point. But, regarding people with fake intentions, I had a person on a ""mental health app"" (Vent) tell me they'd miss me on a post... then I never saw them again. Stay fake, I guess."

1339,"Despairing, aggrieved over dispute with prof. Extreme emotions and distress tolerance is low.","Long story short, because I need to get my ass to bed before I start hyperventilating again:

My tutor for a course is an absolute asshole, and he does not like me ever since I completely forgot to call him “doctor” in an email. His reviews all say he’s a grad-level, sometimes just downright incorrect marker for undergrad classes. On my first assignment, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and he graded me poorly, but I really did fuck up a lot, and his feedback was helpful for my next assignment. 

Then I emailed him to ask for clarification and accidentally didn’t call him doctor. This is a distance learning university, and I haven’t actually been well enough emotionally to be present in school since I was a preteen. I am, however, highly intelligent. Part of the problem for many of us- ha. Anyways, he didn’t like any of it.

He said there is a 5-day turnaround time, indicated in tons of communication and notices from this course. Well, for the second assignment, I absolutely crushed it. I studied up every single part of that paper and went over all my feedback to make damn sure I didn’t mess up. I submitted it 13 days ago, and I didn’t want to piss him off so I didn’t ask. Well, I emailed him about it this evening.

Later, same night, I get my mark. It’s a 53. I was fucking shocked. Absolutely stunned. At *least*, I thought, I would get a 75. 

Did I expect a 90? Nah. But I certainly expected to do way, way better than my first assignment, which was a mess. I got a 64 on my first. 

Failure is a huge trigger for me. Especially since I’ve been in recovery, I’ve been so scared to try new things and take on new responsibilities/challenges. Because when I feel rejected or someone scrutinizes me, I’m a mess. An absolute mess. 

I’m terrified that this tutor might fail me for this course despite getting only 80s and 90s on quizzes, trying as hard and as diligently as I can on the assignments. 

I’m terrified that I’ll fall apart. 

I feel so hurt and full of despair. Why does he hate me? Why is he treating me this way? Why did I email him and tell him a little bit about my past with not being well for school, thinking he might understand where I’m coming from, because I feel like I’m bothering him? I’m paying for this. I’m paying to go to this university. He’s supposed to help me.

I need to stop obsessing over this. It’s 2:30 AM and I need rest. I need to stop torturing myself. 

I’ll come back to it and look at the feedback tomorrow. Hey, maybe he’s right. Maybe I made a critical error. But I doubt it very much. 

I feel really silly for posting this, but it did help me think through some of the more “irrational” feelings.

1342,Thinking about depictions in media (CW Suicidal Ideation),"I remember watching several versions of Hamlet’s big monologue in my English class. One version showed Hamlet screaming and acting visibly distraught while talking about taking his own life, the other one showed him calmly weighing his options and discussing suicide in an almost detached way. All of my classmates thought that the first one was a better and more believable depiction, but I was shocked by the second one because it was so honest.

In the movie “Cyberbully” the main character tries to kill herself and is shown sobbing and completely hysterical as she tries to open a bottle of pills. This always felt overblown to me. In the movie “Elizabethtown” the main character plans his suicide and has everything in place, gets interrupted, and has to leave his apartment. Throughout the whole movie he keeps telling himself that nothing will distract from his suicide plan and that he will lull himself as soon as he is done dealing with a family emergency. 

Too often, I think media depicts suicidal ideation as something that is dramatic and visual. Instead, my experience has been a more quiet contemplation and detached consideration of the possibilities."

She once even made a pretty distasteful joke about someone who was attempting a suicide. Sometimes it really affects me because I struggle with mental health issues myself and the way she talks about it, makes me feel guilty for my issues and makes it seem like it's so easy to fight mental illnesses which make me feel very pathetic about myself.

1344,Bipolar Saga (Well actually Cyclothiamia) - Seeking the Right Meds.,"Well, I was not happy with my medication. I have been on Lithium for at least 5-years and still struggling with insomnia. An indication that maybe, just maybe I should not be killing my kidneys slowly and try something different. I was given Thorazine which gave me severe constipation especially because Lithium tends to do that alone. So being the end of the sucky 2020 I suggested of changing meds for 2021. Should not the pdoc have suggested it? Anyway, after my suggestion the pdoc I am with for almost a year now, says; **""great plan, in 10-20 years (I am 64) you'd be thanking me for saving you from dialysis!""** then he proceeds to tell me how dangerous Lithium is for the elderly kidneys. Indeed I heard a 37-year-old woman having a 60-year old's kidney because of Lithium.  
My pdoc said it like it was his idea! It should have been! But I am most angry at my Chiese pdoc for 4+ years who also KNEW that I cannot sleep and let me take lithium! Then my pdoc says ""well, for Depakote we have to monitor your liver but this is not nearly as bad as Lithium for the kidneys."""
1345,Work is mentally draining me,"I am an 18 y/o girl who decided to get a job a few months ago to spend time on and earn some money to prepare for the upcoming school year. I have never really complained much about work before, until recently. 

You see, I work 9 hour shifts 3 times a week. Didn’t seem like much at first and thought it would be doable. After 3 months of working, my mental health has been going down. I basically spend 10 hours (including travel time) away from home per day. It’s all physical work as well which tires me after a while. I don’t have any time for my family, friends or my hobby’s like art and videogames. Once I get home, I eat, shower then sleep. On the days off I’m usually still too tired, especially due to physical pain, so I don’t have the energy to do much other then try to relax.

Note that art is actually more than just a hobby to me. I study it during my free time, do commissions and practice a lot since I ultimately want it to be my main job. With my current job in the way, I am physically and mentally tired which affects my art a lot. My inspiration and motivation are fading, almost gone. I sleep my days away or watch video’s to keep me somewhat happy. But not being able to do the things I love most really hurts.

It’s hard for me to talk about this to my managers. It’s a very personal matter and I don’t want to show my fragility or be a burden by asking for less hours. Even thought I don’t necessarily like my job, I still show my best side, work the hardest. I’m too scared to be useless.

Now I’m questioning a lot of things. Am I exaggerating? Do I deserve to complain? Should I quit? 

I need someone to talk to who has some experience on this topic and know what their solution is.

Thanks for reading, have a wonderful day 💜"
1346,Best friend betrayed me,"I used to hang out with my best friend all of the time. We were inseparable, Practically brothers.

Although 6 months ago my sister told me that my best friend that I've known for 14 years  was trying to hook up with her. Nothing happened between them, although I've talked to my best friend about bro code and that my sister was off limits. 

When my sister told me what was going on, I was definitely upset. But she told me to not let what she told me get in the way if my friendship. And I didn't for a month and a half. I just pretended that nothing happened.

During that time we would hang out like once a week when time allowed. And I could tell he felt guilty about what he did.

I ended up cutting ties with him and we haven't talked in over a month yet alone hung out. Last time I hung out with him was over 2 months ago.

Recently, I have been struggling with loneliness, depression, social anxiety, self harm, and suacideal thoughts. Not all of it is from this situation although alot of it is in some way tied to it. 

I don't know if I could ever forgive him for what he did. I hate blaming my mental health issues on other people, but I know that he has played a key part. I feel betrayed and it is hard for me to trust anyone, yet alone make new friends.

I have no social life anymore. I don't leave the house when I don't have to. And it's been getting harder and harder to work at my job. I find myself zoning out and working alot slower than I am normally able to. People keep saying things will get better. But it really doesn't seem like they will. 

This doesn't include everything thats been going on. But it's one of the things that has been bothering me the most currently.

TLDR: Best friend that I've known for 14 years tried f-ing my sister. And I feel betrayed."
1347,How is it to have a psychopathic father? My experience.,"Of course he doesn't run with a knife and do crazy things. In psychology they call it a personality disorder charactarized by: Charm, need for stimulation, lying, shallow emotions, lack of remorse etc. He doesn't seem to have feelings and he was doing very bad things in the past, like regular cheating, manipulation, emotionally hurting people without any distress etc. (other worse things, but I won't say it). How would he act around you meeting you for the first time? Very charming. You would feel very nice around him, you would feel heard, even admired in some way. A lot of joking. He is a very good talker without any shame or anxiety whatsoever. One goal, to be the best person for someone.

He acts like that randomly around people and may be very well liked by strangers, so where is the problem? Getting to know him more, he would start trying to exploit you in some way.  Seeing that you may be empathetic, he can start saying how bad he feels about some things and may ask you to do little favours at first, but before that he may even do favours for you to be more likeable. It's kinda like investing in the future. After some time you will realize that you keep doing many things for him, but you would be cofused, because he is allegedly so nice and good. It's quite difficult to resist to the charm and you will question a lot of the things. That's how the manipulation works. On the one hand you feel like he is very nice, but on the other hand you feel exploited in some way. I could say more about it, but in summary, he will keep exploiting you being very nice at the same time.

Other physical signs of someone like that? Stare, he doesn't blink and keeps staring at people more than other people. It's kinda like an empty stare. He may do it to be a bit more dominant from the beginning. If you are not good and obedient to him, you would see a different person without any charm. He will leave you or start being very mean, throwing some tantrums."
1348,Its been a tough year.,"Broke up with GF of 7 years.

Shortly after that cut off by a close friend who was secretly in love with me.

Just got rejected by a girl after I put myself out there.

Works been fucking chaos.

Had an asthma attack at the gym this morning.

I've been feeling really anxious and am struggling to stay positive. 

I need to put myself out there but im finding it hard."
1349,What I've done to help myself.,"It isn't much but it's helped a lot. A friend of mine taught me a method that their therapist told them to try which helps one understand themselves more or something. I'm not sure on the specifics anymore but it makes things better somehow. So I was curious what others think of the method and idk...what people can gleam from my personal results.   


Basically if you have some artistic ability you can try to personify the feelings or emotions or thoughts in your head. Give them a face, a look, so that you can better understand how you feel based off how you envision them. So far I've only done the negative emotions/feelings/thoughts but I'm planning on doing the more positive ones later. Heres the first three, each has their own tidbit of information concerning how it feels to be in it's presence and what it would say to me.  


In the link below are the 3 images I've drawn as well as their respective descriptors and dialogue. Idk what each could mean in the long run but it was nice getting to personify each one even if they aren't positive aspects of my life. They are what make me me and I wouldn't want to be anyone else even if sometimes it does make life hard.

My friend moved abroad for study last year and it all went well until covid, she has been avoiding meeting people ever since March, but the city she lives is still on lock down, there is no flight back home either so she's strained there. 

We talk vet often but she has been increasingly depressed, I try to be there for her but it's hard when she's 10,000km away, last night she said something that truly worries me, it seems like she's having suicidal thoughts. She doesn't really have friends there either, I'm not sure what I can do?

1353,I feel like I'm being watched,"I feel like I'm losing my mind honestly .
I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a really long time and I was diagnosed with BPD and more fun things like being a daughter to narcissistic mother
these past 3 months, things happened that caused me great stress but for the past month it took a very dark turn .. 

I'm unable to fall asleep easily, then I'll wake up around 3 or 4 am with this wave of paranoia that I am being watched or stalked, and that is usually accompanies by the same nightmares (or really bad nightmares where I feel very distressed, during the dream usually everyone is mad and yelling at me and I'm equally as bad trying to defend myself) 

and after I wake up I stay up. I jump at every sound, a car cannot drive by without me getting startled, a leaf just moved on the branch and I thought someone was there looking at me. 
a truck drove by and I never been that startled

1354,Applied to graduate schools today and now I can't stop checking my phone and feeling moderate to severe physical anxiety symptoms. Any ideas to reduce this?,"I have diagnosed general anxiety on top of this normally stressful situation but I stopped seeing my therapist for unrelated reasons and don't have any appointments with her. I realize I'm being super irrational about this. No admissions committee is going to get back to me on a Sunday evening about five hours after submission and my recommenders won't submit anything either till Monday morning at the earliest. There's no reason to literally check my email every 20 minutes or less but I feel like I can't help it. I'm also intermittently physically shaking, nauseous, on the verge of tears constantly, dizzy, have that fight or flight cold chill feeling every now and then, etc. 

Talking about it/writing this out helps a little bit but it's still really difficult to deal with. I live in a place with legal recreational marijuana and I qualify to use it legally since I'm over the minimum age so I might have some to calm me down right now but it doesn't solve the problem when I need to be 100% sober. I don't get any negative symptoms from it that some get thankfully and it's really beneficial to me as a substitute for xanax. It just sucks relying on something to keep me from losing it at all. 

Any advice/suggestions/encouragement/support is more than welcome."

1357,am i depressed?,normally i am on facetime with my friends for at least 6 hours everyday and i love it. this past week i haven’t wanted to talk to them or pretty much anyone. i feel like my mouth is glued shut. i can’t talk to them it just doesn’t feel fun. i feel like sitting alone in my room all day. nothing changed and nothing happened to me this feeling was very abrupt. i feel sad because i want to talk to them but i just can’t. i can tell they notice and i feel like they are starting to think i’m being rude or ignoring them because they are annoying me which isn’t the case at all. i try to call them and i end up leaving the call after painfully sitting their making a few comments after half an hour of them talking. i thought this would blow over in a day or so but i still feel like this. i’m so much happier sitting alone than i am talking to people. i don’t understand. what is this?
1358,Frustrating family issue.,"My dad  was trying to push on Facebook a narrative that there’s no evidence that restaurants are high risk for the Covid-19 virus (my state is shutting things down again) and was mad at me for commenting on his post proving him wrong. I wasn’t upset that he is against the shut down but rather him giving incorrect information as this is dangerous and running rampant online.  He went to Florida multiple times this year including when Florida was the epicenter of the virus and go to bars and restaurants all the time. He and my  are both high risk people. They ended up getting the virus but luckily survived.

He then tried to equate me being the single only customer in a gallery while wearing a mask the same as people going and eating and drinking I’m a restaurant. It was the only place I’ve gone besides work in months and I was the only customer in the building.

We’ve never had the best relationship but this is pushing me over the edge. He cares more about his favorite pub being open for wing night than people’s lives. He’s never respected my opinion or treated me like an adult and it’s caused a huge rift between us. I also am admittedly over reactive to things he says and does because of our past. 

I’m just very stressed and heartbroken over it."

1360,Podcast on Mental Health,"Hello, the Positivity and Success podcast has an episode on mental health today with Mitch Prinstein professor of clinical psychology at the University of North Carolina.

[https://positivityandsuccess.com/episodes/mental-health-mitch-prinstein](https://positivityandsuccess.com/episodes/mental-health-mitch-prinstein)"
1361,Identity issues,"These past months I have been dealing with thoughts regarding self-expression, who I really am and who I want to become.  

Since I was young, I was a very shy child with new people , but I did not have problems with my family and some very close acquantainces. This continued until mid high-school when I started becoming a little more outgoing and it improved more at the beginning of university, more specifically last year. 

As I said earlier, I have begun questioning my real personality and what's the direction I can follow in order to develop myself. I feel like riding a emotional roller-coaster; basically my personalities differ from one day to another, and sometimes I even feel like this during a single day.  One day I feel really assertive, wanting to engage in arguments and I feel pleased when I do that, but later I regret being so outspoken, because I might have hurt a person's feeling.  One time I feel like I do not belong in this world and  I am a big misfit, wanting to give up my pleasing, kind, comforting (?) personality and  dress in goth clothes and get tattoes and become more rebel, but after that I realise that I am not this kind of person.  However, I feel like I am fond of  and would enjoy having a more like ,, I am an outsider, you will never understand me'' identity. The truth is, I feel as I have both personalities in myself. Actually, I even doubt these changes of personality because they kinda occur only in the conversations I keep having in my mind with people whom I am not close to.  But at the same time, I realize that I modify my identity when I come into contact with my family.

 I enjoy really conventionally-considered weird things, alt culture, I swear quite a lot when I am by myself, but at the same time , society has always considered me a compassionate, kind, altruistic, naive, innocent person. These expectations led me not to become more outspoken, due to the fact that I feared that I might do or say something that doesn't meet others' expectations. 

I have really strong values, for which I would like to stand up, but doing that can harm people around me.  Even though I have solid values, I cannot say that about my opinions or views. I feel like I have possessed these values since birth, however my perspectives keep changing depending on what identity I own at that moment. 

I began taking 5HTP about two weeks ago, which helped me. Before taking it, I couldn't focus on anything, I was passive-agressive, extremely reclusive and the only thing I did was to listen to rap, rock, heavy metal all day long and questioning if I developed some kind of mental illness. I also feel like the music I listen can differ much depending on how I feel. If at some moment, I listen to something more aggressive, later I can  listen to something totally on the other side of the spectrum. 

The thing I want to find out is who I actually am and how I behave when I am healthy. I have considered many versions of my ,,healthy'' personality, but I cannot decide which one the true me is. 

I tremendously wanna be more assertive, express myself more in communications and maybe through clothes, or other indirect way of doing that, but at the same time I want to meet others' expectations of innocent me.  When I feel more on the latter side, I really struggle to express my opinions, both in speaking and writing. Even now, I found it hard to start writing this, but at the same time I think that writing can be healing. 

I apologize for the extremely confusing, nonsensical venting, but I am bad at putting my emotions into words."
1362,Some questions about helping my mom...,"Hi folks.  Sorry for the wall of text below.  It's my first time dealing with a loved one who seems to be having some problems and I would like some advice or even just some pointers about what keywords to search online to find more relevant info.

A summary of the situation: My mom (mid 60s) in the past several years seems to be becoming more and more agitated with what she perceives as other people (neighbors, family members) as scheming against her or thinking ill of her.  I just spent two weeks with her at her house and it seemed as though the topics of conversation with her were usually very negative and centered around the previously mentioned perceptions.  For example, she is accusing my brother and his wife of basically scheming against her on a regular basis which is definitely not based in reality.  When my brother tries to explain the situation logically, she doesn't believe him (or something) and the baseless altercations continue.  I suppose the particulars are not important but what is important is that it's all becoming more frequent.

In addition, she seems unable to think critically about what she reads on the internet.  I know many people have family members who get sucked into all of the online conspiracy theories - so perhaps it's just an unrelated issue.  But I hear her on the phone to other family members talking about all the really unfounded nonsense in the Qanon thing.  I've tried a few times to explain to her about responsible consumption of info from the internet but it's in one ear and out the other.

Lastly, she's had trouble hearing for several years.  It's not to the point that you have to shout at her, but if you're just speaking normally, she may misunderstand what you said or just not hear you at all if you're in another room.  Her grandkids definitely don't speak loudly enough and she just misses so much of what they say.  She refuses to get hearing aids because she thinks that alternative medicine can help and she often says that she doesn't trust doctors. We've even taken her to an audiologist for testing and aids and she never followed through on getting them. I've read that prolonged hearing loss can increase risk of dementia later in life too, so that's a concern.

My questions are:

Do you think some or all of these things are related?

My brother and I plan to have a family conversation with her and dad about all of these things at some point.  An intervention, I suppose.  We thought of suggesting she see a therapist but we know this will be taken as a personal attack and she'll think we're saying she's insane.  My brother hinted at it once already and it didn't go well.  My brother and I know we're not educated enough about mental health to confidently encourage her to do XYZ.  Not sure how to proceed here.  Thoughts or suggestions?

Thank you."
1363,I told my dad I don't want to be alive and he called me manipulative,"I have a lot of issues with my dad. He is my only parent and I'm an only child. He has done a lot of hurtful things that have messed up my life. I have depression and over the years I have tried to get my dad to realise how bad it is and told him that when I am my dark place I just feel like there is no hope in living and I want to die. I don't think I would ever do it but even feeling that way is awful. I don't know what to do. 
He says it's my problem and i need to sort it out and he can't do anything and me telling him is manipulative and I'm trying to pressure him (not sure what into) and upset him. 
In just want to be okay. There was a point in my life where I knew I was going to die one day by killing myself. I don't feel that way anymore but last week I felt that despair again for the first time in a year and I told my dad and that's what he told me. 
I have tried to get help but I just had a mix of bad therapists who either felt sorry for me but didn't tell me how to deal with it.. Or just told me to talk to my dad and resolve the issues, which I told them over and over I can't do because he doesn't listen... Then they told me to write him a letter but don't send it... Which does nothing but bring up bad memories and makes me angry and hurt at my dad and does nothing

1369,finally off anti-depressants!,"earlier this year in March, i was ecstatic to secure my first ever job. i accepted it on the spot and signed the contract without really asking any questions. 

a mere three months later i am a mess. every single day i work an extra hour (and with no extra pay) for the sake of ‘helping out’. i am constantly providing feedback which are met with silence. during my break hours i barely have enough time to finish my bowl of food. my colleagues are giving me their tasks (although, i expected so as i am a newbie after all).

then, i heard news of my grandfather having cancer.
a few days before my birthday, a close friend of mine passed away. a couple days after my birthday, my boyfriend and i broke up.

i stopped going to the gym, kept on hurting myself with rubber bands, and did not give a single care about myself whatsoever. i ended up writing a will and came extremely close to finally doing it. it was scary; i was smiling at the thought of finally saying goodbye. 

until one day, my father brought me to the clinic to have me seek professional help (he was worried about the fact that i began crying every morning before i clocked into work).  

i took my anti depressants and felt better. but i realised much more needed to change. i deserved to be treated better, i thought and i decided to resign.

it was slightly difficult as my colleagues kept asking me to stay for a week longer, and say the same thing again once the week ended. i was truly burnt out and needed a break so for once, i stood my ground and said no.

fortunately for me, i was able to secure a new job just a week later! additionally, i had less responsibilities yet at the same salary level as my first job. the first few weeks were tough as i still had fears and heavy emotions. luckily my new colleagues were warm and inviting. the medicine has also kept my mood stable thus far. one to two months after, I’m (mostly) back to normal. I’m still working through my emotions about the break up but at least now i actually feel productive. I’m actually having the energy to do things, going out with friends again and seeing a difficult day at work as a learning opportunity. 

Sometimes it still surprises me how i ever did survive that rough patch in life. So to anyone reading this who’s at rock bottom, please hang on for awhile. let’s go through life together. If you can go through that rough patch, you’re damn near invincible. I love you all, and stay safe!"
1370,please help me,"one of my best friends is very open about her insecurities and mental health and it makes me so uncomfortable. i feel bad for her and try to console her and talk her out of it and listen but i am so painfully awkward at it that im afraid im making it worse.

every time she talks about her insecurities and problems, not only do i feel awkward and uncomfortable with it (because it’s usually out of the blue, like we are walking and laughing and she will suddenly talk about how &gt;!she’s afraid of getting an eating disorder!&lt; or she feels as if &gt;!no one will miss her if she dies!&lt;), but i also feel an annoyance in my head screaming that shes faking it and misdiagnosing herself. obviously my right mind recognizes that she is obviously suffering, but i still can't stop myself from thinking those thoughts, even if i feel immensely guilty immediately after thinking them.

mental health has always been a taboo subject in my country and my family, and that environment probably left me with the “grin and bear with it” mindset. perhaps thats why its so hard for me to sympathize and console her. im not the most mentally healthy myself, and i know that i should probably seek help for my.... issues, but my parents won't see it as important enough. my only coping method so far has been to throw things, scream, and bottle all my other emotions in. its somewhat alien for me to have someone with mental issues pour all their thoughts and fears onto me. 

obviously i want to help her, but i dont know how to offer advice to someone when the only thing i have done is bottle in my feelings. im even bottling in my advice and empathy for her becuase im too anxious to tell her that everything will be ok and every time she tells me that she feels worthless and unable to function and fat the only thing i am able to do is nod and murmur ""no""s. 

(somewhat rant) &gt;!its useless im such a horrible friend the only time ive ever told her that she should feel better and that shes better than she thinks she is when i snapped at her and told her to shut the fuck up and that she wont make people feel like shit and it came out so angry so agressive and i made her cry even i was so guilty i tried to apologize but i just couldnt the words were stuck in my mouth!&lt;

how can i overcome my anxiousness of consoling her and telling her that shes better than she thinks she is? i want to make her feel better about herself but im too anxious and angry to do so. i sound really selfish but i am, i guess"

1373,Do we all have a slight case of mental illness?,"Lately I’ve been super interested in the topic of schizophrenia. I’ve experienced with some psychedelics and I’ve heard someone taking something for the first time can induce schizophrenia if the conditions are right. 

This is utterly confusing to me. Seems like we would all already have a slight case of schizophrenia then, even without taking drugs you can come across the right conditions in a busy city and get it.

So ... that leads me to think about depression, anxiety, etc. I have talked about this on another forum before, and I feel like when we place these titles on people as “mentally ill” they could be so much more. Could some of these people diagnosed as “mentally ill” function better in a workplace or environment designed for them then someone who isn’t? For example I have anxiety, and I try to use the time I overthink on learning how to code."
1374,What is Important in life Money or Happiness ?,"What is Important in life Money or Happiness ?

Recent research suggests that if you focus too much on trying to feel good all the time, you’ll actually undermine your ability to feel good at all—in other words, no amount of feeling good will be satisfying to you, since what you expect (all the time) isn’t physically possible for most people.

When people have the most basic material life, happiness is more important than money for them. If they want to earn more money, and they will lose many things, like family companionship, the companionship of friends and the companionship of children, which influence them to have a happy life.

We have covered this topic in our recent Youtube Video because we believe everyone deserves to be happy and to know the real meaning of Happiness.

1375,The Canadian Mental Health System is an Utter Disgrace (Long Post),"We've barely progressed past the early twentieth century in terms of mental health care (and this is especially true of the public system). Most people do not have access to treatment and are frequently dismissed or misdiagnosed by these so-called ""professionals."" Why is this even an issue in a rich country like Canada?

My mother attempted suicide just before Christmas last year and was rushed to the hospital with toxic-induced stroke after ingesting God knows how many of her prescription meds. They treated her for the physiological damage with rehabilitation therapists and promptly released her barely a week later as though her stroke had occurred naturally - they barely acknowledge the mental health aspect! Instead, they offered to give her medication via injection (which of course she declined) and expected my father and I to essentially assume the role of nurses as though we were trained medical professionals. I've been dealing with her psychosis since adolescence and my pleas to doctors, police officers, and other professionals were ignored (what does a stupid child know anyway?) and my dad still continues to remain silent about her condition - even with her life at stake. What the hell kind of healthcare is this? 

I also struggle with mental health issues (mostly due to my previously dysfunctional and abusive family life). For years I struggled with depression and anxiety, and was only diagnosed in my thirties with ADHD, a condition which has wreaked havoc on my life causing permanent damage to my self-esteem, confidence, employability, academic life, and relationships. Apparently ADHD was not taken seriously in girls a few years and only nowadays is being thoroughly investigated by family doctors in adult women (after the damage is done, of course). 

The cherry on the cake dropped a few years ago when my parents followed me around the house one night demanding I surrender my phone to the police because they believed I was in cahoots with ""dangerous people."" My mother had forced me to take her to the local police station and also called CSIS claiming she had premonitions of a terrorist attack (the police didn't even bother asking if I was ok). They then called the police on me one night when I was coming home from a martial arts class and told them I was something along the lines of a serial killer or terrorist, and that I was out to kill my mother along with a few other people. The older police officer on scene was extremely condescending - essentially treating me like a stupid child - and told me to listen to my parents (I was in my twenties when this happened by the way...not patriarchal at all...). None of these accusations seemed to them like someone with a severe mental illness having an episode right either which also astonished and enraged me. I promptly left that night and did not speak to my parents for almost a year (and it should have been longer).

I now have a decent-paying job in Alberta and enjoying a loving relationship, but I can't forget the trauma shackled to my ankles, every time I take another step forward it rattles behind me, a constant reminder of the aftermath. I sought out a private counsellor in Edmonton who was absolutely excellent, however the pandemic hit and we had to cut down on expenses. I suffered a bout of suicidal ideation during lockdown (the area I'm from is also notorious for suicides - seven in one year, in fact), and my partner recommended the services in town - though I am not quite skeptical of the public system. Should have stuck my guns! After having transferred my files to this counsellor and pleading for help she said ""oh you seem fine, you don't have to see me again"" after only a single session - I was clearly not taken seriously. I was even more annoyed when she asked me about my appetite and use of birth control...I saw the biggest grin on her face when she came to her own conclusion that I was pregnant. In fact, I actually thought she was going to say something along the lines of ""omg congratulations!"" If I really had been pregnant and that was not something I necessarily wanted, her reaction would have been extremely inappropriate (especially to a such a potentially stress-inducing situation).

My best friend (paramedic) has also warned me against calling the suicide hotline as she's witnessed multiple patients traumatized by the ""care"" they received at the hospital (i.e. tied up and sedated like rabid dogs before being promptly churned out to the streets). She would rather I call her and wake her up in the middle of the night if I'm having a crisis than learn I've been subject to this 1800s-style torture.

I don't know what is wrong with our mental health system but it needs to pull its socks up...right now. Canadians are suffering and dying from lack of proper, adequate services and the government doesn't seem to care. The quality of care currently offered at the public level is so egregious it's actually better never to go than to seek out help and suffer the harmful consequences of dismissal, misdiagnosis, and maltreatment. If you have financial resources to allocate to a good counsellor in the private sector then please choose this option - it's completely worth it."
1376,"Mind pops, help!"," Hi! I was just wondering if anyone here experiences random mind pops? Sometimes I'd remember something so random, like a memory or a dream, usually, it's vague. But lately, I've been having a hard time with random images popping into my head, it usually comes at random, especially when I'm tired, I now literally hate closing my eyes thinking I'll see random mental imagery, it's not gory or anything but it just bothers me like I think I'm just nuts. For example, it throws me off sometimes when I'm talking, a random image would pop up, it doesn't cause me to stop talking or disrupt me in any way. It's pretty manageable but who wants to talk, especially about something serious, then all of a sudden a random image pops up. That's just weird and annoying. I don't know if it's always been here and normal and anxiety is just making me more aware of it, or it's an indication of something else. When I looked it up, of course, the first thing that would pop up is a Schizophrenia forum \*rolls eyes\* and I who's a hypochondriac starts to think things again, sigh. Is this normal? Am I just constantly labelling everything as weird?"
1377,I think my husband has more than just depression,"My (32f)  husband (38m)  have been together for 10 years and have 2 small children our daughter (5) and our son (8m) I've known for years that my husband has depression as a result of longterm abuse as a child and he's been on medication for it.  However,  as the years have passed and especially since everything in 2020, I've noticed a trend of whenever winter comes round or something particularly stressful is happening and my husband sinks into an extreme low he will start seeing anger and abuse in literally everything and it even alters his recollection of events into something warped from reality.  For example,  this past week my husband started accusing me of constantly being angry and no matter how many times I said I wasn't or tried to prove otherwise I wasn't believed.  This all culminated in an incident in which our whole family was lying in bed together.  I was nursing our son,  our daughter was beside me and my husband was lying across the foot of the bed talking to our daughter and telling stories.  During these short tales he started telling our daughter that I was angry with him and again I said numerous times that I wasn't angry and had no reason to be angry.  The baby started to fuss so I rolled over to switch breasts and accidentally kicked my husband in the face in the process.  I apologized but he simply said ""you did it on purpose because you're angry. "" I again expressed that it was an accident done while I was trying to swap sides to feed our son but he continued to insist it was on purpose.  It has resulted in my husband beginning to call me abusive.  When we each told our side to an unrelated third party seperate from one another the third party even said it felt to them like my husband was telling a story because there were things that didn't make sense.  He had said we were arguing previously but couldn't say what about.  He said I was always angry but when pressed on why he couldn't give an answer either and when asked where the children were the only one he could say where they were was our daughter.  He couldn't remember if I was in fact nursing our son or if he was in his crib. Is there a mental disorder that can do this?  Alter my husband's perception of reality?  PTSD triggered by my accidental kick?  Bi-polar though I've never in 10 years seen my husband with an extreme high only very deep lows?  Major depression?  Please,  anything that I could ask our counselor or his doctor about."
1378,How do I not be so emotional and sensitive?,"I have a close friend whom I love to death and who cares for me as well. He is very sarcastic . I know he cares and his sarcasm is literally apart of his personality so I feel like because I know this as fact I should accept it. Yesterday, he did something which he always does. I asked what he was doing and he replied something sarcastic that he obviously wasnt doing. Then he said he was trying to do it but he couldnt do it in peace since he was on a call with me. I felt bad because I didnt want to be a bother and I told him I would go and he said cool. So I left. I felt awful afterwards. He msged me and said to join back the call but I told him I didn't like how he treated me but this isnt the first time he has said something like that. This is just the first time I was overly sensitive about it. I should have known he was joking but when people say mean things that undermine my worth I shut out and distance myself I don't make time to analyze the situation to know if they mean it. Instead I get that same feeling I got when my narcissistic sister would be mean or my terrible friends in the past would have made me feel so I distance myself. So when I told him i didnt like it. He immediately apologised but I just felt worse because i know that is his personality and I feel like I shouldnt have reacted the way I did. I also don't know how to be in a healthy relationship with another person. He is an amazing friend but I dont know how to accept a healthy relationship."
1379,Can someone educate me more on previous delusional episodes?,"Just to preface, currently waiting for a call back to set up an appointment for a mental health screening that I got referred to by my doctor after opening up about some things in my life.

So, I had a really messed up childhood. The only place i felt truly safe and happy was my mom’s house, but then she turned on me and I became more paranoid of my family than literally anywhere else while there. Eventually my grandma died and she was kicked out of there by other family and thus I never saw it again without being able to process it properly.

Starting at 16, I began thinking about it way more than was healthy. I would research it, try and find jobs for my future that could help me get it back one day. I’d see if I could find the floor plan and see how much it would cost to recreate it. I missed my home and the safety of that room so much and was deeply resentful it was ripped away from me. Eventually the feelings subsided till they came back stronger than ever last year.

Last year, I became delusional about it more than ever. Now that I was in college, I was able to plan my future out in terms of general  career path. However, this house started overtaking my thought process. I would think about it and my happy times there almost every day and compared to the shit at home it seemed like heaven. I went back to researching ways and became adamant in my head that I would get it back as soon as possible. Everyone around me told me that “maybe one day” to make me feel better knowing full well it’s impossible, and deep down I knew it too but I was in full denial. I was fully primed and ready to do anything to get it back. In January this year I flew there and actually got to see the INSIDE of it thanks to a family friend who is HOA in the building and... the new owner completely changed it. It was unrecognizable, not even the walls were the same. I was in full denial at that point I thought maybe one day I could convince him to let me buy it.

The grand finale to this story is I am now fully delusional, feeling my happiness is solely based on my progress towards getting this apartment back. I have lost all rationality about it and lots of other things. Everything else is still normal about me except this insane delusion about this apartment. I just couldn’t let it go. I discover Wall Street bets and proceed to lose a ton of my college fund despite never having gambled or done any sort of investing before and fell into a deep, clinical depression as you might expect. I spent a few months after that in deep denial and trying my best to learn the system and get it back. I was able to get some money back thank god, not even close to all of it, but the mental cut of me having done that to myself cut deep. I felt like the scum of the Earth.

Eventually, I took acid in May and learned to stop and became fully rational and objective about the events of my life after a period of extreme mental stress and anxiety as years of suppressed childhood traumas and the realities of my life thus far came known to my conscious mind. I can say my mental health is better than ever now solely because of it. I’ve accepted that I will never get the apartment back, and the acid taught me things weren’t as happy as I really thought they were in that apartment. I don’t take it anymore now and haven’t for months. I can safely say that I feel much more in control of my impulses than I ever have in my life and I haven’t seen any sort of delusional signs since. I still worry that big life changes I want to make since realizing more about my past are out of a place of bad mental health, but I think it’s just my anxiety chaining me down. Anyways, thanks for hearing my story, I just want to know if anyone has any idea where these delusional behaviors may have come from or educate me on how they manifest into different mental health conditions."
1380,Numbness,"Recently I’ve been feeling very detached from people, and even myself. I lost one of my close friends who I’ve known for most of my life and I don’t feel a thing. My brother who id consider myself close with randomly stopped talking to me. The weird things is I don’t feel anger, sadness, or happiness I feel nothing. For my boyfriend I don’t feel much for him either. I guess I care for him but recently I’ve just been feeling pretty nonchalant towards everything. Is this normal? And what could I do to get rid of this feeling?"
1381,I feel like I'm loosing my emotions,"Its like I am loosing the ability to feel pretty much any emotion, i dont fall in love anymore, im not excited about anything, sad stories dont make me sad, i even dont feel enything for my friends anymore, i just feel so numb. Im not taking any drugs or medications. I was thinking maybe this has to do something with growing up and just becoming a regular boring adult (im 26 btw), I would like to avoid this but I dont know what to do. Anyone had this experience?"
1382,"Feel alone, need help...","This is honestly weird for me. I’m not one to join things like this. But I’m at a point of desperation. So much has happened over the last two years and despite family and a relationship, I’m miserably alone. Every time I talk to someone I get dismissed. Even the people that claim to “be there no matter what”. I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for 18 years. I started therapy and medication before I was a teenager. Yet everyone acts like it’s fake or a hassle. I just need someone to talk to.... I need to not feel alone when my significant other is sitting next to me. Not feel alone when I’m surrounded by “family and friends”. I can’t afford therapy or medication right now, and it doesn’t do enough for me anyway...."
1383,Can I just not feel like absolute shit for a day?,"Im just so anxious all the time, what the fuck is wrong with me? Everything I do is just overthink and be depressed. Im constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown all I wanna do is scream and cry. Nothing is good anymore. 

I’ll send my SO a heart and I feel like they hate me now because I did that. I feel like they don’t love me anymore for no real reason. I feel like everything I say is just annoying and stupid. I JUST WANT THIS TO STOP. please. Im desperate. It wasnt always like this, please let me go back to just being depressed all day. at least the. I could still find humor in this, make jokes about how bad I felt to cope. But now? now its just fucking torture! 
Why is this happening to me? Why cant i just be normal?







also sry if some things sound weird dunno english isn’t my native language"
1384,I cheated on my bf out of my insecurities. It's been a year and its killing me,"I cheated on my bf of 3 years on a drunk day with my high school crush who sort of took advantage of me. I realised the grave mistake that I have done and confessed it to my bf.  He forgave me but the whole incident changed who I am. 

I have nothing but guilt and fear as my base emotions now. I have guilt for everything that I do and I am anxious and provocative most of the time. I see myself as a low human now. I consider everyone as a better human than myself. I regret moving in with my bf (as my parents don't know about it), I regret smoking ( as I feel I am not being a good daughter) , I fear everyone around me, can't be cool in a social setting, always want to work as I have to prove myself to me, I am struggling to get my values back.

Please help me here."
1385,Scared to have children because I am slightly mentally unstable,"Lately I have been reading a lot about mental health, trying to discover what is wrong with me and all, journey to self-discovery type of thing and I have come across several articles that say that children can have several repressed memories and trauma which will later develop into mental illnesses due to their upbringing or growing up with unstable parents.

It makes me so scared about the idea of having children of my own because while what I am experiencing might be mild mental instability (which might have been caused due to my childhood and upbringing) I am afraid that it might have a negative effect on my kids.

The world is already a cruel enough place to bring a child into."
1386,I feel like I'm ungratefull and I don't deserve anything,"It's been a rough couple of weeks.   
My ex broke up with me, now she is being chatty and I can't read if she wants back or is just being a friend.   
I impulsivelly kissed a girl way younger than me and I found myself in a relationship.   
This summer I got offered a trials to become a model. Got my first photosession that turned out to be on the more erotic side, now I'm mortified to show my overly-conservative parents the pictures or even tell them that they are finally out.   
I got promoted in work and I didn't like the new position a bit. I planned to give it a chance and quit in the summer if I still can't start to feel like it's my place.   
Wnated to start a podcast with a friend of mine, start drawing and do art in general again...   
And here is the problem:  


Now  I'm starting to get feelings for my ex again..  
I constantly bounce between wanting to break up with my current girlfriend and not.   
I wanted to catch this opportunity to become a model and landed a professional photoshoot, now I feel scared should things work out.   
I knew exactly what I was going into and still I'm scared of the pictures and the attention I will receive.   
I stopped thinking about quitting not because I start to like my job but because I grew scared of what will it be if I do so.   
I stopped dreaming about going back to art and doing creative projects with my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I feel like I'm being ungrateull to the opportunities life has gave me. Seems like I want a thing so bad and as soon as I get it, I get scared and want to errase it from my life.   
I feel like I don't deserve anybody and anything and I just want to cuddle up in a corner and spend the rest of my days there, not bothering anybody and not being bothered by noone.   
I tried meditating, I tried getting more vitamins in should my condition is produced by a lack of healthy food... nothing is happening. I feel like the weight of the world has fallen on my shoulders and I can barely move it. Even my medication does not work.   
I feel like I will let everybody down and I don't know how I will live with that.   
Please help me out. Any advice will be appreciated."
1387,"I keep getting treated like a child, and I'm feeling my sanity starting to drain","So I (21f) and my sister (29f) have had a rocky relationship since the beginning of time. I couldn't even tell you how or when it started, but it's been a constant back and forth of arguing, then silent treatment, then arguing again, especially in the last year. 

Admittedly, I've been terrible at managing my mental health in the past so there's reason for my family to be worried. But, I've completely turned it around in the last year, even with the pandemic. I've started my degree, and finished this semester with straight A's, I have a healthy relationship with my partner, I'm eating right, working out, and overall I'm happy about 80% of the time. During the other 20%, I've been able to manage my emotions very well and bounce back in a couple of hours. My psychiatrist even decided it was time to part ways since I have been stable without medication for a long period of time.

Unfortunately, my sister lost her baby this year. It's been hard on her, and that could definitely be why she's been treating me differently. But as far as I can remember, she's always tried to parent me, which I hated because my parents do a good job themselves. Especially now, they've given me the independence I deserve because I've proved I can handle it. 

My sister has taken shots at me a few times this year, and over things that weren't at all self harm behavior. I've come to her a few times with a new project, or lifestyle change that I wanted to try because it may be beneficial, and she's completely shot me down to the point I've been in tears, and just wanted to give up. Everytime I tell her it was hurtful, her line is ""I said that to protect you""...and after that, she always said she'd back off, but then then continues to parent me in the future. 

It's such a tough situation. She's going through trauma, so I can't be tough on her, but she's practicing the same behavior she has for the past few years, and it's lead to me shutting myself off from the world because I can't handle being talked down to so often. 

I don't even know where to begin to set boundaries. I want to stand my ground, but around her I just back up into a corner and comply. I've asked my parents to talk to her, but they never got around to it. I can't message her husband because she has access to his phone. I'm just so lost on what to do. Her mental health matters to me, but so does mine. Help?"
1388,"""Just get out of bed."" As if it's that easy...","You have to know, I love my mom, she's an amazing human being and I know how much she cares about me. 

But lately my mental health has been getting worse and I stopped leaving my room and eating with my family etc because I can't get myself out of bed all day. 

The thing is just that my motger doesn't understand it. She frequently knocks on my door and tells me to 'just get myself out of bed', 'stop being so lazy' and 'only I can get myself out of there, so the only way to get better is to get up and go outside'. 

But. I. Can't. I am too exhausted to get out of bed, let alone go outside or do anything else. I know she means well, but in reality her saying things like that only makes me feel even worse because I know I'm a terrible person and that what I do hurts her. 

How do I deal with comments like that? How do I get myself out of bed when I can't? Is she really right when she says that I am the only person who can get myself out of that dark place?"
1389,Why do certain regular things make me squeamish and anxious?,"hi all, this is my first post on this sub, and while i have other problems for another day, this one is really on my mind. i saw a video on twitter today of a bell pepper being planted and it growing over the days, and things like this (seeing plants grow and move on their own, tree roots in general for some reason?) make me so uneasy, uncomfortable, and squeamish. i’m not entirely sure this is the correct sub for it, but since it does tend to induce anxiety and i didn’t really have anywhere else to go, i put it here. i don’t understand why this happens or if this is a common thing, if there’s a name for what i’m feeling, or how to fix it. if anyone has anything at all to offer please reach out, i would really love to better myself on this"
1390,Siblings suffering with mental illnesses,"I'm F22 still living at home and sharing a bedroom with my younger sister 16. But I must say, although I love her, and believe I hate to say this, but living with her, especially having to share the same room is hell. 

Every since I was 12 I started suffering from many different kinds of mental illnesses. In brief; had depression for 4/5 years. This led to BED. I then tried to control my eating by going on diets which worked for a short while but was still very focussed on my ED. I now continue to struggle with BED. Have also had a few months a few years back during which I suffered with depression again as well. Now, I also suffer from anxiety apart from BED. I must add, I have never sought help and when I had first recovered from depression, I never talked about my mental health with my family. This year I opened up to them and they told me they knew at the time I was depressed (obviously) but they never tried to help me because of the stigma. They still don't know about my BED.

Now, a little about my sister... She has depression and has been depressed for around 2 years I think. She is very open about it, unlike me. I have talked many times with my mother about finding help for her because I know what depression feels like although I know her depression is different than mine. 

Ever since she started suffering from depression, my mental health is suffering a lot. Our relationship is a disaster. We can't communicate without arguing. And I hate this. Since she is so open about her depression, and I don't talk about my issues because I prefer to keep things private, my parents put a lot more responsibility on me which is making it even more difficult for me to get through all this. I want to leave but I have no means. I don't think how this can get any better.

Any help / advice / thoughts welcome.

Thanks."
1391,Random task suggestions to fill lockdown time?,"We are going back into a strict lockdown where I am - I may lose my job and even if I don’t I can’t go to work. I am daunted by the thought and was hoping you all could suggest some random activities to try out from home? 
I’ve stocked up on books and movies but these don’t tend to occupy me as I’m a two things at once kind of person - aka drawing and watching or cooking and listening to podcasts"
1392,Hopelessness,"Writing this because I don’t know where else to go. 

Recently I’ve had a feeling of intense hopelessness which is constantly with me. I wake up and I feel it, I work, study, socialise yet that feeling remains. I might forget it for the odd hour yet it comes back and even if I’m with people I’ll daydream away and have that at the front of my head even if I’m talking to someone or doing something else.

When I’m on my own I have this urge to cry yet most of the time I can’t cry. Only occasionally it will come out and once I’m done that feeling still remains. 

I’ve graduated later than most of my peers, I don’t know exactly what field I want to go into, I have applied for numerous roles yet no success. I normally consider myself a confident individual yet recently this hopelessness for the future has taken all confidence away from me. I’m a 26 yr old guy, currently doing a masters with no idea why I’m doing it, I have no savings, I split up from my girlfriend of 3 years because I didn’t see a future for myself let alone with someone else and I know that hurt her immensely because I couldn’t explain any of this to her.

I’m not quite sure why I’m writing this on Reddit but I needed to get this out. I don’t want to speak to friends or family about it because I don’t know what to say to them. I don’t want to bring them down with my shit that I can’t even understand myself. I understand that mental health issues are best shared but I physically can’t bring myself to even say the words to other people, I’m articulating it on here but I dunno I don’t wanna cry in front of other people maybe that’s it.

Ive even spoken to myself out loud about all of it and tried to rationalise things yet this sadness, loneliness or whatever the fuck it is, just won’t go. Sometimes I think yeah I’d rather be dead but then I realise I’m too much of a pussy to even try that shit and I know it won’t help anything. Maybe it’s just a rough patch I don’t know but I can’t seem to see a way out of this hole. I’m working out and trying to stay on top of my studies while I do my unskilled part time job but this feeling which makes me want to cry, makes me want to smash shit up and just makes me want to hide away, remains. I dunno I just had to get this shit out anonymously cos fuck I don’t know what else to do."
1393,I've been drawing for a month for the first time since high school and I'm doing better.,"I have been drawing ever since I can remember. I started with comics as a child, at school and then at high school. Then came studies, work, moving abroad and I stopped with my passion. And then came the depression. I've finally been in therapy for a year and a half. That had ups and downs, you know how it is. My best friend has been encouraging me for months, if not years, that I keep journals with the positive stuff and that I do something for myself. A month ago I had a crappy day where I couldn't even get up and get motivated. I then had an impulse to go for a walk. When I was out I saw a school supply store, I went in, bought a drawing pad and watercolors and at home I recreated my old drawings from high school to start. They weren't any better than they were back then, but it was fun. So much fun that to this day I haven't stopped and I draw after work and on weekends, whenever I have time. I edit the pictures on my laptop and post them on social media. I've created an editorial schedule so I bring in some structure and look forward to new posts. For the first time in a long time, I'm doing something that gives me a goal. I don't have to think about how much my life sucks and how much everyone supposedly despises me. I know how much it takes to get up and start doing something when you suffer from depression. I just wanted to share my story with you and maybe plant a seed with you that will blossom with a beautiful idea over time. That's how it was with me and my best friend. He would probably say to me now, ""Didn't I tell you?"""
1394,Panic disorder acting up again,"Lately my panic attacks have been coming back full swing, multiple times a day. I tell my partner I don't feel well a lot of the time and he's begun telling me ""you never feel well"" and my memories been really bad because I'm dissociating so much, I can't remember him saying some of things he said and he got really upset with me and said that it feels like I'm not listening to him. We got into an argument for a few hours and this caused me to have more anxiety because Im scared I won't remember what he's saying and he'll get upset with me. He knows about my mental health and how shitty it is but he's frustrated with having to deal with it all of the time which is making the depression worse. My mind feels like it's constantly spinning with thoughts that I can't control anymore and I'm really exhausted from all of it. Panic disorder  makes it hard for me to take medicine and eat things and I've been frustrating him more with that because everytime I have to try something new I have panic attacks for a few hours off and on and it's debilitating. I haven't been sleeping well because of the anxiety of the next panic attack. It's to the point where I'm nauseous almost every day because I'm so scared. My insurance doesn't cover any therapists right now in my area or online and I can't afford one because I'm not working."
1395,Can someone tell me what this disorder is?,"Idk what’s wrong with me. I’m what people would consider normal. Until I’m alone. When I’m all alone it’s like there’s another person inside of me. Who is just violent and rude and insane. I scream random words, beat myself or an object, talk about how I’d like to kill god or that god is scared to kill me. And the whole time I can’t get rid of this weird smile. I’m not joking someone please help me before I can’t control it."
1396,First therapy session,"It’s my first therapy session tmr and I’m pretty nervous. I haven’t told anyone about this, and I don’t plan to do so. I don’t think I’m diagnosed with any, but I don’t know who I can tell my thoughts to without emotionally burdening them. I even had to think twice before deciding to seek help because I’m scared I’ll waste their time. 

These days I’ve been crying and having sudden break downs whenever I’m alone, even in public. One minor inconvenience and I could start crying.. so I’m pretty worried if even before I say anything to the therapist, I’d cry. I don’t wanna waste either of our time :( 

Wish me luck, even though I don’t believe in it ahah. I have a strong feeling I’d get an attack otw there. If there’s any tips on not crying while telling your problems or to stop being anxious, do let me know :’) thank you very much."
1397,I need an advice.,"I'm always finding myself talking with me. Im paranoic and sensitive last weeks. Its like an another person controls my brain.

Im writing these because i think if nobody helps me quickly, im gonna hurt myself. I googled that but every website says the same thing.

1398,I hate being German,"I did a school project on my genealogy it was advertised as a chance to embrace my culture. I attempted to teach them about German foods, culture, etc but the girl in my class who came up with the idea proceeded to post everywhere that I am a Nazi. She said some really crappy stuff about me and now everyone hates me. I’m really depressed that they said we could embrace who we were and when I say that I’m German they jump to 

“you are German so you must be a Nazi”

I made explicitly clear that my relatives left Germany in the late 1800s before Hitler was even in politics.

1400,What are some good remedies for severe anxiety?,"I (20F) have been suffering from extreme anxiety since I was approximately 4 years old. I've been through years and years of therapy, two inpatient hospitalizations, and on a large variety of different medications and nothing has helped long term. I have panic attacks on a regular basis; so severe I often vomit. I am constantly stressed out and it has aged me and my hair has began to fall out.

I'm finally doing hobbies that I'm looking forward to and I no longer feel like my days are filled with a pessimistic existence and i no longer dread each day.

Unfortunately I have to work today, but while I hate it and am not looking forward to it, I no longer dread it and am actually looking forward to going back to expressing my creative mind once I'm finished with it."
1404,Whats happening to me?,Hey everyone. I have a problem and I dont know how to diagnose what it is. I started having panic attacks about a month and a half ago they would always come when I was trying to fall asleep. It lasted for a week or two. One I had that is very memorable is one I had when I was in class at school. I was minding my own business and then all of a sudden it felt like I was pulled out of reality in a way. Everything looked like it had a brownish haze over it and I felt very uncomfortable and could no longer concentrate on anything I did. It wore off after class was over but ever since then it feels like I can't focus on anything I do and my memory is shot. I feel like I'm living in my own mind. The days go by and I feel like I no longer have an emotional response to anything that happens. I don't feel sad or anxious but I do feel uncomfortable because nothing feels like it used to. Even now when I try to fall asleep sometimes I won't fall asleep for awhile and transition into this feeling of being in an altered reality. I'm scared for my sanity and I would like to ask everyone here for advice on what this is and what is causing it? Sorry if this sounds like a mindless ramble.
1405,I think i'm too mentally unstable. Should i see a doctor?,"I get scared, sad or angry over the smallest of things. I overthink everything. I don't know how to make small or big decisions, because i'm always full of doubts. Most of the time i'm worried or upset about something. I don't think this is normal at all."
1406,The 30 Day Mental Health + Self Care Challenge,"Hello, hello, hello! 

So, I’ve decided to create my very own **30 Day Mental Health Challenge**. If you’re willing to try it out, feel free at any point. :) 

Down below, I will be giving you 1 activity to do everyday, for the next 30 days. So, if you begin today, you’re 30 day will be up on the 20th of January 2021. Mind you, you don’t have to get involved, this is just a little challenge set out for a few of you. If you get involved, then great! This challenge was created to strengthen your Mental Health over the festive period. As we all know, it has been an incredibly difficult year, but we will all pull through this together. If you don’t think you’re capable enough to do the full **30** days of activities, that’s completely fine, you can target your own number. Perhaps 10? Or even 15? Do it in your own pace and remember, it’s there to help you and keep your mind as busy as possible. The challenges are not hard, you may feel like some are easy, but that’s the whole point of it - they are there to make you feel accomplished and to get you into a little routine. Many of these activities won’t last longer than an hour. If you’re able to do it, great. Thank you! :) 


**TODAY** - **December 21st** - *Drink 4 glass-full of water*. That’s it, that’s the first challenge. Easy enough, right? 

**December 22nd** - *Go out for a walk*. This all depends on where you live in the world and the restrictions. So, if you’re not allowed to leave your apartment/house/flat, try and aim for 1,000 steps inside. 

**December 23rd** - *Try some meditation*. If you’re not a fan of meditation, that’s fine, no worries at all. Whenever you’re free on this day, give myself a message and I’ll find a 5-10 minute meditation challenge for you. :) 

**December 24th** - *Go to sleep 30 minutes than you usually do*. Change things up a little, we all love change. So, for example, if you usually go to sleep at 11pm, on this day, go to sleep at 10:30pm. Have a better nights sleep! 

**December 25th** - Christmas Day! 🎁 I know many of you will be busy during Christmas Day. So, because of that, I will make this challenge a little easier for you. As the festive time is all about family and love, the challenge will be *FaceTime/Phone/Text a member of your family*. If, for unfortunate reasons you’re not able to, give myself a message and I’ll have a chat with you. And you know what? That counts! 

**December 26th** - Boxing Day! 🥊 After a day full of eating, drinking and spending some time with your family members, I will make this challenge a little more relaxing for you - *Listen to your favourite musician*. If you have an album, great. If you have their music on your phone, awesome. We all have access to YouTube! If you can listen to a whole album, that’s the goal. Put your feet up, feel the music and relax. :) 

**December 27th** - Today, you’ll be writing an **ESSAY**! Just kidding, but it does involved writing, unfortunately. Grab yourself a piece of paper, a pen/pencil and write down something great that’s happened to you in the last few days. So, this can be an activity you did on Christmas Day/Boxing Day or even before the festive period. Think of something that made you laugh or smile, and write it down. 

**December 28th** - So, day 8 of the challenge. And for today, you’re going to set *YOURSELF* a goal for something. Rather than listen to my challenge, today, you’re going to do something *YOU* want to do. If you need any tips, feel free to message me and I’ll find you something to do! If you can, give yourself a goal/challenge, then accomplish it. Don’t make it too easy! 😉

**December 29th** - Quite possibly the most difficult challenge yet. On the 9th day, *you’re going to ask for help*. I have decided to stick this in the middle as you don’t have to think about it for a long time. Also, after the day is passed, you can breathe and relax. You feel like you’ve accomplished something by asking for help. This will give you extra motivation to continue on with the challenges and make it to Day 30. Now, before I continue... as I’ve seen with my own eyes, many of you don’t have anyone to go to for help, no family members and no friends. This is where I’ll come in and help you out. I consider myself your friend. I have spoken to *a lot* of you over the past few months and it’s been fantastic. If you believe that you don’t have nobody to turn to, my PM’s are open for you and it will count as a challenge completed. But, this is also a challenge that reconnects people together. If you’ve fallen out with any family members, this is the time for you to call/text them. If you’ve just had an argument with your father/mother/brother/sister/grandparents, reconnect with them, make things right. What if you’ve already seen them for the last time? And the last conversation you had with them was an argument? I don’t want this feeling to get into your head, but at times like this, family needs to come together and build a stronger connection. To that family member or friend you’ve fallen out with, give them a text, give them a call and reconnect. Let bygones be bygones, agree to disagree if you must, but don’t let your last conversation be an argument. Ask for forgiveness, ask for help and rebuild that relationship. 

**December 30th** - For some of you, reconnecting with a family member or a friend can be a daunting task and it may take every emotion out of you. So, today, it’s going to be a *lazy day*! Stay in your PJ’s all day, make yourself a drink, grab some snacks, because today, *you’re going to have a film day*. Grab 2/3/4 of your favourite films, put your feet up and enjoy! 

**December 31st** - New Years Eve! 🎊 The last day of this torturous year. What a ride, ey? Before the first day of the new year, you’re going to *unfollow all of the negative social media accounts* that brings you down. So, go through your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or whatever other social media you’re on, go through all the accounts and subreddits you’re in... and unfollow/unsubscribe as many accounts you deem negative. Start the new year off right. 

**January 1st** - HAPPY NEW YEAR! 🎈 Let’s start off a new year with a good challenge, shall we? As usual, many people start off a new year with a diet. Well, we are going to do the same thing, but not as hardcore as some people. Today, you’re going to make yourself a health lunch. Get some vegetables, salad and fruits and make yourself something nice to eat. Even if it’s as simple as a tomato and lettuce sandwich, it counts, it’s healthy! 

**January 2nd** - *Donate something to a local charity*. So, for the 2nd day of the year, you’re going to give back. Remember that box of toys that’s laying about upstairs? That DVD you never watch? That grey hoodie you never wear? Or what about that TV you never use? Donate, donate, donate! Many people around the world will be without nothing, how about start the new year off right by donating to others who are in need? It will not only make them happy, but you will feel incredibly accomplished and happy with yourself. You would have helped someone out, it’s a brilliant feeling, believe me. 

**January 3rd** -  *Read a book*! Before you ask, no, you don’t have to read the whole book. If you’re able to and have enough time, try and get through 20-30 pages. By doing so, it will keep your mind occupied and busy, thus will allow you to concentrate on the book, rather than what’s going on inside your mind. Take it one page at a time, put some relaxing music on in the background and relax! 

**January 4th** - In the day, you can do whatever you want, it’s a free day! But, that being said, in the night, how about you have a *phone-free night*? Technology has ruled the entire world for the past few years, but will it hurt by going 1 night without it? Put your phone down and do something else. Watch a film? Listens to some music? Have an early night? Exercise? Meditate? Anything but the use of technology! 

**January 5th** - *Clean your house/flat/apartment*! How many of us has walked home to find ourselves in front of a massive mess? Clothes are everywhere, the beds not been made, papers everywhere etc. Guilty! So, for today, clean up the house as much as you can. It won’t only make your house look much nicer, but it’ll make you feel much, much better with a cleaner house. 

**January 6th** - *Give someone a compliment*. And when I mean someone, I mean anyone! Your neighbour, the post-man, the cashier, your family member, your friend... anyone! The compliment can be as simple as “*I like your shirt today*”, done! By doing so, hopefully it will turn into a habit, that you will start to give a compliment everyday. 

**January 7th** - *30 minutes of Yoga*. Oh no, that dreaded **Y** word! We all knew it was going to come... 😉 Many of you won’t be too familiar with Yoga, if that’s the case, give myself a PM and I’ll fetch you a decent Yoga workout for 30 minutes. At the end of it, I hope you will feel much better, more relaxed and calm and hopefully, a new hobby! 

**January 8th** - Now, this is an interesting one. I will want to know how many people have been following my little 30 day challenge. So, on the 8th of January, *you’ll be creating a post on Reddit*. To be exact, the post will be published on this sub (r/mentalhealth). But, what will you be publishing, you ask? Well, *YOUR* post will be about the things you are thankful for. So, for example... on the 8th of January, I will be creating a post myself. I will name the post “I Am Thankful For #30DayChallenge” and list everything I am thankful for. For example, family, friends and everything that’s close to my heart. Before you ask, no, you don’t *HAVE TO* do this, you can simply PM me and tell me what you’re thankful for there. There’s no pressure at all to complete each and every task on this list. Do as many as you can! :) 

**January 9th** - This is a unique challenge for both genders, males and females. So, for the females, you’re going to have a *makeup-free day*. You don’t have to apply makeup, go through the day with not a single drop of makeup on. You’re beautiful the way you are, you don’t need to plaster yourself with foundations. Be yourself, be natural. And for males... well, we don’t tend to use makeup. So, for you... it’s going to be an easy one, if you usually wax or gel up your hair, go without! Let your hair flow down and be natural. This challenge is to show that you don’t need to impress anyone, you’re beautiful the way you are and if nobody can accept that, then that’s on them, not you. :) 

**January 10th** - Today, you’re going to *adopt a new habit/hobby*. It can be anything! What is that *one* thing you’ve always wanted to try? I’ll give you a few examples.... knitting? Drawing? Gardening? Board Games? Try cooking different meals? Play some cards? Video games? Absolutely anything. If you find something to be interesting, give it a shot. :) 

**January 11th** - This is going to be an interesting one.... *Learn a new language*! “Oh dear” I hear some of you say... nightmare! Well, you’re all in luck. As a fluent Welsh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 speaker, I will happily teach you a few words/sentences! If you’re in need to learn some Welsh words, that’s all you have to do is PM me and I’ll teach you as much as you want! Other languages you could possibly learn is Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese.... there’s many you can learn from!

**January 12th** - An easy little challenge for you today. As soon as you wake up in the morning, grab a piece of paper and a pen. You’re *going to write down a quote or a motivation speech* that means a lot to *YOU*. After you finish writing it down, stick it in a place where you go to every hour. So, your refrigerator? On top of your TV? On the wall? On the mirror? Anywhere. Every time you go to these locations, you’ll be reminded of that quote/speech. :) 

**January 13th** - *Send out a random friendly text*. To who, you ask? That is entirely up to you! When I mean anyone, **ANYONE!** To whoever you love, thankful or grateful for, give them a random text or message. It doesn’t have to be a big text, it can be as small as you want it to be. This can be to someone who you haven’t spoken to in a long time, a former co-workers, a former school friend, your neighbour, anyone! 

**January 14th** - *Do a random act of kindness*. An easy but meaningful task for today. Any random act of kindness, for example, opening the door for someone, giving someone some flowers, help someone with grocery, to a chore for someone, give your dog/cat some attention. Just a little random act of kindness. It’s much better when you don’t expect anything in return, do it for your own happiness. :) 

**January 15th** - Oh god, I’m going to say it, I’m going to say it.... it’s time for a.... *WORK OUT DAY*! That being said, I wouldn’t necessarily call it a work-out “day”, more like a 30 minute work-out session. I understand some of you don’t tend to do this as you don’t have the motivation for it, but try your best. These workouts don’t have to be long, do as many sets and reps as you can. For example... planking for 1 minute (2 times), 1 minutes worth of sit-ups (3 times), 1 minute worth of press ups (3 times) and a few more, that’s it! I’m not asking you to leave your home to do this, you can do it in your own lounge, bonus!

**January 16th** - *Joke Day*! This is a challenge to make you feel good, and hopefully, laugh a little. Think of a joke (a funny one 😉) and as soon you have, PM me the joke! I want to hear all of your favourite jokes. :) 

**January 17th** - Today, you’re going to *Treat Yourself*. Go for a walk and if you see an ice-cream of a doughnut stand, go buy something. You’re going to treat yourself to something you always wanted. You’re going to be kind to yourself, you’re going to be there for yourself (as you always should). Let out all the “what if’s” and do something you always wanted to do. Ladies, remember that purse you saw online? Treat yourself to it! Guys, remember that video game you saw in the shops? Treat yourself! Today, it’s all about *you* and your happiness. Don’t think twice, just go for it. :) 

**January 18th** - *Give some spare change to the homeless + donate to charity*. I don’t know about you, but where I’m from, there are a lot of homeless people about and it’s upsetting to see. If you live in the middle of nowhere and not able to give to a homeless person, don’t worry, how about donating to a charity online? I’m not asking you to give $100 away, **only if you’re able to** give them a dollar/pound. To you, it may only seem a small about of money, but to them, it’s everything. With that dollar, they’re able to get something to eat or drink, because of **YOU**. If you see someone struggle, you help them out, you don’t step over them. And this goes out to everyone, if you’re struggling, get it out of your system, there are people out there who will help you. This can be someone on social media or a professional. We are here to listen to you, we will help you out as much as possible. Do you know why? Because we care. 

**January 19th** - *Write down everything positive about you*. Yet another writing challenge, I know, sorry! Once again, grab yourself a pen and paper and trot down everything you *love* about you. So, your smile? Hair? Eyes? Personality? Your clothes? Your taste in films/music? Your kindness? Your ability to never give up? Anything that comes into your mind, write it down. :) 

**January 20th** - THE LAST DAY! ❤️ The final day of the **30 Day Mental Health And Self-Care Challenge**. That went quick, didn’t it? From the 21st of December to now, I hope you feel accomplished. If you’ve made it this far, I cannot thank you enough for following my little challenge. I hope it’s kept you all occupied, busy and a distraction from all the negative thoughts. So, for the *FINAL* day... you’re going to do something for the *future*. Sounds a little weird, doesn’t it? Well, this time next year, I will be doing the *30 Day Challenge again*. Today, you’re going to *write a letter to your future-self*. This letter is going to be written to yourself for this time next year. As you’ve completed the 30 Day Challenge, write down everything you’ve learnt about yourself and how you’ve managed to make it this far. This time next year, you’ll be opening the letter and it will remind you of the person you once were and how much you’ve changed. Believe you me, when someone is feeling down and unhappy, it’s incredibly hard to stick to a routine as there seems to be no motivation for anything. By completing this challenge, you’ve not only shown me, but you’ve shown yourself how strong and disciplined you are as a person. This time next year, you’ll open your letter and it will all come back to you. You’ll be reminded how far you’ve come and where you once were. 

Thank you all for reading! If you’re not able to do each challenge, that’s completely understandable, do as many as you can. If you need any help, let me know and I’ll do my best to provide you with the best resources. Other than that, have a great day, stay safe and best wishes to you all. Oh yeah, I forgot.... drink some water!!! 😉

Thanks guys. :)"
1407,Please comment down one word/sentence that can make a person smile today. Thanks a lot :),Help me make someone's day better
1408,Ever felt like you never wanted to date again because you can’t handle relationships?,"I thought I was patching things up with my ex of two years who was just angry and aggressive alllll the time until this weekend. I left her in April and very shortly after she saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed as BPD. I remember vividly her calling me one day, in tears after I had been moved out for about a month, saying how nobody will ever love her again and that she’s broken and how the BPD explains everything about her growing up. 

Things broke down way too far and we were left not speaking. She called me in July though and she seemed like she wanted to patch things up. “Just wanted to see how you’re doing”. I had already started writing a hand written letter (15 pages, she had a thing about handwriting) and sent that with a few other things including a Tiffany’s compass. 

I talked about a lot of things, but a few things stood out.  My cat died after I moved out and I told her about that. She loved my cat (pure bred silver Bengal) and we saved her with 6000$ of our own money right before I left (somehow we went from surfing on clouds to breaking up in less than a week). I talked about everything I missed about us and her and described how much her anger was hurting me ; and how it was the only thing keeping us apart. She must have tried breaking up with me or kicking me out of our apartment 4 or 5 times. It was unstable. I finished with, “keep this compass until we find each other again”. 

After having the care package for three months she brought everything back to my place and left it on my doorstep with a hastily written note. She basically wrote back “I don’t know how to say this but I don’t want to be in a relationship any more”.  Not just with me, but the way it was phrased it was “not with anyone”. As someone with bipolar I was not expecting to be the guiding light in our relationship. 


So. Back to the original question. What was that like? What brought you to that point? Were you just hyper aware or did it come after a breakup or an abusive ex? Let me know"
1409,I’m really scared to accept a job offer and this decision makes me spiral into so many negative thoughts about everything else,"The job isn’t perfect and there are several decisions that will come up along the way that could cost me the job or my health (remote work but most are back in office) but it’s still a good opportunity for me to get out of the slump i’ve been in but i’m just so scared that i’ll fail miserably and if i can’t handle this decision how can i handle a career


and I can’t tell if this is my gut telling me it’s wrong or if it’s because i’m afraid of change and need to just take the job"
1410,A short Letter to my Anxiety,"Dear Anxiety,  
yes i ordered Pizza,  
yes i gotta wait and then go down and get it,  
NO its not a damn reason for me to feel sick, dizzy, tremble and have a elevated heartrate,  
WHY in the everloving fuck would you spike up because of the thought of getting a pizza and having a nice evening with my family  
jesus flipping christ

Worst Regards,  
Me  


P.S.: i hate you anxiety"
1411,Negativity and bad thoughts.,"Hey.

Im 17 and I just cant focus on the positive things.

 If im starting to do something difficult, I dont believe Ill succeed.

 If something as little as me accidentally spilling something happens, I immediately say ""Ofcourse it will happen to me, always me"".

 If I have a headache I say to myself, why would it be just a simple headache and not a serious issue or disease.

When someone says to me. ""If you think positive, things will be positive"". I just cant find the sense in this. why would things be positive and not negative. and if I try to think positive I start to wonder if I am lying to myself.

this puts me in stress and makes me just accept that it is what it is and I need to live with this and I cant change.

And i dont want to live with those negative thoughts but i cant think positively without feeling im lying to myself.

I dont have almost any responsibilities. And i feel almost stupid and weak to even complain.

Does someone have an advice please?"
1412,"I'm really confused by my own personality. I've been told I ""lack empathy"" but I don't think I do.","(Not asking for a diagnosis and not diagnosing myself. I just want to read your thoughts and relative experience)

TL;DR: I guess I process things in a way which could probably fit under the label of ""sociopathic"" but I do care deeply for my family members and don't want to be a bad person. Its contradictory and confusing for me.

I (F, 24) have been told by many people throughout my life that I have a lack of empathy. But dont feel like that is true because I do feel bad when I see other people in distress. I worry that my dad is too stressed or my mom feels hurt by her friend's comment or my brother feels sad etc.

I remember multiple occasions when people told me that I was cold because I wasn't expressing sadness when I should have. For example, my highschool took us to volunteer at an old age home (in East Asian where I grew up). Some of my classmates had tears in their eyes at the conditions of the place and the lack of entertainment for the elderly and I felt nothing. A couple of my classmates came and asked me if it didn't make me sad. I said no, it didn't, and they gave me this disgusted look and told me I was cold. I didn't understand why I was getting that reaction until years later when I realized that I should have been sad to see other people in sub-par living conditions.

Another time someone told me about an assault/murder that happened in the area and the first thing I did was laugh because there was some funny aspect to the circumstance that stood out to me before the tragedy of the actual murder did. 

This sort of thing happens a lot. I also tend to say things without realizing that they are hurtful until someone points it out to me.

Another thing, which I absolutely hate admitting, is that I have been cruel to animals. I hate that. When I was a child I would torment animals with the intention of scaring them. It disgusts me when i think back to it. I love animals. But I did it, so I just have to deal with the guilt. 

I form emotional attachments very strangely. I barely ever feel attachment to friends. I only have one friendship that I make an effort to maintain. She's a friend that I get along with on a level that I've never experienced with anyone else. I find her funny and I barely ever find people/movies/jokes funny. 

I had another good friend that I knew since elementary school. We saw each other every day until he moved to another country after graduating, and then we took turns flying over to see eachother every year. He died in his sleep 3 years after he moved and when I got the call I didn't actually feel anything. I knew I was supposed to be sad so I behaved as if I was sad but i didn't feel it. There are times when I think of this friend and miss him but I never felt grief or loss.

I also don't seem to experience romantic love the same way most people do, either. I have barely any interest in people. Its confusing and frustrating because I really want to experience love...but I can't seem to like anyone. I can *imagine* being in love but I have never felt it and the emotion feels out of reach. I never had crushes in school or into adulthood.

Aside from being told I lack empathy I have been told, mostly by family members, that I am very manipulative. I genuinely do not feel as though I am being sinister. I read people's behavior and adjust my own accordingly for the best outcome but everyone does that to some degree. I can admit that I am probably more socially manipulative than the average person because it can be an effective tool but I am not a malicious person.

Anyway, this is getting long. I acknowlege some abnormal personality traits in myself but at the same time I feel concerned by the abnormality so surely I'm not on the sociopathy spectrum as some people in my life have alluded to."
1413,Needing someone to talk to,"Hi everyone. 

I'm (33/F) at my wit's end. I am really needing someone to talk to. I was going to try to see an actual therapist, but I just cannot afford it at the moment. I've been dealing with depression, grief and extreme insecurities to name a few for the past 15 years."
1414,Falling apart,I just keep watching as my life falls apart and it seems like I can't do anything about it.
1415,Struggling with school + advice for the future?,"hey i’m not sure if someone could help here ?? but.. anyway

essentially I’ve failed out of two programs already and in currently failing one more and i’m wondering what my options are for self support and financial stability...... I dunno man I really feel like i should have an education typical “gifted kid” story

Um. I feel pretty unsafe in my living environment so it’s difficult to concentrate or retain any information at all. It feels like a depression induced brain fog ?

i was planning on finishing engineering but was dropped then finance but that flopped so now i’m doing political science. which is pretty unspecialized in comparison

Im financially dependent and from high school i was hoping to be able to afford my own place a year after i graduated uni. but i’m 3rd year but only finished 1 year of a degree

it’s not really about whether or not i like it. i always have passions i can pursue on the side
my first instinct is to leave my living situation and I expected a degree to secure that for me, however, acquiring one did not go as planned
The retail rat race looks terrifying and by skipping out on school I feel like I have lost opportunities

I was also wondering if it would be difficult to get back into school after dropping out
none of my family have a post secondary education (my younger sibling is currently pursuing theirs) and i feel like i’m negatively affecting mine and our future by letting the past 3 years go to waste. (especially in the land of “equal opportunity”. for example, degrees in other countries “don’t count”) my gpa is 1.6. i’ve seen 3 therapists, none of them were particularly helpful, i cant afford one at this point."
1416,Am I psychotic or am I just overthinking?,"So a couple of nights ago I smoked a little bit of a spliff with my sister, only done this once before in Amsterdam and eat a weed cookie and I had the worse experience of my life and panicked and believed I was going to die around 4 years ago.. so this was my second time with it thinking I would be okay as it wasn't an edible and the same thing happened again, as soon as I started to feel the effects which was hearing my sister speak real slowly and my heart was uncontrollably fast I said to her im having a panic attack and I dont remember much after that just that I was screaming and shouting at her that I was dying and my mind was screaming at me that I was it was so loud, and everything she said to me to try calm me down i was paranoid about thinking she knows I'm dying and is just trying to keep me calm, nothing felt real at all like I was in some kind of trapped time loop hell, everything was just manic and scary and awful.. I was like that for around 5 minutes she said but my god it felt like an hour and I started to slowly come out of it, I tried to be sick, I had to get my boyfriend to pick me up but I was so confused and disorientated and just didn't know what was going on.. 

So now im just worried if I'm psychotic, if il do something stupid, I dont know if I'm just anxious now worrying and overthinking or if there is something wrong with me. I have had panic attacks after the Amsterdam experience when my grandad died and I woke up and thought I was dying again and went crazy trying to get out of the house but ive had therapy for that and now I understand that panic attacks may make you feel like your dying but your not and ive learnt to overcome that fear but now im just scared im going to lose my mind and do something crazy.. I get a few bad intrusive thoughts every now and then like ""what if I killed my pet with this knife"" and it scares the shit out of me and my heart starts going because I start to shock myself I could think bad things and what if I did it.. a part of me knows this is just anxiety but another part of me is like well people can just go psychotic and crazy and you've done it a couple of times now with the cannabis.

Can anyone help or reassure me? I've gone about my day today and when I focus on normal things in life I'm fine as if nothing had ever happened but when I start thinking back to the other night and how I acted and how my mind was screaming at me so I was screaming im just left feeling so scared."
1417,"I'm 15 y/o, and I think I'm developing an eating disorder.","Hey everyone. Sorry if I screw up sometime, english is not my 1st language.

I think I'm developing an eating disorder. 

I've been strugling with my weight since I have memorie, I've always known I'm fat and can say I've been discriminated because of it. But the last couple of years have been awful. I lost a couple of pounds in 2019 after finishing primary school. (7th grade where I live)

But something wasn't okey that summer, I wanted to lose weight so much that I started trying extreme diets and when I failed I just ate everything I had on hand because, well ""I'll start tomorrow""

The problem is I found myself doing that thing every single day till today. I just cannot stop, I try and follow the diet during the day, most of the times being succesful, but when the night comes by, I just eat everything. That got worse during quarantine due to COVID and now...well.

I don't wanna rush but I do wanna lose weight, since I am now in 94 kilograms and with my height being 1.74 thats NOT okay. Any kind of phsycological treatment is out of hand, don't ask why, and it's not that I'm ashamed or something like that, I can't tell the real reason.

What can I do?"
1418,Catastrophizing,"I have a tendency of catastrophizing every situation. Basically, expecting for the worst on steroids. Everytime I have to make a decision, I tend to pick up all the negatives and play out each of them in my mind. Due to this tendency, I always live in anxiety and feel crippled because I cannot take any decision. Apart from hurting myself over and over, I am also hurting people around me because I never take a concrete stance on anything. It's making me unable to function as an adult and I can't seem to hold off my mind from playing out the worst consequences of every single decision I make. I'm perpetually anxious and depressed. I don't have any self-worth in my mind. I don't know what to do. My mind is hurting me and I need help."
1419,No one else has noticed that my eating is messed up apart from me,"I know that my eating isn't normal . Lately I'm finding that on some days I'm deliberately skipping breakfast, then I'll eat lunch but it's like I feel like I have to prove to myself or find ""evidence"" that I've done enough to deserve to eat lunch. I think at the moment my food issues kind of stems from every time I argue with someone I feel the need to punish myself by not allowing myself the food I want. And then my brain tells me that the other person would be happy if they knew I had ""punished"" myself. I also have very poor body image and every time I get the tiniest burst of confidence it immediately gets snatched away again because I feel like I'm just being delusional/arrogant because other people wouldn't expect an ugly, size 14/16 girl to have any confidence they would expect a skinny, beautiful size 4/6 girl to be confident but not me. I feel like other people think I can't possibly have an eating disorder when I'm the size I am"
1420,Plummeting feeling - anyone else get this?,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here. 
Today out of nowhere I’ve had this plummeting low feeling. It feels like deep, disconnected, apathetic depression (which I’ve had before, but currently it’s managed and stable). Today I couldn’t function, engage or focus. It feels like someone just switched the power off in my brain and I’m running on fumes. Nothing I do seems to make it better. If I was in the middle of a depressive episode it would make more sense, but until today I have been fine(ish) for several weeks.

Has anyone else experienced this? And do you have any explanation or advice for regaining some sense of control?

Background: I have a long history of anxiety and depression, I have had several stints of therapy in the past and I am currently taking antidepressants. The feeling I had today came on so suddenly after feeling fine(ish) for several weeks. It felt a bit like I must have skipped an SSRI tablet, even though I definitely hadn’t."
1421,Christmas and the holidays are a trauma trigger," 

Part of me wants to scream *fuck Christmas.*   The other part of me wants Christmas to mean something more than  presents and stuff. Christmas is so triggering in an already toxic  society that says *it’s our duty to keep abusive family members in our lives rather than seek peace and health,* and it is because, by that understanding, we find ourselves at battle with ourselves over our sovereignty.

I  think we need to hit the pause button and recognize for a moment that  right now, and no, I don’t mean in the times of Covid, but now as in the  holiday season, is the most challenging time of year for so many of us.  I include myself in this. That is not to say that other parts of the  year are not equally as difficult but simply to say this — in a society  that ignores its people’s needs because commerce is more important than  love — shit breaks.

As trauma  survivors, we are asked to wear masks to hide the pain that we feel  inside during the holidays. We are told not to be a *Grinch*  and to be in the spirit. Why? Why should we adhere to such heresy,  considering that we have been dismantled and not yet put back together?  We have been stripped to our core, bare naked, and shivering, wondering  why me and told to put a little glitter on it — that new toy will fix  the other 364 days of pain.

I  often think about being a child in a home of abuse on Christmas days and  feeling like God was somehow taunting me. For one brief moment in time,  I would feel peace. I could never sleep as a child, and the slightest  rustle would wake me. I would wonder if maybe Santa had time to come by.  I would dream all the dreams that children like me would dream: *Maybe this will be the day that my real dad finally comes back, I sure hope our electricity works this month,* or the all-time classic *maybe mom will finally stop using those pills to hide from the world, in* the dark early hours of morning little girls and boys like me only dream of peace and safety.

4:30  am is far too young in the day for an eight-year-old to be awake. It  wasn’t curiosity that had my attention but fear. How do you sleep in a  house of torment?  But in this one quiet moment, as I stepped into the  hall and looked down the long corridor, there would be a tree covered in  lights and tinsel and bulbs. And in those steps towards the tree, I  would feel a sense of awe and happiness.

Then  reality would return. Only hours later, I would find myself on the  ground screaming in agony from another belt or fist against my flesh. I  would feel the fear of words resonating within my soul — *no wonder your real father left, oh you think you are the man of the house, stop crying, or I’ll hit you harder.*  But for one brief moment, as I walked down that hall and stood in front  of the tree and saw what presents Santa may have brought, I felt like a  child. I felt that feeling of something beautiful, like someone cared  about me, like life wasn’t torture or a trick wasn’t being played on me.  Then I would be back in the reality of hiding bruises, blacked eyes,  scorched skin, and secrets.

I  don’t much care for the idea that Christmas is the time of year for  family and friends to come together in the cause of exchange and in the  often dimmed light of truth. It’s a hard pill to swallow, yet we are  sold the idea that now is the most wonderful time of the year. It’s the  time that we come together, pretend that life is some wondrous bit of  joy, and leap into another year of sweeping reality under the rug.

For  some, Christmas was not filled with trauma and abuse, and I am not  envious of them. No, quite the opposite. I am thrilled for them because  that means that someone in their lives took the mantle of peace,  understanding, communication, and love. For the rest of us, I only hope  that we can step further into our truth and seek not only safety but  hope that one day we will no longer be on the backside of holiday cheer  but instead be at the forefront of happiness.

No  gift will replace what we lost, and that’s the truth and one that I  wish we did not have in common, but I know that in the reality of loss,  there is potential for gain. There is always the potential for hope,  love, happiness, and peace. There is still potential for creating the  family that you want, the relationships that you deserve, and the  holiday spirit as defined by you.

Until next time my friend…

1422,Anyone else just not capable of managing their mental health without a full night’s sleep?,"I have depression and anxiety. I’ve fully committed myself to keeping it under control for the past few years. One of the things that I HAVE to have is a full night’s sleep. It’s non negotiable. Fortunately for me, I get a full 8 hours every single night. Unfortunately, on occasion I’ll stay up a bit too late like I did last night. I went to bed at 11 instead of 9. I couldn’t sleep and ended up staying up until 3AM at least. Around 1AM the depression, anxiety and paranoia started setting in. I coped by watching YouTube videos until I was tired enough. I woke up at 7 and cried the entire time I was getting ready for work. I’m at work now and I’ve broken into tears at least 8 or 9 times today. I’m so overwhelmed. 

Tonight I plan on getting a full nights sleep and I’ll be fine tomorrow. But does anyone else have this drastic change in ability to manage their mental health if they don’t sleep enough? Just asking out of curiosity."

1424,I can’t help myself,"(I don’t know if this fits here but): I’m 13 and I’m more sensitive than other kids my age, this means a cry easier. My parents know this yet they still shout at me for little things, when I eventually tear up and cry the shout at me even more. I don’t understand if there’s a way for me to hold back crying?

TLDR: Is there a way for me to hold back crying (I’m more sensitive than others)"
1425,Is hitting yourself a form of self harm?,"I struggle with self harm in the past, but I stopped a while ago (8 years), but lately I’ve been picking up smacking myself whenever I get anxious/remember something embarrassing or something I did that I dislike (it can be from me thinking I said something hurtful or just me thinking I was weird).  It’s nothing hard enough to leave a mark but I’m stating to do it more often. I only do it when I’m alone, and I just give a quick smack to my face/forehead or arm."

This started like 2 or 3 day ago because I hit my head pretty hard. The sound was if  a coconut hit the floor but more of  a squishy sound. Ever since then I am becoming more paranoid that I am currently in a coma.To prove  a point, i was laying in my bed and I was staring spacing out and saw that the desk was in a weird perspective and then it distorted a for a second. Also, I had a nosebleed out of random I'm not sure if the fall had anything to do with that. I feel so tired and sleepy. I have a few break down already and i am slowly starting to revert back to my toxic and pitiful mindset. I apologize if nothing makes sense right now I have a headache that won't leave me."
1427,Everyone should learn ASL,"American Sign Language (or your areas equivalent) is a really useful tool to have, not only for the obvious reason, being able to effectively communicate with deaf, and hearing/verbally impaired people. I recently started relearning the basics of sign language because i want to make sure i can communicate effectively with people even with masks on, interfering with lip reading. My best friend decided to take it up aswell, and i am so glad she did. 

I was visiting with her and her s/o recently and had a panic attack triggered by sensory overload, my panic attacks have started making it difficult to speak and it gets to the point where i physically cant force myself to speak(this is a mentality thing not a breathing issue) this panic attack was the worst ive had in a while and the fact that i couldn't speak meant that i couldn't communicate what i needed in order to recover; This is where ASL came in. my best friend started with asking yes/no questions but that wasn't working very well for us so eventually she asked me to sign, this made such a huge difference for us and she was able to calm me down. 

Since then a few more of my friends have started learning a few words and the alphabet, and another friend of mine has started signing when they have panic attacks as well. I've taken up signing as i speak whenever i can in order to get used to it and I've found that its really helpful with my ADHD, where normally I'd be scratching or puncing my leg or arms when im understimulated, this gives me an outlet for the energy and gives me something positive to do that still stimulates my body as well as my mind. 

ANYWAYYYSSSS the moral of the story is signing=good! you may descover it helps you in ways you never realized, and it makes life just that much easier for those who rely on ASL to communicate."
1428,How can i stop being socially awkward around black guys?,"
I love black people. 

Ive had some traumatic experiences that have given me ptsd. 

I have so much anxiety around people especially black guys and all girls who are pretty. 

I dont think black guys are inferior in fact i feel inferior. Im so inferior that i dont deserve to live. 

I was buying weed from this group of black guys i ran into at a skatepark in hayward cali 4 or 5 years ago. They invited me behind the half pipe to smoke with them. As soon as i took the first hit someone sucker punched me in the back of the head. I ran. And they were so fast i dropped my backpack and they swarmed over my pack like hyennas. All of them had nicer clothes then me. Nicer jewelry etc. I also SUCK at fighting. Never won a fight in my life. 

What punctiated the insult was all my skater friends just watched and didnt do shit to help me. 

I was just coming on break at dominos so i walked a couple blocks to the skatepark to get bud. 

And in texas later i had a black best friend who fucked my girlfriend at the time and lied about it the whole time. We were both homeless and watching each others backs. 

I was selling psychedelics and promoting shows in tucson and was getting robbed so often i had to set up a fund for it. 

In brooklyn i got jumped for my phone and weed. 

This all threw me for a loop. 

Now i am scared of them...not always physically although theres that. 

But im scared of them like id be nervous arouns a hot girl or something. 

This makes me socially awkard and ive been told by black guys ive tried to hangout with that they thought i was a cop..or at best they asumed i was gay. It doesnt help that i think they are so cooool and dress fly and i theres the fear that they think im uncool or less than.

This either alienates people or puts me in physically compromising situations where im seen as a mark. 

How do i lose my trauma and talk to black dudes like they are normal fucking humans beings and i can stop having panic attacks around them. 

It doesnt help that all my hippie artist friends are on this racism crusade because i feel even voicing a concern makes me look bigoted. 

I just wanna heal from my trauma and just feel normal around cool looking young black bros. Help me. 

I love black people. The question is how do i love myself enough to be worthy to kick it without then kicking my ass or making the vibe awkward. 
The more i over think it the more awkward in gets. 

It feels like i was molested by guys. This ptsd is so real. I just wanna be comfortable. Ive scoured the internet for instruction manuels yet found nothing."
1429,Millennials and Gen Z have you felt burnt out in the year 2020?,"A lot has happened this year and it’s easy to understand how this can lead to people feeling burnt out and being unproductive when there is no surety of a future. I'm curious to find out what general difficulties or worries Millennials and Gen Zs have been facing physically and emotionally concerning social media, career growth, racial awareness, societal pressures, getting older and on and off bouts of productivity on top of being in a pandemic in the year 2020?"

Everyone thinks I'm this happy guy that's outgoing and it's satisfied with his life, and I feel like such a fraud because I'm just a sad kid who does absolutely nothing with his life.

I argue with my parents and cry myself to sleep almost everyday and I hate my life."
1431,Is my brother okay?,"I (21f) am worried about my little brother (15m). He's literally the sweetest, but things don't seem right with him. He's recently been failing multiple classes at a time and doesn't show any interest in doing homework. I think the only reason he's passing any classes is because my poor mother (who is currently the only one with a job in our house) stays up all night with him making sure that he studies. He gets horribly down/angry/sulking once you try to get him to do work. He has recently expressed no interested in higher education, as if he's given up.

I should also mention that ever since the pandemic started, he has put on more than 50 lbs. Kid is 6'4 and pushing 330. I'm a little more than worried, as he loves emo rap and talks about how he doesn't have any friends and doesn't need any. 

I just don't understand given that the rest of my family is extremely happy, driven to do well in school, is down to earth, and artistic and excited about life and the future. Meanwhile lil bro is stuck on the computer all day packing on the pounds. I really wanna help him but I just don't know how."
1432,I am lonely,"Hello all!

&amp;#x200B;

I would describe myself as quite normal, have an SO, a dog, a house, a job, both my parents alive and a brother. But I do not seem to enjoy much. When I think of doing something, like going out for a drink or dinner I mostly back out because I think I am not going to have a good time and most of the times I think I don't. 

I am diagnosed with a panic disorder since 2014 and have left my home town to study abroad since 2010. Leaving my hometown, I left behind most of my friends, just after a year after school ended, and in the Summer of 2011 I met my SO. She was a friend of a friend, whom I got to visit that summer in the island he studied in. We played together (with said friend) when we were in different countries, like we were still living next door. In the meantime, I have made friends where I studied, close people whom I shared a great deal with. They were family to me where my family was absent (mostly because of distance, nothing major between us)

This is where the SO comes in, in my second year of Uni and I am head over heels in love and start spending more and more time with her, still playing with my friend online (the SO playing with us, lol is for everyone) and still going out with my friends abroad, but I now recognize I started neglecting our relationships. From my part, I was giving less to them than what I was supposed to if that makes sense. They rarely mentioned anything apart from a time or two but I can see it clearly now.

This is 2014 and I having a panic attack after having a tattoo and got dizzy (people said it was a ""normal"" reaction of my body to the pain or my blood sugar got too low). I am now dropping out of my last year of Uni and coming back home. Throughout all this, the SO has been amazing and supportive, and still is to be honest.

I came back and realized most of my high school friends have stopped seeing each other, each found new people to spend time with, but once a year we would all gather and keep in touch. I found a local uni to finish my degree and made another great friend there, who I cherish today.

&amp;#x200B;

This is more or less my after school years. My biggest problem right now, which I am realizing day by day, is that I seem to not enjoy things. I think I do not enjoy being alone. It is like I am a Sim in Sims3, where they had that social bar and when it was low, they did not feel like doing stuff. I listen to music (have not really changed taste since school) and all the memories of those times come rushing back and I remember myself being more sentimentally active; being happy here and there, sad, angry etc. Most of the days now, I think I am flat, just OK or worse.

I do not enjoy being alone and I get bored often, I cannot entertain myself anymore like I used to, dropping in a game and forgetting about what happened inside the house. I sometimes feel the urge to go play ball, like I used to but I have grown fat and the only friend (the one I made when I came back from abroad) isn't into it. I know I want to spend more and more time with that friend but we have structured our life in a way that our job is the most important thing and we have less and less time in a week to have quality time (she has an SO too and most of the times we all get together).

I think I am stuck. Please send help.

TL;DR: I think I have not spent enough time with my friends when I should have had, and now this comes to bite me in the ass."
1433,Need advice. Genetics destroyed any chance I have of normalcy,"Born with a small dick.  4x4 on a good day.  Life is brutal because of it and if you think otherwise you are a woman or a man who was lucky enough to be born normal.

Not a day goes by that I don't see the signs all around me.  I'm not wanted.  No-one really wants someone like me so what's the point of all of this?  

This isn't a women-hating post because this is all just biology.  I'm hated due to factors out of my control.  I'm not going out trying to have relationships so that I'm not wasting anyone's time.  I'm aware that women fear meeting people like me.

I just don't get it.  What did I do in a past life to end up like this and how am I supposed to find a purpose if I'll never find someone who cares?"

1435,"Well, this is Awkward","

Just to be clear. I don’t want anyone’s pity and I acknowledge that the internet isn’t my therapist. 

I was debating to myself last night, whether to talk to a trusted friend about my feelings, or dump my shit on the internet. So, now I’m here. ADHD runs in my family and it’s pretty damn likely that I’ve got it. (However, I won’t refer to myself as a person with ADHD, as I haven’t been diagnosed and I don’t want to abuse the term). 

I struggle with all the “common” symptoms of ADHD, hyperactivity and inattentiveness, as well as severe mood swings and trouble regulating my emotions. But I can manage that decently well. It’s annoying, but manageable. 

The one thing that’s really been pissing me off for over three years now is that I just don’t do anything. I try to convince myself that I’m passionate about art. Painting, drawing, and creative writing mostly. Except I don’t DO any of those things. Basically, whenever people ask me what I do in my free time, I say “Art!”, which is a fat lie. I basically just sit around and do nothing. 

I can’t remember if I ever used to be passionate about art (I forgot to mention my absolute piss-poor memory) but it sure doesn’t feel like it. I don’t know if I’ve just lost interest in the things I love, or if I’m just a dumbfuck. 
I mean, I know I used to do stuff. I was quite the soccer player, and I didn’t despise social gatherings as much as I do now. Fuck, I can’t even read a goddamn book now, even if the book was, “How to Stop Doing Nothing With Your Life” 

I struggle with my personal / social identity too. What I think is so different from what I say, and every thing I say feels wrong. I’ve known for a while that I’m an introvert, but I’m almost wondering if my “extreme” introversion is actually a sign of a deeper issue.

In the words of Honey Sugarman from Bojack Horseman, “I can’t be with people and I can’t be alone”.

I don’t like being around people, but when I’m alone, I don’t do anything. 

I’m anxious about people’s perception of me, so that’s part of it, but I also just don’t care enough to do anything. And even if I find the motivation to create art, I hate the way it turns out. (I have the lovely traits of both procrastination and perfectionism. Thanks Mom and Dad). 

It’s not like I’m depressed. I don’t have anything to be depressed about and I can function just fine. I just don’t do shit, and my sense of identity is stupidly uncertain. I can force myself to hang out with people (though I don’t enjoy it), but I can’t even do things I’m supposed to be passionate about.

I would love to hear “Oh! Just take some pills and you’ll be back to your old art-loving self in no time,” but I know that’s not how these things work. 

It would be great if I could just find something to be passionate about, find something to do every day, but I just don’t. Videogames and social media will suffice I guess. 

I’m not afraid of being mentally ill, I’m afraid that I’m perfectly fine and this is just the way I am. I’m afraid that my entire identity has been crafted from a lie.

All of these “insecurities” are made 100x worse by Covid, with staying inside all day, and not having a job to pass the time, but at the end of the day I have no interests, and no identity. 

If you’re not smart, maybe you’re athletic
If you’re not athletic, maybe you’re nice
If you’re not nice, maybe you’re creative 

But I’m none of those things. Not particularly smart or nice or athletic or creative. 

I guess I just don’t know what to do. I’m nobody, really. It would almost be reassuring to hear that I’ve lost myself, because that implies that “myself” can be found. But  this IS me. I’m just unremarkable in every aspect, afraid of what people think of me, and too lazy to shape myself into somebody. 

How do I change when I can’t find the motivation to? Well, I don’t, obviously. 

I don’t really expect an “answer” or “solution”. I just have to get off my ass and do something with my life. 
I guess it just becomes a little more complicated when you don’t give a shit. 

I’m not really going anywhere with this, I just like to complain. It makes me feel better, and I don’t have to actually do anything! Incredible.

1436,When will I stop feeling like a failure?,"I am not doing well. Again.  


The holidays are always hard for me. In some ways, easier this year, as I can blame the pandemic to just NOT be around toxic family members. But I can't avoid everyone and it is hard to mask my mental illness on these bad days.  


I know I should be grateful, I have stayed gainfully employed this entire pandemic. I am living with extreme privilege compared to most people in my country. I still have a roof over my head, I didn't have to go back home or move in with the in-laws.  


I didn't even have to go back to a budget. I actually got a raise this year! I maintained a 4.0 GPA all year. I should be PROUD, with or without a pandemic. But, I'm not.

I am a social person. That is just me. When quarantine happened, it felt like everything just collapsed. I couldn't be with friends and family in person, I had to do my classes through zoom, and so many things have happened around that time. I think I finally hit a turning point this year when my mom got diagnosed with cancer. That was something that really got to me and forced me to finally start getting my life together so I can be able to support my mom. Before then, I wasn't eating well and I wasn't sleeping well. I wasn't in good shape to do really anything, but I started telling myself that I need to get better for my mom. She told me how strong I was and told me that I take for granted how strong I am. That inspired me to get better and get through what I am going through. As of right now, she is starting chemo and is doing well. Sorry this is very long. But I just wanted to say that this year is almost one and things are going to get better for everybody. I hope that everybody know that they are wanted and cared for if anybody is going through something, just take time because you will get out of it! You got this!"

1439,Worried about a friend,"Hello!

I was hoping if someone here could help me recognize some symptoms of bipolar that a good friend of mine might be having. I’m worried for her and want her to get help.

I’ve known her for about 10 years and she’s always been really overdramatic and lies about pretty big things. Like when we were in college she would tell everyone that she was getting her masters but then years later she actually got her bachelors degree. Recently it’s been worse though. She tells stories to our friends about times we would go out but she would either put herself places she wasn’t and put words in places that no one had said. Recently she was telling a group of our friends that we were drugged once which absolutely did not happen.

Also, she tends to be very aggressive when anyone tried to talk about this issue and says that we are in the wrong.

The biggest red flag is the situation with her boyfriend. He has cheated on her multiple times over the past few years (so she says) but always has an excuse to go back to him. It always happens the same way too. He cheats on her, they break up, she is really depressed for a while and then goes back to him without telling anyone.

There is a lot of things behind the scenes that I don’t know but what I see on the surface is very concerning. Again, it’s really hard to bring things up to her because she gets really aggressive when anything is brought up."
1440,"Really grateful for having a good day for once, I can't remember the last time I was actually feeling stable, let alone contented and being able to hold onto warm, happy feelings!","My first post here was a few days ago, trying to express my fear over COVID and the massive changes it's had on my own and other's lives. Two huge contributing factors to my mood - definitely more so than reading the news, has been my inescapable chronic pain and insomnia. The pain - a result of 2 prolapsed discs and 3 shattered/crushed vertebrae and painful, grinding degeneration in my hip - has reached the stage where I'm on the highest possible dosage an NHS GP can prescribe without a consultant's agreement - Fentanyl 25mcg/hr patches and liquid morphine. I'm on the NHS list to see a consultant specialist in pain management and have been since September, but the situation has gotten so bad that I'm planning on seeing one privately through the medical insurance my employer provides in January. This is only because my £100 excess is yearly from 1st Jan, so I'd rather pay for the year at the beginning rather than the end! 

Despite working in UK private medical insurance for 15+ years, it honestly hadn't even crossed my mind to seek help privately before a couple of weeks ago - I have a bad habit of ignoring my own health issues or downplaying them - so I know full well that I'll probably put it off even in January! Therefore, I've decided to tell my best friend about this plan (we've worked together all that time, even switched to our current employer from the previous one together, she also now lives only a few doors down from mine!) since she's like a sister to me so I know she'll kick my arse if I don't follow through and make the appointment! 

Anyway, something I was grateful for today was discovering  - when I was in severe pain after washing dishes and taking clothes out of the dryer  - that due to a delay in issuing my medication for the last couple of months I had a 'spare' two week supply of patches; 5 spare ones. This meant that I could apply a second one to see me through the severe pain I'm having now. I know it's not recommended, but as I work in medicine I do understand the risks and know that even doubled I'm on a low - moderate dose. And it helped. A lot. This morning I woke up in tears that became gasps for breath after trying to use the bathroom, and it felt like I was being sawn in half each time I rose or sat down on the sofa. Considering that my GP has referred me to the pain team specifically to increase my Fentanyl dose, along with replacing the morphine with stronger, fast acting Fentanyl lollipops, overlapping the 3 day slow release patches isn't that drastic/dangerous considering the tolerance I have to opiates. 

So that's the first nice thing, despite taking about 6 hours to notice the difference, I've had ONE FULL DAY of bearable pain! I cooked a French omelette, crispy bacon and toast and despite having very little appetite (normal for me!) just the fact that I could stand at the stove to cook, then wash the dishes without needing to sit down and recover first, made that omelette taste like the best meal I've had in ages! I've never successfully made a proper French omelette before either, so had a nice sense of satisfaction at accomplishing that! 

Next, I managed to make a fellow Redditor very happy by gifting them some books (plus a little extra treat!) from a fandom we have in common but she was unable to get due to her situation and location. I felt almost selfish doing so, it brought me so much joy hearing how excited and happy she is over the gift, even though we're complete strangers, pretty sure I was happier than she when she accepted my gift! Literally all day I've had a smile on my face knowing that, although I've been totally isolated apart from food and medicine delivery for the last year, I was able to give some happiness to someone else 😊! I donate to charity through direct debit every month, but knowing that I could make a particular individual happy with a personalised gift was an indescribable feeling! 

Leading on from the last one, it seems like I might have earned some karma (but again, the joy I got making someone else happy was a wonderful reward in itself!) because my boss showed up at my door with a HUGE hamper as a Christmas gift from the company - although the items were incredibly well chosen so I have my suspicions over who was really responsible for the hamper! Due to my health I've not been capable of returning to my job for over 3 years, barring a 3 month period after my brain injury/coma when I definitely pushed myself too hard and had to be absent again. I officially returned from extended sick leave in September, although I am yet to actually do any work whilst they firstly set me up to work from home, but now I'm not doing any work because I need to use up the accrued holiday before New Year! It was wonderful to see my boss, it was her day off and she brought her little dog to say hello too!

Lastly, and again the thought of karma crossed my mind, I had two shopping delivery mistakes made which turned out to benefit me! Amazon were meant to deliver a package but their driver didn't wait longer than the 10 seconds it took for my (severely disabled) butt to get to the entrance to my building, didn't attempt to call the phone number on my delivery instructions, then sat in his van ignoring me clearly standing at the open door at the top of the steps I'm not capable of walking down. Amazon support assured me that they will report this incident, give tomorrow's driver clear instructions when redelivering, and gave me a £25 credit on my account. 

As one of the items I'd ordered (a bottle of Prosecco) was intended for the delivery driver from my pharmacy  - the person who I've had the most contact with all year, a very sweet older man who always flirts and makes me laugh! - I had to order something else to gift him when he makes his last delivery to me before Christmas tomorrow. Luckily there's a few supermarkets and off licenses on Deliveroo in my area, so I placed an order for a bottle of red and one of white wine as they were all sold out of Cava/Prosecco, and only had £50+ bottles of Champagne! I also got myself some groceries, eggs, bread, milk, fresh fruit and bread as my next 'big shop' delivery isn't until January and my last was in November. 

My order arrived within 15 minutes, but when I opened the bag I discovered it definitely wasn't my order - to my complete shock there were TWO bottles of their premium Prosecco, along with some soft drinks and a packet of cigarettes. I don't smoke (not for over 18 months now, yaaay!) but this particular brand, Marlborough Gold, is £17.50, and as my brother smokes I'll give them to him and save him some money! Deliveroo support were kind enough to both re-order what I'd originally paid for, and told me to keep what had already been delivered. Considering it was around £70 worth of items, I definitely came off lucky in that situation! 

So, now I'm finally settled down after a more eventful day than I've had in ages, not in any pain, and I expect that for once I'll get a good night's sleep since I have happy thoughts and feelings rather than the misery of chronic pain, isolation, and feelings of uselessness that are my usual companions. I can also console myself in future by rereading this post, to remind myself that despite feeling utter despair just a few days ago (as in both my previous post here, and one I made on the chronic pain sub) that even when things seem so very dark and hopeless, there can be little moments of light and happiness which it's definitely worth hanging on to experience!"
1441,Sometimes I feel like my life is just a big series of mistakes,"I can think of so many things that I've done wrong in my life. I've missed important deadlines because of stupid reasons, I have been in extremely stressful situations where everything could have been alright if only I'd done a mundane thing a few months ago. At one point in the summer, I felt like my choice of university degree was a big mistake that had a huge influence in the decline of my mental health. It was a mistake to live with people I didn't like and have to deal with extreme social anxiety every time I walked in the kitchen and saw them. I dated someone and maybe even fell in love with someone that broke my heart so bad that it took me a full year before I could regain my self esteem and have a full month without breaking down because I felt abandoned. I've met some brilliant people in my life and my mistake was that I didn't let myself become close with them for fear of revealing too much and looking stupid of naive.  Almost everything I can think of is mistakes I've made.  And you know what? Almost all of them could have been avoided. Of course I could have seen the fucking deadline earlier. Of course I could have lived with different people. Of course I could have just rejected that guy. The thought that almost all of my anxiety could have been avoided if only I had made a different decision is just killing me."
1442,I think i've been seriously misdiagnosed with BPD,"So I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was a child (saw therapists, had CBT for ocd when I was 10, then was first prescribed antidepressants when I was 14) due to a really abusive upbringing.

Ive struggled my whole life getting &amp; keeping jobs (kept having really depressive phases) and I'm super sensitive and have issues regulating particular emotions (sadness, anxious &amp; dispair but never anger, or anything else and I'm rarely happy or experiencing joy) .

Ive made terrible choices when I was severely depressed back in 2014 becuase I just didn't care and ended up in debt and had to go bankrupt at 23.

I don't have relationships and won't talk to anyone anymore (completely isolated the last 4 years) because I don't trust people, due to me making friends with terrible people my entire life, and me excusing it for ages then realising that, oof, they aren't good people and they don't care about me or anyone around them and me pretty much gently phasing them out. (it's important to note thst those people have a patern of treating others really badly too - so it's not just something I've made up). I've never had issues making friends but I do (did) have issues seeing peoples true colours/intentions &amp; made excuses for horrible behaviours they had (I even had people say to me what are you doing - person x is not nice - what are you thinking?!) And I think that comes from my shitty childhood and wanting to people please and have people like me. Even to this day though, I would never say I hate any of them, they just aren't nice people in my opinion.

I got diagnosed with BPD after I started seriously self harming due to being chronically depressed in 2015, I was in a terrible friend group - they were always starting drama and fights over nothing with everyone, they were vindicitve, two faced, slept with each other behind each others backs and the ring leader who was the worst did have BPD. (no I'm not implying that everyone with bpd=bad, but she fit the reputation to the letter) and to top it off I was in love with that person that had bpd who was leading several girls on at the same time and playing with our emotions. So my emotional state was a complete and utter wreck.

Over the last few years ive started to realise that I don't actually fit with a lot of the diagnosis criteria;

\*I don't have a fear of abandonment and never have (nor do I behave in the love/hate push/pull ways).

\*I am completely fine being alone (it's a a bit lonely but not awful or anything)

\* I don't make suicidal threats

\* I'm not impulsive (although I do have an ED)

\* I'm rational and can see things from both mine and another person's perspective.

\*I don't have issues with severe anger, aggression or outbursts of any kind

\*I don't struggle with my identity &amp; know my core values and beliefs

I think that the psychologist that diagnosed me had lumped together various things and decided that meant I had BPD (I had recently come out as gay, had an awful friend group that made me severely depressed and constantly fucked with my mood, was self harming &amp; had debt &amp; depression).

I'm also getting frustrated with the BPD tag because no one at the mental health service I have is listening to anything I have to say, and I'm being dismissed and belittled constantly due ""having bpd"" . Apparently my depression and anxiety (that I have a Long history of are ""just a part of BPD"" and they completely removed them from my medical notes) no one is listening to me or what I say.

I recently asked to change an appointment time with a just started therapist who I met once, for like 40mins - she spent the entire time emotionally patting me on the head and talking to me like a toddler and kept repeating ""you're valid for feeling that way 😊"" as well as ""congratulating"" me for dealing with a situation in a rational way (which was so weird because that isn't something new, and really annoyed me (I didn't say anything to her) because it was so ridiculous). I asked to change the future appointment time so that I didn't have get public transport thsts packed with children (bad anxiety &amp; panic attacks, as well as CoViD anxiety) and the psychology team pretty much sad I'm ""being manipulative to avoid appointments and changing"" just because of ""my BPD"". I had one appointment with this woman for 40mins and spoke about family history. How on earth was me asking for a different time manipulative or not wanting to change?! I literally said I could do another day if they didn't have another time slot? And worse case scenario Im OK with going back on the waiting list until they have a suitable time. It doesn't make sense.

I genuinely don't think I have BPD - I don't behave like any of the stereotypes or diagnostic criteria and I'm extremely quiet, hate confrontation, can't stand people who lie or who are dishonest or manipulative (my mother was extremely manipulative/liar so I cannot stand people who do) I'm extremely anxious &amp; depressed. The literal only thing thst fits is some self harm, and emotional sensitivity (but not outbursts or impulsiveness). I think I might actually have ptsd or Avoidant personality disorder (which actually fits much better with my exact feelings &amp; situation), along with chronic depression.

I've even had staff on crisis lines literally claim from thin air that im being aggressive or angry with them - just because they know I have ""bpd"" and want me to act like that, they deliberately try to goad me in to being upset which is so disgusting - and when I don't behave or show irritation like they want, and stay calm and rational, they start putting on a show for their colleagues - including one person claiming I was apparently swearing at her?! (I recorded the call and sent it to the independent complaints people because I'm sick of being treated like this but I'm waiting to hear back. It's also a really common complaint in my area that the mental health service is atrocious)

What am I supposed to do when I'm already being lumped in the bpd=bad &amp; horrible, because the mental health clinic/therapist are all instantly dismissing anything I say - without knowing me. I've taken to recording everything now, in person or over the phone because no one has my back or can keep their shit straight.

I'm assuming I'm going to have to go higher up than them and ask for someone else who's not one of their staff to assess me before going forward? Because I'm starting to loose all hope and it's genuinely making me want to off myself. How am I supposed to get better and work on my issues when theyre treating me like utter shit purely because of a ""diagnosis"" that doesn't actually fit my symptoms. I feel like they essentially want me to lay down, do everything they say, and admit to being a shitty horrible person that caused all my problems by being manipulative and terrible (which doesn't even fit with my issues) and I won't, it doesn't make sense and isn't true. I know who I am, flaws and all and have no problem admitting when I'm wrong (even if it feels shitty) but I WILL NOT take responsibility for other people's actions or outbursts.

This is more of a rant I guess but I am so sick and tired of it. I clearly don't have it.

Its also made me really sympathetic towards people with actual BPD because the stigma and seeing first hand how they're treated by medical staff- I'm positive that not everyone with BPD is awful like they make out on the Internet and in person. Its utterly foul how some people treat those with it (one size fits all). If you're reading this and you have BPD - I'm not shitting on you or your diagnosis so please don't think I am. I'm just frustrated as heck because it doesn't fit me at all and I'm being treated like shit because of it."
1443,I need to relax but I have friends who are struggling,"Right now, I've got some things going on in my life, some fun and exciting while some is quite sad. I've been having up and down days really as I've got a lot going on in general but which makes it harder is that right now I have a suicidal friend. I really want to support her but it's so difficult, on top of the fact that I have my own things going on and I also then feel really guilty that I hate helping her because it makes me feel selfish. She has other people who support her which is great but unfortunately she lives in a verbally abusive household which due to weird laws, she can't currently get out of, without telling said abusive parents.

I'm really worried about her but I just need time to not worry about her. I need a day... when I'm not constantly worried shes going to harm herself. I need a day for myself but I feel guilty about that fact and I just don't know what to do."
1444,"Struggling with friends mental health, need advice.","My wife and I have been sharing a rental house with a friend for a couple years now.  He originally moved to where we were from another state to broaden his social network and career opportunities in a bigger city.

I’ve been suggesting seeing a therapist for his depression/anxiety but he would always give the run around.  Either he would say things like “I know what’s wrong, I’m working on it” or “I have XYZ, I’m fixing it myself”. Or some other variant of avoidance.  Despite me telling him he can’t self diagnose.

So after two years of this back an forth(I even started seeing a therapist to show him how effective it was for improving every day life) he finally did something extreme enough for me to have to intervene.

A couple weeks ago, he apparently massively misinterpreted a conversation he and I had about Polyamory and bisexuality.  It was basically me saying I support the idea of polyamory but having tried it several times in my wife and I’d relationship, that we decided to be monogamous and focus on our relationship.  The bisexuality conversation was along the lines of, it’s ok to not adhere to a label and to pursue relationships that are health and make you happy.

He then proceeded, the following day, to ask my wife, via private chat, if she would like to take their friendship to a more physical relationship.  She was, of course, very surprised by this and confused as to where it came from but politely informed him that she was not interested in him or that kind of relationship and that she and I are in a monogamous relationship with no interest of changing that.

He never said a word to me about any of this.  I had to go to him about it a day later, after discussing how to handle things with my therapist.  

So I talk to him and express that what he did was wildly inappropriate and was very disrespectful to both my and I’s relationship and to me, as his friend.  He appears to realize how badly he fucked up and apologizes.  I tell him he needs to see a therapist about whatever issues he’s having around not understanding social ques or boundaries.  This leads him to a zoom call with a psychiatrist who prescribed him Gabapentin.  

So he gets on this stuff and is wavering between normal and manic.  He’s had a tendency towards grandiose claims without having done the work and not even being able to explain the concepts behind his world changing ideas in any understandable form.  Such as cracking the grand unifying theory of physics by next week Bc some obscure paper came out that had some interesting info he doesn’t really understand.  A constant positioning himself over us, intellectually.(Wife is a couple credits away from a BS in physics w/minor mathematics and astronomy) 

So I made it pretty clear that I need him to show me in good faith that he’s seeking treatment and help.  Bc anxiety wasn’t what caused his proposition, but he’s trying to claim that now he has meds that he’s better.  But has been actively “searching” for a therapist with no luck.  Yet his insurance network is one of the largest insurance networks in the world.  It’s been two weeks and he says nobody has reached back out to him.  

I’m at the point that I want to fully disengage and move on with our lives when our lease ends this summer.

He’s a genuinely kind and good person and we’ve been good friends for years.  But his aloofness about getting help and quickness to accept praise for ideas he hasn’t executed, is wearing thin.  

What the hell do I do?"
1445,Bully payback help,"My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn’t even know.
Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said “do the world a favor and go kill yourself” as well as “when I find you it’s gonna be the fucking end of you” as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I’m guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won’t stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. 
It’s mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She’s been constantly tired. I’m trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won’t and isn’t doing well. I think she’s really overwhelmed and it’s getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. 
This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!
With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served."
1446,I started cutting,"Trigger warning this is a a true story about me, and deals with some heavy shit if you’re not ready to hear about it please don’t read this. My whole life I’ve been depressed, that probably isn’t true but it feels like it. As far back as I can recall I’ve been unhappy with myself. It all started when I was 10 and a man who I’ll call J came into my life.he was my mother’s boyfriend, and I quickly learn that his sexual interests extended past my mom and to me. After a mouth of him being in my life the light assault turned to full blown rape ever other day. He was a alcoholic and at the time so was my mother, meaning she never noticed it happening. And for some reason I never tried informing her of it, to this day she still doesn’t have any idea of the mental, sexual, and physical abuse I went through on a daily basis. I think I don’t want to tell her because I’m embarrassed of it, but that’s besides the point. His magnum opus of abuse was during a holiday. Every summer when I was a kid we would try to leave our city and go somewhere nice to relax. This instance we decided to go to a place called Vancouver in Britain Columbia Canada. My mother and brother came along with us but we got separate rooms, my brother with my mom and me with J. One night he drove back after a long night of drinking and cheating on my mom. He was absolutely hammered. He came to my room and woke me up and said he wanted to “play a game”. I knew what this means it’s his code word for fucking me. I don’t know what time it was exactly but outside it was quite blue. So it must of been 3-5 in the morning. Needless to say I wasn’t really that exited to “play” but I knew if I said no I would get beaten, so I without saying anything stood up and got ready. Without going into to much detail he started making me suck his cock, I instinctively started biting down due to the pain it caused. He ripped me off and started yelling at me about how he’s going’s to kill me but not before he rapes and murders my mother in front of me. He stormed out of the room and I thought maybe I got away with it, but a minute or so later he comes back in with a knife, pins me down and presses it to my chest. He tells me that I’ll finish what I started or he’ll rip my heart out. (I’m sorry if I rushed true that but it’s difficult to talk about for me) And so I did. After that instance I didn’t talk for a mouth, but the abuse didn’t stop. One day well I was sitting alone on the playground I got called to the office and I was informed that J had overdosed and died. You would think this would make me happy but for some reason I felt attached to him, like it was my fault he’s dead. Since this whole ordeal I was never the same, in a Attempt to feel better about myself I started eating. It was my only coping method, I had no friends and I definitely couldn’t talk to my family about it as my mom was still in love with J. So I got fat and as soon as the abuse at home stopped the abuse at school started, I was called balloon boy and many other insults and slurs. Then high school started, I was never very smart so I was put in a “bridging class” basically I wasn’t dumb enough to go to a special school, but I wasn’t smart enough to go to normal classes. The good news was I actually started making friends we would skip class and smoke weed and talk about all the women we fucked when we all knew none of us have even had our first kiss. Somehow these kids got me involved with the “cool kid” and this is most likely the worst thing to ever happen to me. Two people stood out from the rest of them I’ll call them joe and John. Joe stood out because of how nice he was to me, instantly I felt like he could be my best friend. But John stood out because of how much he reminded me of my now deceased stepfather. Immediately he started abusing me he would had to hangout with me just so he could get me drunk and start beating me, anytime I would find I woman I like he would go tell her horrible lies about me or make a fake account with my name and message vulgar racist things just to make sure I couldn’t be happy. No joke at one point he told Joe that the reason he was so awful to me is because he thought it would be funny if I killed myself because of him. This continued for years up to the recent quarantine, I thought it was all over. This was my last year and if I never had to go back to school I would never have to see him again. Life for a while was good my mom stopped drinking and stated smoking weed. I got a new step dad and he’s great and my mom even started buying me weed. After about a mouth of being trapped inside with my mother I started to open up to her about what I’ve been feeling and I got put on medicine to help with my adhd depression and my anxiety. But this moment of happiness would last as we after a bit went back to school, it seems that John wanted to make up for lost time of abuse. And it ramped up tenfold, it was also at this time I found out that my stepdad cheated on my mom and with my mom having a void were he used to be she filled it with liquor. And so did I there was so much booze in the house she would notice if I stole some, and I became very dependent on it. It was around this time my suicidal thoughts started getting heavier. And to top it all off Joe my best friend overdosed and died at 17 years old. And that leads us to now. I started cutting not just cutting but burning myself with a lighter  punching brick walls and a multitude of other ways to hurt myself. My suicidal thoughts are only getting worse and I have no one to talk to. If you made it this far than hopefully you can help me with my problems I don’t even know why I hurt myself, it’s just makes me feel a escape. I am concerned that one day I’m going to kill my self and I don’t know what to do."
1447,This is the hardest thing I’ve ever dealt with.,"I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression a few months ago and this has to be the hardest thing I’ve gone through. I have a number of chronic issues, but dealing with my mental health disorders blows those out of the water. I don’t even know myself anymore. 

Does this get better?"
1448,Don’t know what I’m doing with my life,"I have a long history of depression and anxiety, but I just feel like it’s always 1 step forward and 2 steps backwards. I feel I’ve developed trust and anger issues and my patience is running low now and I just don’t know what to do and I fucking hate my life. I’m a 21 year old virgin, I feel like a constant loser and I have ‘friends’ who I can’t lose ties with and they just make me feel even worse about myself. I’m very introverted so I find myself to be quite shy and secluded, but all my family aren’t and this is just adding to my problems as the older I get the less I feel I have in common with my family and I feel anxious when I have to come home for the holidays, and I hate that I feel this way. I’m just lost and need some direction in my life, because I don’t know where I’m gonna end up if I don’t act and I’m scared.

1449,How to help someone help themselves?,"Hey, I know someone who is going through a really tough spot. They are inconsolable and depressed and I don’t know what to do. About a week ago I thought we were going to have to take them into a mental hospital. Now they are having another episode and I’m at a loss. 

They went to a therapy session the other day and the therapist suggested walking or deep breathing if it happened again. I tried to remind them and offered to do it with them but they said no. They are really stuck in their own thoughts and it seems like nothing I do can help them get out. I also suggested journaling but that’s apparently what started this episode. Do you guys have any advice? I’m doing what I can and trying to be empathetic but I’m feeling pretty helpless. Also if this isn’t the right place to post I’m sorry."
1450,Mother told me I’m the reason my brother tried to commit suicide,"Me and my mother were arguing when she said that because me and my brother use to argue sometimes that I’m the reason he tried sucide, I’ve been worked up and depressed about that for a while and I don’t know what to do."

These last year's I just lived but had not dreaming or any at all. But now I got dreams and hope, I want to explore the future. And I'm so happy because of that. Although this pandemic is slowing down my process. But still, I feel so happy that I made this progress in my life. I finally feel like I'm going back to be that happy girl I used to be.

1452,Need to get this out to somebody,"Hello, this post may be a little long but I need to get all of this out, and hopefully get some advice and support. It taken me about 3 days to work up the courage to post this, even anonymously because I'm hugely embarrassed about the issue. 
So here goes - suffer with several mental health disorders, I guess the ones relevant to this story are an eating disorder, body dysmorphia, anxiety and depression. 
So I didn't have the best of childhoods, I suffered a lot of abuse and spent my teen years largely depressed and suffering from frequent panic attacks. I began university, and also began the worst 3 years of my life. I lived my degree and I lived my friends, but I fell extremely unwell suffering with an autoimmune issue and and bulimia. Surfing all of this, I experienced a lot of suicidal ideation and honestly, never expected to get this far in my life and so I didn't take very good care of myself. As a result of this, my dental hygiene is very very bad. I experienced binging and purging during the height of my eating disorder, as well as suffering with grinding my teeth for many years on and off. 
Due to all this, as well as not very good during my childhood, I now have very yellowed teeth, several with holes forming. Two of my back teeth have cracked with parts now missing of them and I'm not certain but I think my gums may actually be receding. I'm so embarrassed and ashamed. In the last year I've made a tonee of progress, I'm eating healthier and I feel healthier, mentally and physically. However, this problem is severely messing with the stability I have, my body dysmorphia is extremely heightened and I'm worried I'll relapse with my eating in order to compensate for how I feel about how my face/teeth look. I'm scared and embarrassed to see the people that I know (when we are allowed to) and so agoraphobic tenancies have set in again. I feel so lost and stuck.
I don't have a dentist, I haven't for as long as I remember. I'm terrified and embarrassed and ashamed to find one. On top of that, in the UK I knkow you have to pay for dental care, I'm currently studying a masters degree, and my money is either spent on thing I need to complete more or course or helping to support my two younger siblings as my mum has arthritis and lost her job during the pandemic. I assume the work I'd need done is extensive, and I just can't afford the luxury.
I'm just looking for any sort of advice anyone has, because I currently feel lost and hopeless and I'm worried that I'm spiralling, I don't know what to do.
Sorry this is so long, thanks to those who've taken the time to read.


TDLR - I have many mental health issues, many of which contributed to poor dental health. I'm embarrassed and ashamed and I don't think I can afford the work I'd need done. I feel like it's all causing me to spiral"

I’ve been dealing with depression for a long time now and now that I’m old enough to go to appointments alone I’ve decided to seek out treatment. 
For those who attend counseling to treat depression what was your experience like? Did you see a general physician and ask for a referral or did you just find a counselor yourself and set up appointment? 
I know this is a basic and somewhat dumb question but this is a big step for me and I can’t really talk about this with anyone in my life so any advice would be appreciated"
1454,How to become comfortable with exposing my self-harm scars when out in public?,"For those who have stopped SI, how did you become comfortable wearing t-shirts (and not long sleeves) in public settings?  

My scars have had years to heal and I’m out of that dark place now, but even during the warmer months I wear long-sleeved clothing when going out in public. I’ve gone out sometimes with my partner wearing just a t-shirt and nobody remarked or seemed to notice, but I was uncomfortable the whole time and really want to work on that.  

I’ve seen others before with visible scarring and it always makes me feel so proud of them for having that courage, but I haven’t gotten to that point myself.    

How did you “stop caring” what others might think and gain that confidence in yourself? Has anyone ever commented negatively about your scars or are most people understanding about it?"
1455,I don't know who I should talk to,"Hey guys!
I (21) have struggled with my mental health since puberty and 2015 I met a girl that has been my best friend since then. She struggled too, but we told each other everything that was going on. I generally have the urge to talk about anything that's going on in my life but I felt like it didn't bother her because she told me as much about her life. We live in different cities now but up until about a year ago we still texted all the time and talked about everything. She now has new friends to whom she talks about her problems (which is obviously completely fine) but since she doesn't tell me much about herself anymore I feel like a burden when I tell her about my struggles. I have a boyfriend but although he never complains about having to listen to me he's not the best person to talk to when it comes to emotions. I have other friends here but since corona I didn't stay in touch with them.
So my struggle now is how to cope with not being able to tell my struggles to someone since I always used that as an outlet and a coping mechanism.
This btw is an example of me having to tell someone about a struggle I have and I do feel kinda guilty about wasting your time with that. But thanks to anyone who reads think."
1456,What the fuck is going on?!?!?!?,"Am I real? Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?Am I real?      Does anything even matter???

Is this world real? Why must I suffer? Why am I writing this?!!??!??!"
1457,So I have been suffering from loneliness/anxiety and cannot stop ruminating and my therapist is on break...,"I’m not in crisis or anything but I’m finding that I’ll be ok with something one day/minute then I’m obsessing over it again thinking of all the negative aspects and outcomes. Usually I’d talk with my therapist but they are on break...

What can I do to get my head to chill the hell out? I’ve tried keeping myself busy but it is still like its running on auto pilot. Like my brain keeps looking for things like “look look! We didn’t think enough about this!” Or “yes we did establish that your ok with this... but what if?” All with the whole negative focus... like my brain wants me to be in a constant state of anxiety and fear...

I want to be there for my family more since they need someone to help cheer them up and I’m trying my best to be there for them."
1458,I feel as if I'm approaching a dead end,"I suffer from pdd, moderate, anxiety, insomnia and PTSD and I am just stuck. I gradually am feeling myself slip further and further into my fucked up head, ive tried therapy, meds meditation, faith and I havent made it to an appointment I scheduled for any of my shrinks since February; and not for a lack of trying I've had an appointment at least once a month since, I just am way too good at talking myself down. 
I'm not in any danger of killing myself yet; too much of a pussy to be honest, put the gun both literal and proverbial to my head on many occasions and just couldn't pull the trigger. I am however burning bridges with my family, if I end up on the streets I dont know what I might be capable of.
I'm hopeless and the only reason I'm still trying is because praying every day to a God that doesn't listen so someone else kills me is no way to live. I talked to my shrink over the phone the other day and because I've missed so many appointments im not even going to be able to go back to them so I guess I'm just kinda desperate. 
I want to stress that I am not going to hurt myself, I feel like I'm past that point, but not particularly in a good way; im complacent I'm my misery, cozy and comfortable even.
I don't know if I want to vent or if I need advice."
1459,A friendly reminder just for you.,"Hey you,

Just thought I'd offer you a friendly reminder. We're going though hard times due to the pandemic, and holidays can be pretty stressful as well. 

I just wanted to remind you to go easy on yourself. It's not the end of the world if you don't slave over your oven. It's no biggie if you can't afford swell gifts, you have a lot of offer and lots of love to give. Do yourself a solid and take a little break. You deserve it. 

Are your needs being met today? Did you take some time to care for yourself? Did you get some rest? 

And if you feel like no one gives a fuck, you're wrong. I do and I wish you well.

Stay safe and take care of yourself, friend."
1460,I can’t stop biting my tongue...,"As the title reads I can’t stop biting my tongue. I’ve always have had this problem but mostly with sleeping and me grinding my teeth. But recently I’ve been biting my tongue more and it’s just not during my sleep it’s throughout the whole day. It’s like I’m more aware that I’m doing it and end up biting it more or just making it worse. 

If you have any tips on how to break this cycle I would greatly appreciate it. Please I can’t stand it anymore my tongue is so sore."
1461,Tips on hiding depression over the holidays?,"Obviously Christmas is coming and I'm going home for a week. I know I'm super lucky to be able to when many people are locked down at home alone. But my depression is just so bad right now. I have sought help and just started therapy but I'm not doing well. I can barely fathom the idea of spending a week constantly around other people. I know I want to see my parents I guess just not like this. They don't really believe in mental health issues either, or at least not that I have a problem - several years ago when I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and given meds my mom got mad at me for taking them, told me they were going to ruin my life, everyone has bad days, you're fine just need to be happier, etc. The other thing is that her only sibling, my aunt, died of (I think) an intentional overdose right before Christmas and I know it must be a hard time even though she doesn't really talk about it too much. So I also don't want to ruin the holiday and leave them worrying since I live in another city by myself.

Basically I just need to seem happy for a week, but that seems like a monumental task when I'm really struggling to do basic care things like shower and eat. I was just hoping someone here might have some advice, thanks if anyone reads all this."
1462,Another loved one died today. I should be sad but I can't feel my emotions anymore,So exhausted. I usually cry a bunch and I can't even cry. I don't feel anything at all and I used to feel so much. So many loved ones died this year.
1463,Help with finding help,"I've got a lot of mental health issues that have been going on for a year and a half. I have severe germaphobia, phonophobia, hypochondria, high anxiety, depression. I've tried regualr talking therapy and it didnt help. I was wondering your opinion on clinical hypnotheraphy? And if you think it might help could you point me in the direction of finding a good one in kansas? I'd prefer to do telehealth as of now since I don't leave my house."
1464,I can't stop eating my skin,"I've been eating my skin since I was 6, and I can't seem to stop. I even do it without noticing. Im 14 now, and I'm so scared to shake hands with people of even wave. My mom just passes it off as a ""Bad Habit"" but I don't really know. Any help about this would be heavily appreciated."
1465,I'm crippled by a fear that I'll always be alone and that nobody will ever love me,"I feel like every day I grieve the loss of a relationship that I've never even had. I'm only 18 and I know that it's young, but I have this deep ache in my chest when I think about love. I can't watch sappy romances, I can't see cute couples together, without feeling genuinely sick with jealousy. I'm desperate to have somebody who will love me, but I'm terrified I'm never going to get it. At 18 I'm completely inexperienced - never even held hands romantically. I'm (F18) gay but not out to my parents for various reasons, and so I can't possibly try to be with a girl when I would have to force her to be hidden. I don't want her to think I'm ashamed just because I'm not out to my parents and can't be open. I don't know how to kiss, how to do anything more than that. I don't even know how to date. How do you be in a relationship? I have no idea. I'm so fucking unstable and I can't see a happy relationship for me in the future. I've fucked my relationship with my mum, with so many of my friends, and as much as I crave a relationship with somebody I just don't think anybody would be able to love me. I feel sick thinking about a future where I'm all alone. I'm terrified."
1466,"Dreading a return to normalcy, normal or nah?","I recognize that this is a very privileged take. I am in no way trying to speak on behalf of the rest of the world - and in no way trying to belittle human suffering and death due to Covid-19. 

Perhaps this internal conflict is why I am struggling/posting.

 I am literally dreading a return to personal normalcy after Covid-19 (which I know will come eventually). Right now it's not an issue where I am, we are headed for a 14 day lockdown after Christmas. But imagining things being busy and crowd again bothers me. Imagining not working from home bothers me. Even imagining people not wearing masks bothers me. And it's not the virus. I have just begun to really really enjoy the peace and quiet lately - and having little social obligations. I've taken most of my social media down during Covid and I've reduced the data on my phone contract (which I am soon buying out of entirely).   


Reddit, what the fuck is wrong with me? Everyone else around me loathes the pandemic and is having such an awful time with isolation (with good reason, I don't want to minimize any of those valid negative feelings). I, however, can not seem to get enough space lately."
1467,Family that is constantly making comments about whatever I'm doing.,"Does anybody else have family that seems to always be analyzing whatever you're doing, and always has to make comments about it?
Like, what time I wake up is a topic in the morning. 'Sleeping in late today?' or 'up early huh?'
Another thing is food related, which as somebody who is in ED recovery really bothers me. When I'm looking through the cabinets, it's always 'making a grocery list? figuring out what to eat?'
Like I don't understand why they feel the need to have to say anything about any of this. It's all such miniscule stuff that doesn't relate to them at all! It makes me so irritated and bothered, I wish people could just worry about themselves. It's makes me feel very watched constantly and like there's always somebody breathing down my neck."
1468,Psychiatrist wants me on SSRI's but I don't think I need meds?,"So I have untreated PTSD. I have Depression and Anxiety as a result of the Traumatic events I've gone through. I've learned to help myself as best I can, and I'm no longer suicidal nor have a drug abuse problem. I in all honestly just want some therapy, and maybe a sleep aid. Psychiatrist had some talk with my family doctor, and she didn't tell me which SSRI she wants to put me on, but she said she would rather have me on meds and offered little info about the chance of getting Therapy. Any input?"
1469,Another loved one died today. I should be sad but I can't feel my emotions anymore. Is this wrong?,"So exhausted. I usually cry a bunch and I can't even cry. I don't feel anything at all and I used to feel so much. So many loved ones died this year.

I guess this is a good thing that I don't feel anything anymore?"
1470,Could I Reach Out to Somebody?,"Instead of venting through a text post in hopes of getting a response, I’m wondering if I could message someone directly. I just have a bit I want to get off my chest. It won’t be long. Is anybody willing to listen?"
1471,Why do I feel like this isn't reality,"I have always felt like there was something missing.
I now know what. I don't feel real. If i look in the mirror I don't feel like this is me. I feel like a doll or idk. It's a very weird feeling. I don't feel that am me. I feel like am 2 different people. I don't feel like am humen. If I look in the mirror and see my face I just get nervous those teeth and skin and hair is that mine. Is my body mine. I feel like there is someone else controling me just like a doll. Those are crazy thoughts but I just can stop thinking. I always wonder how I move my fingers and legs. I get also really nervous if I look at my fingers and toes. ARE THOSE MINE.
Can somebody explain this?"
1472,I don't know wtf is going on,"Throwaway because a lot of friends and family know my real account

&amp;#x200B;

I'll provide some context. I have basically been a straight A student my entire life, up until junior year of college (I'll come back to this). Because of my good grades and such, I got a really nice scholarship to a university there is no way my family could afford otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to the issue at hand: I have basically just failed my first semester of senior year. I am writing this post because I legitimately have no idea what's going on with me. I am able to get A's and B's on exams usually after lengthy periods of studying that often end in all nighters before the exam. But when it comes to regular assignments, shit as mundane as problem sets and discussion questions, I absolutely break down. I don't know why but I cannot bring myself to just sit down and work on them, and when I do, I usually spend hours on them because I end up getting distracted by everything. I can't fucking believe I just failed a semester of college because I did not turn in fucking homework assignments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I first started having trouble working on stuff my junior year. I realized I was really starting to struggle in just sitting down and finishing my shit in a timely manner. This led to me passing classes with C's because I basically didn't turn in half of the homework assignments. I talked to my academic advisor about it and he was puzzled as well, because I still seemed to be doing really well in exams and projects and whatnot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've given a lot of thought to wtf this is. It's weird because besides this, everything else about my life is going well; I am able to enjoy my hobbies and the company of my friends and family. 

&amp;#x200B;

To anyone that got this far, sorry for the mess, I just don't even really know what to say. Any advice or questions are welcome because I really need to figure this out before it gets worse."
1473,How to deal with my postpartum,I have been blessed with the best baby on earth and she is my whole world. But ever since she’s been born I’ve been having horrible panic attacks and horrible anxiety whenever I leave my house or have to do anything. I’ve had suicidal thoughts and really bad depression and I don’t understand why it’s so bad. I can’t remember things and I’m usually in a fog and I just feel like I got dumber after having her. I lost my identity in a way. I don’t know who I am anymore. And none of my friends talk to me anymore. My mom I try to keep distance between because she’s so controlling but I have either pushed everyone away or they’ve pushed me away. I am in a hole and I don’t know how to get out of it. And that I just get so angry that my fiancé won’t be doing practically anything and I just treat him like shit and I don’t know why and I want to fix it but I just get so angry with him. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. I feel toxic I just wanna be the best me I can be for my family but I don’t know how to be that person.
1474,“Stupidity of the world “,My eldest sister and I at the dinner table were having a civil conversation about the difference between chewing and eating and my father unprovoked says “ I really hate It when you guys discuss the semantics of things it makes me feel like you guys are following the wrong things going along with the stupidity of the world that’s how I feel that’s how I feel” with an agressive tone of voice for absolutely no reason. This is why my siblings and I never discuss anything around our father and never tell him anything because all he ever does is complain and tell us to shut up. It makes me so upset
1475,How do I study or be productive while depressed?,"I have nothing to look forward each day. I kind of have people that stand my presence, but I don't know if I can call them friends. Never been with anyone, and will probably die alone as well, because I'm fucked in the head, diagnosed AvPD and depression, along with suspected narcissistic traits, though I don't believe the latter is right.

All well and good, but all I feel like doing is rotting away in my bed, but I'm a college student and should be getting ready for finals right now. I was the same in high school. It feels like I'm trying to fool myself, like it doesn't matter anyway since I'm such a worthless piece of shit. Yet I know that all I'm doing is making life harder for myself later on.

If anyone has any tips on how to shut off your internal monologue and stop wasting time I'd be happy to hear it."
1476,I don't know how to help my sister,"I am 18 and am back home from collage. I have a little sister who is 12 that I am super close with. She has had bouts of sadness in the past, and I have usually helped just by talking to her. But we just had a conversation, and she admitted to hurting herself a bit, nothing major just minor slaps her arms and stuff. She said she does this whenever she feels like she messed up, which she says is often.

When I asked if she thought she might do worse, she said no, but she has thought about it a lot. I told her to always come to me to talk whenever she feels like hurting herself, but I'm scared of what will happen when I go back to collage. The only reason she talks to me about this stuff is because she trusts me, and I don't want to lose that if I tell our parents.

We can't really afford to seek professional advice, and we live in an isolated area, so even when covid is gone, my sister won't get out of the house much. I know this was a bit all over the place, but I am seriously worried about my sister and really need some help."
1477,How do you find a way to be motivated when your depressed?,I haven't been motivated at all. My depression hasn't been doing great lately and my angry mother isn't really helping. My room and washroom have been a complete mess and just seeing all of this crap piled up is making me more stressed out and upset. As much as I want to clean all of this stuff up I just can't leave my bed. It's hard for me to do anything. I haven't even been eating much lately. Is there anything you do that helps you get motivated to do something when your not feeling your best?
1478,Try New (70),"Trying. If something isn't working, try somewhere else. There are always other options to share. There is no point in waiting ""to catch on"". Their is brighter waiting for you. 

December 21. We have shifted. For Good. It is our time. Our time to end the year in the strongest way we have in our life. If you need rest, give yourself rest. If you want to start working on something come January, write them down now. If you are going hard until the hard year, keep on the gas. It will all pay off. We are all different. We must remember that.

The skies are Grey out today and thats ok, another chance to find the sunshine inside, even for just a moment, if so, we have won today. A moment where we sit there and say thank you for life, for what we have been given and for what we have. Its so easy to think in the future and what we want; yes, its good to set goals, to set intentions but everything is only available for what is who you are now. 

Living as a trans person, there are many times throughout each day that make me think, why? who am i? why is it difficult to be understood? 

I have learned in the recent days that the **only** person that needs to understand us, is our oneself. Isn't that beautiful though? Out of close to 8 billion people in the world, we are the only ones that truly know who we **TRULY** are. Thats pretty beautiful to me. Of course these realizations have taken me my whole life and I am constantly connecting with it more and more each day. Emotional Intelligence &amp; Resilience. Knowing that everything we are enduring and that we are living through is for our Highest and Greatest Self. Take the goods, the bad's and the uglies and use them to your advantage. It is meant for you in this present moment but even that will pass. I know it. We are divine. Together, Separately.

Today: Give yourself a hug and say out loud ""I CAN"", because I know you can. Wishing you well.

Oh ya and go listen to my new podcast on Resilience. Episode 12. Here are a few links for them.

1479,Opinions,"Would any of you say it's an OCD symptom that I'm unable to relax enough to let myself daydream or talk about stuff to my mom because I feel this constant need to over analyze my feelings and thoughts? It's like I feel the need to rush to my journal and keep my thoughts in check, or say a prayer to God for a sound mind (like I've done every day now), or just lay down and meditate and try to get my mind right. I've been sitting in the park for the last 3 days just journaling and trying to make this all make sense. I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know if that's like a 'losing control' kind of symptom or what."
1480,Is it nor normal to have a manic episode at night to the point where it drains so much energy to the point where I pass out and sleep for the rest of the next day?,I do not have bipolar I have adhd(I think we experience that as well)
1481,"Help, I don’t know what’s wrong with me.","17 days ago today, I was at a small gathering with my mates. We had a few drinks and I had a few pills from one of their e-cigarette. I’ve only started drinking since this summer and have only drank about 3 times so far. I had a pull of one of their vapes containing THC-E-cigarette juice and I had a huge panic attack. I instantly felt dizzy, weak, felt like I was about to collapse. I genuinely felt like I was dying. I really did. I researched this and it had to of been a panic attack. I was up all that night I didn’t sleep I was panicking and crying. Since then I’ve been having trouble breathing especially at night. It feels like my nose is not getting as much air into my lungs as normal. Feeling blocked a lot of the time. I cannot stop yawning all day and its not because of fatigue or tiredness. I keep needing gasps of air every 15 seconds or so. I’ve researched that THC leaves ur system after 7-14 days and it’s been 17 days as I type this. I’m genuinely worried and I really need some answers.

In conclusion, I’m having breathing difficulties since, after the panic attack. Had thc and alcohol that night. I’ve tried vicks inhale cream. 

PS. It is not COVID-19 I considered that a factor and got tested and tested negative."
1482,Am I having an identity crisis?,"Hey guys, how are you doing? I am 17, I'm a guy. Since about summer of last year there's been a lot of changes in my life such as starting college and some family problems. Lately I've been feeling very confused with my place in this world, what I want to do in the future and who I really am. I've been in my head a lot and have had so many ups and downs in the last year and a half. Its just crazy how so much has changed recently in my life and I'm kinda freestyling life now.

 Prior to this, at 14-15, I started dabbling with alcohol, weed, other stuff (anything I could get my hands on). Graduated to trying other drugs and did a bit too much LSD for a short period of time (like a month). Kinda hate it now lol. And now I haven't done much drugs and I feel so empty. It might sound a bit stupid (considering I never did so much drugs that I was addicted or nothing) but I always feel the urge to do some type of drug just to feel different and I feel like the potential for a drug problem is developing (if that makes sense). Now you may be thinking why even mention this, well I don't know if my minor drug use is affecting my feelings of not really knowing who I am anymore. On the day to day I get on pretty fine, minor anxiety here and there, but other than that I manage to maintain a few friendships and kinda keep my family together at home.

Another thing I want to mention is that my circle has grown much smaller (not really a bad thing to be honest) but as a result, I have more time alone and I just think a lot. When I'm alone and not with my friends I start to think about who I really am and I sometimes feel a bit sad. I feel a bit lost in general. I feel like I was a different person when I was around my friends before. Also, my parents are more distant now and there's so much subtle tension between them. Like my dad started cheating on her last year and everyone's just been quiet about it. He's now an alcoholic and my mum is a completely different person now. It's like she's half of what she was. Just seems so much sadder, calmer and done with everything. Its just a bit sad to see my mum like these. My sister and I are kind of used to it now which is the worst thing. I have adapted to feeling this emptiness inside of me and it has just become the norm. My drug use accelerated since then, I have lost interest in many things in life and don't really know what I want to do in the future. Who am I really man? Just don't know what the fuck I am feeling anymore."
1483,"Free - I wrote a book how I overcame bipolar, anxiety, paranoia and giving it away for free"," As we come closer to Christmas day, I have decided to give my book on how I overcame mental health issues away for free.

The book can be downloaded directly from my website here [https://andrewespiewhitburn.com/the-way-out-is-through.../](https://andrewespiewhitburn.com/the-way-out-is-through-the-way-in-ebook/?fbclid=IwAR0dU0Ml3nottZVJzXc79Jip5Po-Uehc0rLItxRB6qhAf_nX9xrvZDDrTMY)

1484,I don’t want to go to sleep because I don’t want tomorrow to come,"Lately I’ve been feeling like I have no purpose. I don’t look forward to anything anymore. I have few friends and can’t even see them due to COVID. Nothing gets me excited anymore, so what’s the point of tomorrow? It’s just going to be the same shit over again. I’m not suicidal or anything and would never harm myself, but I’m sick of life right now"
1485,Can anyone please just listen ? :(,"It’s currently 23:41 on a dark Monday evening... my bed is under the window and I’m in tears crying to this ... there is a loop of kyu sakamotos Sukiyaki playing in the background somewhere the room is dark so... but it feels nice feels like I’m slowly drowning 😌😌

I am depressed , tired and mentally exhausted with life... having no one to go to having no friends and wanting to get back with my ex as it’s been a year since we broke up. I am trying to have something good out of life but I can’t you know why ?? Because I have to deal with being autistic I have to feel like I’m an alien and feel fucking isolated. I have no friends at all... everyone stares at me and it hurts more than getting a stab wound to the heart. Oh wanna know what told this up ?? I am 3/10 due to this app yes my looks are everything no ONE WANTS TO KNOW ME. Because I am ugly... knowing this deep down it hurts... I’m seriously suicidal I keep trying to workout in hope that my body can look at least acceptable so people will wanna be around me.. I scroll through the internet and I feel why I can’t be like them all ?? Why do I have to look different? 


I miss my ex so fucking bad seriously I would trade my soul to go back in time to fix me and her it’s been the longest roughest year for me.. I’ve come to experience total isolation from society.. now I really want her back. I am craving her I feel lost and sick without her... so today I decided to message her out of the blue and she replied and we got talking... and it hit me how special she was to me even my parents said she was very very pretty why would someone like that be with a loser like me ??... I just want her back I’m trying to get her back because it’s eating me inside :( I love her I still do 


Thank you for listening to me"
1486,Lost control need comfort,"My bf of nearly 5 years broke up with me a while back. He’s having his own issues, but since then he’s dictated when we can speak. It started twice a week, then once a week, now it’s been no contact for nearly two months.

I don’t want this to be a ‘oh stupid girl missing her ex’. He was my best friend, and he helped me get out of my abusive household. He helped me build back up from nothing. We were so close, he was always there for me, and I loved being with him. I felt safe and loved in a way I never have before by anyone. I’ve never had anyone stay with me in my life; my father, my mother, my grandfather, aunts, uncle’s, cousins, I lost contact my grandmother and close family for over 10 years because of my psycho parents. I’ve lost my sisters. All of my best friends from school and undergrad. None of these people died - they all left.

I don’t want to lose him. He’s dealing with his own issues, he’s in therapy. It was therapist that suggested breaking up for a time. And then covid happened, and the break turned into a break up. I’ve seen him once in person in a whole year.

Before I got out of my house, I was locked up with no contact to the outside world for just over two months, December to Feb. He couldn’t have picked a worse time to go no contact. This period is always hard for me.

He’s already said multiple times he wants to stay friends, stay close, maybe date again one day when he’s dealt with his stuff (which I’m not going into here). He’s already set a date in Jan for us to catch up, and from there build up from ground zero. So don’t comment to say ‘go no contact and never speak to him again’ because I’ve had enough of people on discord groups saying that and not listening to me. 

But I lost control today. I cried and cried and banged my head into the tiles on the bathroom wall. I cried until I was exhausted. I tried to contact him and he said it was best not to talk just now, he’d contact in January like we agreed, and he wouldn’t reply to me again. I just lost the plot and cried.

My gran then made it worse, saying I was an embarrassment, acting like a teenager not getting her own way, scaring my uncle (who I’m staying with for Xmas), how could I do this to him after he opened up his home to me, jeopardising his job (god knows how he finished at 5), and I had to act my age and stop this nonsense. I felt terrible as if I’d ‘chosen’ to want to cry so hard I nearly threw up, to find that hurting myself dulled the pain somehow.

Just... help me.
How do I stop this. How do I get better. How do I fix this. How do I cope with no contact for months at a time?"
1487,I posted this on a different subreddit and then instantly got scared and deleted it so now I'm posting here,"I’ve been thinking a lot about ability/disability lately, particularly as it relates to mental health. Growing up, I was definitely taught the “you can do anything you set your mind to” ideals, which overall I think are very positive! I think it can be helpful to see the world as something that we happen to rather than something that happens to us. But I also think that this mindset, when taken to the extreme, can be damaging. It doesn’t always take into account the differences we have as individuals. Let me give you an example.

Because of a failed eye surgery I had when I was very young, I’m missing about half my depth perception and see double when I get tired. Because I’ve lived my whole life this way, it’s totally normal to me. However, whenever I would jokingly complain to my parents about not being able to catch balls in PE class because I couldn’t tell how far away they were from me, constantly having bruises on my right hip from all the doorframes I hit thinking they’re farther away than they actually are, and not being able to read at night because I’m seeing double, they would always dismiss these concerns with something along the lines of “Oh come on, that doesn’t really happen to you.” or “You’re just exaggerating.” So I learned that I shouldn’t talk about those problems. In many ways, I began to feel that they weren’t even valid problems to have. I told myself that I was bad at sports and always ran into doorframes because I was clumsy and awkward, not because I was missing most of my depth perception. And every time I saw double and had to put down my book, I told myself that I just didn’t feel like reading anymore. 

I also have a slight hand/body tremor. I’ve had it my whole life. It’s partially genetic, partially due to being born prematurely and not receiving the best medical care at the time, and partially due to anxiety. Although I’ve had it my whole life, it was never something that my family talked about. One Christmas when I was very young, my dad got me a kit that let you decorate something with rhinestones. I couldn’t do it because my hand tremor was too bad. He had the weirdest look on his face as he watched my try to do it with my hands shaking. He even asked me if I could just make them stop shaking, as if it was something I was doing on purpose. I was used to this, so I told him I’d just try the kit a different day when my hands weren’t shaking so badly. Then we never spoke of it again. Because he’s a medical doctor, he has access to beta blockers (which can be used to calm tremors,) which he used to quietly give to me before important clarinet auditions so my hands wouldn’t shake so much. When I recently got my hair cut, the stylist was getting frustrated with me for sort of jolting in the chair from time to time, and I had to explain to her that I had a tremor. My nickname in high school was Parkinsons, which I earned after spilling a paper plate full of food because my hands were shaking too badly. 

A good friend and I recently both got juicers and have been swapping juicing recipes. I told her that I felt bad buying the pineapple and watermelon that was already cut up because it cost so much more. I said something along the lines of it being perfectly understandable for disabled people to buy things like that, but I really shouldn’t have to. Well, I had already told her that the reason I was buying it was because the combination of my tremor and my lack of depth perception makes it hard for me to cut up fruit. So she challenged me on it and asked “Ren, you literally just described two disabling conditions you deal with and then put yourself down for using a product that you claim is made for disabled people.” I actually had to pause to think about that one. (Side note: buy pre-cut fruit if you want to--you really don’t need a “good” reason like it’s your money just treat yourself)

I also deal with a few different mental health conditions. Namely: depression, anxiety and a dissociative disorder. All of these have been diagnosed by licensed medical professionals, and they’re all chronic. The degree to which they effect me varies a lot. Sometimes, I hardly even notice I have them, but sometimes they seem to take over my life. When I was in college, I had memorized which bathrooms were the best to quickly throw up in when I had panic attacks between or during classes. I almost failed a class because I missed so many days being stuck in bed with severe depression. I actually had to fight the professor on that one, because my grade was an A otherwise. She just wanted to dock me for missing classes, but I digress. The most challenging aspect of my dissociative disorder is how it affects my memory. I have made a lot of progress on this front, but in the past I lost an average of 2-4 hours a day. These were just hours where I was dissociating and had no memory whatsoever of what I had been doing during them. I’d often “come to” in a location that I didn’t remember walking to, feeling sore and stiff from holding perfectly still for 3 hours, and once after having taken a whole bottle of laxatives for who knows what reason. I no longer lose time on a regular basis, but I do have a very bad autobiographical memory. I often repeat stories 4, 5, and 6 times because I simply don’t remember telling them. I also forget things my friends have told me, sometimes entire conversations. I hate this so much, because I want to remember and I am paying attention, I’m just too busy fighting dissociation to actually store those things in my memory.

I feel a lot of shame about my memory problems in particular, and I do my best to hide them. Whenever someone asks me a sentence that begins with “remember when....” I always pretend like I know what they’re talking about. I’ll play off not remembering something as just being a bit ditzy or goofy before I’ll admit to simply having no memory of the event/conversation. It’s disorienting to deal with. I recently discovered the #soapcore tag on tumblr and excitedly told my friend about it. Apparently, she had shown me that tag months earlier and we had spent like a week sending each other pictures of soap. I’ve got no memory of this whatsoever, and that’s just a small example. Forgetting so much can sometimes make me feel like my life is being taken away from me. Like, does it even matter that it happened if I don’t remember it?

Now that I’m working on ED recovery, I am even more aware of my mental health struggles. When I was actively in my ED, I took 2-3 hour naps every day and often slept for the entire day on Sundays. I never even paused to consider that there was an alternative to losing so much time to sleep. I got sick frequently (I also have an autoimmune disorder, so this was just sort of a wombo combo), and when I get sick I get really sick. I never “just” have a cold. At minimum I’ll be running a fever for a day or two, and usually I’m stuck in bed for most of the duration. Back when I was at my worst, I was getting sick like this for roughly one week out of every two months. All things considered, I still don’t think getting sick that much is really so bad, but not that I haven’t gotten sick in almost six months I have absolutely no idea what to do with all this free time and energy. 

Another thing that I’ve been dealing with (and this is probably what inspired me to type out this long post) is compulsive water drinking. I started drinking lots and lots of water as a way to feel full when I wasn’t eating enough food, and then I started drinking water even more as a sort of comfort tactic as I worked on recovery. I’ve done the math, and I was probably drinking at minimum a gallon and a half each day. I’d drink water every ten minutes or so, and I felt very anxious if I didn’t have my water bottle right next to me. I only realized that this was an issue when I started experiencing major digestive issues, increased confusion, and increased double vision as a result of it (I’m still not convinced that all these things were directly caused by water intoxication, but I will say that the symptoms have eased up significantly since I started drinking closer to 90 oz of water a day). I did some research on Google, which is how I found out that compulsive water drinking was actually a thing. The first day that I started to limit my water intake was actually incredibly difficult. It’s a more powerful compulsion than I wanted to admit! Honestly it really feels like I’m quitting smoking or something like that, and all this is over something as simple as w a t e r. 

The final thing I want to talk about is a subject in its own right, and I might type up an entire post about it. To summarize, I’ve had a few therapists encourage me to get evaluated for autism, and I believe there’s a decent chance that I’m autistic. I don’t personally identify as autistic because it’s not something I’ve been diagnosed with, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I did eventually get evaluated and find out I had it. (Sidenote: compulsive water drinking is somewhat common among those on the spectrum). I have some weird sensory issues. Like, getting my face and neck wet makes me want to peel off all my skin, I can’t stand the feeling of carpet on bare feet, random things like that. I’ve also noticed that I seem to have some difficulty interpreting social cues. I have a hard time telling when people are joking or being sarcastic. Not too long ago, I played my first session of D&amp;D, and it ended with me close to tears. It’s hard enough for me to interpret social signals in person, but it was nearly impossible in the context of roleplaying. I kept thinking that a character was meant to be joking when they were actually angry or vice versa. My friend, who was the DM, asked me if I would be open to another session, and I told her that I didn’t think I could. After I explained my reasoning, she responded with “Oooh so it’s an accessibility issue then!” She said that, if I wanted, she could just bring up telegraphing emotions in our next meeting (without specifically mentioning me) and ask that people describe the emotions of their characters when they described their actions. She talked about this like it was the obvious thing to do, but it truly wasn’t something I ever thought of on my own. I don’t see these things as “accessibility issues,” I see them as “Ren being dumb issues.” There’s a lot more I could say about this, but I’ll leave it there for now.

Basically, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to be “abled” and “disabled.” I’ve realized that, if somebody came to me and described the challenges I deal with, then asked for some sort of accommodation around them, I wouldn’t even hesitate to provide that accommodation. But I would never think of asking for an accommodation myself. I also have this “it’s all in your head complex about things.” There is very much still part of me that believes I’m just making this all up for attention or as a way to excuse my lack of intelligence or lack of ability. I definitely don’t identify as disabled because I feel like doing so would be an insult to those who are actually disabled. But the more I think about it, the more unsure I feel.

The goal of this post is to spark some discussion. I’m sure I can’t be the only one to feel this way, and I’d be interested to hear about it if you deal with anything similar. I’d also be interested to hear your take on what kinds of issues warrant accommodations. For example, if you were in my D&amp;D group, would you accept the solution the DM suggested? Do you think I need to take a step back and stop trying to categorize things as “problems” or “challenges”? I’d love to hear your thoughts."
