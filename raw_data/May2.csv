0,I regret so much.,[deleted]
1,Feels like I’d be better off dead,"The path that seems to have been chosen for me is a miserable and torturous one. I confess, I haven’t always been as good as I am now, when it comes to putting myself out there. However, the end results seems to be the same. My attempts, as well as the courage I’ve mustered, remains futile. The day my life becomes enjoyable, will be the day I cry tears of joy. For it seems an impossible and hopeless dream for me. I must be destined for a despondent existence."
2,"I don't know how to deal with my emotions, I throw tantrums and I'm an adult","Firstly I'm in the wrong so please don't hold any punches back.

So today I had another tantrum because of something minor, this being my mom's slightly spitting on me while talking. By accident.

Since I was stirring a pan of potatoes I gave her the cold shoulder while barrating her. So she ignores me, she usually does this to not make me angrier but as I get older this action makes me unreasonably more angry now. So after the potatoes were done I started purposely splashing tap water on the ground, aggressively pouring soup until we reached the table. She has cleaned up the spills, I'm still angry so I knocked the toothpicks and boxes of cookies over. 

Now she's annoyed and tells me to grow up, I start blaming her boyfriend's exact same actions years before when his anger issues were worse. That growing up with him made me this way. She tells me I'm stupid for doing what he does then and that I need to see the doctor. (Side note, she'll never let me because that'd mean she's not a Perfect Mom in the eyes of our family and that I'm crazy.)

 It's true but I don't know why I got angrier. My blaming gets to the point that he himself comes into the kitchen now asking what's wrong. My mom blames her boyfriend and tells him what I said. He calls me mental. Which is probably not wrong but I don't know how to deal with honesty either. So after being embarrassed O grab the hot potatoes and throw them at my mom. (They were cut and she was wearing a big vest.)

So I eat in our room (we have 3 rooms in the house, 1 for him, 1 for my frail grandpa and the last is for my mom and me) and watch on full volume a video about calculus. Now I'm really breaking down because I'm reminded of how dumb I am. She enters the room ""looking for something"" and I'm even more mad. I tell her to get out and she refuses saying this is her room. I'm throwing things again. Now she's yelling at me, since we're close to grandpa's room I'm really sad now.

It ends with her leaving me continuing to feel down so I ripped her pillow in half and covering it in dust and water to throw at her. 

I'm sorry for this wall of messed of text, I already know most of what I need to work on.  

Like being babied for most of my life made me really indecisive and dependent on others (only just recently started cooking but I can barely get on the wheel without having a breakdown), I'm germaphobic and I may have anger issues. It also doesn't help that I don't like being stared at which is weird because ignoring me angers me? I also frequently tear up really easily to, which nearly caused me to drop out of school multiple times. 

I'm still indecisive about what all this text is for but I feel a little better typing this out. I bottle my nitpicks alot I don't know. I guess, please berate me and tell me what's normal."
3,Can’t feel anything anymore,"I’m new here and i’m not one for talking about myself but i think i just need help. i was in a very intense relationship from november 2017 to around april 2019. i connected with this woman so deeply but it just fell apart. ever since then, i’ve tried countless times to have any sort of connection with anyone. not even particularly “sexual” relationships. i do connect with my son (single father) but that’s really all i have. the women i’ve tried connecting with were very likable, and i treated it as a budding relationship. but by the time i realize i can’t develop emotion, i’ve already gotten them emotionally invested in me and i hate hurting people and i really wish i could get over whatever blockade is preventing me from meeting someone and pursuing something further than a one night stand. 

i know this was all over the place but hopefully you get the jist. i just needed to see if anyone else has been through something like this and how you coped because i’m having a hard time and i’m afraid of not being able to feel"
4,Extrovert Fighting the Quarantine Blues,"I’ve known I havent been okay with the quarantine situation for a while.  As a extrovert who works exclusively from home, and exclusively by myself, I had things set into place to be sure I dont get stuck in a rut at home. But obviously the quarantine has put a hold on all things outside of my home.  My roommate recent left for a week and has extended her stay.  While things are opening up, my mental health has completely dive bombed.  Ive talked about doing things like going hiking but now im so scared about leaving my house I get very anxious outside of it.  However, coming home feels like entering a prison.  My brain goes into survival mode and I get anxious and cannot think, clean, work or hardly do anything other than sit on my floor waiting for either the worst or for this feeling to pass over.  I had a total breakdown yesterday and tried to speak with my boyfriend about it, only for him to get extremely frustrated with me and tell me to “fuck off”.  When i told him that wasnt okay later on he then tried to bring up things that he has done for me recently as to why I shouldnt be so depressed and I became livid and actually blocked him.  He is usually very supportive but he had a bad day and ended up taking it out on me at a very inopportune time.  I’m really not okay with his reponse and have even thought about totally breaking it off. I feel betrayed that he would do so and now my mental health is hitting a new low. 
I really just needed to vent this as I am not one who really openly talks to people about how I am usually feeling(unless its good).  Anyhow.  Im trying to pick myself up but having a very hard time as I seem to keep digging a hole. Any extroverts find any good coping mechanism.  Im usually pretty good about keeping my mental health in check but I am feeling very out of control."
5,Great app for mental health! (Not self promo,That app is called “reflect” on the App Store ( sry the link doesn’t work) +DM me if you need to talk to someone :)
6,How can I overcome character jealousy?,"For context as to what character jealousy is, it's basically when someone gets jealous of a movie/cartoon/etc. character. For me, I'm jealous of superheroes and anime characters, not because of strength or looks, (It's sometimes looks but that's not what i'm getting at) but because of their stories, depth, friendships they make, and so on. I don't see and real purpose in my existence. I don't do anything with myself, I can't help others with anything, I have no real emotional depth, and I can't call people I consider friends ""friends"" because I don't know if they consider me their friends, and i'm scared of the outcome. I want to have some thing that makes me different in a good or useful way, but there are none that I see, so I just feel worthless and empty.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I overcome this kind of stuff so I can watch movies and cartoons and shit without feeling pathetic and worthless in the fact i'm nothing?"
7,I'm worried going to break my ipad because of my intrusive thoughts,[deleted]
8,The Abyss | Drowning in High Tide,"---**Time Will Stop**---

I feel like I’m drowning, except I know how to swim, the current is just too strong to stay afloat anymore, that current is my emotions. What strength I had left is my ability to swim.

Think of the way people long for the beach, or they long for a rainy day and a good movie to relax too. They long for things that bring them comfort, time away from stress, even when they can’t necessarily set everything aside to make it happen immediately. It’s the same way, for me, with suicide. I went under for surgery when I was child, I described the nowhere and nothingness I experienced, I was told that I was going to just dream and wake up. But I didn’t dream, it was complete darkness with no sound for hours, I knew I was put under and I was conscious about it. I imagine at times this is what death is like. And so, like most people would long for some innocuous escape from everyday life, I sometimes long for an escape not-so-harmless: the nowhere, nothingness.

I had a friend kill himself when we were in school, I was 13 and he was 16, at least I think so. My years of secret drug abuse and having severe depression has made me forget a lot of my life actually, my memories from the past few years are shoddy at best, only sometimes do memory’s come back and I actually get excited about some of them, even if they are bad ones. The most I can go back is maybe 2013 and that’s it. Thinking back, I didn’t understand why he would ever want to do that, but here I am. Thinking of doing the exact same thing. The more I think about it he made a great choice.

So much pressure is put on us to do good, and a lot of us make mistakes. One slip up makes you feel like the smallest person in the world. I get stressed out from the most minuscule things. You are looked at as a failure if you don’t go to college or if you don’t get a good job. We are all machines in this system to keep modern society ticking, forced to work in jobs to keep this thing called ‘life’ running. The meaning of life is to work and then die and I don’t care to live like that. I’ve lost all motivation and passion for everything and I’m too tired to even care. This isn’t heaven it’s hell with a smile.

Now that I am writing I just had another memory come back, I remember when I was younger, I would always say to my mother that “I want to go home”, but I was at home, we were at home. I don’t understand but I still feel this way. I never felt like I was at home and I have lived in this house since it was built 18 years ago. I don’t even know what I mean. I’m missing something.

I’ve actually been writing this for the past week because I keep thinking of more things to add to this, so some parts I write might seem kind of oddly placed, been holding off mainly because of the ending of this post, you’ll understand once you reach the end. Anyways, I’ve remembered some of my childhood again. I remember when I was in school, I was always in Christian schools and I remember always having more time speaking to someone outside rather than actually in classes. Through Primary and Secondary I always had to speak to what I’m assuming was a counsellor? I really don’t know.

So, the first Primary school I was in was run by Christian nuns, and when I was leaving that school to be transferred to an all-boys Christian school (they separated boys and girls in my town once you reach like 6-7). I for some reason remember being called a “Devil Child”, or something like that by them and they were happy I was leaving. Pretty funny if you ask me. I was pretty bad to be honest; it wasn’t until I was transferred to the all-boys school did I change. But even then, I still had to speak to someone outside of class, which were all women. I’m guessing this is where my openness comes from, and the way I can more easily speak on my emotions/feelings, and my more relaxed feeling I get around girls/women in general, I’ve never had a problem talking to girls ever, which is strange and weird to say considering I have pretty severe anxiety around people. I’ve always found speaking one-on-one way easier.

Something that pisses me off is how boys/men can’t speak about this kinda stuff openly without looking like a pussy or a bitch, there’s a reason why the suicide rate is so fucking high for us. If you don’t act strong or I guess “manly” you are seen as weak. I blame societies pressure to be like that. We aren’t allowed to be depressed, sad be anxious or want to talk. We need to “Man up”, “Boys don’t cry” and the “Get over it” mentality etc.

I just watched a video titled “How Doctors Tell Patients They’re Dying | Being Mortal | FRONTLINE”. It was very interesting, the part that got me the most is the fact that I will never have someone in my life who cares about me as much as that woman did her husband. I want to die relatively young. I don’t have the courage to grow old and alone with no sweetheart by my side. I don’t care that I’m 21, my mind feels way older.

I also recently found this article titled “Tragic 11-year-old killed herself as she was ‘unhappy with her looks’ after revealing heartbreaking plan on Instagram”. The thing about this is just how fucked the world really is, here we have an 11-year-old beautiful girl who killed herself because she thought she was ugly, she was probably bullied or due to social media saw other girls and felt ugly herself. Such a huge shame. And the craziest thing is that it says “suicidal ideation is increasing in children as young as seven”. This is how we know the world is truly fucked and mental health isn’t cared about as much as it should be.

I try and do anything and everything all day. I can’t be alone with my thoughts so my objective is to do as much as I can to keep busy. Every evening I’m exhausted, emotionally drained and still depressed. I feel like I’m beating back a relentless force. I feel like I’ve been robbed of being proud of the little things I do. My biggest fear is waking up and not having anything to do, just be in my head. But that’s where I’ve landed. I’m alone and lonely. To the outsider I look like I’m doing really well but I’m struggling a lot. My depression forces my brain to turn to isolation which in turn makes me worse and I’m lost on how to cope with it. I never have anything to look forward to.

I never had any real friends; I was never in a real group of people and I will never be. I always feel like an outcast, an outsider, I never really fit in, I’m a weirdo in others eyes and I’ll never have a legit relationship. I never even really had a childhood that I even care to try and remember and I missed out on my teenage years, I never got to experience things at all. I got bullied which turned me into an insecure and anxious wreck of a person which in time made me severely depressed. I realised more than anything that I’m always alone/lonely, I am so lonely, so depressed I am paralyzed. I don’t want to do anything. I’m completely isolated all the time, and all I got is myself and I don’t even like myself. I’ve had either people either use me or don’t care about me at all my entire life. Nobody actually cared about me in reality. I’m in a position now where I was friends with a lot of people, now I feel abandoned.

People always choose everything besides me. I’ve been placed in situations that are very heart-breaking as far as relationships go, and they disappoint me, it takes the very soul out of me, it breaks my heart. It’s hard to explain what you feel, you just know what it feels to feel. The saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies, it comes from those you trusted the most. It’s not just friendship relationships I miss though, I really miss affection and intimacy. I literally crave it. I want it more than anything in the world.

I just don’t understand why. Am I the problem? Am I the asshole? Am I the fake friend? I must actually be an ugly and awful person in general to be around. My ex-girlfriends called me ugly and a horrible person so I must be. You all deserve better than me, I am just not worth it. I am not worth being friends or in a relationship with at all with anyone.

What significant thing have I ever done for anyone anyways, I’ve never done anything in life, I’ll always be a failure. I haven’t done anything interesting, notable, difficult, or impressive, my entire life. I’ll never amount to anything or be successful at anything and I don’t feel like continuing to achieve anything. I have no effect on this world anyways, I have nothing to offer, no talents, no goals. Nothing. I’m not important. I am not a real person to most of you. I am nothing but a name that is attached to something. I have nothing to live for. I’m worm food. I feel like a huge burden. I feel like a lost cause, they wonder why I’m gone for so long, I still don’t know where I belong.

All I ever tried to do was help others and make others happy even if it in turn made me unhappy or caused me stress, people like me who want to die from suicide are highly sensitive people, we are deep feelers. We can spot a fake a mile away, we can see when others are hurting and not put off by others misery. We do these things because the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy, because we know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and we don’t want anyone else to feel like that.

I’ve seen lots of people say that if you die, the people around will be sad and angry at themselves etc. But the thing is: if I’m dead, I can’t “see” or “experience” the repercussions of my death anyways and I think I prefer that to feeling like shit all the time. I know this is a dreadful way of thinking. There is peace in death. It’s that same window from when before we were born. The only ones that suffer in death are the ones left living to process it.

I feel as if I’m already dead, I’ve been dead for years, but my body just kept on living.  I’m just a shell of the person I once was, you can see the pain on my face, in my eyes. All my suffering is really getting under my skin. I’m drowning in my thoughts. I know that they aren’t my friends, but I’m friends with the thoughts again. It helps me sleep by thinking of killing myself, I find it comforting when my mind doesn’t know what to do. We don’t actually fear death, we fear that no one will notice our absence, that we will disappear without a trace. Days will turn to weeks and weeks into years and I won’t be remembered by anyone for anything.

The way I go will be by my own hands, on my own terms, on my own time.

9,I'm worried my ipad is going to break because of my constant turning it on and off due to my OCD,"I have OCD and I've been turning it on and off all night, because every time I turn it on, I get bad intrusive thoughts that make me turn it off again. I want to stop but I can't get to sleep without turning on otherwise, I'll be worrying about doing it in the morning. I am really worried its going to break soon. Has anyone got any advice on how to do deal with this? Thanks and sorry for the rant"
10,I feel like a tumor to my family,It sometimes feels like someone is chocking me whenever I lay down. My mind races and I can't think straight like once I felt like I was a bunch of different people and then I felt like I was all of them and then it felt like I couldn't breathe and every time I swallowed I felt like I was chocking on nothing. Then I realised it's late which only made it worse and I felt like something was trying to kill me but it was only me. It feels like I should die but I don't want to die. Like in the day I love life but at night life feels like it would be better off without me and I'm only a tumor to my family and friends. Every time I get help I only feel like I'm wasting their time and if I wasn't there they would have easier lives.
11,Am I bipolar? Overwhelmed with frustrating but positive feelings,"Super brief backstory: abusive parents (emotional neglect, physical abuse &amp; sexual abuse, yay!) who were also very strictly religious.

I’m mostly recovered now (or at least shoved all the bad feelings in a box 90% of the time).

However I’m still on anxiety meds to calm some horrific OCD and possible borderline/bipolar/who knows what (haven’t been able to get a diagnosis).

Basically, for as long as I can remember, I feel like there’s a bonfire inside my chest. Sometimes it comes out it negative ways (I used to have really destructive anger issues and severe attachment issues). Now I’m feeling better and I’m in a secure situation it’s coming out in more positive but nonetheless frustrating ways.

Like... I want to feel and do EVERYTHING all the time, all at once. I feel like I have so much energy and passion and determination that I don’t sleep until the early hours because I’m so wired. When I listen to my favourite music I feel like I’m going to explode with the feelings I get.

I want to change the world. I know it sounds stupid and it’s embarrassing to admit that I dream this big because I’m just one person probably with bipolar delusions of grandeur.

I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. Does anyone else feel like this?

I want to do everything, experience everything, speak to everyone, sing all the songs, dance all the dances, and just figure out a way to release this huge mosh pit of emotion inside me. I feel so much love and determination and passion and hope and awe at the world and it’s just... argh! I can’t contain it.

If I do something I go big or go home and I’m always the person who wants to take it to the next level. For example, if we were planning a night out I’ll be the one trying to get people to go to the craziest clubs, stay out a long as possible.

Is it anxiety? Bipolar? ADHD? Am I delusional or can I use these feelings to fuel me to achieve my dreams? That’s what I’m doing at the moment and I’m getting as involved with pursuing my career path as possible but sometimes I worry all I have going for me is my passion and not necessarily talent. (I want to go into community work and believe what I’ve been through personally might have equipped me with the tools to maybe make a difference and a unique perspective.) I just want to use what I’ve been through for good, I suppose and not let it be for nothing.

Anyway, enough rambling! Anyone feel the same? Got a diagnosis? Any advice? Help a gal out?"
12,Low IQs correlate with suicidal feelings,"This may not be accurate and doesn't apply to all suicidal people. However, I heard that people who have low IQs are more likely to think about suicide or attempt it. I experience suicidal feelings all the time and have attempted suicide in the past. I do believe I have a lower IQ but that sure doesn't make me feel better."
13,how do i help a friend who doesn't see any worth in their life?,"they don't think anything will get better for them. they are convinced that no one likes them. they don't think anyone could ever like them. they don't have access to a therapist, they're family is unsupportive, they don't have many friends. i don't think i can contact a school counselor to get help for them... this friend almost killed themself yesterday. ive been trying to help and thought that i was for a while but im scared. i know what is like to continue to fall back to the same dark place even after doing better for a bit, and i know that it's possible to come back. I've had several friends self harm, go through the worst things I've ever seen, try to end their life, and ive always been terrified that there's nothing i can do and that one day i will have to see a world without someone that i know belongs in it. it's not good for my own mental health to get as involved with someone, someone who is extremely depressed and/or suicidal, like i am right now. but i think i need to be right now. i would never consider this person to be a burden on my, because they are not, but im struggling to help them on my own. i know its not my responsibility to be someone's therapist but i don't think i could handle the potential consequences if i am not this time. I've worked hard to not get back to this place, but I'm here now. i don't think i can change this person's mind on my own. i was in a similar situation as then except that i was fortunate enough to have people and resources, and if i did not im not sure where i would be today. what do i do?"
14,Resources for finding teletherapy?,"First off, if this is the wrong place to post this mods - please delete my post.

For years I've felt I really wanted/needed to talk to a therapist, and I had a few bouts with in person therapists.  I found that the inability to physically get to an office with a hectic schedule really made it challenging to continue any work on myself.  

With COVID and the lockdowns state by state, I've really wanted to try teletherapy as it seems like it would be easier to fit into my life and thus I could keep up with it. My insurance (BCBS PPO), references me to their site to look things up but it doesn't denote whether any therapist will do teletherapy, and the list seems never ending.  Additionally, it references me to therapists who are largely out of state and I'm not sure if that would be an issue due to medical licensing or something.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and any advice would be greatly appreciated."
15,Suicidal but terrified of death.,"Does anybody else feel this way? 
I want to die so desperately and vividly daydream about my suicide and how people would react to it, but I’m also scared af of death. I have bad depression as well as manic episodes and get strong suicidal thoughts... but I can’t bring myself to do the deed, despite wanting to so desperately. 

I know what y’all are gonna hit me with : “ThiS iS a SiGn tHaT yOu DoNt aCtUalLy wAnT tO dIe”. Save it tho pls, cause I do want to die. I’m just scared of dying😂😭"
16,Slowly turning back to self harm ( sorry for the second post ),"Alright after finding masochism more and more romantic over the few months I've had the urge to look into it as well...

For the record I did it before but adventually talking to mates about it and having the year of my life I started to forget about it.

My reasoning now is just to punish myself and to get some joy out of it, it always gives me a happy feeling and constantly getting the urge to do it again ( who doesn't love dopamine).

The things I am doing are not that harmful and at worse I get small cuts, but I want more and more.
For you see I always loved weaponry the engineering that went into them or the sheer time it takes to make them makes it very interesting.
So I really want to buy a knife.

All of what I just said is wrong in every way, and I know that but I don't know how to stop.

I am again sorry for me posting often I am a bit of a trouble child.

17,My brother claimed he’s going to contact a lawyer because he threw a tantrum and wants to evict me. Problem? He’s a tenant just like me.,"
I heard no lawyer is going to take family issues and besides that, there have been plenty of times where he’s threatened/got in my face because he’s tried to intimidate me. So what’s he going to say to the judge?

&gt; Well uhh... there have been times where I lost my anger, got in his face, and...

And what’s the judge going to say?

&gt; Indisputable evidence! You are 100% innocent!

We’ve gotten into some fights but nothing serious like face-punching for anything. 

He also likes to go on about ‘his house’ and I just laugh and say:

“Okay [landlord’s name].”

If we weren’t in a pandemic I could possibly look for hosing elsewhere.

He randomly approached me and said:

&gt; Oh maybe you can live with our other brother.

&gt; Maybe you could too.

I say.

He claims he’s going to get a court-order. A court-order for what, his brother not moving out when he resorts to threats and rage?

Laughable."
18,Spiraling and scared of myself. Current world events and difficult home life are triggering bad coping mechanisms. Want small suggestions for working my way back up.,"36 F. OCD, intrusive thoughts are main issues. I turn to alcohol or other stuff to numb it. Already seeing a therapist 2x a week and maxed out on meds. 

Main theme of my ocd is being worthless. I put myself in really bad situations that should have landed me in jail or 6ft under. 

I really am trying! I'm open with my therapist. I attend virtual meetings for ACOA. I can't seem to have more than 3 days that I can function ""normally"". 

3 panic attacks yesterday. I can feel an episode coming on. 

What do you do to keep yourself safe from yourself? 

What do you do to work on positive habits? 

What small self care things do you do?"
19,Video therapy,"I’ve finally decided I need therapy. After sitting at my desk at work, and feeling like I’m going to burst into tears, after driving to work and having a stomach ache because of anxiety. I know video therapy is the only way to go now, so who has tried it? Does it come close to in person therapy? Is the virtual barrier sitting in between the therapist and client, cause any disconnect? 

Thanks"
20,Anxiety mixed with depression,"Since isolation started my mental health really started taking a bad turn, most of my anxiety is being caused by uni work but there’s obviously other stuff impacting it as well because I’ve had it for years. But recently I’ve been getting more and more depressed and I’m starting to self loathe, and as much as I hate it and try to tell myself that those thoughts are ridiculous and totally not true, they still linger? I’m constantly shaky now and there’s this feeling in my chest like I’m on a roller coaster even if I’m in bed and it’s getting really difficult to go about my day. I’ve got so many assignments due but all I can think about is crying and hiding from literally everyone I know. I started to see a therapist a few weeks ago and I’m hoping I can work through this with them, but right now I can’t see my self as anything more than a burden to my friends and family, I’m usually quite open about it but my family doesn’t fully understand what’s going on (which is okay) but I guess it makes it harder for me to talk about because I feel bad because they’ve also gone through depression and anxiety but their ways of dealing with it were very cut throat because they had to care for their families. Can anyone relate or give me any advice? I’m from Australia, Melbourne."
21,do I have anxiety (or something else) or is this normal?,"I’ve always been a bit of an over thinker and experience stress with stuff relating to school or conflicts, which is all normal. over the past months things have slowly been evolving and I’ve been trying to convince myself it’s normal and I’m overreacted but it’s just starting to really get to me so I wanted to see if anyone had any insight. 
basically I feel like I have been experiencing what I can only describe as anxiety because I’ve never had this feeling before. I feel really panicked and feel almost a pressure in my chest and slightly nauseated from a bad feeling in my stomach. it started with things that I would usually associate as stressful &amp; overthink like boy problems or interactions with people but, unlike before, I found I was unable to stop thinking about it and analyzing the situation for sometimes even hours. if it happened at night I would have trouble falling asleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about it. then I started getting the feeling of “anxiety” but it would have nothing associated with it. sometimes it would just be like super intense and I would cry because I felt so stressed out but I couldn’t even try to stop it because I couldn’t associate it with anything. there have been a few times where I was supposed to be somewhere but couldn’t get it together to leave because of this. these anxiety with out source moments have continued to happen, as have moments of anxiety with things that are more reasonable, but more recently I’ve started getting anxiety over things that seem really irrelevant to my life but once I think about them I can’t stop freaking out and worrying. I’ll spend hours thinking about it or researching online to find some answer to whatever it is i’m freaking out about. I have had to stop what I’m doing on multiple occasions because I am unable to stop thinking and worrying about said thing. it’s also gotten to a point where I’ve started associating this anxiety with other things. for example sometimes I’ll pick up a book or am about to start a show and I’ll either feel anxiety or think I might and I’ll do something else because I don’t want to deal with it. or even sometimes the phone rings and I get anxiety because I feel like it’s some bad news about something. 
almost on a daily basis something will trigger this feeling and I just get this intense worry that I feel the need to either mentally analyze or look up to find an answer that will rationalize things and calm me down. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense it’s kind of hard to explain but it’s really starting to get difficult for me to manage. any insight at all would be really helpful thank you"
22,Need advice,"This sunday is Norways national day. Me and my roommates are supposed to go to one of their sister to hang out and have a bbq. Lately I’ve been struggeling to eat as it is, and I also have always hated (and not celebrated) the day in itself. I don’t want to eat in front of others, and I’m also the only vegan there. I don’t want to go, I’d rather be here alone, but I don’t want to bother them any more than I’ve already have. Any advice on what to do?"
23,Anxiety,"I always felt like I had anxiety, but now in quarantine I  feel like it went up to 11. The slightest things freak me out and keeps me shaking for hours. Currently, my ears have been ringing for about an hour and I have no idea how to make it stop. I'm honestly disturbed and scared of myself.

And for reasons I won't get into, I can't ask for any help when it comes to my mental health.

Please help."
24,I shouldn’t be alive- my experience with lexapro+trazodone,"I will attempt to make this short and helpful to others seeking medication for depression, anxiety , insomnia and adhd. Warning! This post could be triggering to some with anxiety or psychotic episodes. This is my personal experience with the drugs, I know their are 100s of thousands of success stories. I’m not downplaying the effectiveness for some.... 

2 months ago I was prescribed Lexapro and trazodone for depression and anxiety. I don’t remember the mg but I remember reading it was on the high side. I didn’t think anything about it...big mistake... let me just say off the bat, question the fuck out your doctor and then do personal research. I also suggest asking if you can take 1/2 or a quarter of the amount to test. Most antidepressants have a long half life. 
Back to the story- 3 days pass by and I dont feel any different, maybe a little nauseous. Then, on the third night at roughly 330am I wake up sweating profusely, heart pounding out of my chest and a ringing in my ear that sounds distant yet localized as if at the furthest corner of my brain. My brain is out of control, manic as hell and nearly incoherent babble. 
I’m no stranger to panic attacks, psychosis, psychedelics or mania so at first I was not really that worried.... I thought I could ride it out.. then it went to another level. I went downstairs to grab some water and try running my wrists under the faucet or place them in an ice bath. When I get downstairs I have this strong sensation that I’m not sure where I actually am... it seemed familiar...like de javu. But couldn’t place how I knew it. 
I remember taking an abrupt right to try and find my cat to help calm me down...he’s great for panic attacks... only to end up in the wash room staring at the washer and dryer thinking “ what in hells name are those?!” I start really panicking. I abandon all hope of calming myself down and soon I’m surrounded by every noise in the home but amplified by 100. I run out of the house and down the street. At this point I don’t know what to do... I don’t believe I knew what a phone was or the dangers of running in my pajamas at 330/4 am. I really don’t remember a lot after getting outside other then...”fuckkkkkkkk I’m stuck”... did I mention I was supposed to start a new job at 7am? 
Wellll after hours of running my brain started to rationalize on some level. I’m at a stoplight and think to myself “oh shit...stoplight.. woah! Stoplight that’s great...” I walk back home. Change my clothes and drive straight to my on the job training where I then excuse myself several times to cry in the bathroom and pray to God that I come out of this. I’m still having intense waves of psychosis- soft noises becoming to loud to think, interjecting thoughts of extreme violence, suicidal thoughts, waves of intense sadness...all the stuff my employer doesn’t want in a new manager of million dollar construction projects.. fast forward, I made it through training and even managed to last 2 months at the job. Possibly getting fired tomorrow because Im forgetful which means negligent in corporates eyes. 
On the upside! Today is the most normal I have felt. It’s a normal like getting used to being in an abusive relationship. You find ways to cope and cherish the moments your not getting hit or berated. It’s not great and I want to change but I have been told only time will do the trick or not... my dr. Isn’t sure. I’m genuinely surprised I’m alive and partially sane. In my own personal research it sounds like I was over prescribed serotonin and basically OD’ on it- serotonin syndrome. Genuinely don’t give a damn just happy I can see my daughter and I’m not in a institution. Moral of the story- watch your back!! Just because your doctor prescribes doesn’t mean it’s going to help you. Do your got damn research and try alternatives like running at high speeds until you puke your guys out. I have nothing but love and support for others who feel helpless and want out of their mental illness. It is an incredibly tough thing to learn to live with. Please be safe folks and tell somebody you trust that you are beginning medication treatment. They can be your monitor in case things go amuck. 

Love all and be safe. If I spelled shit wrong or my sentences don’t make sense just roll with it...."
25,Mental impact on relationship,"For a little over a month now I have been seeing this guy and for the point of this story I will call him Ryan because I don’t want to disclose his name. So, “Ryan” and I met and stuff. We have been pretty well in the relationship but now I’m starting to notice the things that Ryan does.
I’ve been noticing his acts of only calling me when he is going to bed but I know he had good intentions at least I think he does. I believe it is me who is affecting this though. I am a moody person at times and it is hard for me to control my anger and sadness. I also seem to be ignoring him and I can’t deal often with our problems. He denied to call me tonight due to this mood and I believe it is all my fault and I just want to be a good girlfriend. When I feel good Ryan makes me feel safe and secure. As well the most important thing, happy. I just want to know if there are methods. I am trusting of him and let him know how I feel most of the time but when I am in a mood things will change with me and “Ryan” at my expense."
26,Wondering thoughts on a huge anxiety trigger of mine..,"So I'm a 27 F. 

|Previous Diagnosis|Current Diagnosis|Previous Meds (Same meds for 8 years)|Tried Medications\*\* |Current meds|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Depression|Borderline Personality|100 mg seroquel (quatiapine sp?)|Straterra|200 mg Sertraline|
|Bipolar|Anxiety|20 mg Paxil (paroxotine)|Ritalin|300 mg Wellbutrin (New within last 6 months|

||||Rexulti|On hand .5 mg clonazepam (only take those VERY VERY RARELY. only taken 2, in the last 6 months)|
||||Adderall||
||||Concerta||
||||Vyvanse ||

\*\*Medications that i remember trying within the last three years (never taken longer than 6 months), don't remember doses

\*\*Note\*\* i was unable to take any ADHD medication due to the fact they made me feel as if I would have a seizure, heart palpitations or anxiety attacks. 

I'm currently very comfortable with my diagnosis with my new psychiatrist of a year. he helped me get my anxiety service dog, has tried a lot of medications and has always taken what i'e said into consideration. if i told him i was scared of something, or disliked a medication, he always listened to me, respected my wishes. With my fiance, he's always noticed i've had a ""go go mode"" and a ""I need to nap"" mode always. But regardless of medication, i always seem to have extreme upset and need to clean my house and do house chores when i can get out of bed. To the point if they don't get done, i have a breakdown or panic attack. It almost becomes a need that when I get up, these things have to be done and they have to be done now. 

Even if I'm on a down day... I feel anxiety surrounding it. Seeing a mess or knowing i have to change the animals water or something.  I'm going to mention it to my psych when we meet (hopefully in person soon) as well as my fiance. is this just anxiety/bpd behaviour? Or is it possibly OCD behaviour as well? 

I know my dad definitely has anxiety/OCD type behaviours as we were never allowed to have dirty rooms in our house. To the point of he would come into a prety clean bedroom and demand we pick up a tiny piece of fluffy (paper, or something) off the floor. Or him asking if all the doors were locked, alarm on a bunch of times for him to just get up and check himself. 

Curious on everyones thoughts &lt;3"
27,I'm 18. I feel like my mental health has been spiraling downwards for a while now. I have always just found ways to ignore it. I can't any more.," 

Hey, sorry if this is so long and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. I don't mean to waste anybody's time on here so sorry in advance for this, I just need to get this out. Sorry about the ton of grammatical errors, but if I don't force myself to just type as I think I will never say anything. Hopefully one of you guys can help me and I hope all of you are holding up okay.

Like I said in the title, I'm 18 and I feel like I've always been husking off the weight of an existential crisis that feels like is finally coming to fruition during quarantine. In high school I was in musicals and dramas and choirs and stuff and was going to go to music school. My dad is paying for my college though and a couple of my brothers dropped out after years of failing classes and not getting anywhere. He started my college fund when I was little and I can feel that he really wants me to be his first successful son so I went into computer science because I love video games and I figured that'd be the next logical step. I am in summer school right now because the specific program at my tech school is a substitute for the first 2 years of comp sci at a 4 year so it runs in trimesters, meaning I have a full workload of online classes during the summer.

I'm close to a year in (I turn 19 in June) and I really hate it, not for the subject matter specifically but because I can see exactly how my life is going to play out: work for 50 years to save up for retirement and have fun when I'm old and die. My social life went off the deep end as soon as I finished school, partially because I'm at a tech school so there is no music or anything really. I have always kind of known my life was going to head this way but I never really dealt with it or with anything else in high school because I just decided to not think about it.

I got therapy my freshman year because (trigger warning) I was molested by 4 of my classmates every day in 5th grade for a few months and didn't tell until then, and at that point I didn't really tell him (therapist) anything because I had already kind of bottled that up. The other time I got therapy was when I was 9 and my parents divorced and I didn't really tell her (the other therapist) anything either.

I have a girlfriend on and off for the last 2 years or so, she is my 2nd girlfriend. She might be abusive but I don't know, I broke up with her once and then got back together when we went to the same college, maybe because I felt like we had to because we were in the dorms together and she is very persuasive. We argue a lot and I always feel like I'm the one in the wrong for everything. Sometimes it feels like she's really really mean to me or manipulative but a lot of the time that fades away and I just feel like a bad boyfriend, I try really hard to be a good boyfriend but it always feels like I'm not doing enough and it always circles back to something I'm doing wrong, that I don't love her enough, etcetera. She talks about marriage and staying together forever and I just agree, but I'm not so sure but I don't know what to say. I feel scared and trapped. We go to the same uni and I also love her and hate the idea of a lack of companionship considering everything else I mentioned. The last time I broke up with her was hell and I also have really bad self esteem so I have no idea how I even got her to date me in the first place. We try to call every night but a lot of nights I'm late because my mom makes food really late and I have chores and she makes me feel like a piece of shit, or maybe I am I genuinely don't know. I feel like I don't know if I'm in the right about anything, like I have no real convictions. I feel trapped not only in this but in my own life.

I have always wanted to be famous or at least successful in something related to music or video games or something but it feels like I can never even get the courage to try or to follow through. I have grand ideas but lose motivation very quickly and I can't even finish one section single song that I'm working on, usually I just end up deleting the whole thing. I have terrible ADD or something similar because I have an insane inability to concentrate on anything that doesn't interest me directly, even busy work that has to do with something I'm interested instantly checks my mind out and sometimes I sit in front of homework or the computer for hours trying to get my brain to work. I am an incessant procrastinator even in things that I like and it makes me feel like a failure. I feel like I should not be lacking this discipline or work ethic, I had to put in long hours at musical rehearsals and stuff so it isn't like I was coddled or given everything or I never had to work.

My grades aren't bad but extremely mediocre and I can't get into the university I want to as is, but the problem is I don't even know if I want to go there at all for comp sci or even to go there at all. I want to be financially sound and make my parents proud and vindicated for all the money they saved up for me to go, and it constantly feels like I am failing them, my girlfriend, everybody, and myself. I try my best to be the best person I can be but I constantly feel like a giant sack of shit. I am extremely superficial and extroverted from my days in music so I make friends easy but I lose them quickly due to some combination of lack of attention span and depression. Sometimes I feel like an introvert sometimes an extrovert, I act like an introvert but I feel like nothing recharges my ""batteries"". Some days I have extreme highs where I feel like I am king of the world (usually when I get a new big life plan or something or I have some item or something in the mail that I'm excited about) but it hardly ever lasts more than a few hours.

My parents know about a decent amount of this (more my dad than my mom) and I was planning on going to see a therapist while I was in the dorms but I was always so scared and I could never muster the effort. Part of that is I think because my mom and dad both had terrible home lives growing up and their expectations of me are also exceedingly high so I feel scared to feel the way I feel. Now I'm home at my mom's during quarantine and I couldn't even if I wanted to. The weight of my relationship, my life, and my parent's expectations have been crushing me for a while and I feel like I'm at the point where I feel like I can't be crushed any smaller. ***I have never and will never consider suicide***, but I feel empty and drained and I honestly don't know what to do. I have never done drugs or alcohol, though I do have caffeine everyday. I'm a healthy weight for my height as well. What the fuck could be causing this and how can I get through quarantine with no available professional mental help? How am I so fucked? I try so hard to be a functioning human and a good person but I feel like my brain has giant metal weights holding it down from everything around me and I feel trapped. Any advice at all for anything I mention above would be the equivalent of gold to me. If you made it this far in my ramble I appreciate you for even doing that, and I hope you are all getting through this spell of terrible misfortune okay."
28,Do I have insomnia?,"I'm not sure about all the symptoms of insomnia, but after a few Google searches and a bit of common sense   I do have a small suspicion.

So, main thing is I usually try to be asleep by ten but end up staying to usually around 12. Most people in my family are asleep by 8 or 9, so I'm not sure if genetics have anything to do with that.

My bed is a mess whenever I wake up. I do sleep with q dog on most days, who usually ends up sleeping on the floor while I'm asleep. 

I have noticed that my reaction times have been slowing down, around 300 milliseconds. Apart from that, I am feeling tired throughout the day and often find myself sitting down, eyes closed for a few minutes before I continue my day.

If anybody wants more info I'm fine with that. I'm a teenager, so not sure if it's a hormones thing also."
29,During a pandemic is the only time people seem to be concerned with social isolation and mental health...,"I've severe reoccurring depression and anxiety, these are directly linked to the fact that I'm long-term unemployed - no job means no social interaction, also no money to pursue a social life or hobbies - as an Autistic person with ADHD this social isolation also has a greater impact on me as I don't retain social skills (use it or lose it kind of deal). I'm certain getting back into work would treat my depression, but there's just no support to help someone in my situation to get back into work and so I'm stuck. 

It's frustrating seeing how all of a sudden there's a social conversation about how lockdown is going to impact mental health, acknowledging that social isolation is a huge issue. After a decade dealing with social isolation, having people not willing to try to understand how hard it is to gain a social life back and how social isolation really fucks with your head...these same people are clambering over themselves to seek support now. 

There's already a ten month waiting list to see a therapist, and therapy hasn't been helpful for me (it's 12 x 1 hour sessions, mostly it's just small talk), once the lockdown is lifted long-term mental health services are going to become all the more strained. 

I do *NOT* begrudge other people mental health support, and I am *NOT* saying these people shouldn't be bothered by social isolation during lockdown...it's just frustrating people only give a damn about these issues if it effects then personally.

30,In need of someone to talk to,"Hey. So I lost my grandfather today and was broken up with last week. Im under a lot of pressure with work and school right now as well. I just need someone I can talk to anonymously right now. If someone would be willing to message me for a little bit, it would be really appreciated. I'm not suicidal so please don't be afraid or worried about that. Thank you in advance."
31,"If my migraines are related to past psychological trauma, how do I relieve them?",My therapists thinks my migraines could be related to the trauma I went through growing up. I've also been through testing and somatic symptom disorder was one of the diagnosis. If my migraines have a psychosomatic cause how can I prevent them?
32,please help,"i don’t know what’s happening. one minute i’m fine the next i’m pacing in my room sobbing, hearing things, seeing things. i want to go slit my wrists and bleed out in the bath tub, i cry so hard my eyes hurt. in between the crying i have moments where i can’t breathe, i just gasp for air. but one hour later boom that’s it it’s over and everythings back to normal?? what is happening to me someone please help me figure out what this is"
33,Am I dreaming?,"For the past two-ish weeks I’ve felt like I’m in some sort of dream. Things just seem off, like I can’t recognize myself in the mirror, my arms feel heavier or shorter sometimes, I have small gaps in my memory, and I have trouble recalling if something really happened or not. Oh, I also find it difficult to relate to my memories, and I feel like they didn’t really happen. 

I’ve never taken any kind of drugs and I haven’t been diagnosed with anything (I’ve never talked about mental health with my doctor), although I’d say I’ve been depressed for 1-2 years. I don’t mind this feeling, but it scares me sometimes. What should I do? Thanks :)"
34,Has anyone used Betterhelp?,"I’m struggling, massively. It’s the first time I’m able to admit that I’m struggling (I’ve been struggling, just massive denial and dangerous coping mechanism to cover it) since I left any sort of treatment six years ago. 

I’m trying to find a local office that will be able to get in for a phone appointment any time soon, but they’re giving me times almost the last week of May, or first week in June. I’m waitlisted at a few places, but knowing myself likely need something sooner. I’m not a danger to myself or anything, I’m just literally in mental shambles. I’m trying to find unbiased reviews of Betterhelp but they all seem somewhat bias or fabricated to sound amazing. I was curious if anyone has personal experience, or input they can provide."
35,How do I get myself to shower every day?,"I’m so embarrassed by what I will say here, but I’m kinda desperate for some ideas about the shower thing. I’ve been severely depressed most of my life, until several years ago when I started making progress in therapy. I still deal with it almost daily but I have moments and some days of joy. 

For years I’ve tried to convince myself that every other day is enough but it’s not. It’s not just the possibility of odor, or probable odor (I’m a bigger girl now and I always have sweat a lot regardless of weight, so I probably stink). It’s not that my hair isn’t as cute the second day. These things kinda matter to me. Or I want them too? But I don’t understand why I don’t want to do it when I literally don’t like the feeling of not being fresh. I wake up sometimes feeling like I can skip that day, but inevitably (like now) I get into bed feeling uncomfortable and annoyed with myself, wishing I would do this one thing for myself. 

Self care has always been nearly impossible but I’ve gotten a bit better over the years. I finally started brushing my teeth immediately after waking up several years ago. Last night was actually the first bedtime brushing in a long while. I brushed tonight too. Still might get a snack later. When I try to sleep, sometimes I eat due to anxiety because my mental defenses weaken a bit and I panic. 

So, ya, please be nice. Any ideas are appreciated."
36,"Around five years ago, a boy committed suicide because of me, and I still can hardly live with myself for it.","Growing up, it had always been dream to be a police officer. I was enamored with the idea of protecting and serving my community. Eventually, my dream became a reality; however, the job was not as glamorous as I thought it would be. I thought I would be out chasing bank robbers and serial killers all day, but that obviously wasn’t the case. 

I lived in a large city near a pretty prestigious university. On many Friday nights, I would be assigned to alcohol control duty around the bars near the university. It was my job to bust and ticket underage drinkers. In this locality, if somebody was caught drinking underage or had a fake ID, they would be given a misdemeanor charge. If it was there first time, they could almost always get the charges dropped on a deferred prosecution agreement. 

Well one night when I was in patrol, I went to a bar to check up on an underage drinking call. I checked the boy’s ID, and he was indeed underage. He was also very obviously drunk, although not to the point he’d lost control of his actions. I told him I would be ticketing him. He was absolutely frightened. He begged me not to, saying it was not his first time and he’d be given a criminal record now. I thought as apart of my oath to protect and serve, it was my duty to ticket him, regardless of the severity of the law. It would be an honor violation not to. I ticketed him. 

I left the bar and made my way to a few others just to drop bye and make sure everything wall alright. About 15 minutes later, there was yelling coming from the street. The boy had been stuck by a vehicle. Traffic footage later showed that it was very likely a suicide. He killed himself because of the charge I gave him. 

After explaining everything to my superiors, I was put on paid leave and made to see a counselor to ensure I was handling my okay psychologically. I just couldn’t take it. I quit my job as an officer and went back to school; now I work as an accountant. I’ve since gotten married, and given birth to a wonderful child (very recently). The birth of my son has just brought back the horrible memories of what I did to that boy. It’s my fault he’s dead. How can I raise one child knowing I took another from his family?

I’m so fucking lost."
37,I wanna kill as many people as possible,"I fucking hate everyone. Men, women, children, Black People, white people, Asian people, fat, skinny, old, young, attractive, unattractive, gay, straight, etc. 

All my life I’ve struggled with mental health issues. I’ve been sentenced to prison for a year and I was beaten and constantly pushed around. I had to fight for my safety and even when I got out of Prison I didn’t get along with my family. 

I can’t even type my thoughts properly on this goddamn post... 

I have a lot of anger and hatred in me and as each day goes by my desire to kill People grows. 

People don’t take me seriously and just say I’m edgy and an emo but i wish that were the case.

I don’t even know what to say anymore. I have no one to help me or to talk to. I feel so depressed and angry all the time.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep living. 

I don’t know what exactly it is I’m asking for."
38,People keep telling me “i’m constantly negative”,"Hey all. So at the moment i’m in Utah with my dad on a motorcycle trip. Earlier, we were sitting around our hotels fireplace outback just having a bit of a father to son talk. And he said something along the lines of “you need to work on being nicer, you’re constantly negative” And about a week ago my brother was screaming at me for being such a negative asshole. But this all confuses me like through and through. I mean, yeah at times i’m pretty moody. I struggle with a constant anxiety and depression, and each one feeds off the other. So, if i’m having a particularly rough day, i may be a bit more standoff-ish and what could be considered “rude”. But like, the thing is. I don’t say mean things to them, or really anyone for that matter. I don’t insult them or anything-and they still say this. I’m just confused i guess, cuz i didn’t realize how much it was affecting others. 
What can i do? I mean, i can’t find examples of me being negative or an asshole, so i can’t really see if it’s true or not. But like, what can i do about this? I’m now super down and anxious because it’s all i’ve been thinking about all night now. How do i change this? Like?"
39,Are delusions a good or an extremely dangerous way to cope with stress and anxiety?,"I apologize for the long post. Here it is.

I am an average person with the same problems as anyone, looking for a job in an economic crisis, not being able to pay my debts and all round loneliness because I have been socially awkward and introverted my whole life. I occasionally get anxiety attacks and my arms and legs feel hot, vision gets a little blurred and I feel nauseated. I have, in the past, used smoking and boozing as ways to cope, but now it feels like I might turn into an alcoholic if goes for too long.

So, in times of anxiety I tend to put on my headphones, play some music and just imagine this alternate universe where things are going well for me. I think of what if situations where I live out and correct my wrong decisions, or where my luck was actually better than what it was. In this AU I have a job, loving friends, stability and a genuine satisfaction with life. This helps to calm me down and feel happier. But I think I might be getting further removed from reality. I’ll spend HOURS just imagining, having fake conversations with my non existent friends, solving imagined work problems. Now, I am kind of addicted to it, so much that I would rather live my delusions than actively participate in looking for a job or developing any skills. 

I don’t know how to get out if this. Has anyone else experienced this problem? If so, how did you get out of it? Is there a healthy way to get rid of anxiety?"
40,Mental Health Short Film Apparently Made By Students (Solo Orange),"Found this short film online about anxiety and depression. Apparently made by young students in college. What an interesting film. Just sharing in the hopes it helps someone :) 

Link: [https://youtu.be/NEz8eZmO\_zY](https://youtu.be/NEz8eZmO_zY)"
41,I'm becoming increasingly worried about certain distressing and disturbing thoughts I've had for as long as I can remember.,"Hey all, I know this is gonna sound crazy and you're gonna think I'm sick but I don't know who else to tell, I can't tell my family about this, they won't see me the same if I do and I'm not seeing a therapist right now, though I want to find one. 
Ok, so to the issue. Ever since I can remember, even as a kid, I've had thoughts just suddenly enter my head. These thoughts are highly distressing to me. They just come at random with no set frequency as to when they come. It can go on for days or stop for weeks until it randomly starts again. So the content of the thoughts are horrible. The content ranges from me doing something to inflict pain on someone else, being cruel verbally and emotionally, and doing something like destroying something that I know is precious to someone else. So that's the content of these thoughts. 
I DO NOT enjoy these thoughts and I DO NOT want them in my head. It IS NOT a fantasy of me doing it, it's almost more of a ""what if I were to do this"" kind of thing. But when I get the thoughts, I get extremely disturbed by them. I have anxiety issues (no diagnosis but I know anxiety when I feel it). I've read about intrusive thoughts and I've wondered if maybe I'm obsessive-compulsive but I don't have compulsions. I can be impulsive, especially when it comes to buying things. 
I just know that I would NEVER act on the thoughts I have because I wouldn't be able to live with my self if I did any of those things on purpose like that. When I do something wrong I feel remorse and sorrow. I can be numb to emotion but I try not to be. I'm just worried I'm a psychopath or something and that's where these thoughts come from. I don't know what to do about these thoughts, all I know is that they cause me immense distress."
42,A vent of my emotional stresses and suicidal thoughts.,"Just so I can speak them all out there.

My father, who I may not have lived with but spent summers with as my only time with him. Out of anyone in my family he was the only one who relentlessly showed his love and support for me. Always stated how proud he was is dead from soul-crushing depression.
He didn’t commit suicide or anything, he literally just go so depressed he stopped eating, his organs shut down and he died.

He was always an extremely heavy drinker, my step mom and him would drink straight out of X hard alcohol bottle (usually a fifth at a minimum), usually scream at each other with extreme hatred before going to bed. They never yelled at me this way (even if I did something bad I’d just get a stern talking to about honesty and how lying is wrong).

My closest brother, only only one I’ve really ever spent time with is in prison for a foul and disgusting crime. But we were always on/off friends growing up. 

Like on one hand we hand this incredibly bonding over video games, and making up our own games.

But when we were younger my mom saw a counseled and at one time I got motion censors in my room because he’d come in when I was sleeping and beat the shit out of me. And when I was just in my first teen years coerced me to let him blow me (I rationalized because I didn’t finish I he did nothing wrong).

I god married when I was 24, we started dating when I was 15 and she was my first. I avoided mentioning we also met when she was 22 and she later became ashamed of that (any time it was brought up she was obviously uncomfortable about it).

I’d say I’m in love, I never even kissed a girl what do I know. I was often tormenting myself about my continued decision to be together, constantly evaluating why it’s wrong by I convinced myself it was. I viewed and lied about watching porn (she didn’t want me even seeing rates R movies).

After seeing a counselor, convincing her I wanted to be in the relationship (even after she knew our age gap and how long we’ve been together). I finally convinced myself to love homes without question, as I’d questioned it so much. After I finally decided to sign the marriage license, not a year went by when she decided she loved me no longer and we divorced.

That was over a year ago and I’ve since dated a few people (a couple I’ve slept with) and I’m now dating a girl, in fact we live together and she’s incredible. She’s super smart, funny and gets my humor. She’s beautiful and just in a warm kind sort of way. She knows pretty much everything there is to know about me and still loves me for it.

She likes my friends, and tries to be interested in my interested, and I hers. I want to avoid the word perfect, as I know no one is but she’s on the spot. We have good “physical” relations and I enjoy her presence very much.

We’re in our mid 20s (actually less 6 months apart), and I was her first. She has mentioned multiple times she gets a little self conscious because she’s not my first. She has no one to compare our sexual interactions to and I do.

She’s dated people, even for significant amounts of time just not having sex. But I cant avoid seeing the similarities. In my first relationship I’ve said a lot of the same things she is, only I’m the more “experienced one”.

I was with my first for almost 10 years, almost 5 times her longest relations and she has voiced her issues with that. 

I feel at no point in my life I have taken advantage of another person, in fact I often felt I was being taken advantage of or that I was beneath someone else (I still do).

But now she thinks herself beneath me, and apologies about everything. Constantly saying she’s sorry she’s bad at “X” or constantly questions if I approve of something.

Like I have adult education and she’s extreeeeeemely well educated. Like I feel like I wasted my life with my last relationship and she is really well off, and yet she loves me with all of her heart. I feel completely unworthy,Ike I said outstanding in every sense of the word.

When people say they’re dating up in my case it is not a joke, yet she is vying intensely for my approval.

And I use this as another force behind my life-long, multiple-times-a-week thought process:

“Everything could be easier, and less difficult for everyone if I were dead. But I guess some of the people I think care about me would be saddened somewhat and then no one would feed my cat.”

And I go on."
43,How do I start seeking help?,"I have visited social workers at my primary care twice. It was a little helpful but I wasn’t able to tell them my whole story as I feel very ashamed.

I have had very unhealthy behavior, compulsive lying for no reason at all, loneliness, being unhappy, high level of social anxiety and mild clinical depression (based on the social worker’s assessment), narcissism, inability to form relationships in a nutshell. No one other than me knows about it and no one even has a glimpse of what has been going on in my mind.

I just want to seek professional help. I just don’t know where to start and how to talk about my behavior without feeling ashamed. 

Thank you guys, this would be so so helpful :)"
44,I imagine people I know observing me when I'm doing something since I was a kid. Is it some kind of disorder and why does this happen?,"Is it normal to do that? I have always imagined people i know observing everything i do. Especially if I'm doing something noteworthy. And I voluntarily imagine it.. not in a paranoid way where I feel like people are watching me.
The people observing me are usually people I know and they often differ from situation to situation.

It feels like I imagine them watching to prove them a point. I have no idea why. They observe me from an imaginary place and even discuss with each other about it. Basically, they discuss what i imagine them discussing.. so its not really out of my control either.

I do that all by myself and it doesnt really bother me honestly. I did this since I was a kid. Now its become hardwired in my daily routine."
45,I need help. I am alone. My only fear is being alone. Please help. 14 yo male,"I’ve realized over the past few weeks that I am alone. Yes I have friends, yes I have family, but I am still alone. I feel like my friends are fake. I play games with them but I am always the person chosen for the stuff nobody wants to do. I always get banned from our Minecraft servers for no reason and get kicked from our discord. Whenever I  make a small mistake in a game I get roasted and it kills me. None of them respond to my texts and I am currently kicked out of our group chat because I sent a tiktok that they didn’t find funny. Only one of them treats me like an equal most of the time and that’s why I haven’t left. I live in a small town and all the other friend groups hate me. I don’t consider any of them to be close. My best friend and I don’t talk anymore. The only girl that has had interest in me I had to ghost for reasons I’m not gonna say. The only too people I’ve been comfortable opening up too were my best friend and that girl. Now I have nobody. My family wouldn’t care if I told them how I my emotions are always watered down and I am always sad. My siblings would make fun of me. My mom would say something like “other people have it worse” and wouldn’t care. My dad and I are close and I love him but he wouldn’t care about my feelings. He never has. I am unattractive and 195 lbs at 5’8” so I am chubby. The only thing I am good at is skiing. Because of this I have very low self esteem and avoid leaving my room, which is my safe space. I am having zero suicidal thoughts and am eating fine. But I am just so worn down and I don’t know how long I will be able to take it. The only fear I have in life is being alone. Even so to the point where I would reject immortality so I don’t have to see my loved ones die over and over again. I am alone. I have thought about therapy but my parents wouldn’t pay for it. I need help on how to feel emotions fully again. How do I become more outcasted. How do I feel comfortable simply being in public. I need help in anyway I can get it. Please help, I need to not be alone."
46,"I feel like I live in a sea of fog, with temporary moments of clarity.","I guess I just need to type this out. Does anyone else feel like this sometimes? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm typing this during one of the said moments of clarity that I'm feeling tonight, sometimes I can go weeks without feeling like I feel right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

During moments of clarity I feel like I know what I want from my life, and the direction I would like my life to take, I can make solid plans and feel like I can actively achieve them, with smaller goals I can put in place. I can see the benefit of my relationships in my life, and have feelings of gratitude for what I have.

&amp;#x200B;

On any other day I feel like I'm just putting one step in front of the other, like I have so much going on that I can't focus on one thing for too long or I'll run out of time to do the other things I need to do. I can't see the long term benefit to any short term task (like working out, practicing learning towards my educational goals, going the extra mile to do stuff for my wife, even working on my yard. I'll find myself questioning my relationship with my wife, with my family, the purpose of my life, why I make efforts to accomplish anything.  I tend to just drift through the day doing the bare minimum, and I tend to make decisions or do things because I should.

&amp;#x200B;

I also will have random anxiety attacks surrounding things that I've put off too long, like cleaning the house, or some chore I've been putting off, I'm seemingly unable to clear the anxiety until I accomplish one of those chores, or I do mediation/breathing exercises until I fall asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried counselling for the first time just before Christmas... I didn't really hate it but I just felt awkward because I don't really like talking about things that have gone on in my life, like I feel embarrassed for things that I've done or have had done to me. I come from a divorced home, and my father had anger problems which led to verbal abuse towards people in my family. I've also since left a religion which has given me an unhealthy level of cynicism towards spirituality - or really anything that I can't physically see. I try and tout logic to help my decision-making, but I tend to find myself making seat of my pants decisions because of anxiety or fear. I also find that after going to counselling I'll be even worse for like a week after. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is extremely patient with me, but even she will sometimes get frustrated with me when I will forget to do things that I said I would do, or I'll lie about a small thing because I'm afraid that I will get in trouble (Stupid small things, like whether or not I walked the dog, or switched the laundry). I don't think this stems from my relationship with her but from my relationship with my family in general. Since dating my wife I've come to realize that for the most part my family is emotionally manipulative and my worst menta health days come after spending time with them. This causes additional turmoil because I feel like I shouldn't distance myself from them for my own health because they're family and family is something that should be foremost. I grew up in an extremely religious home with all of my friends and family belonging to the same faith. Over the past 5 years since leaving I've had to reinvent how I feel/think about pretty much everything. As well as my relationships where many of my old friends either stopped wanting to do anything with me, or outright would no longer talk with me. My extended family didn't shun me, I shunned myself because being around the religion causes me extreme mental turmoil. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to feel the clarity all the time - like I did before leaving the religion I was born in. Life is full of so much uncertainty and I don't know anything about anything, but I know that I like feeling this clarity, I like feeling hopeful for the future. I love doing things and recognizing their importance towards longer term goals that I've made.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate feeling like I'm just barely breathing, that I'm just moving day to day and month to month without any hope.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I still feel happy when I spend time with my wife, or I'm walking my puppy. These moments just seem fleeting and far between."
47,What is Wrong with Me?????,"I hate myself so much right now it's not even funny.

I'm literally the most ARROGANT person. My mother keeps telling me that I come across arrogant, and deep down I also know that I feel like I'm better than everyone, but it isn't even true! I'm lazy as hell and don't do jack shit. I just sit on my ass and watch anime all day. But I still constantly live with this feeling that I'm somehow superior and I can't fucking get rid of the feeling that I am because I'm so clearly an idiot.

I'm also lazy as HELL. I just don't do anything and lie to my parents saying I studied. I need to stop, but I just can't. I have no motivation to do work and no goals in life. Yet somehow I think I'm superior to everyone.

I find myself wallowing in self-pity 24/7, making my life seem so much worse than it actually is. 

I want to stop being this annoying jackass and I want to be a decent human being. But of course, I never change. No matter WHAT I do, I always end up being the same, lazy person that I always am. I need to stop. 

I hate the person that I am so. Damn. Much. I need to stop, because I am toxic as hell and have no friends because of it. But I don't know how.

Someone, please tell me what's wrong with me. And please tell me how I can go about changing myself and getting rid of my toxic nature."
48,Im acting up again I think.,"I (25m) live with my Fiancée (27f) and have issues with depression and BPD. My soon to be wife is a very nice woman but sometimes I want to break her nose. She gets upset with me for playing on my phone when we watch shows together yet listens to music with airpods when I'm trying to have an actual conversation about Us as a couple. When she does that all I think about in that moment is curb stomping her and her perfect smile.

I truly do absolutely love her but I catch myself in moments thinking about how easy it would be to end her life. She's all I have in this world but parts of her makes my skin crawl. I've rarely act on my urges except for I've noticed when I hold her i squeeze her too tightly, enough to make her vocalize her discomfort. 

Anyways, I don't take medication never have and don't plan to. I don't know what will happen but I've always been a little unstable.  She notices sometimes but thinks it's just me getting anxious. I've lost track of what I'm talking about so I'll end it here. 

Post what you will."
49,Cry for help/vent/both. Not sure.,"Virus really fucked me over. I was starting to get back on my feet in school after I had a really bad time before all this went down. Now I've started staying in bed for hours, not doing any of my hobbies, not being able to sleep at night, lying to my mum about doing the set school work, getting flashbacks to some very dark times, I've stopped showering as often because I don't feel motivated, I've stopped exercising and generally mentall and physically I'm the worst I've been in years. I didn't think I'd end up saying this but I need to get back to school as soon as I can or this is going to escalate (I'm not in danger right now just so nobody gets worried). I'm eating less, too, and I've got tics again which I haven't had for years."
50,How to accept nothing is forever ??,"Hello, so i have come to this sub many times in the past for advice. It's one of the only places i feel safe chatting about my problems. So here goes another one.

I recently got out of my first relationship (i'm 16). It absolutely ripped my to bits. I was a mess for days after she left me. I had to go to the emergency late night doctor because i couldn't breathe properly because of the immense anxiety. It was utterly terrible for weeks. 

However i must say three months have come and gone since then and i have realized that she was not the one for me after all. I also have a new girlfriend now so all is good don't worry about me.

However, i have learned one thing about myself and it's a really big hurdle in my life i need to overcome. I believed whole heartedly that that girl would be the one forever, i really did. However, obviously that didn't end up happening.   


But i have come to realize that it was not just the relationship, but everything in my life i don't ever want to let go. I have attachments to everything and find it hard to accept that one day i will have to move on. 

my computer, my phone, my car, my house, absolutely everything i don't ever want to replace. I just want the same one forever. I don't know why i am like this because i never used to be. I used to always want to have new things, even after i just got something i was already eyeing off the new model or something like that. 

I just need some help realizing that nothing is forever and these material objects will one day have to be let go in favor of new models. I just don't know why i am so attached to a having these things forever."
51,This is a rant:(,"Okay so this is just me ranting about everything going on in my life rn. I’m not diagnosed with any mental illness or anything and Im probably gonna sound like an attention whore but oh well
Any misspellings or weird bits is cause my phone is a crackhead
 I feel so unmotivated to do any of my homework right now and I’m scared of f failing but I also can’t bring myself to actually do my homework even if it’s just watching a YouTube video. I really don’t want to take my AP tests this year because I don’t think I’ll be able to finish in  time because I don’t feel like doing anything.
My phone that my mom said we were gonna get replaced over a year ago but she decided to go out with her boyfriend instead doesn’t fucking work and she doesn’t think that she is ever in the wrong when it comes to my little sister not liking her when her loudly having sex at 2pm is what is bothering my sister. She’s so fucking annoying she never does anything around the house and dinner sis either crockpot or me cooking whatever she wants me to make. I’m so fucking tired of her bullshit.
I feel like I’m going crazy and I want to reach out to my friends but I also don’t want to burden them and I haven’t really talked to them since quarantine started which is making me feel even worse about reaching out to them because I don’t want our first real conversation to be me treating them like a therapist and I feel like I’m crazy so much. 
I don’t want to kill myself but I just want to stop existing I just want a break from all of this mayhem and I don’t want to be at home but I have nowhere else to go"
52,"I feel terrible fear and guilt over incidents in my past. Innocent but stupid mistakes or events that you couldn't really blame a child or teen for, but oh my god they terrify me.","I've told a therapist these things and they tell me not to worry, but I can't help it.

I think the biggest one for me when I was 16 and for some reason very curious about how porn websites handled illegal searches. I don't even remember if I tried Google first, but I ended up putting a search into a site known for being too much/offensive. Got my answer immediately when a huge warning popped up with my IP address saying the event and my information had been forwarded to INTERPOL. Pretty much had a month long panic attack, and I still feel such shame/anxiety about it.

The other was when I was like 12-13. I had a ""girlfriend"" and had just discovered internet porn *and* 4chan. I found a thread for people looking for pornstar lookalikes and posted a Facebook image of this girl. My best friend who had introduced me to 4chan saw it and told me it was fucked up and when I realized how true that was, I freaked out like my life was ruined. To this day it haunts me.

There's a few more things like my sister and I sexually experimenting between 5-8, me kissing my cousin when I was 7 then her telling our entire family and extended family, resulting in a very public spanking/yelling at.

My friend at age 9 nearly burned down his house with gasoline when I was over. Not my fault, I insisted he not play around, but his uncle screamed at the both of us and I have no idea what he told my mom. I hid my face in shame for a day afterwards, walking around with a blanket over my head like a damn ghost. Then she told my grandparents and aunts/uncles despite me asking her not to.

Then there's the time I got scammed out of $500 when I was 15 and my parents screamed at me for days. I almost killed myself during this time because of the shame/embarrassment I felt.

I feel like all these things contribute to my intense feelings of shame, which manifests in POCD. Which weirdly enough wasn't an issue until I was fixing my sister's fiance's computer way later. They got together when she was 15 and he was 20, and it was really weird. I always had this fear that he was a predator, and years later, about a year before they got married (she was 23), he wanted me to fix his laptop. I took this as an opportunity to snoop, and it was incredibly intense/anxiety causing. I didn't find anything, but suddenly my mind was flooded with intrusive thoughts and images that I have not been able to shake since.

I know I'm not that monster, my therapist says I'm not that monster, but Jesus am I afraid sometimes. Classic OCD but even recognizing that doesn't help. I look for reassurance every chance I get. I'm doing it now with this post. But I feel like these feelings of shame manifest in the most shameful ""what if"" I could possibly think of, and my history has just enough in it to make it seem real."
53,Hating my abusing parents,"And no, this isn’t a “teenage is angry at their parents” kind of hate. we’re talking about a “I was bullied by my parents” situation.

For years I was mentally abused by them, confirmed by an specialist. 

Now they have “changed” and claim that they have always wanted the best for me. They buy me presents, and insist in me majoring in bio Medics 

The problem is, when I was a child and I felt down, my parents would ground me. I wasn’t allowed to cry or be noisy or play like a normal kid. 

This led me to trying to end my life at the age of 8. And for ten years I would hurt myself and never dared to tell my parents. I suffered in silence, praying to god to kill me, cutting myself, having problems at school, etc. 

I wrote other two letters to say goodbye and for some reason never did.

I even had panic attacks and do you know what they did? They grounded me for having panic attacks, they said I was ruining the day, being selfish and dramatic. 

Last year I tried to kill myself again and ended up in a hospital por ten days. 

Then I was a new person. I loved me and life. Everything was great until quarantine. I started helping around the house, doing chores. But whenever I did it wrong or forgot about something my parents would tell me I was lazy and would never succeed in life.

I feel so many things now. I feel like I hate them, but at the same time I feel like I owe them. Even worst, whenever they say bad things about me, I believe them.

Finally, all I can do is smile and pretend as always, however I’m starting to lose hope."
54,Hyper Sensitivity?,"So idk what to even ask or what the purpose of this is but I guess I just want to vent. 

I was working nightshift when a lady walked up at around 5 am waiting for a Train. I asked if I could help her but she said she was only waiting. I noticed she was wearing sandals without socks while it was almost freezing outside. I offered her to go into my store until the trains ride so she can keep herself warm but she refused.

She could speak very well and seemed to be very smart so I wondered why she looked like she had been out on the street for a long time (no offense). I asked her and she told me the story and without going into much detail, she just had so many misfortune in life and was wronged so badly that I just felt this utter sadness for her. I offered her all the cash I had on me, which was 20 bucks, but she refused. 

We talked for about an hour after which  my boss came. She told me to act like she was just some crazy lady and that I was sending her away so I didnt get in trouble with my boss. I felt so bad she thought that I'd to that for my own namesake? She was such a nice lady and I can't help but feel sadness.

On my way home I was on the verge of crying because of how bad I felt life had treated her. When I got home I let loose. I seem to have multiple encounters where people like that really pull a string on my heart. I thought I'd post it here because Idk where else I could post sth like this. I dont even know if what I am feeling is abnormal or not. Just wondering about  you guy's opinion I guess"
55,One of my online friends is obsessed over roleplaying in a bad way. I need advice.,"My online friend is a female who loves to RP with a group of friends, with me included. But, recently she spams me and the group on discord with pings and such, demanding to roleplay. When I said that I was starting to become unmotivated and might quit roleplaying, she reacted unhealthily, saying it was a loop and asking why she even tries. Her wording makes it sound she is really desperate. I really need help with helping her. She says she's trying to get professional help, but I don't know if she'll even get help before she does something dangerous. I'm sorry if I worded this pretty bad, I'll post screenshots if needed."
56,Winning Depression,"Does anyone know of any videos of people who have overcome come depression succesfully and is told in a narrative way like weightloss or muscle gain vids.

I'm working on it everyday and I've had it my whole life. Ive seen incremental progress but just like Ethan's story is inspiring, I think I would get more empowerment from others that have conquered it and are thriving. Any suggestions would be awesome"

58,Do you think I have OCD,"I might just be very paranoid or something, but every night before I go to bed I need to check like everything and make sure it's perfect. I have to check every door. I have to turn the lock as far as it can go and press the door multiple times to make sure it is in place and not like half open even though I already pressed it and it is clearly not open. (I think I might have even broken the lock to one of my doors because it turns a lot farther than the locks to the other doors and feels a bit loose). I have to check downstairs and make sure nothing bad is happening and making sure nothing is like on fire even though it's completely irrational because nothing can just like spontaneously combust out of nowhere. I have these light switches that are circles and you twist them to adjust the light level and when you turn them off they click. I turn them off and I hear the click, but it has to be perfect for me to be satisfied. If it is slightly to the side of being turned on even if it hasnt clicked on, I have to click it again and turn it as far as I can to the off side. And sometimes even when it is perfect I turn it back on and off again. One of my biggest fears is my house burning down, so I always check my oven. I have to make sure it is off and that its not hot, and I always check the outlets in my kitchen and make sure everything is unplugged and I put my hand on everything to make sure it isnt hot, like the toaster, microwave, rice cooker, stuff like that. And even after I do all that  I sometimes get to the bathroom and after I brush my teeth I feel like I have to check it again even though I already did. I have even tried recording myself doing all of this and checking it all but watching it later in bed to make sure its ok doesn't satisfy me. I make myself get out of bed and check everything again. But the confusing thing is I only get like this at night. I never have to check and double check things during the day, its only before I go to bed at night. If I dont have OCD what could be wrong with me? Why does this only happen at night?"

61,I’m done.,The last 3 days have been especially horrific. I didn’t go to work today. I didn’t sleep last night. I kind of feel as though I’m on auto pilot. I don’t want to do this anymore.
62,I had a huge fight with my dad and now I feel at peace.,"I have suffered with depression and anxiety all my life, and I guess as a result of this, I also have a short temper and get angry really quickly. And during lockdown, I have been fighting with my family. A lot. Especially with my dad. About everything.

Yesterday we probably had the worst fight ever, and while I usually accept that I am often to blame, I know for sure that this wasn't my fault. I - honestly - don't know what I did to cause my dad to get this angry with me. I am just so tired of it. And the whole of yesterday, I felt absolutely awful. I haven't cried this badly in years, to the point where I felt absolutely drained and exhausted and sick to my stomach because of it. I was so tired that I had to pause my studying and sleep for an hour or two (I normally never take naps), and kept thinking about ending my miserable life, what with having no close friends and a family that doesn't love me. I cried myself to sleep and had a nightmare about my dad hurting me physically. 

However, this morning I woke up, earlier than I have in ages, without feeling tired. I don't think I can even remember the last time i DIDN'T feel tired. And, for a lack of better words to describe what I am currently feeling: I feel totally at peace. I don't feel like crying, I don't feel angry, I don't feel any extreme emotions. I just feel like yesterday didn't happen, all the fights before didn't happen, like I just have a normal life with no mental illnesses or problems. I dread leaving my room and having to face my family, because I don't know how I'll react. I just want to stay in my room forever and be at peace, alone, and feel this feeling forever. I don't want to feel like I did yesterday ever again. I want to get better."

With this whole quarantine thing, I've got two problems. I'm having a lot of schoolwork and it's all in a very short timespan. They're all not very hard to do, but I feel like the sheer amount is stressing me and I've been very anxious whenever I'm not doing it.

Well, that was the first. The second one is that whenever I **do** start doing the work, I end up spacing out or just procrastinating by closing the tabs and doing someting else. And never actually finish it. So it goes on a loop of getting anxious because I didn't finish it, picking it up for 3.5 seconds and giving up again.

I've seen two in the past. The first one spent less than 10 minutes with me and told me I have bipolar and put me on lithium. He was so cold and rude and didn't listen to anythung I said.

The second one was also a male (I'm a female), didn't seem too interested and didn't want to take me off the lithium even after saying he doesn't think i have bipolar (which I agree with). I had one bad session when I was extremely low and I didn't say anything. He told me to come back when I actually want help.

My experiences are bad and I'm nervous to see another one. I told my go I'd rather see a female but there aren't any that I can afford around here. 

Does anyone have any positive experiences? I'm worried about seeing one again"
66,Do I need help or am I being ridiculous?,"I keep having days where every little thing frustrates me or stresses me out. It builds up until I end up sobbing and I get so mad and disgusted with myself that I imagine tearing at my skin or vomiting, whether I feel sick or not. Sometimes when the emotions get too much I bite myself or pull my hair. The thing is I don't have any past trauma or anything. My life is good. I can still feel joy, sometimes I can get so happy and bouncy it's like i'm high and out of breath. But then something as simple as dropping an object or having to make a phone call will almost send me into a sobbing fit. I also keep having instances where I get angry or irritated for no reason and I get rude or mad at my loved ones for no reason. It makes me feel awful and then I feel disgusted with myself again. What should I do? Am I being ridiculous? I've always been over emotional but this is too much."

68,Has anyone survived a hanging?,I was just wondering if anyone has attempted to gang themselves and what their experience with it was like. I have a massive phobia of suffocation so does anyone know how to simply block the blood flow to the brain rather than cutting off the airway ?
69,I can’t tell if I’m depressed or just telling myself I am,"Hi I don’t know why I’m doing this, I just need help I guess. So for a long time I have had many things I want to do in life, and I enjoy them, but suddenly I can’t bring myself to do anything. I have read a bit on symptoms of depression, lack of interest, slowness, tiredness, etc. I pretty much check all the boxes except for self harm, a few years ago I considered suicide, but I was also dumb and in 7th grade. Anyways i side tracked, I have most symptoms of depression, and I feel like I’m depressed, but every time I feel like this, I also feel like I am convincing myself that I am, like I’m for some sick reason wanting to be depressed. Like consciously I don’t, and I consciously feel depressed, but in the back of my mind I get mad at myself because part of me thinks I want to be depressed. Like, I feel like if I’m contemplating this then I’m probably not, but then why do I still feel depressed. I can’t figure it out for the life of me, and it’s stressing me out, and making me dislike myself more than I actually do. Sorry if this came out sounds edgy, I don’t really know how to express what I’m feeling without sounding like that. Anyways if anybody has some wisdom or experience with this, that would be great so I can figure my shit out. Thanks."
70,Mental health &amp; the coronavirus - Looking at Illinois' response (letter to the editor),"Hi everyone,

I'm a current MSW student in the state of Illinois. For one of my courses, we have to write a letter to the editor as an assignment. I wanted to share it here in case anyone was interested in reading it!

On April 11th, Governor Pritzker announced the development of a new mental health text hotline, *Call4Calm*. This hotline, available in English and Spanish, allows for Illinois residents to connect with health care professionals in their area by texting a word to a phone number. Call4Calm having a potential large clientele (with diversity of spoken language), is a small step taken to combat the intersection of the coronavirus and racial socioeconomic disparities. Black and Latinx individuals are dying from COVID-19 at disproportionately higher rates, and it is impossible to get country-wide death rates due to a lack of data from individual states and counties. 

The coronavirus is changing how groups of individuals interact with one another; for example, the Latinx community greet each other with a kiss on the cheek, and they cannot do that anymore without imposing risks to their health. These small routine changes have an impact. In a survey done by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 49% of black and 48% of Latinx respondents said that the coronavirus has had a negative impact on their mental health. The total is 44% among white respondents. While there is a small gap in the survey, it is important for service providers to acknowledge this gap and ensure that their continued service deliveries exist gap-free, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, or immigration status. A great and simple resource for anyone to educate themselves on minority mental health disparities is an article on Mental Health Disparities created by the American Psychiatric Association.

Here are the sources I've included in the letter if anyone is interested in reading them:

71,How am I supposed to be happy?,"How am I supposed to be happy when every day I wish I were someone else?

How am I supposed to be happy when everything I do validates that I've accomplished nothing?

How am I supposed to be happy when there is not a single thing I like about myself?

&amp;#x200B;

Every moment of my life I spend in my head pretending that I'm someone else. I've never wanted to actually be myself. I can't just look in a mirror and be satisfied with who I am, because I have no reason to. I'm not healthy, productive, kind and I'm getting the grades I could. I can't change who I am, because I don't have the willpower and I'm just too lazy. No matter how much I want to change I can never actually bring myself to doing it. It's just a never-ending spiral of self-hatred when I'm aware that I want to change and that I hate the person I am, but then never do anything about it. Then I just hate myself even more. It's quite literally exhausting thinking about myself because I just get so upset. I can't name a single thing about me that I prefer over someone else.

I am having problems with my PTSD which are causing my nightmares, so I am not surprised by the fact they are occurring, but do not know why I can physically feel the pain. I can’t even describe how excruciatingly painful it feels.

I can also feel every emotion in my dreams, they are extremely vivid and I am often unable to differentiate dreams from reality anymore. This is terrifying and I am worn down. I hate sleeping because I know what will come. Why is this happening and is there any way I can stop this?

It hurts so bad. I’m miserable. Please help.

76,Does anyone know what the best option is?,"I’ve been going to a couple counselors recently, and it’s helped just being able to talk things over and get it all off my chest. But, over the past couple weeks, I’ve noticed more and more things inside my own mind and body that I’ve never noticed before. Insomnia, depression, and anxiety have all been things I’ve struggled with for a long time, but now I find myself often breaking into fits of rage followed by immense shame and regret, more common flashbacks, mood swings like I’ve never felt before and just overall a total shift within myself. 

Sometimes talking it out helps but within only a few minutes I’m back to normal and it becomes more and more dreadful. I’ve never self harmed nor been suicidal, but I start to get this feeling when I get anxious like there’s something in my skin and I need to rip it out. I find myself scratching at my arms and rubbing them vigorously. There’s other things like that but that’s just one example. Another is sudden episodes of intense neck twitches and muscle spasms. 

The counselors help I guess but it’s mostly just there to help manage stress rather then help with other things. Is there a specific person I should go see instead to talk about these problems? I’ve brought them up to the counselors but like I said it’s more driven towards stress management. I’m tight on cash, especially with this pandemic happening, but I can feel something inside of me quickly falling apart and I’m afraid that at any moment somethings going to snap"
77,I feel like my brain is decaying,"I dont know whats wrong with me or how to type this out, if im overreacting at my issues or whatever but i’m considerably freaked out right now and fucking confused. 

I’ve been living in a fog for so long. I don’t know how to describe it well but I know that many people feel it too. I feel like my consciousness is plunged into murky oil, like I can barely see in front of me at all in a sense like i’m winging everything. I have no plan for my life or have any idea what to do, it feels like im blindly following my idea of being a musician but i feel like i’m gonna fail miserably. 

The worst part is it feels like i’m getting dumber every single day. Since quarantine started ive been sober the entire time and I guess i’ve become more productive but my brain has gotten dimmer I guess, i’m less creative, my attention span is worse, my anxiety is worse, Im constantly staring off and thinking and those thoughts take me nowhere, i feel mentally handicapped. In social situations it shows and I feel so pathetic because of how dumb im acting and how terrible I am at being normal, and idk if its all just in my head or if its how I actually am because idk how other people think and whats the normal way to be. 

I’m currently having an anxiety attack because I read an erowid story about someones experience huffing gas. He only did it around 10 times and had noticable brain damage shortly after and got leukemia from it. When I was younger (around 12) I did the same thing about the same amount of times, and im worried i’ve just fucked my whole life because of it and probably immensely shortened my lifespan. Ive read that the chemicals from huffing gas permanently affect the chemical balance in your brain so ig i am just fucked. I was always told I had so much potential but i guess ive been a loser from the start. 

Idk though. Nothing makes sense in my head anymore it seems. Ive lost all sense of direction. I feel like just ending it all or begging somebody to help."
78,[Content Warning: Suicide] Did something I set out to do almost a decade ago after trauma set me back,"I was a freshman undergraduate in 2011. My expected graduation was initially in spring 2015. Late in my junior year - 2014, my uncle killed himself. Then my moderately wealthy grandmother died, and her daughter, my aunt, immediately set upon taking advantage of my grandfather's dementia to make him fear my father and my sister and me, before I could even process my uncle's suicide. 

I ended up driving back home from one semester of college 4 times to testify against my aunt, who by mid-2015 was trying to confuse my grandfather about basic concepts in hopes of getting a signature on a will she'd written. I had no concept of mental health, no understanding of my needs at the time. I numbed myself. It took a long time to get to the point that I could take a clear look at myself. 

Now it's 2020. I'm interviewing for my dream job. I live with the woman of my dreams. I was caught in one loop for over 9 years, damn near a decade.

Then the loop ended, and I exited into something beautiful.

Wait it out. Alright? Endure, horrible as it is. I can't guarantee tomorrow will be easier. But today's pain -- it can make tomorrow's pain easier, if that makes sense. It can. And then the third day's even easier.

Just stay in the game."
79,How do i confirm I exist,Everything gets closer and closer to a video game every day. I'm not sure what emotions I'm feeling. Everything becomes more and more numb. How does society work if every-one lives like this. I'm a consciousness floating above my body. Do I exist? How do I know you do. Why should I try to act normal when nothing acts normal. I don't want to act normal. I have to confirm my existence
80,How to get rid of delusions/fantasies/intrusive thoughts?,"On my throwaway account because this is awkward... I've been diagnosed depression/anxiety and have been told by therapists that I'm high enough functioning that I shouldn't worry about any further diagnosis even though theu admit there may be something there.

I'm happily married with a newborn child, but for some reason I can't get my wife's best friend out of my head. We're close and good friends as well, but nothing more. Never have been, never will be. But for some reason I can't really make myself believe she doesn't secretly love me. I find her attractive and part of me wouldn't mind something coming of it, but I'm loyal to my wife and just want to be normal for once.

I should also note that I'm a porn addict attempting recovery. Logically I know this other woman probably just views me as a friend and would be disgusted if she knew I thought of her like I do. I feel like an asshole and I just want it all to go away. These fantasies that feel like they are truth are making me want to kill myself. I don't want to cheat and I don't want to feel like some kind of pervert for crushing on my wife's best friend.

I've tried ignoring her and the thoughts but they don't go away. I've tried writing my thoughts down but suffice to say it wasn't a healthy outlet. I'm barely able to make it a few days without porn, much less these intrusive thoughts. I'm honestly at the point where I just want to kill myself rather than running the risk of my delusions taking over too much and accidentally saying or doing something terrible.

I know this may just sound like some horny asshole to a lot of you, and trust me, I think the same thing sometimes. But I'm really trying to not be any of that because I really want to be a good husband and father for my child. How do I stop the intrusive thoughts short of a shotgun in my mouth?"
81,People think I’m having delusions,"It's stupid in even posting this but I don't really know. I don't really know what world I live in. People think in having delusions and it's getting me paranoid that I am. But I don’t think I am, but if you look up “delusions”, it’s the same things I’m thinking, but like it’s different. I mean, maybe the people at the therapists office are lying. (Not any of you are but maybe you were taught wrong). I haven’t had any thoughts about killing people, or well that’s not a sign but you know what I mean. But I'm serious, the people who think that are the ones who understand our reality! I’m not crazy, that may sound weird I’m not. I should just stop writing. I’m probably not, or y’all are just lying. My thoughts are probably just mixed up. I don’t know"
82,Feeling down after being in water?,"I’ve kind of always had this issue as long as I can remember. Whenever I go swimming, or sit in a hot tub, or anything outside of showering that involves me being in a body of water for a long time, I start to feel really down after about 30 minutes, or right when I get out. I’ve asked friends about this and they all have no idea what I’m talking about. I’ve tried googling around and can’t find anything either, in fact results say that swimming should have the opposite effect. I was wondering if anyone else experiences this or knows anything about it. Thank you!"
83,Craving Morphine after a single use in a hospital.,"Hey all. Last year I had some unexpected surgery to remove my gallbladder because pain from stones had become unbearable. I had morphine once in the ER and it wasn't even a large dose. After that they gave me Delotid (sp?) for the rest of my stay until the surgery (around three days stay). Since then I've been craving morphine like mad. It felt amazing. None of my aches and pain existed anymore and I felt happy and peaceful for the first time in more than two decades. (I'm 28, diagnosed depression/anxiety really young) My family has a history of addictions and I even have a personal history. I don't really know what I'm asking unless y'all have a good way to cut the cravings, but I just needed to vent to people that might understand."
84,"Therapy is good, you should try - but sometimes it isn't.","A quick background - grew up dealing with a fair bit of shittiness in school and with my family, could have been better, and bar some NSSI issues when I was young, could have been a hell of alot worse too.
Anyway, generally never caused me any problems beyond anything minor shit that didn't really matter. I was fairly happy once the bullying stopped and I made friends. Depression hit in my final year without me even realising it, made worse when my grades slipped after years of working on them - mint that everyone just got disappointed and stopped caring.

Entering a useless degree made it worse. Then shit when south at home. I hit pretty low, self-injury got real bad. Finally reached out to get help - had all my darkest secrets spilled to my boss, co-workers, friends, family, people who should never have known then stuffed into the mental health plan system with drugs that didn't work an a therapist who was nice but wanted you off the list the moment you had a good day. I was going for six months and only saw her 12 times, she kept trying to fix issues that weren't there, passing half-diagnosises - things you couldn't manage in half-an-hour. I don't blame her, although the goverment pays, she had a tiny office, tons of patients and no equipment. She could have made more money working for a private company, she would have done well, yet she dedicated her time to helping the battlers and the workers.

I think overall getting help made it worse. I was pretty calm and wellbalanced when I wasn't in a dark place, I tolerated people, I could motivate myself - I didn't hate myself as much. 

Now, I'm the opposite. I'm an angry, stressed, anxious mess and I've gone back to my shitty coping tools. I don't have a good excuse to be feeling this way, I've turned lazy and unmotivated. There are people out there who have it so much worse.

Therapy is good and you should try. 

Shitty therapy isn't, I wish I hadn't had been so lazy and helped myself instead. 

I'm trying to change myself, but I'm not sure I'll ever be who I was."

86,You have a purpose,"Just think about it why would god have put you on this earth if you don’t have a purpose, Insects even have a purpose, you might not think you have a purpose but that is because you don’t have faith in it, as long as you wake up and live life you will find your purpose and it will be worth it."
87,Scar Tattoo Cover Up,"This is actually my first reddit post (I’m almost 30) 🙃 I had a pretty bad and unprecedented episode that lead me to harming myself. It’s not that it has never happened before, it just hasn’t happened since I’ve grown and have found a great combination of meds. I already have tattoos on both of my arms, and wanted a sleeve anyways, but now I want one more than ever to cover up my “quarantine scars”

I don’t need to explain to any of y’all how hard this is, with mental health issues or not. Personally I’m diagnosed as Bipolar II and with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I’ve actually been doing very well, and am ashamed of my recent event. I have always used art, and thus tattoos, as a way to not only cope with my mental illnesses, but to move forward and don’t beauty in life. I live in Austin,Tx if you know of anyone who would like to help me when this is all over and tat shops are open that would mean the world. I’m a social worker, and my husband (we got married on our porch two weeks ago) got laid off. I can totally pay for a tattoo but not for TWO (one for each forearm) 

Let me reiterate that I have NO IDEA how reddit works. Is anyone else struggling the way I am? What’s up nerds?? I hope y’all are thriving any way you can?"
88,My Stalker is threatening to commit suicide...,"I have no idea what to do at this point. This is the first time he has ever threatened to harm himself. 

A little background: I have been cyber stalked/stalked for about 2 years now. He was a former friend because he sent me unsolicited nude pictures of himself and confessed that he is ""in love"" with me. I tried to nicely reject his advances but it came to a point where I was so uncomfortable I decided to just end the friendship and ask him to not contact me anymore. Most of our communication was through social media, because at the time I was out of the country, but now I live about 2 hours away from his home. I blocked him on all social media accounts and have put them all on private. I figured he would no longer contact me but he would make fake accounts and message me through them, begging me to speak to him and such. He even writes my name in his bio on twitter, as well as correlating his background photo to whatever photo I have up... It didn't seem as bad until he showed up at my place, unannounced couple months ago when I nor anyone I know gave him my address. I was luckily not at my place at the time and the police ended up getting involved. During this time, he messaged me begging me to come outside and see him. That he paid over $200 on Uber to see me. He ended up leaving the front of my apartment, so he said in the messages, around 12-1 am, even though the officer I talked to told me he would make sure he wasn't near my apartment. Couple weeks after that, I had posted a clip of my boyfriend and I, and somehow he saw it (I'm not sure how), and he sent me a bunch of erratic messages threatening me and my boyfriend. I am in the processes of getting a protective order but two days ago he made another fake twitter account and messaged me from it and when I went on the account, I saw that he had turned it into an account that's all about me. He is basically tweeting at me... 

So, about an hour ago, he tweeted that he wants to kill himself and that he feels that it is the only option at this point because I am not responding to him and have avoided his messages for 2 years. I have been advised to not respond to any of his messages and to proceed retrieving the protective order by multiple lawyers, but I don't know what to do now. I can't read that and not do anything about it. I'm conflicted because I don't want anything to happen to him, yet he has put me and the people I love in danger and I feel maybe he's trying to lure me? Maybe manipulate me into contacting him? I'm not sure. I am trying to reach suicide hotline, but I felt I wanted to get my story out there somehow to see if anyone else had any other advice for me. Thank you in advance if you take the time to read this."
89,"I think my mother is sick, don't know how to help her","Hello everyone!

I created a new account to post this because it's very personal. I need help with my mother. 

I'm adult, I have moved out from my parents' house years ago but came back for the quarantine, thought it would be nice to spend time with them. Not so much anymore. One of the reasons I wanted to move out was not only university but my mom. We always had huuuge fights, to the extent that one time I have spent a whole month sitting in my room alone afraid to go out. I know she loves me a lot, she had me after years of trying but ever since I can remember she could be lovely and then sth happens and she snaps. When I was a child sometimes it was so nice but other times she gets so angry I have no idea what about and she gives me silent treatment and makes me sit in the  basement. When someone said to her she's wrong, it was a disaster. She always feels attacked. The way she behaved anytime we had an argument, like ingnoring me for weeks after the fight made me scared of even going to kitchen because she might be her. After some time she would let me apologize to her and it was back to good. When I moved out our relationship got much better. We would see each other just a couple of times a year, we would talk on phone a lot. I could finally live my life, have friends, go out. She never let me. When I wanted to go out she would make me feel guilty that I leave her. I had zero friends, none. I was scared of telling her anything, I was embarrassed of the things I like because she would mock it. But I thought our relationship got better. Now I'm back and it happened again. She is always so inconsiderate of others, my dad included. I commented on that and it was enough, she got angry and started shouting at me. She said she hopes she dies soon so we won't be taking care of her cause we are so awful. Now we don't talk, just as before. I am tired of this. Everyone is always tiptoeing around her because even small thing can make her snap. She is always a priority, she expects everyone to respect her and let her do everything but when it's other way around she's a bitch. I observed she tries to mock my dad all the time. Just watching them interact sometimes makes me cry. We always have to watch out what we say or how we behave because even a small mistake (like occupying the bathroom) would make her angry and cause a huge fight. She's never guilty, she never said sorry ever. It's always someone else not her. She guilt trips everyone and tries to manipulate others. Once she said she wanted to divorce my dad because of me, because I made her angry. I've had a serious depression since age 4 because of the way she behaved around me. And I've never had fights with anyone but her. It's always her, she argued with her mom, sister, my dad, me, my brother.  I seriously started to think there is sth going on with her.  I can't take it anymore. We could just cut her out but she's my mum. When she's in good mood she's great, she helps me, cares about us and it's just nice when we sit together watch a movie and have fun. It seems to me she doesn't see how she behaves AT ALL. It's shocking to me how one time she's nice and other time she can say really awful stuff. I want to help her somehow but I'm afraid suggesting her anything would make things even worse. Please I need some advice."

I was seeing my doctor for 5+ years before the pandemic hit and I eventually stopped going a few months before all this went down. Why? I don’t know. I really don’t know. And I don’t know how to explain that to him. I guess the medicines stopped working like they used to and instead of going and telling him I didn’t go at all.


Now I’m 2.5 months into this pandemic with no job, social life, or end in sight. I see my unhealthy coping mechanisms coming back and I really don’t know what else to do. The website for the place I go to says they are still accepting phone/video meetings. I guess I’m just scared. Nervous, embarrassed and scared. 


I didn’t think I would have to go back on medications and I really don’t want to but at this point I feel like there is no choice. I’m really losing myself right now and if anyone has any words of encouragement or any advice about how shameful it feels to go back to your doctor like a stupid fucking dog with its head tucked between its legs... please share it with me. 


Sorry for this sappy post, I am really just struggling. I wanted to be able to handle it on my own and as it’s turning out that I can’t. This is so fucking embarrassing. I’m really disappointed. I just can’t live like this and I’m really trying not to die here. I feel so fucking ashamed."
95,What the fuck is depression anyway?,"Are there any online resources that actually explain what this shit is? Not ""You are sad. You need therapy"". I need information. I quit therapy because the therapists refused to offer ANY kind of information. I wasn't there to talk. I was there to learn."
96,Interesting symptoms,"USA.

Documenting this for you guys:
State: It's late at night, i'm tired, restless
Intermittent since childhood. Typically at night during insomnia.

I believe this is called Alice and wonderland syndrome. But Im going to describe some of the symptoms I'm having at the moment:

Extreme hyperfocus on objects (text on phone), typing on keyboard. Almost a tunnel vision effect, but peripheral vision is fine.
(huge symptom) Thoughts and sounds feel like yelling/screaming ALL the time. Thoughts are ""stuck"" in yelling mode.
Loops of delayed screaming thought effect- disturbing, unsettling feeling.
Ringing in ears is exaggerated, slight. buzzing sensation
Everything is perceived larger than normal
Delayed screaming sensation after  thought.
panic feelings
very slight dizziness
Long stares
Feeling like I can snap out of it if I distract myself
Pulsating feeling (not strong, just subtle) in head
Imagining the sound of crinkling paper to be largely exaggerated. Drips would also be over exaggerted
Everything feels longer, time slowing sensation


No hallucinating, strobing, color changes, reality loss, no visual tracers, no pain, body function loss or seizure.

happens at night with very little sleep.

Lasted about 30 mins, and it's completely controllable. I can ""snap out"" of it if I just distract myself for a while, get some water, stop focusing on it.

Has happened throughout my childhood, very intermittently. Rare.

What do you think? Every had this?"
97,I've always been mentally screwed up,"Sometimes I don't even see why I should try. I have always been suffering in one way another. When I'm happy I'm obsessively ruminating about my fears and can't really enjoy what I'm doing, when I'm not obsessing I'm depressed. I'm also addicted to drugs and I am going through a breakup. I'm seeing a therapist but I can't tell if it's helping. I just feel so hopeless and have lost the motivation to even dig myself out of this hole, it just doesn't feel worth the struggle."
98,Need help on whether some of my thought patterns are Dangerous,"USA, I am a 15 year old male

Sometimes when I look at my imperfections (pimples, zits, bumps) I fantasize about cutting them off of my body with a sharp blade, like a chef’s knife or a scalpel. This is most commonly experienced when I have a cyst that is causing me pain. I think about the concept of self-harm fairly often, however I’m pretty disgusted of the thought of actually harming myself. I think it comes from a want to improve my image without actually putting in effort. I also pick at bumps on my skin impulsively, like scabs or pimples."
99,Need help finding therapist?,"Need help finding a video chat or messaging or something therapist, that are lgbt friendly, with options for religion and gender and whatnot, that take insurance."
100,"When I was a kid, probably as young middle school, I really wished I had a therapist so I could talk to someone and be seen, is that normal?",Seems kinda sad when I think about it now
101,Anxiety causing bowel problems or what?,"About 5 times in the past couple years I have had a week of diarrhea. Also hemorrhoid flares a few times. 

Sometimes I randomly get cramps. Sometimes my rectum seems damp or full. Sometimes it’s like I need to sprint to the bathroom, but if I stop and breathe it goes away. The symptoms virtually disappear when I calm my mind or distract myself. The symptoms come back (not always, but sometimes) as I scour google looking for answers. My answer now... ulcerative colitis. 

I have seen my GP 3 times and a GI once. All have dismissed it for hemorrhoids. They did a physical exam for inflammation... nothing. They did a rectal exam... nothing. And still, I am worried something is horribly wrong.
 

Please someone give me an answer, a coping method, anything. This is just so hard."
102,I don't know if I'm valued as an individual,"I've been having issues with my insecurities lately, I have always been somewhat okay with who I am but in the past couple of years I have either dulled myself out through constant drug use or spent too much time thinking about myself to the point where it negates and becomes a hate fest on myself for no reason.

The overthinking is definitely an issue. I have tried meditating and stopping my bad habits, but it is hard to stick to it and keep myself focused. In this time (I'm 21 so I know this is somewhat normal) I have lost a huge amount of friends, basically everyone I knew from childhood and school, and I have made new friends with my S/O friends. But then the overthinker in me tends to hit the places where I find my happiness: my relationship with my partner and my new friendships/family. Why have I lost so many people? Is it because I made a new change in my life to be happy? And why am I not happy? 

I am soft-spoken, and won't say things just to say them. And when I do speak unweildingly I regret and overthink it to the point where I hate myself in the end. When I do decide to speak in conversation, I do not feel like I am being valued for what I have to say. I most of the time will get cut off and then just stop saying what I was going to say, even though it hurts me to do this (it happens a lot). Am I just not interesting enough, or do people feel inclined to talk over me because they know I will stop talking anyways? I want to feel valued in my relationships, but I have had a hard time connecting to them because of the way I take certain behaviours in social situations I'm not used to. How can I help myself with this? How do I become a better person for myself? Because where I'm at right now I'm not happy with, and maybe I'm not trying hard enough, but I thought someone might have some advice. 

I appreciate those who read, I know it's a lot but I'm reaching here because I've found a comfort in it as of recent times."
103,When does depersonalization / derealization become a problem?,"I feel like I'm in a dream 95% of the time. I'm fine with that, it's nice. I still do everything I'm supposed to do. But lately I've realized that when I'm out in the cold I barely notice when my hands start going numb and stuff. I have to remember to hurry and get back to somewhere warm."
104,Psychiatrist acknowledged my previous mental illness diagnoses but didn't include it into my new assessment. Is my mental illness cured?,"His colleague (My new psychologist) gave me a call and said ""He Dosent think you have OCD or anxiety"" but he acknowledged the previous diagnosis of my OCD, GAD.

It has sent me into a spiral of obsession and I have been very anxious regarding the removal as I know I suffer with mental illness. I just visited my general practitioner and he said ""yes technically you still have OCD"". but it's not enough for my mind, I'm still obsessing. My GP has still included OCD in my report but the psychiatrist has not.


My mind is going crazy telling me ""well what if I don't?""   What if I never had it? What if??????!"" But I know I do. Please reassure me

Do i still have Anxiety or has it magically disappeared? Do i still have mental illness?"
105,END THIS LONELINESS,I'VE BEEN ALONE ALL MY LIFE. I'M GOING CRAZY. I WANT TO OVERDOSE. I WANT TO BE ANOREXIC. JUST END THIS LONELINESS. NOBODY TOUCHED ME IN YEARS. I WANT TO JUST DIE AND NEVER EXPERIENCE THIS AGAIN. MY BODY CAN'T TAKE THIS. IT'S FUCKING TRAUMATIC.
106,Mental illness issues,"I honestly feel that nobody cares or takes mental health seriously until it happens to somebody that they feel they don't know. I know people say they are aware of mental health issues and wanna help out, but if they think they know you inside and out they'll make out like you just want attention. Been hospitalised intensive care trying to take my own life. These so called friends were at the hospital. More bothered about taking pictures with me in critical condition. Soon as I'm out they think I'm just an attention seeker trust me when I say. I wanted to end my life not get attention you all fucked up. Sorry xx"
107,I want to rip my body to pieces,"I want to fucking wreck it, choke it, make it bleed, destroy it completely. I want to see my head get blown apart, all skull fragments and brain flowing around. I want to cut my hand and see it fall. I want to feel the blood flowing out of me. I want to see my skin turning pale as the blood leaves it and it goes cold. I want to see bones sticking out of it, finally falling completely into disrepair. I'm sick of this shell. I can't stay in it any longer. I want to gouge my eyes out."
108,Struggle to make decisions because of too many choices. This leads to anxiety...,"-Which movie should I watch next? 
-Which game should I play next? 
-This movie isn't very popular, so there is no point in watching it. 
- What if this is not the right movie and I've just wasted my time? 
- I really like this TV, but it's not popular amongst others so I won't buy it. What if the company who made the TV goes out of business? No point in supporting them by watching. 


These are just some of the thoughts I have when making decisions. I research endlessly, and at times check if something is popular amongst others before I make a decision. Even if it's not my favourite thing, sometimes I will just want what's popular. Then after making the decision I doubt myself and have anxiety. 

I just feel lost and never feel truly happy with some of the decisions I make. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
109,It's okay to cut yourself,"""But it's wrong! I have the privilege of a great support system, and therefore I can tell you it's wrong!""  


Fuck off

Some of us don't have support systems. Coping mechanisms don't work. People aren't meant to live in isolation, even though schools teach us how great isolation is from the get go. So sometimes, if no one wants to touch, it's okay to cut yourself. It's a little bit of warmth, a bit of adrenaline, a way to feel something besides nothing. It's okay, really. Fuck the privileged."
110,Laziness,"Am i just lazy or depressed? I cant get my work done. I’ve always had negative thoughts every single time. Whenever i tried to do my work, all those thoughts kept coming and keep telling me that there’s no point in doing this, because at the end im just a useless person. I hate myself honestly, and i dont know whether i had some sort of mental disorder or im just a lazy and irresponsible person. I cried every day just to think how worthless am i. I cant even talk about this to other people because all they can say is “be strong”. Im also suicidal because everything tires me so much. God, am i just a really lazy person???"
111,Future issues,"I have been mostly unstable mentally for as long as i can remember. Im not going to go explaining what i went through, iv gotten help from this community before so i will try again.
I keep hearing this ""Do what you want"" and ""Be yourself"". Like if u want to become something, you could achive it. Thats been total bull for me. I love music, iv been making music for 3 years now, went to a ""culture school"" what we called it where u dont get to learn maths or all that stuff like is all about acting and music and i was there since kindegarden i moved to that school and been there for 6 years. The school was later shutdown for lack of money and students failing main classes because we were not educated for the basic stuff that was needed for ""school"", if you catch my drift. When i moved school, i was there from the 6th grade to the 9th which is the the end of ""main school"" were im from, after that is highschool. All students there knew everything because they got to learn it and i didnt know anything, struggled to get at least least worst grade so i quit everything and started making music, for my own sanity pretty much, curing my depression was also helping. I studied networking, promotions and yet i could never get it too work, ever. No one notices me ever, in real life or on the net. When i switch to something like acting what i can do well, non of my connections could bring me anywhere and doing it all alone never worked, getting a job doesnt work cuz of my education faliure and i dont want to work in a mcdonalds for the rest of my life. Sure i can redo school but thats a whole 9 years of redo. When im done to even get a job as a mechanic, ill be 30+ by the end of it just by nonstop hard work because trying what my therapists said and everyone else saying ""you can become anything"" has failed everytime, i just dont know what to do. I dont even have the money for the education eitherway since i spent wverythinh on trying to evolve myself into the music industry. Im just at a point where, making music for myself and drinking has become my lifestyle and im just slowly waiting for liver faliure or something."
112,They never tell you how important emotional development is,"I think I knew, but I didn't know how much of a big deal it was.

And I missed it. I wasted my most important on studying, hoping that everything else will just work itself out. Become a proud member of the economy. I'm now an undeveloped, emotional wreck that's stuck in the pasrt.

Yes, I fucking got out of the comfort zone. I keep doing it every day. But it's like everything's too little too late. I can't take this anymore. Life is so fucking boring. They said life changes and is unpredictable. 

No, it isn't."
113,I don't show/feel many emotions but at the same time I don't really care?," 

I'm scared that I might be a narcissist or a psychopath

I feel emotions like guilt, self-loathing, and anxiety sometimes but that's about it. My mom told me that I am emotionless and that I look like a psycho (maybe due to flat effect?), and I haven't realized that I am like this till she told me.

This hasn't bothered me till my mom brought it up. I'm quite socially anxious and I had a psychotic episode around a year ago.

I visited a psychologist and she didn't diagnose me with anything but I feel that I may have some kind of personality disorder at least.

What can I do about this? I would like to appear more ""normal"" on the outside at least so I can hold a job."
114,My Birthday Was Ruined.,"i have this cousin, and i don’t want to mention names so i’ll call him Pete. he is 14 or 15.

my birthday was about 2 months ago, back in February. me and my cousin, Pete, decided to hang out. it was my 16th birthday and i don’t have any friends at all really, so my only option was to hang with my cousin. me and him were very close, we did things together all of the time. we’d stay at each other’s houses and our grandmothers house. 

on the 18th, which was my birthday, we decided to stay at our grandmothers house. after spending the whole day together at the mall and shopping and whatnot, we came back around 6 or 7pm. we hung out with my grandparents for a bit and then they went to sleep. 
he was sitting on a chair and i was on the couch. it was about 1am or 2, and we got into some type of argument and he fell asleep, which i decided to do as well. 

around 6am i woke up and i see him crawling on the floor towards me. i didn’t really think anything of it as he is a weird dude sometimes. so i tried going back to sleep. until he started poking me. i didn’t think anything of it once again and as he was probably just being weird. then he started touching my ass and caressing it. i didn’t know what to do as my anxiety was literally pulsing through my body and i just laid there basically losing my mind. i didn’t know what to do. i was literally frozen. he started pulling my pants down and grabbing my ass more and started licking it and kissing it (weird and gross. i know.) and he starts trying to take off my underwear. 

then as soon as he gets them off, my grandmother wakes up and he freaks out. he fixes my underwear and pants and lays in the floor. she walks in and goes “Pete why are you laying in the floor?” and he responds, “i just wanted to” and she chuckles and then the morning goes on. 

my cousin was awake and aware of his actions which really makes me extremely upset. i also noticed that when he did this, he had moved my phone away from me and turned it completely off. i don’t know why he did that but i can’t stop thinking about it. 
his older brother has done the same to me about 3 years ago. 

i’m literally traumatized and stressed out about it even though it’s been almost 2 months. i don’t know what to do."
115,what is the condition of this human being ? {me (: }," 

hi everyone !!! I had some questions about my condition that I guess some of it are concerns of a lot of people 1-is it possible and is there any case that the symptoms of their pssd start and come after months passing from stopping the med ??? 2-and if yes; is it possible their symptoms gradually become worse ??? (I'm a male in my 17 I used citalopram 20 for six months for anxiety and then after stopping it I had no specific problem and during taking it too which then after a 5 month period of being on no med I start to take citalopram 20 again for almost 3weeks {cause I had still some

anxiety }in the last days of taking citalopram for the second time I got some erectile dysfunction then cause of this {and noticing that my anxiety is more

related to maintaining some psychological behaviors and to some thoughts }i stoped it gradually; after a week of stopping it I came back to normal and had no problem sexually but after 4monthes I noticed that recently my penis has become numb to sexual pleasure and have numb pleasureless orgasms too {from brain and genital I can orgasm but during those

moments feel little to no pleasure plus that I have normal sexual functioning physically and have normal and sometimes high libido } and during those time I develop kinda emotional blunting that happened twice in different days but recently {idont have any anymore but i don't feel the pleasure that I used to do from stuffs and life and even laughing is not pleasurable much }now i suspect to different conditions that have caused these problems and I'm totally confused that winch of this it possibly is a :1-pssd 2-one of the effects of my anxiety with combination of some kinda new depression of mine 3-a condition that happens after facing chronic anxiety for long time and cause anhedonia(winch after somehow an accurate eximination i found i have psycologiclly traits and symptoms in common with these people in research ) here is the research{ [https://www.inverse.com/article/61363-stress-and-depression-brain-changes](https://www.inverse.com/article/61363-stress-and-depression-brain-changes)} what are your opinions ??? ) ha such a strange world  "
116,For depression/anxiety I highly recommend the David burns book,"« Feeling good: the new mood therapy » 

It likely will heal partly or totale your mind. I’m really excited to recommend it to you guys cause I was so down since this quarantine. I even begun to slowly contemplate death and how it could be a relief. 

And since I’m reading the book I understand so many things and cognitive bias which are the very very cause of all the suffering in depression and anxiety. 

It’s a CBT book known for being very effective and not letting anything to hazard. 

It can be found virtually on internet and practiced in the hour. Don’t lose any time and work on yourself, it’s huge."
117,"My brain is blocked, I'm trapped in head","Hello dear people,

I suffer from depression and social anxiety. Lately, I have the problem of turning more and more into myself when I'm out with people and talking with them, I'm literally introverting. I then have a complete block of thoughts and can no longer concentrate on topics or conversations. I'm somehow mostly trapped in my head and I can't think of any topic, idea, joke or anything productive or really informative. A few months ago, it was still possible for me to react with humour, to joke around, to give my opinion about something and to reflect in conversations, in order to maintain a proper conversation. Now it feels like I don't have any opininon or personality. 

Even in the university, in the online lectures or in group work, I can no longer work productively, because my head seems to be completely blocked. I can't think of anything, I can't go into the topics, I can't think about questions, I don't take anything out of the lecture despite being present all the time, because I don't remember anything right after that. Concentration is very poor in university as well as in social contacts. I can't access the thoughts or memories in my head anymore. I feel so empty, shy, anxious, sad and stupid right now. All just bad non-conducive qualities. I feel like being like that I can't offer people anything and it starts making my self confidence go even lower than it already was.

In addition to depression and fears, how can one still live properly and at least enjoy life to some extent being like this? Cognitive, mood-related and socially restricted. Has any of you had similar experience, perhaps even in connection with mental disorders such as depression and anxiety? What could you do about it to become more open and extroverted again? To be able to access the thoughts and memories in your head again? 

Is that maybe ADD already? My doctor says we should first get my depression and anxiety under control before we do a concentration test on ADD, because depression and anxiety and years of stress and the confrontation with such mental disorders also very much changes the structure of the brain and the memory, for example especially affects the hippocampus.

I hope you understand what I mean and maybe you can help me, because like this my life doesn't work according university and social life even less farther than it is possible for me anyway because of the depression and social anxiety. Now my ability to think, concentrate and remember gets less and less too. With that nowhere else do I see a reason to be proud of myself and to build up self-esteem and self-confidence somewhere."
118,"I just need advice (BTW, ignore the profile pic.)","I want to ask a few questions for advice reasons.

1. [How](https://1.How) bad is it to hear you parents say You don't look' mentally' disabled.
2. What to do if a parent or 2 won't let you go to therapy
3. How do I get therapy without my parent's consent.

119,I want something bad to happen so I can just end it.,"I have a fucked up past and my future is gonna be even worse. I just want something bad to happen now so I can end it.
And prevent it."
120,Im deppressed and scared,"Recently covid-19 has put us all into quarantine and schools have introduced online learning. For the past few months I have been doing well until now at the end of the school year in May. I really dont know how but I completely forgot about a class(I know stupid) and I think Im going to score pretty low. I've never been a bad student upholding A's and B's on average so right now I dont know what to do. Ive shot an email to the teacher who for the past week has not responded in order to see if I can earn some form of credit(Honestly just enogh to earn a B). I find myself glued to my computer, waiting for some sort of response and am mortified by the thoughts of my family, peers, and friends looking down on me. At this point I have no idea what to do. Im to paranoid to cry, Im too afraid of talking to a friend about it, and quite honestly I spend my days just taking short naps and inbetween waiting for some sort of reply. I wish I can go back in time and reverse my actions or jump whenever this blows over.

Im only in highschool so do you guys have any tips or guidance for me? Honestly Im writing this out now to bring down the paranoia so please, if you have any advice I would greatly appreciate it."
121,I’m the bad person.,"I’ve admittedly always had a crush on my friend, and she’s fully aware.  She uses this against me in a sense, and it became a one way friendship of me always listening to her complain.  (4 years)
I wanted to express something’s that were going on in my life, and she didn’t have the time of day for me.  
Last week she was on vacation (stuck with) her family and got into a fight with her mom, and said she would text me the next day and explain as she was worn out.
The next day nothing came.  I thought she may need some space.  Day 3, 4, 5– I continue following up asking if she’s okay.  But no reply.
I finally sent a voice message saying how she said she’d follow up, and never did—and it’s making me greatly concerned.
She said she’s fine, it was just another day in her life.
I tried to tell her it seemed serious, it was unfair to not let me know you were okay and keep me worried for days—just a simple text is okay.  You know I was trying to reach you and increasingly worried.  As a friend I would like some respect.
She took the opportunity to end our friendship, and said it’s because I care too much and want to date her.
I let her know I’ve been talking to someone else, and I wanted to tell her (we’ve never dated, and she doesn’t like me, don’t owe her this) before but she never let me express myself, and that’s why this conversation is happening.  As well as me changing jobs, maybe moving, and a host of other life changing circumstances.  Not because of my old feelings for you that may or may not exist, and I don’t know are true because we never explored them; but because I wanted my friends opinion who knows me very well and to help check me.

I’m tired of being the bad person for trying to do the right thing.  I’m sorry that caring to much about a friend is an issue.  I tell myself it was the right thing to do.  After 4 years of being mistreated, I finally stood up for myself.  I’m sorry I can no longer keep this person as a friend, as much as I have tried.

I never give up on anybody, or anything.  I never shut anyone out.  I would gladly give up my shirt for someone else and go without.  But I just can’t do it anymore with this person."
122,I want to hurt myself even more,"Everything is going wrong and getting no punishment, never has the feeling of friendship, brotherhood of love.
I don't think to much about life anymore it don't find mine has any value.
I hate myself and everyone hates me.
The worst is I know why everyone hates me but I am to much of a dumbass to figure out.
I want to end it to not experience it further.
I can't do this anymore"

i was watching a TV show that was bleak &amp; made me feel even more depressed. at the very end of the episode, a character turns the pages on a calendar and crosses out my exact birthday. the episode ends &amp; im weirded out. a coincidence, maybe. but i took it as a sign of the universe telling me i need to just kill myself.

i feel this a lot. what would this be called? not as in just depression but a more specific term? trying to google it doesn’t help because it thinks i’m referring to “warning signs of suicide” or psychosis."

125,Whenever my mother plays the piano it causes me emotional pain and I don't know how to deal with it,"Title pretty much sums it up. I'm a 22 year old dude still living with his family and somehow every time I hear her play it causes intense feelings of pain and frustration and I really don't know how to deal with it. I don't know why it is, I don't know how to fix it. Every time she plays I put my headphones on and blast out music as loud as I can, most of them time stuff I don't even like just the most loud and intense tracks I can find, so I don't have to hear the piano anymore. I really don't know why it is. I play the piano myself and when I play it's perfectly fine. It's the worst when it's classical pieces written in major keys"
126,I went back to drugs to feel something other than pain.,😢
127,Why do I scream?,"Help please, I need to know what this is? When I'm having a fight or just block with my husband, I will start screaming. High-pitch scream of anguish. It's so scary, it's not fair to him, I can't breathe sometimes, all I want to do is keep screaming, I'm so full of anguish, I feel like I'm trapped and I can't escape or make things better no matter how hard I try. I have breathed into a house slipper once, that helps, also husband holds me on occasion. I would like not to put us through that. I can only think maybe it's like a panic attack but I've read symptoms and it doesn't seem quite like that. Please I need to know what it is because I can't stop screaming when I'm like this."
128,I don't know what I feel anymore. I'm just numb.,"Honestly if no one reads this or responds, I feel like I just need to type this out for myself. I just don't know who I am anymore, I guess I have never really known who I am.. and I feel bad for feeling this way because it's not like I don't have a good life, I do. I know there are people out there in worse situations than I am, I feel so guilty for feeling the way I do. I just feel numb all the time, like I don't get enjoyment out of anything anymore, I beat myself up on a daily basis, I don't have any relationships with anyone cause although they cross my mind and I think ""oh maybe I should text them and see how they are"" I just dont, because, well I don't know why.. I guess no one texts me. Now I'm not alone, Im 22 and I have 3 absolutely beautiful children and a fiance who loves me for me, but I still feel so lonely. I have no friends, my partner has friends who will be friendly with me obviously, but they're not my friends.. I see everyone on Facebook with so many people to tag in funny memes etc and I have no one, Its like I'm incapable of being friends with anyone else, I have always been like this, I've always just wanted to curl up into the fetal position under my bed sheets and lie there for hours ignoring the whole world.. obviously I can't do that now with 3 kids.. and I'm weird because I'll put on a front for anyone that I love myself and think im the best and probably come across as stuck up but I'm not, I hate myself, I always have, sometimes I wish I was successful with my suicide attempt 8 years ago.. I wish my mum hadn't of found me hanging there, whenever i see another person on Facebook has killed themselves, as much as it breaks my heart for them and their families, I'm kind of jealous? I'm jealous that they no longer have to live in this shit heap of a world.. my ""depression"" has never been like this before, I was always so erratic with it, when I was depressed as a teen I starved myself, I was bulimic, I self harmed til my arms and legs were just bloody, but its not like that, I just.. can't be bothered. Doing anything. Feeling anything. I'm like dead soul still walking this earth. And I feel like I can't speak to literally anyone about this, I'm terrified if I tell someone, they will think I'm not fit to look after my babies.. and I am, they are the reason I'm still here today, I could NEVER let them grow up in a world without me keeping them safe. But I just want to die."
129,Why can't I believe in myself?,"I don't know if I have self esteem problems per se because I actually think I'm a pretty good guy. I'm a college students with great grades while also being able to work part time. I have a healthy social and physical life and I try to stick to my moral principles as much as I can.

Problem is, even though I *think* I have many qualities, I don't *feel* like I do. I feel like I should be able to work more if I planned my time better. I feel like I should spend more time studying because I barely read the mandatory material for my classes. I feel like I should go out more and enjoy my life while I'm still young. I feel like even though I've never been a better runner, I'm still failing because I stopped rock climbing and I should also do yoga, meditation, calisthenics...  


From an outside perspective, I probably have a healthy, balanced life, but it's like it's never gonna be enough. I want everything. And even if I'm actually able to improve myself in many areas of my life, I know it's never gonna be enough and I'll just raise the bar again. I could turn into an omnipotent god and I don't think I'd be satisfied with myself.  Is there a way to break this cycle? Because clearly working harder to meet my goals hasn't been working super well even thouh I've made great progress in the last few years."
130,"I constantly feel the urge to scream as loud as possible, but I can't","i feel i'm disconnected from everyone here. it's like i'm not even here and being ignored  
i really hate loud noises from any kind and it's being hard to stay well at home. some of them talk really loud, and the others leave doors opened... this really makes me frightened  
also i'm seeing my psychiatrist by video call, it's awful having to vent out loud with 11 parents living here  
(sorry for my bad english :( i just wanted to vent here)"
131,My perfectionism is getting out of hand,"Sorry for posting about such an irrelevant topic, but it's really bothering me right now. (Also, please forgive me for my my broken English, it's not my first language.)

I've always been an ambitious person with big plans and high standards, and it didn't bother me for most part, heck, I was even proud of my constant strive for perfection. But as time passed, my standards skyrocketed and my self-esteem started declining. It has come to a point where I struggle to accomplish even the most basic everyday tasks because I can't handle the thought of possible failure. People call me ""gifted"", but if my frustration tolerance doesn't improve, I'll soon be inferior in all skills because I'm unable to learn anything I'm not immediately good at. I've considered talking to a professional, but I don't think I'll actually do it because there are people with serious issues who need those few therapy spots way more than I do. I don't even think I would get any diagnosis, I'm really just a dumb, procrastinating perfectionist who can't get over herself."
132,Huge mistakes I have made,"I have made one of the biggest mistakes in my life last summer, and still to this day I cannot forgive myself, I dont know what to do and day by day it is eating me up inside. I know the people around me are starting to distance from me and im losing many friends because of what I have done.....help"
133,Body dysmorphia during covid19,"body dysmorphia during covid-19

Right before covid i had a back injury that put me out of commission from working out for a month. But before that, I was a regular 3-4x a week at Orangetheory / Pilates / Spin and on a very busy schedule between grad school and full time work. 

Over the last couple years I’ve experienced severe body dysmorphia.   I can’t really run outside now because road running hurts my lower back. I’m a person who needs focused classes with an instructor because that’s the only way I can get my mind to fight urges to quit running etc.  it’s been 3 months now and I feel awful. 

I’m having severe body dysmorphia challenges and thinking I’m getting very large even though I tend to walk 3-5 miles a day with my puppy and am not a total couch potato.  

Just wondering if anyone else is having similar feelings.  And those who are able to handle them, what helps?"
134,I’m not interesting sorry.,Why can’t I just nut up and kill myself? I’m done with feeling like this.
135,Isolation double edged sword,"Is anyone one else secretly enjoying not having to leave the house as much? 

And yet I worry, because I know that my social anxiety is growing and as much as my introverted self likes being a home body when I need to leave its becoming increasingly difficult to step out of my comfort zone.

I am allowed and invited to go see a small family gathering, and although I really do want to go, I am having a hard time leaving my apartment."
136,You must have at least 5 characters in your title.,"Hello, I am very mentally ill right now and I’m not sure what to do. I already have had much trouble finding proper mental health care before all of this pandemic nonsense so I don’t even know where to begin right now. I have health insurance. It’s an emergency and I need to talk with someone. 


What are some things that I could look for in my community for help at this moment in time? (Like I have no idea so I can’t even think of an example to get an example.)I absolutely WILL NOT go to an emergency room and that’s the only thing I know of that I might be able to get some help."
137,Advice on,How to heal from manipulation?
138,Communicating with family/loved ones,Does anyone have any experience communicating your feelings with family? I feel like I should express I am suicidal with my parents but don't want to worry them. I was thinking of printing out a leaflet or something to explain how I feel and leaving it out for them? Is that cold?
139,I’m really fragile and easily intimidated,"I cry very easily(I’m 14M), when I feel angry or unjust, or when I’m intimidated. I just feel weak. I cry even when I don’t want to cry. I cry thinking about previous things that happened. Not full on snot crying, but tears definitely. Is that a problem? Can I fix it without a therapist?"
140,Is something wrong with me?,"Hey community,
Sometimes I feel something is wrong with my brain. Like, most of the times I forget even the basic stuff and but some things I remember with great detail. By great detail I mean I can close my eyes and live in that particular memory. 
I mostly cannot control my actions. Most of the times, I know what I am doing is stupid and wrong but I cannot control myself. Example: I have slapped my friends N times without any such intentions.
I have a urge to breakup. I have broke up with 2 girls without any reason. One moment, I want my girlfriend with all my heart and other moment I want her to leave. 
I sometimes cannot recall how my entire week went by. I cannot recall my own age sometimes. It feels like I am living in a dream. 
It's not that I am dumb(but poor communication and language skills). I am in one of the most prestigious colleges of my country.
Should I be worried?"
141,"I keep telling myself that I'm getting better, but am I really?","I don't know. I've been gradually feeling better because I've been forcing myself to basically not think about anything so I wouldn't overthink and get sad. I went to my school's counselor a while back and she taught me to distract myself if I catch myself starting to overthink, so I've basically been doing that. I've been feeling alright but I'm just, empty I guess. I just exist.

Sometimes I'd come across posts on reddit about suicide and I'd suddenly start crying and I'll have an unbearable urge to hurt myself. I thought I was getting better but this just seemed like a sign that I'm not. I feel like I'm still ill but I'm just very successful at distracting myself.

I don't know what I'm trying to say or why I'm making this post. I really hope I'm really getting better."
142,I just wanna say bye and die,Just found out my gf was cheating.we have been together 8 years and she just dumps me like crap
143,Lost all motivation,"Hi everyone. I'm just looking for some advice or someone to talk to about this, as I'm sure I'm not the only one with this current issue.
This semester of college was quite challenging for me. The covid outbreak naturally did not help. As I finished my last virtual presentation, I felt devastated since it did not go as well as my presentations had in the past. I promised myself I would spend my new free time working on myself, a little each day, to improve my skills and habits to I can start next semester on the right track. But when I finally get my days off from work I just can't get out of bed.
I find it easier to scroll through my phone than read self-help books. Watching movies brainlessly is easier than studying for my summer classes or teaching myself a new computer program to get ahead. My room is a mess to the point it stresses me out but I have no motivation to do anything about it. I tried all the techniques I could, not using my phone for 24 hours, excersizing, eating healthy, finding ways to motivate myself. None work and I just find myself crawling back into bed when I get the chance.
Does anyone have any advice on how to get out of this rut? Or is anyone else in the same situation?"
144,How can I help my 7 year old brother?,"My 7 year old brother has been spoiled for the majority of his life and he's gotten to the point that he's clearly overweight for his age. But that's actually the small problem, the bigger issue is that he's become numb to people arguing and yelling at each other. 

My family deals with issues by either acting like they don't exist, or by yelling and arguing. I hate it, and so does my other brother. My youngest brother (7 year old) used to kind of cry and try to go somewhere quiet when this happened, now he just sits there like it's normal, and I'm scared for him.

I still try to comfort him anyways, and try to make sure he's okay because clearly I'm the only one who actually cares about his mental health. I just hope he doesn't turn out to be like me, and end up having a lot of mental issues because of this. 

I literally just want to best for him and I have no clue on how to make that possible. It feels like this household is just a house with people who happen to be related, rather than a household with a family.



A little bit of backstory, for anyone who is curious. I'm the oldest brother, 19, my other brother is 16, and this one is 7. I practically raised him, so I have a really strong sense of ""help, protect, and raise"" with him. After all, I've taught him more about life than my parents. My father is abusive as hell (not so much lately), and my mother is just honestly a toxic person to be around.

I've changed his diapers, I've fed him, rocked him to sleep, watched him for hours and hours, and helped calm him when he has one of his tantrums. He looks a lot like me when I was that age (to the point that picture quality is the only difference in our photos), and I honestly see a lot of myself in him besides that. I really really want to help him in anyway that I can!"

148,Everything Is Too LOUD!!! I Need Some Help!,"I'm not familiar with asking much on Reddit pages so forgive me if I format anything incorrectly.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an 18F and I know that I can be pretty overemotional sometimes. I cry easily and while I wouldn't say I'm too sensitive, I definitely feel deeply whenever I feel something. Sometimes this makes me feel like I'm being overdramatic with my emotions and it makes me feel bad for people having to deal with it. But in this case, I don't think I'm being too dramatic? I will explain now:

I'm a very light sleeper. Any noise wakes me up. My family (mostly my dad) tends to be very loud in the mornings, which often wakes me up. It's very annoying but my dad just says he can do what he needs to in the morning and that I should be up at that time anyway. This past year I've found however that I've become even more sensitive to all kinds of noise. Hearing loud noises or anybody speaking over a quiet tone of voice (particularly right when I wake up in the morning) immediately makes me incredibly angry, to the point where it takes extreme amounts of self-control to not scream at them to stop the loud noise. This morning I woke up to my dad in the kitchen watching a bunch of videos with the volume on full blast and my mom on a phone call speaking very loudly. I immediately felt super overwhelmed and upset by all the combined noise and started crying though I don't know why. I felt like all the noise was crowding itself into my head. When my mom came into my room a couple of minutes later, she was apologizing for startling me in the morning which I greatly appreciated but her voice in the room, even at a normal level, felt like it was so loud ringing in my ears.

This is not the first time this has happened. During the school year, some days if I was feeling sad or upset, everybody's voices would greatly annoy me, and the yelling in the cafeteria would feel so overwhelming and loud, I would go to the bathroom and cry. I read an article that said sometimes if you are under emotional stress, noises can become unbearable. Am I overreacting? Or does anyone have any tips as how to calm down from this or get over it? It's gotten to the point where I get anxious when I go to bed, because I'm wondering what loud noises are going to set me off the next morning."
149,I know I need help.,I need help. I know I do. I don't think I've ever felthappy in my entire life. Right now I feel trapped. I'm in a marriage that is not very emotionally supportive. I live too far away from any type of mental health services my only choice to to get pills from the local health department but that's not what I want. My wife tells me I just need to be an adult and suck it up. But she's the one triggering me. She makes my brain so foggy I don't know what to do sometimes because she expects me to be psychic I guess and know exactly what she meant without asking and if I do ask she calls me stupid. I thought I could do teletherapy but apparently my state doesn't allow for that so insurance won't cover it. I feel trapped and like I wish I could just get help.
150,Being sad/depressed is so exhausting,"I keep drinking coffee, but all I want to do is nap. I’ve been feeling so hopeless in my relationship lately, and I can’t afford couples counseling. I just want to sleep through life right now, and then maybe come out months later to things being better, but I know that’s obviously not a thing. I can’t communicate with him, and our sex life feels like it’s tanking. SOS send happiness and communication"
151,(18F) TW TW TW Urgently Seeking advice,"trigger warnings - sexual assault, psychotic episodes, drug use, suicide and self harm mentions

Hey guys, this is going to be a bit of a long, rollercoaster one...but I'm desperate to know if anyone has felt this way before, I'm a bit hesitant to go to the doctors for it (you'll understand why as you read). Here's a rundown of my past 5 months...

ME
First off, I have a long history of depression. I was diagnosed with dysthymia (mild chronic depression/persistent depressive disorder) and secondary anxiety at the age of 12 after years of doctors telling me my suicidal thoughts and self harming were caused by puberty. I was immediately referred to a mental health service who provided me with a youth counselor I saw for roughly 4-5 hours a week. After seeing little to no improvement after a year of therapy, I started taking an antidepressant called Prozac (Fluoxetine).
I stayed on Fluoxetine until early 2020 after deciding I wanted to be able to cope without needing medication to stabilise me for the rest of my life. Coming off of the anti depressants has been a bit rough as a lot of horrible-ness went down about the same time. It's now been about 3-4 months unmedicated.

MY PARTNER
My partner (let's call him William, 19M) and I have been together since we were 14 and 15 years old, it's been nearly 4 years of pure happiness. I cant describe the bond I have with him. Growing up I struggled with bullying and making friends but William brought a whole new meaning into my life on what it is to be a friend, to be a lover. William and I often talk about getting married, having kids, and owning our own house one day, these have always been hot topics of conversation for us. Truly, a bond like no other.
William has seen me go through some very dark depression and is the sort of guy to think ""well shes had a worse day than me, my problems arent that big of a deal, I need to look after her"". He's always had trouble communicating his feelings about anything really if he knows they're going to be a cause for concern for someone.

CAR CRASHES
The first boy I ever loved, Sam, was killed in a tragic car accident a few months after we ended things in 2016, 2 months into William and I's relationship. I was still very much in love with Sam at the time. Less than a month after Sam's death, my family and I were nearly killed when the car I was driving was sideswiped off of a motorway by an 18 wheeler truck. Naturally, both of these events instilled an anxiety in me involving my loved ones and being in/around vehicles.

SEXUAL ASSAULT
On December 23 2019, 3 days before the 3rd anniversary of Sam's passing, I was sexually assaulted by a friend of William and I's while we were clubbing with them and a few other high school friends of ours. This 'friend' - whose name I will shame till the day I die - was called ZAC. My privacy was not respected so his won't be either. Zac lured me into a bathroom cubicle and held me against a wall while he touched whatever he pleased, ignoring my repeated ""no""s and ""stop""s. I told William everything that happened as soon as I got away and found him. I struggled with the guilt and shame of what Zac did. I was angry at myself that I felt I walked into the situation and that I could've done more to fight back. Unfortunately, I was a deer in the headlights. 

PARTNER'S PSYCHOTIC EPISODE 
On January 7 2020, William and I went to his usual doctor who was supposedly ""the best doctor in the practice for mental health concerns"" as William had been feeling down and anxious the past few months but him and I had noticed an increase in these feelings since I'd been assaulted. This doctor wrongly prescribed him with an antidepressant called Citalopram. William had told his doctor that he had taken a party drug a few days before hand. The doctor knew this but failed to realise the extremely dangerous combo this party drug can have with citalopram. With the party drug and antidepressant (both being serotonin stimulators) in William's system, it triggered an undiagnosed serotonin syndrome, causing William to be in a psychosis for a month. Within that month, William's parents (who I had an awesome relationship with) turned on me and decided that it was me that caused this change in William - ignoring my cries that it was the medication reacting badly in his system. ""The doctors know best"" is what they'd tell me as he sat in front of me asking how much the government was paying me to deceive him and why no one was putting a stop to me framing my sexual assault on William. He ran away twice, tried swallowing my tablets once, crushed his phone in one hand while he was in a fit because he thought the date was not changing every day. William despised me, I looked into his eyes and they looked like huge black saucers full of absolute resentment for me. To be honest I was scared for my safety when I was around him but I would never give up on him, especially because I knew he couldn't help the manic thoughts he was having, and I paradoxically was the only one who could calm him down. William ended up being admitted into psychiatric care for a week, he told his psychologist that he'd raped me and was going to jail, and that I was abusive towards him (obviously none of this being true in the absolute slightest). Everyday he was pumped with more antipsychotics but it didnt bring my William back.
Eventually, William was discharged from the hospital, exhausted, confused and bitter as ever. Hed voiced in his psychotic state that he wanted to pack all his things and drive off to start a new life without me. That same day he withdrew all his funds from his bank account and drove off back to his home town (roughly a 10 hour drive) after telling his mum he was going to see a friend. Im unsure why she didnt raise an eyebrow and it infuriates me to this day because she later tried blaming me for the following events as well despite her not stopping him driving off even though doctors said dont let him drive. He was missing for over 12 hours when he showed up at his grandparents house. Weeks later, he explained that he'd bought 3 bottles of alcohol and had planned to walk up a nearby mountain where he'd drink and die of hypothermia. Id love to say this was a heartbreaking plan hed come up with and he never acted on it but unfortunately he started this journey. He wrote a suicide note, left all his things in his car including his keys, left the car unlocked and walked straight into the bush. It took him 3 hours in his psychotic state to convince himself to turn around.
I feel so sick thinking about any of it.

It's now been 3 months since William came out of his psychosis.
Ever since, I have had separation anxiety (especially when I know he's driving alone), endlessly blamed myself for everything that happened and for driving William to suicide, and a poor appetite (having 1-2 snacks a day). My anxiety and mood levels have been incredibly poor.
My childhood cat also passed away 1.5 months ago and it shattered my world. My best friend replaced me because I couldn't be emotionally available (i.e. go to clubs so I can watch her spend all her money on pokie machines then get in a car with her so she could drink drive us home) after the few months I'd had. Then to top it off, my family got a phone call telling us that my grandmother had only a couple weeks to live, no longer than 9 months.

I'm not at rockbottom, but I feel nothing close to peaceful. My heart, my mind, my soul is a warzone full of hurt and trauma I can't work through. My mind is constantly going full speed with thoughts and pictures and voices and feelings I can't escape. Most nights my pillow will have a familiar damp circle stained onto it before I sleep. Most days I cry when I'm driving home. I struggle talking to people because the feeling of saying something wrong in conversation, scaring them off or showing the wrong parts of me makes me tremble, my chest tightens, then my legs wont stop bouncing and I cant figure out why my breath wont steady.

I feel like a block tower, one wrong move and im a pile of rubble on the ground, waiting to be reassembled just to crash and burn all over again.
I miss feeling in control of my thoughts and emotions like I do when I'm on my medication. Am I ever going to be able to cope without meds?
I am so desperate for advice and hearing your similar experiences. The past few months I've felt more overwhelmed and anxious than I've ever felt before. 

if you made it this far, please know how grateful I am, I need someone else to hear my story so I can stop relaying it to myself."
152,Is it psychosis?,"Good afternoon every one, I'm here to please find some help or advice. When I woke up today and went to get a cup of coffee my mother (67) came to me with years in her eyes, telling something strange is happening to her. She tried very hard to explain.

She says that she will be doing something (in this instance is was mopping the floor) and that she would experience different scenes in her mind or scenarios ,jumping from one to the other. Like she is outside of herself, living all the scenes all at once. It would come and go. She would shake it off and continue mopping but it obviously was scaring her. There's no loss of memory or being incoherent. This occurred around 10-11 am. She does not want to go to the hospital just yet and she just left to a friend's house to see if she can feel better.  She says she still feels strange...its 1 pm...I begged her to to go the hospital. Nothing like this has happened to her. Please any info would be appreciated."
153,Stigmas around body hair,"i was in the shower debating if i should shave my legs or not, and even though im not gonna leave the house because of quarantine i thought “but people would find it gross if i didnt.” why is there such a bad stigma around female body hair? shaving my legs is uncomfortable for me because i get razor burn really quick, and yet people always manage to tell me i have to shave my legs to be pretty. idk, this probably isnt relevant to anything, i just had to get that out there."
154,Depressed and irritable,Why does depression sometimes show up by making me super irritable and angry with everything. Like without any warning I’ll wake up one day and everything pisses me off (no this is PMS) my depression doesn’t always show up like this so it kind of makes me feel crazy. Does anyone else experience this?
155,i can't understand what i'm dealing with,"hi, so i found this tulpa subreddit under a thread, and i genuinely had no idea what it was until i read about it. i was initially gonna post this in that subreddit, but figured just post it here, as i'm certain i don't have the whole tulpa thing. basically, i'm 16 and i have imaginary figures talking to me, and doing stuff with me, but i can't see nor hear them. i don't have an image in my head, and i don't hear voices whenever they 'speak' to me. they're not really imaginary friends to me, since i'm aware that they're just figments of my imagination, whereas people with imaginary friends tend to think they're real, and can describe what they look like, what abilities they have, etc.. i could be wrong, but it's been 13 years, and i still can't seem to stop myself from interacting with them when i'm alone. 

heres a backstory:

 i was three when these imaginary figures showed up, and i didn't really create them per se, they just kind of appeared one day, and ever since then they've been around. i remember that day so fucking clearly--i was about to sleep next to my babysitters, (both my parents had nightshifts on that day) and one of them asked who i was talking to. i just dismissed her question, and went to bed. i don't remember what happened after that, but clearly that 'talking to no one' thing stuck to me. 

i always just thought i was weird for it, but i just dealt with it and hoped that it'll leave me alone. i've been concerned about my own mental state for the past 4 years now, and i really can't see a therapist, as my parents don't believe in mental health, and my city doesn't really have actual therapists. i dealt with grooming and manipulation by an older male when i was 12, and that just made the whole imaginary figures thing worse. i was dependent on male attention, so all these characters in my head are men. in this imaginary timeline, i have 3 older brothers, and one male bestfriend. i'm an only child, so the brothers thing makes some sort of sense, but the bestfriend one doesn't. 

to be fair, it might be some coping mechanism my brain developed, as i was pretty lonely as a kid. i grew up with multiple friends, though. i got good grades, and everyone in my grade knew me, so i don't get why i still deal with this imaginary figures thing. in all honesty, they keep me sane, but recently they haven't really helped me i guess. i went through a pretty bad breakdown, and resulted to self-harm, and they weren't there. all i could hear was negative encouragement telling me to kill myself, and how easy it is to just die. this happened a couple days ago, and i'm confused as to how they didn't appear when i needed them.

anyways, i'm 16 and have a pretty solid friend group on the internet and in real life, i have a boyfriend, and i have a good reputation irl and in my community on the internet, so i'm pretty sure i shouldn't be talking to these imaginary people. i tend to forget their existence when i'm talking to someone, or if i'm preoccupied, but they somehow keep coming back. an ex told me that it probably is just some form of DID/schizophrenia, but it's really not, as it doesn't match up with the symptoms. i just wanna have some sort of clarity about it."
156,Advice on hearing someone's past,"Recently my girlfriend told me 6 years ago she cheated with her then bf, hooked up with a guy and got pregnant and terminated the pregnancy. She says her mental health dictated her decisions. I feel uncomfortable knowing that about my girlfriend and not sure how I feel about her saying it was all because of her mental health. I knew she lived a... ""Free spirit"" lifestyle before we were together but I didn't know something like this was part of it. 
Do i have a right to feel uncomfortable? Do I have a right to even have a say about how I feel in general? What could I do or say to personally and to help her feel better about this?"
157,"I don't want to, but I deserve to die","I can't see any other way. I'm scared shitless by death but my life is completely meaningless. My life is miserable. And I don't want to sound ungrateful - it's miserable purely because of myself. 


I make myself live like this every day. I'm useless and I never do anything. I merely waste time and space and food. I'm good for nothing and I will never be of use to this world. 


What's ironic is that I seem to be okay with this. I can't change. I don't think I even want to change. I get a morbid sense of satisfaction out of self-pity and seeing myself fail at everything. Maybe this is my trying to psyche myself up to kill myself one day because there's only so much hate you can hold for yourself before it's too much."
158,"Really need advice, dropped out, losing job, breakup, addiction","I am addicted to kratom and porn. I used to be addicted to harder drugs like xanax and opiates. I am also going through a breakup. I dropped out of college and I am also about to lose my job because my performance has been terrible due to my mental issues. I also have OCD and depression. I am currently following an exercise regimen which is helping but I still feel like crap. I am also seeing a therapist. I have a general plan to try to get out of this hole and I want to know what you guys think.

I find porn and kratom to be about equally destructive to my life. They both make me a shut in who isolates myself but the porn also kills my drive to do anything useful with my life. My plan is to keep using the kratom while quitting porn. While I am using kratom I am going to try to find activities I can invest my time into that are constructive and fulfilling. I will try to build a near perfect daily schedule so that when I do eventually quit kratom I won't have that feeling like I'm just waiting for the day to be over because it feels so long.

I don't know, this is just a rough outline by someone in a dark place so I would like some advice. I want to tackle this beast and i have tried over and over again but I keep failing."
159,I don’t feel happy anymore.,Lately I haven’t been having the best time. Usually I would just go to my girlfriends house for a day to feel better but she broke up with me and now I don’t know what to do. My mental health has been going down and she usually kept me together but now I feel alone.
160,"Noise disturbances at home, it’s not my fault :(","I’ve been observed by a doctor about ptsd. Due to past experiences, I’m likely to suffer from the condition. Now I’m a 24 year old female that lives in a residence hall on the college campus where I’m a student. I have hypersensitivity as a symptom of my mental health condition. I grew up on military bases throughout my childhood and was used to loud noises and constantly startled by sounds due to taps, training, exercises, and planes taking off and landing a few miles near my home. I’m sure there’s plenty to pick at my mind for all that. Anyway the room I was assigned was next to the building entrance and exit doors. There’s so much noise that disrupts my peace and quietness. Not because it’s a college dorm, but the maintenance staff has been excessively loud and rude. They have full out casual yelling conversations in the lobby of the building while on the clock. They’re noisier than the actual people that live here! The anxiety is that I’m stuck thinking that a loud male adult is going to yell suddenly outside of my room... it’s very discomforting. My heart is always on the edge of tensing up in my chest as soon as something unexpectedly crashes, slams, or yells just a few feet from my head. What is that neurological impression? It’s awful and is too intimidating to mention to the staff or the university housing administrators. All that I can infer from past complaints or requests is that if I were to ask for a change in the maintenance awareness or ethics, I would be told to accept how it is or cope with it like everybody else. These are violent noises! I can’t help that every time the wall shakes next to my bed, noise echoes from the door slams and people body checking into door handles that have been located next to my head. It’s agony. It’s like I’m suffering torture. I have nowhere else to live though because I’m technically homeless without this housing. I can’t even function as a person let alone a student due to the daily impact this is causing to my health and wellness. Where can I finally find some peace and quiet? I need a place to live that is better for my sanity. Somewhere calm. 
My heart skips a beat and my breathing pattern interrupts as soon as I hear or feel the noises on the other side of the wall. It sounds like a gun cocking and shooting every time the door opens and closes, which happens more than 20 times a day.
Nothing I have done has helped yet. I can’t reduce the noise levels nor can I prevent people from doing their jobs around me. What can I do to get myself somewhere better for myself so I can improve my mental and emotional health and strength?"

162,Jokes about mental health,"Hi everyone, I hope you're all ok.

I was talking to my dad the other day and I mentioned how I had started CBT that day and I was keen to start meditating again as it helps grounds me. He smirked and said that my therapist must have a laugh about me and my very 'Californian' mental health issues. I was really upset by this - firstly because he has no idea how much I struggle with my anxiety, as he has never once asked, but also by his reaction. He got really angry when I said 'that's not funny, that's really upset me' and said that I was overly-sensitive for being upset and it was political correctness gone mad. He said I couldn't take a joke and I had no sense of humour.

I am quite sensitive about my mental health because I do struggle, but I don't think this is necessarily a case of me being overly-sensitive? I think it was an inappropriate joke. Just wondered what your guys thoughts were on this? 

Thanks :)"
163,Something happened to me today that has completely knocked me back after about a year of solid progress,"Basically been accused of something I didn't do. Something so insignificant it doesn't even matter, but 3 strangers accuse me and treat me like a criminal. I got a bit heated, why wouldn't I, but those fucks created that whole thing. 

I'm so annoyed it hurts."
164,I don’t know if this is my anxiety and depression talking or just the truth,"I accepted a long time ago that I’m nothing more than a place holder in people’s lives. I’m around filling a gap until the person they actually need appears and then I fade into the background where I belong. And maybe that’s just how I was made, always meant to be drifting along until I fill the next temporary role. Never the best friend, never the one and only, always just a temporary holder. For friends, I fill the gaps where their real friends are busy. For my relationship, I’m a place holder until the girl he really loves and needs comes along, and when she does I won’t exist. For my family I’m a tax revenue until I’m not worth it.  It doesn’t matter how much I care about all these people. It doesn’t matter that I’d do anything to make them happy. That I give everything I have. I’m still just a placeholder. And I always will be"
165,I’m spiralling,"My stepdads been gone for two weeks. For most of the time, I’ve thought him and my mum were over. We’ve been seeing him and supporting him but he’s not been here. 
He came back last night, and that was fine. He’s still here today, and probably will be all weekend. That’s… not so fine. I think him being away, and coming back, has made me realise what a shitty toxic environment it is when we’re together. There’s been a lot of issues in the past, and it feels like with him being in and out of our lives it’s all affecting me so much more. 

I feel like I’m spiralling into a really bad place, like all those emotions and memories are back, a lot of them were forgotten about for a long time. I don’t know what I can do. I can’t expect her to break up with him… but I’m really at a point now of it being him or me. Honestly, I wouldn’t blame her if she chose him, I don’t even live locally (I’m here because of the pandemic), but I’ve always been so close to my mum and I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t come back and see her any more. 
I feel like she’s chosen him over me before, I still blame her for that even though it’s not true. So why wouldn’t she choose him again? I feel like I’m losing everything, I don’t want my mum to be alone but equally, we can’t all carry on like this"
166,Why does my confidence randomly drop?,"This randomly happens sometimes. I am feeling ok, going about my day, then suddenly out of the blue my confidence and self esteem implodes like someone punctured a balloon. A feeling of being low, worthless, self councious and just wanting to go home, cry and go to sleep hits me like a wall. But one moment ago I felt fine and nothing special has happened in the meantime. I suddenly feel drained of all energy and motivation. I have no energy or will power to keep on doing what I was doing. I want to hide. If I look in the mirror I see a fat and ugly monster, while earlier in the day I felt like I looked fine, maybe even pretty.

Why does this happen?"
167,Fear of other people,"How do you deal with the fact that you don't know other people's thoughts?

To me it's terrifying. When you're engaging with somebody, you have no idea what they are thinking. They could be out to hurt you. They could have a gun and shoot you. They could pretend to be your friend your entire life only to hurt you in the worst way possible. They could use the fact you like them to manipulate and use you. 

I've been used and manipulated a couple of times in my life. I have had people pretend to like me only to blackmail me for money later. I am also autistic, so not very natural at understanding social interactions. I have had to learn how to interact with people appropriately (and on the outside have become very good at it, to the point people think I am a very sociable person). But deep down I feel nothing but fear for the fact I don't know what the other person thinks. 

I think part of the fear comes from the very fact that I myself am never the person I project to be. I just project an image of me that I have learned works well in interactions with people, whilst I simultaneously am a different person on the inside altogether. 

How do I deal with these fears of not knowing what people's intentions are? I can never really put my love or trust with someone out of fear that they will use that to hurt me. I feel like all my relationships with people is just me acting and never truly trusting them."
168,Afraid of being alone,"When i was younger i had no problem being alone. I was home alone a lot, since my dad was barely around and mom worked long shifts so we could live well. I actually enjoyed being alone. Right now i’m in my second serious relationship and i noticed that whenever i’m alone i get really sad and realised that it has been happening since my first serious relationship. When i was single, after the relationship, i really enjoyed it, but when i think back i always had to do something or go somewhere. I would be exhausted, but i would still rather go out than stay in alone. About the same time my mom found a new boyfriend and ever since that she is barely home. She comes home like once a week so I’m basically living alone.
I hate that i can’t enjoy being alone. Do any of you have any idea why i’ve changed to that or how i could feel happy while being alone?"
169,Just got out of a relationship. She is bipolar and we are now talking about working thru things. I have depression. We are still in love.,So the relationship initially ended because neither of us were properly dealing with our mental health. We both agreed to focus on ourselves after the breakup. There are talks about working things out and trying again. We are still in love but our demons don’t play well together. My depression flaring up is directly related to her episodes usually involving pushing me away and being distant. I’m just scared that I’ll be hurt again but worse in the future. She was never getting help for bipolar which if we do try again I would have to insist that she is in counseling which she would agree too. I just don’t know if risking my own happiness for love is worth it in this case. I’ve never been so confused and lost in my own mind before. Looking for advice possibly for someone who is close with someone with bipolar. I’m just scared that it can never work and trying would lead to more heart break and depression.
170,In need of advice.,"This is my first post on Reddit. I am 23 F. I'm hesitating on posting this post because I rarely talk and interact with anyone even on the internet. 

I think I need some advice. I have gone through hard times in my life that traumatized me and I've been ignoring them because I thought they do not matter. However, it turned out that those traumas are bothering me and I still remember those hard times and cry when I'm alone, sometimes I cry myself to sleep. 

I don't enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. I am distracted and I lost interest in everything I used to enjoy. I sleep more than I need and I am going through mood swings since June 2019 and I've been having mental breakdowns. The idea of seeing a therapist is in my mind but I am a shy person who doesn't like to open up about her feelings. I rarely talk and I find it so difficult to describe how I feel. I have few friends that I had talked to about this problem, but sometimes I feel like I don't wanna bother anyone with any of my personal problems anymore. Sometimes I see myself as a  happy person and I don't need a therapist but sometimes I see myself in deep depression phases and need to talk to someone. what should I do? 

Thank you in advance!

171,"I have blocked the negative thoughts, I am trying to be positive, but now the small things are affecting me. Please advice.","I am around 30% better than what I was more than a month ago, a little bit about myself, I was in a relationship for 7 years, we broke up 3 years ago and my life had been hell since then, I lost my job, I live with my mom and grandparents and there is a lot of negativity around me.

1 month ago I contacted my ex, she said she does not wants any contact with me, I said can we be just friends, she said no, I felt awful, I asked advice in other subs and all of them told me that it would be better not to contact her and she has moved on, it really helped me to understand and those advices really helped. 

After this I have this old treadmill in my room, I am walking on it for 30 mins everyday, I am praying too and it is helped me a lot, I am not thinking about my ex, all the family problems I have and all the negativity I have around me, I have also blocked it from my head, before they used to keep on going on, but at the moment I am really successful after so many years to block them.

Now my problem is that I have become very extra sensitive, now sadly the small idiotic things keep on going on my head which are really stupid, for example I had some photoshoots of a model, she wanted them, so I gave it to her for free, in return I just asked her a normal question which is her favourite Ice Cream flavour, she just blocked me, I felt awful for 2 days and it just kept on going on my head that I gave her something for free, I did not even ask a vulgar question and she blocks me?

Other stupid things which are affecting me are is that when I finish a movie or a TV show, I feel awful for a few days, they keep on going on my head, I feel like I am the main character and basically every time the girl leaves me. These things are not even real, the real problems which I have are 1000 times worse than this but I have blocked them but these stupid things are affecting me now.

Sorry for the long post, I would be really thankful if you can give me some advices, I know I need to see a therapist but sadly I have no money and I am an introvert and have no friends either."
172,Feeling very lost unmotivated and depressed,"Hi! 
I (25) am an immigrant living on visa in the US for a couple of years. I got married last year after completing my Masters in Law. 
Since my husband is on a visa too, I cannot work. I have gained weight and that is one of the reasons to make me feel very under confident along with the fact that I dont have a job. Its not that I couldn’t but because of our immigration status I cant work at all. 
I was a very ambitious student back home and even when I came here but my relationship started to go sideways and it affected me so much that it became my first priority and I ended up marrying without any family members present just to save the relationship. I was so desperate. The silver lining is that my husband is a good man. He takes care of me and is supportive. But, I feel in the whole process I lost myself somewhere. I am become this person who wakes up with no aim, no objective. I tried doing social media also, just as a hobby since I cannot take it as a business. 
But it is not working out too. 
I literally have no motivation to do anything. My husbands parents dont talk to us because of the marriage, my parents talk but are very indifferent. I am way far from my family, friends. I don’t really have friends here and even if I try to make I feel noone would really want to be friends with me. Maybe I have a inferior complex. 
I really feel I need a mental health care but since I don’t earn I feel its too much to ask. It feels like a luxury. 
Just wanted to say it out loud here to feel better. 
Thanks for reading/listening."
173,How to Explore Emotions,"Emotions are a reaction to something that is happening in the present, but can be fueled by many different things. A popular metaphor that’s been used to explain this idea is to think of an emotion like an iceberg.

In an iceberg, Anger is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath the anger can lis fear, stress, and even past experiences. All of these factors can fuel your emotion. They can affect the intensity, duration, and even the effect of the emotion on your body.

By identifying and understanding the context of an emotion, you do several things:

* Gain clarity by giving names to the powerful forces that are affecting you
* Understand the potential factors that have fueled this emotion
* Start to develop a plan to pay down the emotional debt

## Exploring the Emotion

Emotions can be fueled by three main categories:

* Things that happen to you - Examples include present event(s) that triggered the emotional response, past events, culture, and things people have said to you. For the most part, these factors are outside of your control.
* Things you do - Examples include how you view yourself, going to the gym, and what truths you believe. There are many things in this category that you can control.
* Biological and chemical factors - Examples include the effect of [chemical imbalances in the brain on depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326475), [marijuana on depression](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/marijuana-use-may-be-harmful-to-mental-health-the-family-healthguide), and even [caffeine on anxiety](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0021-843X.93.1.120).

Going through each of categories can help provide structure whenever you feel overwhelmed, lost, or uncertain about your feelings. Here’s an example of how I’ve used it in my own life.

## Anger, Basketball, and Getting Older

I love basketball. It is one of my favorite sports in the world. I love watching it, playing it, and studying the game. In my early 20’s, I would play religiously. I’d be out on the courts three times a week even if I had a sprained finger or ankle.

But lately, I’ve noticed that playing pickup basketball hasn’t been as fun or as enjoyable as it used to be. I even found myself getting angry and arguing over silly calls. It got to a point where I started to ask myself, “Why am I so angry? Why am I even playing basketball anymore?”

This is when I realized something was wrong and started to explore the Emotion Iceberg of Anger by breaking it down into the three categories above.

### 1. Things That Happened to Me

There were a few factors that stuck out to me as to why I was getting angry. People would call fouls inconsistently. Someone would make a really physical play that I thought was dangerous. Some people with really big egos and would talk down to my teammates.

But to be honest, these things have always happened and weren’t really the root of the problem. I needed to dig deeper.

### 2. Things I Was Doing

#### I Had Unrealistic Expectations for Myself

A couple years ago, I was a pretty good basketball player. I was fast. I made 3’s consistently. I could handle the ball. I was the “go to” guy in crunch situations. But that was when I played three times a week.

Due to work and a foot injury, I wasn’t able to play basketball for almost a year. So when I got back on the court and I was missing 3’s, turning the ball over, and slow on the court, I felt really frustrated and upset.

#### I Was Overly Critical of Myself

Whenever I would make a mistake on the court, I would beat myself up inside. And because I never adjusted the standards I had, which were now unrealistic. I found myself repeating a vicious cycle:

1. Do something I used to be able to do
2. Fail
3. Beat myself up
4. Repeat

This cycle of self-criticism built up a lot of Emotional Debt of disappointment and a sense of inadequacy that manifested itself in anger.

### 3. Biological and Chemical Factors

I was getting older and I didn’t have the same stamina, response time, or speed that I used to.

This was a hard pill for me to swallow.

When I was growing up, I worked my butt off to develop the skills I needed to excel in basketball. I thought all I needed to do was put in the time and the effort. I was slowly beginning to realize that this may not be the case anymore.

## Paying Down the Debt

After going through the exercise, I realized that I wasn’t enjoying basketball as much as I used to because I had set unrealistic expectations for myself. I expected to immediately go back to the same level of play I was at before I got injured. I was also expecting my body to do things that would either take time to develop (like stamina) or is just no longer able to do.

To pay down this debt, these were the options that came to mind:

1. Put in the time to get to a similar level that I was before
2. Readjust my expectations
3. Walk away from playing basketball completely

I’m still not sure what the answer is. Maybe it's a little bit of both. But believe me when I say that it will take time for me to figure it out. Breaking old habits and expectations will be hard. I also wouldn’t be surprised if there were deeper emotions and themes I need to explore as well. But I have peace of mind now knowing that I have a path forward.

180,What seems to be the problem?,"I’m having a bit of an episode right now. For the last 4-6 weeks I’ve been pretty depressed, had low moods and have been completely burying my head in the sand with regards to social interaction/university communication through texts, emails etc. 

I can never decide whether my feelings or actions are valid or whether I’m just being lazy and using my previous bad spells as a way of justifying what’s going on, ie “I was depressed before so I must be depressed now”.

I’ve been lacking motivation to do just about anything: (as already mentioned) replying to emails/texts (this has actually caused great anxiety/dread for a while), getting out of bed in the morning, showering/dressing, catching up on my coursework that I’ve missed. I’ve not been eating or exercising enough and I’ve been sleeping too much. 

I’ve also been thinking about suicide a lot. For years and years I’ve had suicidal thoughts on and off, but recently it’s been almost a daily occurrence. I feel as though things would be better and everything that’s weighing me down would disappear if I did too. The only difference is that before, I felt as though I could really go through with it and I could almost plan it, whereas now I’m thinking about suicide a lot but don’t feel as though I could or would actually go through with it. 

I’m finding it difficult to know what the problem is and whether or not my feelings are valid."
181,Wanting to go home,"Hellooooo,

I  experience this very heavy feeling if wanting to go home, and to my mom even though i am “home” (as in at my house with my mom) im crying very uncontrollably towards my mom and keep saying that i want to go home. Its like the feeling if being a child thats in a uncomfortable situation wanting to go home and to their mom because that is associated with comfort and being safe. I experience this quite a lot, i don’t know what to do with it or where it comes from all i know i that i want to go home and to my mom"
182,"My inability, or laziness, to speak.","For a very, very long time now (3 years at least) I've been more and more quiet. I don't know how to explain it right, but I'll try my best. I don't know how, when and why it started, but I began being very unresponsive. For example, if I was at home and my mother came in my room, talking to me, I would keep quiet and just watch her, even when I'm asked a question, to which I would answer with ""I don't know"" or I just wouldn't answer at all. I hate speaking and I hate being spoken to, I hate the sound of TV and I just want to be in a quiet place. I hate it so much I would throw tantrums because I just want the TV off, I want the washing machine to stop, and I cry at times because I can't take the loudness, or maybe it's because it feels like it's busy around me. I feel uncomfortable. At school, you know, when we had to go to it, I spoke with my friend, but even then it was very vague and at classes I wouldn't speak at all, even when asked a question I would rather keep quiet and be accused of not paying attention rather than speaking up. Maybe this is just something normal, I don't know. But I feel like it's not because I don't speak at all. I always keep quiet. I also think I might be anxious, but I don't really know what anxiety exactly means. I cry a lot for not reason at all, a lot of times I just eat or do homework and start crying for no reason whatsoever. I wouldn't say I feel sad. I just feel hurt, maybe I'm depressed. I don't get up at all, I spend all day laying down to the point where I've had constipation for months from the lack of movement I've had. I'm weak, I've had times where I just start shaking and fall down or at least cling to something so I don't end up on the floor. Back to the lack of me speaking, I really think it's developing in a problem because I just don't speak. At all. All day, I maybe say those few ""I don't know""'s to my mother and that's it. Yeah, I'm at home all time, but even at school I just didn't reply to anyone, they probably thought I'm ignoring them, but I'm literally unable to answer. I'm sometimes scared to speak. But scared is not the right word, it's just that I listen to them and I don't filter anything they say, I try to answer, I try to push myself to speak, but I don't and just keep looking at them. It's like my voice just won't come out. I hate speaking. I just want it to be quiet."

I think it's because I'm tired of being the guy who does the disinfecting around the store because of coronavirus when my job used to be more fufilling. Not sure if that is even the cause because when I get back to doing things from involving my old job I still feel the same way. If you've had burnout how did you manage to get over it? I can't really change much about work since it's set in stone so I'm looking to see if there is some way to fix it mentally.
184,All this Covid nonsense makes me want to kill myself. Just sayin,Everything getting canceled and not even allowed to live my life the way I want to live it is making me extremely suicidal. Everything that I found that helped me calm down and want to stay here on earth isn’t allowed anymore and how these lockdown orders keep getting extended and extended even tho the curve has been flattened out just makes me think they’re never going to let us go back to normal. I don’t see why I should keep waiting for something that might not ever happen
185,Brother is acting strangely,"Hello all, 

I don't know how to put this, 
My brother has been studying abroad in the Usa.
I know he used to take lsd, we both did.
And due to corona he came back home and is among us now.
But he is delusional now.
He keeps Talking bout creating a  new world,  a world with no money, says he is working with prople on it.
And that world will come in 8 days.
He believew to hat he is holding his meeting while sleeping. Or closing his eyes.

He keeps saying there is no corona and doesnt get while we are on lockdown.


He became quite irritated when asked about his studies and said: ""please I dont want to talk about my studies, if you want  to talk about the new world."" 

He seems ok otherwise, he remembers us.

I am super worried about him, and am worried if his situation will worsen.

I convinced them to take him to a therapist, but we cant right now due to the lockdown. 
And my in country (kuwait) mental health is a bit of taboo.


My parents attribute this to permanent damage from the lsd. Or demonic possession. 

Please any advice on how to deal with him, should we hold him to his 8 days deadline? Should we confront him ? Or should we go along with him?

Thank you for any advice."
186,Parallels between my (26M) personality and a bitter incel?,"Alright, i will make it brief and provide a summary of my exerpiences leading up to this post:

&amp;#x200B;

A) I have had 2 friend circles stop inviting me out - I often find myself the outcast.

B) I am convinced my face, specifically, is the cause of my life's woes

C) I am not only ugly, but from an ethnic background that also I think doesn't do me any favours in the looks department/perceived as attractive to my area

D) I Have had \~2 years of isolation due to repeated rejection by women, and comments on my apperance by men.

E) Posting on r/amiugly, or sending my pics to people online doesnt help. People say i look good,cute,whatever over the internet or even average at times (the odd person calls me a 3/10) but my real life experiences makes me think the 3/10 is the accurate one.

&amp;#x200B;

I now view pretty much everyone with suspicion. I know they will eventually turn on me/drop me, I just dont know when. Every few months I become more likely to ghost people, more hard-headed, and more angry at the world. I really , really fucking hate my peer group and most people I am forced to interact with pre-quarantine. I genuinely despise them.

I want to get better, I just cant. I feel so bitter, and righteous and ""right"" in my stance. And I get worse as the years go by"
187,How can I overcome my inferiority complex?,"I hate to know that there's better people than me. When I see or hear them I want to punch them or scream at them. Don't tell me that I'm an ignorant that does not know what that people is passing through. I ALREADY KNOW THAT I'M AN IGNORANT AND CRUEL INDIVIDUAL! And that fact makes me feel even more inferior, morally inferior. Nothing of this shit makes any sense. I'm from Colombia but I study in Germany bc I got a fucking scolarship due to my outstanding grades. I'm not a poor south american proletarian , I'm tremendously privileged. THAT'S AGAIN, I'm feeling morally inferior again bc I'm frivolous. If there's a way to scape from this ridiculous mental jail, please,tell me."
188,"f17, my family says i don’t pay attention, they tell me i “don’t listen”, they’re constantly having to tell me the same thing over and over again. i cry very easily &amp; mental health has gotten worse. any advice for how to deal with this?","hello. i’m not sure if this belongs here, sorry if it doesn’t. anyway, for the past few years my mental health hasn’t been that well. i feel like everything’s gotten worse. i feel like i’m at my lowest with my mental health i’ve ever been at. physically i’m fine though. also i apologize if non of this makes sense, my mind kind of wanders off so i’m sorry in advance. 

last year my mom and i moved in with my god parents because they’re struggling financially and needed some help. a few months pass by, i do chores around the house, get a job, do my schoolwork and all that. 

during my school year, my grades constantly fluctuated. i’d have straight A’s for a few months and then i start to procrastinate and a few grades drop to a D. but i ended my junior year strong after getting punished for having a D. but now it’s an A. my family got on my ass about having a D but it’s because i lacked any motivation to do anything about it. but after they pestered me and threatened me i got it up. 

since quarantine, schools been cancelled. i am still fortunate enough to work. i still do chores around the house. at least every week since after quarantine started my family notices that i “don’t pay attention” to little things when i do chores. sometimes i forget to put cleaning supplies away, sometimes i forget where i even put them. i don’t mean to forget these things, it just happens. but it happens too often. i don’t know why and i hate it. i have a chore list my family gives me everyday and i complete those chores alongside going to work 3 days a week. every time i do my chores i do what’s ask of me. i try my best to get everything done the best i can. but i feel like that’s never good enough for them. “why didn’t you do this too” but it was never asked of me. i only do what’s asked of me because i feel like if i do something else it’ll be wrong and i’ll get punished for it. 

my family tells me i “don’t listen to them” when i’m spoken to. i zone out. maybe i don’t like confrontation. who knows. but they can tell. “are you fucking listen to me or no?” they ask. i do listen to them but i’ve heard that “you need to start being responsible” over a million times that i just completely shut down. i honestly feel like i am responsible. i work, i do what’s asked of me. i don’t understand what’s the issue??? 

whenever my family talks to me about something wrong i’ve done they always start with “i don’t want you to start crying but....” and guess what? i start to fucking cry. i hate it. as much as i try to hold back my tears i can’t. and then they always get upset when i cry. “why are you crying, it’s not that serious? you’re not a baby, so stop.” 

when they talk to me about being responsible they always hit me with the “you’re going to be 18 soon, you’re going to be an adult, you have to learn how to act like one. what are you going to do when you get to college and don’t have us around? how are you going to support yourself?”

i’m scared to grow up. but i know i can definitely be responsible and do things on my own but because of my family i always second guess myself. 

sometimes when i zone out i start to feel like i’m just going through the motions. i feel like i’m watching myself behind a tv screen. i look in the mirror and wonder if that’s really me anymore. i don’t even know who i really am and it’s kind of scary. i just want to find myself already. 

i feel kind of hopeless. i feel like i can’t do much right when it comes to pleasing my family. no matter how hard i try. i wish i could just be normal and remember things. i wish i didn’t lack attention to detail. i wish i didn’t procrastinate on shit. i don’t mean to, it’s just how i am but they don’t understand that. i can’t focus on shit anymore. (also i’m not trying to seek attention i genuinely just need to vent because i feel like if i vent to my friends or family then they’ll judge me or tell me that its “all in my head”) 

any advice on how to just deal with this shit? i’d appreciate anything. 

any questions? anything i have to clear up? i know this is all over the place, i am sorry."
189,Am I being sensitive?,"I'm a 24m that was recently diagnosed with bipolar II. I've been off work with FMLA for the last two months due to serious heart palpitations that have kept me from functioning as I normally do. I work in the oilfield, so it isnt unusual to work 80-100 hours in a week.

Recently, my doctor said I was good to go back to work with no restrictions other than hourly. Alot of my work is driving and sitting waiting for others, so I was able to convince her to set my limit to 50 hours a week. Work wouldn't allow me to come back, saying that they cant accommodate that, and my boss told me to just tell them to let me work as much as I want and he would only work me 50 hours a week. He is a habitual liar, and I was advised by medical professionals to not do that.

I went in to work to grab some of my stuff that I needed for something else, and someone brought up that I should just lie to my doctor and come back and that it's my fault I'm broke. I brought up that I'm being considered disabled and that things aren't as simple as lying and coming back when we dont know what's causing my debilitating heart palpitations. They got back on the phone so I left.

On the way back, the guy texted me saying ""what's your disability called, being a cunt? Can't even say bye."" I took offense, and he eventually back pedaled saying along the lines of ""we pick on you cause we like you"" and that ""it's normal and you (me) shouldn't take it personally"". Am I being overly sensitive?

I've always figured it was one thing to do it normally, but saying that kind of shit when someone's down and struggling is pretty insensitive. Now I'm back home and angry at myself because I feel like I'm just losing more stuff in my life. Am I wrong?

Tl;dr

Work wont let me come back to work and I got called a cunt because of people being assholes about it and now I feel bad."
190,Viibryd + alcohol - is it safe? General thoughts?,"Started Viibryd for anxiety, switching from Celexa. On Celexa, I had no issues with drinking despite the label warning (I was just quicker to get tipsy). I'm not an alcoholic - I'm talking 6 drinks max with friends spread out over one night but only twice a month. I have a hard time believing everyone on SSRI's completely abstains from alcohol!

I wanted to ask what others on Viibryd do? Do you skip your dose that morning, or can you tolerate it? 33 year old male, no other health issues, if that helps."
191,confused,[deleted]
192,Things really don't feel like they're working out right now,"I started going to therapy about one and a half year ago because I've had mental health issues for a long time now. I'm only 22 but I've felt extremely lonely for most of the part of life I have a conscious memory of and I'm completely out of touch with my emotions. I followed therapy there for about half a year, until the program I followed there ended, it wasn't enough and I got referred for more serious treatment. That took another half year and to be honest, things have only slowly gotten worse.

Not all things have gotten worse, but the main thread of my life has. I've been isolating myself more instead of less since last fall, and therapy is only making me feel worse. And like I said, there have been some positive changes too. I became close friends with someone for the first time in my life, and I feel like I have figured at least one thing out about what I want to do with my future. But my overthinking mind can't let it rest that and is turning the positive into negative too. I'm not gonna say there's no inherent negative things coming from these but I'm definitely making it worse in my head than it really is.

Yesterday morning I had therapy again, once every two weeks, and I've been feeling horrible since. I'm reminded of all the bad things I'm so stuck on and I just don't feel like I'm making any progress at all. I've never really liked this lady but right now I'm considering dropping it and looking for someone better, but I don't know if I'm gonna find that. Because I may not like her but she asks the right questions.

In the meantime I've lost some potentially good friends. I've lost my motivation to keep working through my college work. I've even lost motivation to pursue my dream of traveling around the world, because let's be honest I'm not gonna enjoy that if I can't really connect to anyone I meet. But what's worse is that I'm constantly reminded of all the things I don't have and I'm stuck in my own misery so bad that I don't want to get out. Yesterday night I had a breakdown and I welcomed the feeling with open arms, it was almost comforting to feel that again.

And I can't rightly say that this quarantine is making things better. I feel so locked up mentally, but now also physically. And every chance I had to improve my social situation seems to have flown out the window for at least a year or so.

I can even see the things I do have as positive anymore, so tell me: where the hell do you go from there?!"
193,Feeling better on Zoloft,I posted here a while back about feeling super hopeless. My depression had spiraled out of control. I was even thinking about attempting and just ending it that day. But I managed to call my family doctor and she prescribed me Zoloft 25 mg and I feel like myself again. With a calm sense of mind. I never thought that this would happen to me. I feel like I have a future now and can actually accomplish stuff.
194,Today I told loved ones about my boundaries and it went really well,"With all that’s going on, my mental illnesses (BPD and PTSD) plummeted and shit hit the fan. 

I was barely able to speak to anyone let alone my family since lock down began. I’m living with my SO and just about managing to function at bare minimum in work. But other than that, I’ve spoken to no one. 

Which means I’ve ignored so many and ghosted so many calls. 

Today I reached out to just 3 friends. My three closest friends. Telling them why I had been ignoring them, apologising with all of my heart and setting up boundaries for the next few weeks (ie no calls but trying to text once a day). 

And the amount of love I have received has made me cry. Their patience and support means everything to me. I am so so SO lucky and I can’t believe how kind they’ve been. 

The demons in my head built it up. But their kindness means the world. 

To anyone out there struggling: take it day by day and you can do it!"
195,I've posted about this before but I still need help. I can't muster up the will to care about anything but sex,"This is making life kind of hard for me. My entire personality is basically just my sex drive. I find it difficult to pay attention to anything else. And even worse I constantly beat myself up about the lack of sex in my life. I am married. I love my husband to pieces but he can't keep up with my sex drive and in disappointed in myself for being monogamous.

I know this is because as a kid I just sort of inferred that my only worth was sex and resolved to be the best at it.

And I know it's not good for me to think this way. But it's soooo hard to care about anything else. The fact that I fell in love with somebody and got married is amazing. But I'm often regretful just because I feel like I failed at my only purpose in life.

I can't do hobbies unless I talk myself into it with sex. Want to get into art? It'll all be porn. That sort of thing.

It wouldn't be so bad but I'm having a hard time functioning. Sometimes people want to talk about other things. Sometimes I have to behave because I'm in public.

I'm trying to get better. But it's hard because I don't want to get better. I want to get laid."
196,Today I might have found out why I dont feel,"Hey!So little backstory, I have a lot of trouble understanding emotions, I can seem happy but I dont register it as such, I usually have to end up surveying how my body reacts to understand if I am happy, sad or such.

I Had a really indepth talk with my cousin tonight, we talked about how we both grew up abused and neglected, both to similar degree, but I ended up being emotionally dull unlike him, he said that child neglegance/abuse causes this and it did make a lot of sense, I did live through as a child/young teen a lot of abuse physical and mental and its probably why I have the old ""bottle of emotions"" that pop after a while some nights and I end up crying.

I can finally understand why I second guess everything, why I second guess my hobbies, my favorite movies, even if I love my girlfriend or not, its not because I dont enjoy or love those things, It's because I literally have trouble feeling those emotions, I haven't felt proper emotions for a long period of time ever since my young teen years, and the memories before that are locked up due to trauma.

If anyone has any tips to overcome this ""bottling up"" of emotions in any way or opening up locked memories, please say so below.

Thank you for reading."

198,Some venting,"Sorry, this is just me venting and i wanted it to be out somewhere, will delete if this is triggering or not allowed. Note: English is not my native language so there might be some mistakes, it's just easier to write these things in English.

*Dear people, it’s my time.* 

*Why? I don’t know. I failed, but i don’t know in what. I feel like i failed in a lot of things. I guess it’s just me. I failed in myself. Humans are smart beings, capable of doing great things. Everyone excels in at least one thing. But i? i don’t know. I don’t know what i have to offer in this life. I don’t know what i have to offer to other people. Humans need a purpose to exist, and it’s their search of a lifetime to find that purpose. But i feel like i serve no purpose. Nils is at the moment the only person i exist for right now and if it wasn’t for him i don’t know what i would be breathing for.* 

*I don’t know why i’m here, please someone tell me. I don’t deserve this life, i feel like i don’t deserve anything. People always try telling you that you are worth it, and you should fight. But for what? Why? It feels like fighting a war not worth fighting for. Why should i keep on doing this if i know i’m not worth fighting for?* 

*Low self-worth, depression, a teen just going through mood swings, call it the fuck you want. I don’t care. I genuinely don’t care wether i don’t wake up tomorrow because why would i? I feel stupid, stupid for feeling this way, stupid girl. It’s all one stupid mess, this life. I’m pathetic, really really pathetic. But i deserve to feel this way, why wouldn’t i deserve it? i’m no good to friends, family. I suck at everything i try, not good at anything. They don’t like me, i don’t like me, but then again, why should we? Don’t love anything that is not worth loving. Don’t love anything that is going to let you down anyway, i have done that multiple times in this pathetic life, letting people down i love. I’m scared to do the same with Nils, i don’t want him to feel bad.* 

*But i’m a closed book, to scared to say anything, insecure, sad, incapable, unpredictable mess. I don’t like feeling this way, but i settled in this feeling. It’s my home, constantly feeding of negatives, cause why shouldn’t i? I feel stupid for saying all this, it’s like it’s worth telling someone. Why should people listen to me? It’s not that i’m worth talking to.* 

*I don’t understand myself, is this just me writing down the obvious or is this a cry for help? Only god knows. But here we are again.* 

*Please listen, someone.*"
199,Im confusion,"So like over the last few years, if something minor happens to me (eg. i bumped my foot into bed) I get this sudden rage? It feels like when u lift the lid off a pressure cooker idk. usually I am able to keep myself from being angry any further but like this has never happened before and I’m usually a calm person that doesn’t get angry. if u have any idea pls comment."
200,What would I miss by killing myself?,"World's gone to hell. There's nothing but work, eat, sleep repeat. What is there beyond this?"
201,I genuinely don’t see a future for myself.,"My mental health has pretty much barred me from doing anything I’m interested career (theater, politics) wise because of my anxiety, depression, lack of emotional control, and high functioning autism. I’m pretty much incapable of doing anything involving math or science. And I have no idea what other career paths i might be actually good at that can support me and my medical needs in the future. I don’t know how I’m going to take care of myself. I don’t want to be stuck in fast food service or retail the rest of my life but I don’t see anything else for me. I barely have the motivation to do anything but whether thats me being lazy or the depression I can’t tell. I rarely want to talk to the few friends I have, and I don’t know why and it confuses me. I’m just genuinely a very confused person and I don’t understand myself or my brain. And I can’t talk to my counselor about this because my family will hear me and I don’t want their affection or sympathy, which also confuses me? The only two options I see for myself is depending on my parents for everything in life or a mental asylum. I don’t know, I’m definitely overreacting but it’s how I feel."

203,Why do I keep having sleep paralysis every night?,I keep having sleep paralysis almost every night sometimes multiple times in the same night. It feels a little bit dumbed down now though. I used to get sleep paralysis 3 or 4 times a year but now since I get it every day it feels a little bit more dumbed down. I can move a little bit and I can see sometimes. There super weird now though. Yesterday I thought my door was a boney hand. My most memorable episode was when one of my childhood best friends came in my room and told me to stay quiet.
204,I really need help,"Its not a major issue. i just have no clue what mental issue i have. Could someone try to identify it for me? I can't find anything matching it. Basically, i feel empty most of the day although i get into this weird mood sometimes where i say random weird stuff and i can't stop it. I know its not bipolar disorder because i dont get mania or hypomania. I also get angry really fast and lash out. i do weird things like stare at myself in the mirror for ages. Im not sure if i have a mix or something. Im just confused. i will be grateful with any info."
205,Anybody have a schizoaffective related disorder AND find anything alternative outside of psych meds to help? Such as supplements/vitamins etc.,Schizo disorders are related to super excessively high dopamine levels. Curious if there are natural alternatives that can at minimum help a little or help regulate the dopamine levels...
206,I'm going crazy in quarantine.,My top coping mechanism besides using drugs (now sober) was going out in the community and doing things I'm ready to hang myself in the garage if I have to spend another day inside with my family. And there is no end in sight
207,I need some clarity,"To set this off I will try to make it not cringe and actually give some insight. I'm not looking for pity nor do I want to boast my ego. Contradictory I want to become more humble and actually learn to respect the shit around me more.

Ok so short and sweet how do I make myself respect myself more? I have felt this constant self hatred for myself for years and at first I thought of it as teenage anxiety and that garbage, but it has stayed around for too long.

I dont consider myself happy nor sad, but I know I have some problem in my head. I havent gotten diagnosed, but I've talked to some phycs and they all told me basically useless things. I want to learn how to actually live. I feel so incompetent and useless despite the fact I know things. I feel so weak, despite trying to look composed or neutral at best. I feel so stupid around my friends. Hell even the subjects I know most about do i rarely even talk about them for more than a minute or two at best. I have such a shitty memory and almost everything  I do is either doubted or questioned by my friends and family. I underperform at school, relationships and everything compared to the people I know. Life feels like a fucking competetiton where im 3 steps behind while the most ""stupid"" people are ahead of me.

I want to feel like a man, but if I even have to question it, it means I'm not. I also am pretty lonely, but over the years despite of me being a very extroverted character I feel very ""easy"" being alone. Its like almost a shell to hide away in. I want to speak to others about how i feel, but I cant because it makes me look weak and inferior. So I'm stuck.

I try not to hold myself higher than others, but its really hard, when I feel like i have no redeeming qualities. I critique myself at times when I should really be proud and happy. I really want to fix this soooo bad, but have nowhere to look. Should I get myself diagnosed? Even that makes me just feel inferior when all the others are seemingly in a same spot of ""anxiety"" and still get no help.

I acknowledge the problem and thats why I want to change it because I find it really hard to even enjoy the things I used to enjoy and the worst thing I fear is to be a disappointment to my dad. Not that my dad really vocally expects me of anything, but deep down I know what he feels.

I have tried to talk to other about this, but I just face the same anwer of suck it up. Trust me I've tried, but I dont think its healthy anymore.

Ty and really sorry for the long shitty rant"
208,Why can't everyone just stop lying?,"I guess I'm a fool for ever believing anyone but I really don't understand why people feel the need to lie. 

The managers at work say they care about the employees but then they terminated off 80% of my department. They are still sticking to the ""We care"" horseshit and I wish they would just stop. We are adults and you don't need to patronize me. I know if it's between my job and your stock going up a tenth of a point then I'm gone. I don't care anymore but just stop.

My family tells me they care about me and then treats me like a slave to cook and clean and bring home a paycheck for them. Stop. I can handle not being loved but I can't take being lied to anymore. It's OK. You're human and are allowed to be an asshole to me. I may not like it but don't tell me things that are untrue. 

The doctors say they are here to help but all they do is charge me more money to accomplish nothing. Stop, just stop. 

Why can't they stop? I'm losing my mind and all people want to do is lie to me. I just want them to stop. Why won't they stop?"
209,I sometimes feel weird and I don't know why,"I don't want to sound like other kids that make stuff like this up for attention, but sometimes I feel like I'm being watched or not entirely safe during certain times.

Such as when I go to bed. Sometimes I just get creeped out and I dont know why. 

I also feel like I'm vulnerable. Could someone please tell me what this is I'm feeling?

Also I dont think it's a big problem, since I only feel like this sometimes."
210,"Trapped in mind, need help","How can I get better at articulating myself/ word recall/ and general socialization


This has been in issue that has plagued me since I moved away from college. The act of creating an identity for myself and “selling” myself to people to create friendships has caused quite a bit of mental problems. Now that I’m back home from college and have had time to reflect on my first year, I realize how tough my first year was and how much self hatred I had for not being comfortable with myself. I desperately need my second year to be substantialy better and I’m willing to put in the work. I’ll list some of the issues 
     1. Not being able to think of the right words or sayings and as result shaming myself 
2. Constantly thinking of a particular word throughout a day just to make sure I can remember it. Also asking myself to recall certain words constantly and getting frustrated when I can’t think of it 
3. Frequently pausing movies or YouTuve videos and repeating pieces of diologue in my head like I’m trying to learn language like a robot
4. Keeping several notes pages filled with words and quotes that I want to use 
5. Mostly keeping quite to avoid judgment and the mental aftermath of taking 

I aspire to be naturally witty and funny and comfortable with myself as so much people I come across. I need to remove this self doubt. know most of these might seem like a memory promblem but I believe my memory is fine (always been an A student). Any help would be appreciated!"
211,How do you get professional psychiatric help which is comfortable for someone who is 'difficult'?,"I don't want to say too much as his personal thoughts/feelings are not mine to share but a friend of mine was sent to prison for a month as a result of a misdemeanour offence, during this time he has been prescribed anti-psychotics which do not seem to be the right fit for him.

He's told me that the psychiatrist he's been sent to comes across as judgemental and disinterested and he does not feel able to build a good rappot with him, which is a shame because he was very much looking forward to the sessions and being able to get a lot off his chest. I've heard many mental health professionals are working from home during 'rona and are providing online sessions. He needs to talk to someone who can help him, I'm very concerned for his mental health and well-being.

**What is the best way to go about getting diagnosis/medication/treatment/therapy for potential: psychosis, bi-polar, depression, anxiety, mild autism/ASD, psychopathy, narcissism and addiction/substance abuse issues??**

No one seems to be able to give him an accurate diagnosis to be able to assist him correctly. He is a wonderful person but the victim of circumstance being from a violent country, with a complicated family background/upbringing."
212,Suicide threats from friends,"Hi, so i need advice. I have two guy best friends who mean the world to me but... have a lot of mental issues. I learned today while they hung out at a park fishing (i couldn’t go cause i’m and some of my family is high risk), that they both held knives against their own throats threatening to slit them. I’m so concerned and afraid and don’t know what to do. Do i confront them? What can i do if i’m ever there if it happens again? I’ve considered disarming them but i really don’t want to (i do martial arts and i’m at black belt level)... please help me"
213,Anyone wanna play COD warzone together? Real lonely and suffering crippling anxiety wish I had a way to get away from my mind I play on PlayStation 4 but it doesn’t matter I can add you via crossplay,
214,I think I'm depressed.,"My two closest friends have both gone through depression and I've been there for them both, and I've never considered the way I feel to be depression, but recently it's gotten worse and I think it's come to the point where I am depressed. I grew up suffering with anxiety and I had issues with anger like things would really anger me and I'd snap and hurt people but like this wasn't just normal anger, it was like I was watching myself do it and I couldn't stop myself, I didn't want to stop myself. I still suffer with these things and sometimes I really kinda scare myself, because I almost want to snap and hurt people because I get bullied a lot, and I know I could easily beat the bully's if I wanted too, but I have to stop myself whenever I'm angry but I don't want too anymore. I don't even know what I want, I guess I just need someone to kinda validate these feelings so I know I'm not alone, or that I'm not like psychopathic for wanting to hurt people, or even just to say I am psychopathic so at least I have an explanation for it."
215,Guilt,Is it normal to feel guilt of not doing as well in your life as your peers are doing?
216,"I get how people want to be surrounded by others with positive energy, but how about the people who deal with stuff.","I feel a bit worthless right now, because I am not where I want to be in my life. I let my depression get the best of me, and I made mistakes. I feel worthless, because of a post I saw that said if you are stuck in your life, I don't want to be associated with you basically. 

After, I thought about my own childhood, and other people who don't have friends at school. I guess I turned people off, because I looked depressed all the time, and unapproachable &amp; I know my life would be better if I had friends who would be there for me no matter what. Then I wonder about other kids of today.  Because they don't fit in/ have problems in life they are not worth friendships or getting to know?"

219,Struggling to concentrate on things you normally enjoy,"Hi, I love reading books I’m addicted to reading, I usually can tune in and devour a book quick same with tv and films. 

Since my depression has came back I feel like I literally have no attention span this isn’t like me whatsoever 

Does anyone have any tips how to over come this it’s driving me crazy I want to get back to doing what I enjoy but I just can’t hold the same attention span that I did before."
220,How to be happy for other people,"I really hope I’m not the only one this happens to and that this is an appropriate question for this community. 

Someone you know (perhaps a friend or colleague) has some sort of accomplishment. Perhaps they won an award, received a big promotion, whatever. You should be happy for them. But you’re not. You’re not necessarily jealous of them, and it’s not even necessarily the case that the accomplishment could have been yours if it wasn’t theirs. Yet you find yourself, perhaps at some barely conscious level, jealous or resentful. 

How do you get over these feelings and learn how to be genuinely happy for other people?"
221,will people think i’m needy or insecure (to the point of turn off) if i ask if i’m bothering them?,"i’m 19 now, but i’ve been struggling with depression for years and also have really bad anxiety stemming from emotional abuse from my parents and then being bullied at school. i also have “mild” or “high functioning” autism that shows up the most in the areas of social skills, (lack of) executive function, and being uncomfortable with certain sensations and sounds. i also display all of the signs of BPD (borderline personality disorder) but because i am not one to self diagnose, i am going to speak to a physiologist or psychiatrist about it in August.

i don’t know how to read people. i have a very anxious attachment style plus a fear of being abandoned, and it manifests in automatically feeling like people hate me unless they say otherwise. i know this is a turnoff for both friends and relationships but i have no way to get help for it right now. quarantine is really affecting me because being alone physically makes me feel abandoned even if it’s not the case. i want to reach out and talk to my friends, but i’m terrified that i’ll be bothering them and they won’t want to talk to me. i’m dealing with a lot right now and because i’m stuck in a toxic family and can’t get therapy, i have no real support. i want to ask a friend of mine if it bothers him when i talk to him but i don’t know if he’ll be annoyed if i ask him that. i don’t know what to do but i feel so isolated and afraid and alone rn."

223,M16 Feeling selfish for being depressed when O have no reason to be,"I know there's a typo in the title but I can't change it now

Sorry this is all over the place btw

I live an objectively good life, but I'm still depressed and feel awful for it. It's worth noting I'm not extremely depressed, though it's hard to say exactly how bad when I haven't been off my meds fully in a long time. They help tremendously, but I guess I can't expect them to just make everything perfect. I feel like I'm burdening my parents who've done nothing wrong, punishing them for nothing. They shouldn't have to deal with this, which is a large reason I never talk to them about it. I think of it as being dealt a good hand of cards but sucking at the game, if that makes any sense. I feel really bad complaining about it, like it's nothing important so I'll come across as full of myself. I sometimes wish my parents could've had a different son in my place, one who doesn't have stupid mental issues that make no sense. I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this but I just felt like I needed to get it out there to somebody."
224,"The boss is watching, and listening, always.","I'm reporting this here, because I think I'm having more of a mental health issue with this any a business issue.... A little preface  - I'm 46, on the spectrum, and struggle clearly communicating with people that I'm not close to. 

I work for a small Managed Service Provider (I'm an IT Geeks) with a lot of little clients and 5 or 6 very large clients. We have been working from home since March. I've always known that the boss records our screens and reviews everything we do. Back in March, I found out that our calls are recorded too, even though we do not inform the clients that they are being recorded. I found out because the boss attached a wave file of one of my calls to our Teams chat. Talk about humiliating.. I wasn't rude, just a bit short. It was a random call from a woman wanting someone to talk her through connecting hew new Dell computer. She didn't have the correct cables and had no clue what to do. I told her that I need to open a service ticket and get a payment method before beginning. She wasn't happy about having to pay to keep me on the phone for what I expected to be about an hour. The boss didn't like how I handled it.

Forward to today. Talking to a user at one of our largest clients, I connected up to her notebook and was surprised by how slow it was. It's a 7 year old dual core dell notebook with 4G and a 5400 hdd. It took me 3 minutes to get the Windows Credential Manager open. While this is going on, The user was very chatty. I'm a geek, small talk is hard enough for me as it is. During the call she was saying how slow it is and that she wishes she could get a new one. I told her that she would need to make a request to HR for that. No big deal right?

WRONG! Right then I get a message in Teams from the boss.. ""Don't prompt them to ask for new equipment, they need to do it on their own""

That fucked me up. Now I'm having to troubleshoot this PITA issue, make small talk, AND the boss is LISTENING to my call live! WTF? At that point I simply couldn't focus on the issue because I'm replaying the whole call in my head, and thinking about all my calls for the day.

Am I over reacting? Should I be okay with the boss watching my screen and listening to all my calls?"
225,I feel like I have hundreds of layers of repressed emotions,"It's like I have a strong knot that is untying very slowly. But it's still there, and it's annoying and sad sometimes. Hope is lost occasionally, but I keep on going. I'd like to hear if some of you are going through similar stuff."
226,Depression and Maladaptive Daydreaming #1,"The worst part about being depressed is the feeling of hopelessness. The fact that I know the steps needed to feel better, how easy they appear for others to achieve, and how realistic the steps really are. Yet I still find myself lf constantly feeling stuck, like the walls I've put up for myself have become impenetrable.

My mind feels so scattered, jumping from one made up fantasy to the next, never stopping to appreciate the life I have right in front of me.  At this point however, it's beginning to feel beyond my control. Every moment I'm not occupied (and many times when I am) I get pulled involuntarily into a fake world, one where I embody the traits I wish I had. Love, musical talent, crazy adventures with friends. In my mind I can be whatever I want, from a charming beloved millionaire to a devilish villain in a Tolkienesque fantasy land.

The amount of my time that is consumed by my daydreaming has negatively impacted all of the relationships that mean anything to me. I don't know what I'm going to do to break this habit, writing my thoughts is probably a good start. If you made it this far and can relate to my situation, I hope reading this helped you feel a bit less alone. 

Probably going to sleep now, at least there dreaming is normal. I may write some more in a few days.

227,Can't cope with a brutal job,"I work in mid sized law firm and have for about seven months. I took the job to escape a bad gig, and this had the plus of paying more and being a mile from my home. 

I made a mistake in taking it. Every single day is overwhelming, but not for the work. An incident happened in January where I got blamed for something that I did not do, that was serious enough to put me on a final written notice. I was three months into the job at the time and feeling screwed.  I was looking for other positions but then boom Coronoa.   
Now I am fearful I won't have a job come Monday because today I accidentally addressed an email Mr. T instead of Mr. I (fictitious names obviously) 

This is insane. It was a stupid human error that comes from being overwhelmed by random tasks everyday and not set strategy or clear set goals in my job. 

Does anyone have tips for how to cope with this anxiety?"
228,I don't understand what's wrong,"Lately I've been feeling worse and worse, it was to the point a handful of months ago that I could manage to get my school work done but now I can't even look at my school work without feeling worthless and ashamed. Not only that but I feel so lacking in energy and passion, I try not to burden people with my presence by not talking to people and seeing them less. I don't even understand what makes people tick on a day to day basis, I see these kids that are so happy and passionate for their future and all I can think of is how bleak it will be. I don't understand what makes them care about anything, let alone school, future and their occupation. I'm so tired of feeling nothing but negative emotions"
229,Why am I so disappointed in everyone?,"Whenever I look at 98% of people I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and disappointment.

I'm not disappointed in the pretentious sense, I don't feel like I'm better or somehow above them. I just think ""you could act and think so much better than this, why do you do this, why is everyone like this"" and then I get saddened by the fact that pretty much everyone is like that.

It’s the first time I’ve really had it this bad- I’ve had the awful memories, bad dreams and worrying it’s all going to happen again but this is the first time I’ve ever actually felt like I’m back in that awful situation.

234,Mood tracking for mental health survey,"Hello redditors,

We are a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, PhDs and Masters students from the University of Melbourne and RMIT who have bonded over the desire to make a difference in the field of mental health. We have an idea for an app that will attempt to detect when the user's mood state begins to decline before it becomes severe enough to disrupt their lives. 

To the best of our knowledge, we think we have an approach that is not yet available on the market. However, we would like to get a better idea of what people's preferences are around mental health apps, especially from those experiencing mental health difficulties. 

We would really appreciate it if you could share your opinion on our survey (should take no more than 7 minutes). Your details will not be collected by us and your responses will only be seen by the 6 of us. Click on the link if you would like to fill out our survey.

235,Seeing the personification of all my life's traumas becoming president is terrible for my mental health,"Bolsonaro is openly racist, sexist and homophobic. He's angry, authoritarian, ignorant, narcissistic, the embodiment of male toxicity... he's never been shy of who he is. All of this horrid shit was basically his campaign bid... and he got to be president. I'm in a country where over half of the voting population took a good look at him and went 'yeah, I want him as president'.

It's like none of the people who deal with the kind of hate he propagates matter. If anything, I feel like my country wants us to suffer. It's terrible being someone who went through so much shit under the thumb of people like him, and seeing the country willingly give him presidency, it's like good and decency don't exist, and that evil and hate will always win."

She recently found out her husband has been having an affair since December. She is currently staying with our mother (I still live at home with our mom). (Our father passed away 11 years ago). Since she’s been here she’s been a drunk mess. Last night she drank until she passed out. She’s been drinking all day today. 

I also think she is having a manic episode. I’ve never seen her have one so I’m a little unsure of what it looks like but I do know she has had them in the past. She’s been nonstop since she woke up this morning. She made breakfast for us all, cleaned the entire house, tuned the piano and did work in the back yard. 

When she talks to me it’s always about her husband and the other woman. It’s clear that that’s the only thing she’s thinking about. I’ve never been cheated on so I don’t really know if her response is reasonable or not. 

She, this is really what concerns me the most, she has pretty much been stalking her husband. They have a camera in their house because of their dog’s medical issues. She’s been checking the camera on her phone to see what her husband has been doing since she left. 

I really don’t know what I can do to help her. My mom told me to just leave her alone. My sister has tried to commit suicide twice in the past I’m worried that if things get worse she may end up hurting herself or someone else."

241,How do you deal with close friendships fading away?,"My best friend has been very distant and has been responding very curtly for a few weeks.

I've tried to talk it out with them on multiple occasions but it's always brushed aside. Respecting boundaries is very important, so I don't push the issue too much. I just remind them that I'm there for them always, whenever they want to talk.

In my eyes, it's very obvious they grew indifferent towards our relationship, and are kinda stepping away little by little. 

They stopped returning the ""how are you doing?"" question when I greet them, and most of their responses to a lot of the things I said turned into ""yeah""s or ""ooh""s

I've always been anxious of being annoying or pestering someone too much, so whenever they give me a curt reply, I give them their space.

This friendship is over 10 years old, and it breaks my heart into million pieces to see it fade like this. I know nothing is forever, but I thought he'd be one of those lifelong friends.

How do you deal with losing a friend in this way?"

I don’t have enough experience with the issues to make any decent recommendations on where to start. Their insurance is also a factor.

Is there a directory of sorts? Where should we start looking?"

244,Signs of schizophrenia ?,"Hoping this is the right place to post, Im still figuring reddit out. I posted about my husbands medical issues but deleted it because they're extremely specific and I dont want him finding it, but now i have questions about his mental health. Ps this is gonna be a long one please bare with me. 

 I have *always* assumed he was autistic with anger issues. I still think he has autism because he has *several* signs but his anger is more than just anger.
  He will explode and say things I would not say to my worst enemy, throw/ruin things, stab furniture with knives, slap/punch himself in the face repeatedly etc etc etc.
  When he calms back down he claims to not remember most of what happened or severely down plays it, or, says it was something I did or said that started it.. he will say things like 'well I just needed help with something today and I felt like everyone was resisting me and I started to get frustrated and then things escalated. - When truthfully what happened was more like he kicked my door open and started right off with an attitude/yelling/demanding something because he was frustrated.
  He has had anger issues for years and been kicked out of every place he's been in because of it, but when he talks about it half the time he'll admit he played a roll in it, the other half of the time he sincerely acts like everyone is truly against him, people just dont care about him (he says that all the time), that he cant trust anyone etc. 

here's where my question comes in..I have never thought he could be schizophrenic but 4 different people (2 of whom never met him) said he sounds like he is suffering from schizophrenia. Today I placed a call to the hospital and ask them where I could go for help, they could hear him yelling in the background so they sent the cops to the house. One of them pulled me aside and asked if he was ever diagnosed with anything, I said not formally because he doesnt 'believe' in that kind of thing and doesn't believe he has any mental issues, the cop told me he suspected schizophrenia ..Another person who said it was a doctor. Not one that had met him or diagnosed him, she was told about his behavior and said that's what it sounded like. 

If I can add any more info that would help please let me know.. If I threw every example up here this would turn into a novel. I also want to clarify he's never been physically violent with me..I don't feel like I am in any immediate danger, I am just incredibly stressed. Anything can set him off into one of these melt downs. From someone saying something wrong (or something he perceives as wrong) or him having a plan and then that plan getting messed up in some way ..I never know when to expect a complete melt down and to have terrible things screamed in my face. Sometimes he can be so sweet and gentle and I feel so bad for him that everyone gave up on him..other times I fully understand why."

246,Not sure how to handle not being able to afford therapy or medication.,"So when I was pregnant with both of my children and also a short period after for post-partum issues I was able to finally get the help I should've gotten through my childhood issues. Well sorta.. I was able to get medication for anxiety and depression and had planned on coming back to work on PTSD and even through my OCD but unfortunately I am in the lower class and when my husband got a new job paying enough money for them to kick us off government assistance but not enough to actually cover mental health along with all our other expenses. 

I've tried looking at more affordable options online but my biggest issue is being completely diagnosed properly in a way where I can find out what is the absolute best route to atleast being able to manage if not completely wipe out some of my symptoms. 

I know it's not the best way is to look into it online especially if you're a hypochondriac but I have no idea what else to do. I've tried using the just answers for doctors and they directed me to getting properly diagnosed as well or pay $50 for a phone call. 

I'm not sure what to do it's ridiculously expensive alot of places around me are about $200 per session for people without insurance. I wish I new exactly what the root problem is so that can be treated first because like most of you guys know alot of things like depression and anxiety and OCD can all be interlaced. 

Thanks in advanced"
247,please help me...,"Hi, i'm a 16 year old girl living with her mom and dad. I've been dealing with skin issues and no motivation recently. Over this quarantine i've been getting really depressed... i have no one to talk to and the only person that i talked to and loved so much... isn't here with me anymore. I feel so lost without him, he was my everything and one day it all vanished. He helped me through all the hard times i've had and now i have no one. About 20 minutes ago i got into a huge argument with my mom and it resulted in me having a huge mental breakdown. I'm crying as i write this.. i tried telling her that i hate how i look and she said its fine. I then told her that I have no motivation to do my school work online because i'm so depressed and everyday i just lay in bed. She said that i can never do anything right and that to just ""fail the school year"" all because its ""my fault"" i can't do it. She was yelling at me the whole time and just saying stuff to me.. i tried to talk but she would just cut me off. This isn't the first time she's made me cry. I don't know what to do anymore and i have no one. Please help me please..."
248,don’t know,messed up on my diet and binged. now i feel like i’ll never be able to keep going on a diet. now it’s giving me panic attacks and a bad depressive episode. idk what to do. i want to purge.
249,I'm terrified to get help,"I hope this doesn't come off as excuses, but I have childhood trauma that literally ruins everything for me. I can't hold a job, I drop all my classes, lost all my friendships and I am terrified of getting help. 

I understand that my mental health is not an excuse to give up, treat people badly and not take accountability for my actions but... I don't know how to explain what goes through my head that makes me so irrational and I just..ruin everything for myself.

I fear getting help because that means acknowledging that I am fucked up, that I can't live in my little bubble of thinking everyone else is just wrong, that i'm not the problem. I don't want to be like this, I want to ignore it. 

I'm sorry if this seems pointless or something I just needed to vent"
250,"I hate me, myself and I and food","I don’t think I have a great relationship with food. All my life has been spent thinking about what to eat, what not to eat, calories,diets etc and I’m sick of it. I don’t want to do it anymore. 

I was large for most of my childhood and decided to lose weight freshman year of high school. I worked really hard and I was able to go down from 200 to 140 pounds. I was so happy, I was confident, but once the allure of being “skinny” wore off I realized that I was still miserable and depressed. This thing I wanted so bad (being skinny) was just a temporary fix for how crappy I felt inside all the time so I started to binge eat. 

Now I have gained all that weight back and some. I am currently in the process of trying to lose weight again. I am exercising more and trying to eat less and keep track of my calories. But I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. I don’t want everyday to be consumed by thoughts about gaining weight or eating too much. I envy those that never have to think about it like my sister who eats what she wants and stays relatively the same size. 

I feel like I hate food. I hate that it makes me fat. I hate that I’m almost addicted to it and still feel the desire to binge eat all the time. I hate starving myself for days and then breaking and eating enough food for 4 people in one day. I just wish I didn’t have to eat. I honestly wish food didn’t exist and that we all could sustain ourselves by pulling energy from the sun or something. This way I never have to worry myself with my weight again. 

The sick thing about losing weight is that it’s never about your health. At least not for me. I’m not trying to lose weight to be healthy. I’m trying to lose weight to be skinny which I’m sure by now all of us know being skinny doesn’t automatically make you healthy. 

I know losing weight won’t really fix anything. I hate myself. I always have. I’m 24 now and can barley look myself in the mirror without crying. I harm myself. I punch myself in the head. I have very negative thoughts everyday and honestly I’m only still here because I love my family and they love me. But I’m starting to wonder when does it get better. When do I stop hating myself? When do I stop feeling depressed? When do the suicidal thoughts stop? When does the urge to throw my car of the road stop? It’s obviously not all about my weight because losing weight didn’t fix me the first time but I don’t know what else to do. I’ve been to therapy. I even had a breakdown in 2016 and I had to be hospitalized. Maybe this is forever. 

Will this post help? Of course not but I wanted to get it out."
251,Let’s be animal crossing friends!,I miss connecting with people. I’ve been feeling a bit lonely so I got animal crossing and it’s definitely been helping bring joy in my day. If you play let’s be friends 😇😃
252,Sometimes I feel like the best period of my life may have been a manic episode (20F),"I have been depressed most of my life, since young age. Things were especially bad last year. I was in a very toxic relationship rampant with alcohol and drug abuse. It's a very long story so I'd rather not go into detail. 

Anyways, last December I got sick of living like that. And I made some very impulsive decisions. I broke up with my ex, I got a job from a faraway city, and I just fled. Nobody knew about it, apart from my ex and my best friend. I didn't even tell my family. Just disappeared. And all of these decisions happened within a span of a week.

From the moment I got there, I felt like I was released from some kind of heavy pressure. I felt so free, my mind was so relaxed. I stopped drinking and taking drugs. I was completely sober. But I smoked like crazy. I was never much of a smoker ever, but those days I'd smoke a pack a day or more. 

I did really well at my new job too. I worked long, extra hours and it felt so good to be productive. I never came to work late or skipped, never complained about anything. I had so much energy all the time. I felt so fit. 

I made good money too. I saved a lot, in hopes of treating myself to a little vacation.

I've always been a little bit socially awkward, but I was so myself during this time. It was so easy to connect to people and I made some really good friends, who I had many good times with.

Sometimes I'd get paranoid because it felt like I was on a high all the time. It felt like things were too good to be true, that somehow it would come crashing down.

And it did. Within three months, I lost my job due to the pandemic.

And along with my job, I also lost my shit pretty much. I slipped right into where I was before this sudden bout of positivity came around. Started binge drinking. Fucked a married guy. Spent a good portion of the savings I was so careful about on weed and alcohol. I gave treats to my friends too, all our parties were on me. I fucked up my relationships with many people, made a lot of people hate me. And in turn I hate myself now.. I'm back in my hometown, locked down, and miserable as fuck. Thinking of how it was all so good and it went wrong so fast.

And that's when I realized I was back at square one. And now it feels hard to believe that I truly was so happy and productive. Now that I think about it, there were many things wrong with my life even when I was on my emotional high (like the fact that I was ghosting my family and pretty much disappeared) but it didn't cross my mind at all at the time. I felt so good and on top of the world. That it feels so hard to believe.

Was I actually happy, was I actually changing my life for the better, or was I just in the midst of some episode? I lay at home and think of this all the time. It's so weird."
253,My anxiety has been out of control,"I’m sure it’s been the same for many others during this pandemic. My anxiety is overwhelming and consuming and dominates my every thought. 

I recently flew home from CA to NY at the instance of my parents and I’ve come to realize, it was a horrible choice. I allowed my anxiety and my fear of being alone for several more months push me into making a decision that has caused me an enormous amount of grief. To top it all off, I’ve started developing covid symptoms.

I can’t sleep, I can barely eat, I spend most of my time watching tv like a zombie while quarantining away from my parents consumed by the guilt that I may be infected or worse, that my family may be infected. If I take a hard hit from this virus, I can live with that. I’m 27 and while I’m overweight, generally I’m healthy otherwise. But if this virus takes down my parents, I’ll never be able to live with myself. And that fear and terror has me checking my vitals every ten minutes which only makes matters worse.

Sometimes I wish I was someone else. I like who I am but if I could change one thing, it would be to get rid of my anxiety. It absolutely cripples me in every way imaginable."
254,How to get help without your parents knowing?,"I’m a 16 year old female, I’ve always felt like something is off about me and I’ve been wanting to get help after having suicide attempts, my friends insisting it to me after they got concerned of some behaviors.

I’ve had the conversation with them, I’ve sat them down to explain, I’ve been brave enough to do it and yet I’m told no. It’s always the same outcome: “there’s no money” “we give you everything, you shouldn’t feel this way” “A psychiatrist won’t fix you, that’s something you do for yourself” “pray to God” “You don’t know what problems are, you don’t need it” “I fixed myself, you should do the same” “you’re overreacting, quit it”, and recently added to the list “If you do this, you’ll get therapy” “if you do this, I’ll give you the money to pay it”.

Yes, I’ve tried school counselors but I don’t trust them after the last one I went to called my mom for a meeting and I ended up getting scowled at for “overreacting”.

Where can I get help without having to get my parent’s consent?"
255,Hopeless for me?,I just finished my freshman year of college and am very miserable. I have had no friends in high school and haven’t made any at college so I’m starting to think there’s something seriously wrong with me.
256,Is life really worth living?,"We always try to convince ourselves that it is. We tell ourselves that no matter how hard it gets, something good is bound to follow. But what if, this good thing, that we endure so much suffering for, just isn't worth it. 

The reason I'm writing this is because I really want to believe that I am wrong. 


I don't mean to be annoying or bothersome, sorry."
257,I can’t do this shit,"I fucking hate myself, everything, I’m annoying, I’m stupid as fuck and I’m known for being a dumbass, my friends always joke about the dumb shit I say but I really fucking hate myself, I can’t think of any good qualities, I’m unintelligent, annoying and I’m a cunt, I act like I’m going through shit when everyone else has worse problems, I’ve had a lot of family shit in the past but right now, I’m 17 and I don’t have very major family issues and I act like I’m struggling, I’m a pussy, I fucking hate everything about me, and I don’t know what to do, I can’t even tell if my feelings are real or true, nothing makes sense, I just don’t know what the fucks going on and I never will, I get drunk to numb all of it but it just makes it worse, I want to cry but I can’t and I haven’t for years and it’s killing me, I know this is dumb posting it here, but I don’t know where to turn"
258,I’m Worried: I Have Low-Set Ears,"My ears are low-set and I’m worried about the psychological implications of that. While I am autistic and higher average MPAs than the neurotypical population are associated with autistic people, autism isn’t specifically associated with low-set ears. Also, I don’t suffer from any other mental health conditions or developmental disorders.
Here’s a link to both sides of my head: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/11J7Wf9e5kMQI8ktWcIyKv4duFBfLtJI5ChhRBj2FmTU/edit
What are the scientifically known causes and implications of my low-set wars?"
259,I finally got seen!,"After three years of trying to get seen by psychiatrists and therapists I FINALLY got seen and am now starting treatment, come to find out I've been living with debilitating bipolar disorder/BPD and clinical depression. They prescribed me mood stabilizers and gave me generic Abilify and told me to report for weekly therapy and apologized for not answering calls, I'm finally on the road to normality! I'm literally crying right now. 

I'm so happy someone finally listened long enough to help me understand what's going on and why I'm hearing things that don't exist! I'm sorry this probably isn't allowed but I just had to share the news, I feel so validated. I've been trying to see someone for three years and its so comforting and purifying to feel like I'm not crazy."
260,At first I thought it was schytzofrenia but I'm wondering if anyone else does this and what it's tied to,"So I'll tell a few of my symptoms and also give a back drop of the fact that I have had past trauma and my parents both have severe issues, they never physically abused me but my illnesses in general have definitely gone untreated ever since I can remember. 
My mom is a hypochondriac and I am too, she's severely ocd specifically when it comes to illnesses. I am too but more so mental illnesses. 
Anyways I have trauma and past shit and possibly more underlying issues that I'm just trying to figure out.


So one thing I do alot, almost all the time if I'm not distracted is almost subconsciously seeing myself. 
I don't know how else to describe this except for that I feel as if I'm seeing myself from someone else's eyes and I look different in every angle. Like if a car is passing by one way I'll see it from their view but also if a car is coming from the opposite direction I do that too. It's almost always constant that I can be occupied doing things like taking my kids on a walk or even singing or talking and it's like I'm watching myself. 

Another thing I do is the constant monologue which I didn't know was something normal but it's very intrusive even during sex, sometimes I get ridiculously turned off when I shouldn't be because it's like my mind starts going on a whole rampage telling me things ontop of seeing myself from different angles and it's weird. And then I just get where I have to either power through it or just stop cuz it just doesn't feel fair to my husband to continuously stop but my mind just WONT shut off. Laying down for meditation or trying to sleep even weed doesn't shut it off I'm constantly over thinking and having an inner monologue and also seeing myself and it's just so much at one time. 

I'm also CONSTANTLY worried I'm doing something that looks bad. Like legally bad or just looks bad in general. I shouldn't have said this or that, I shouldn't have done this or that. And then get very paranoid about people around me and what they think of me. Sometimes I start thinking that someone is mad at me when they aren't etc. I get ultra paranoid when it comes to my kids. Very small things I feel like someone is watching or is gonna see like a tiny bit of dirt on the floor NEEDS to be cleaned up NOW. I over whelm myself to the point of having a break down that results in being so ridiculously over tired that I physically do not give a shit about all those tiny details anymore and then I jolt into a depressive episode/ panic attack where I feel like I'm being a terrible mom and it's way worse if something happens like one of my kids gets hurt or something (they are 1 and 2) 

I just keep wildly swinging from being hyper active and happy but also very obsessive and then back down to being so depressed completely wiped out of energy, can't even hold my eyes open long enough and having to just take a nap on the couch and stuff. 

I also don't have any way of actually taking a break. The most I can get during the day is if the kids take a nap (IF) they take a nap because unfortunately they just don't some days. Or if my husband is off work and doesn't actually have something planned the whole day he's off. 
I have no family around me the closest is 2 hours away and the rest are in another state and we don't have enough money for a baby sitter so my burn outs end up just sort of cycling back into being hyper active again. 

I'm not really sure what to do. Thanks ❤️"
261,I feel like I don't belong anywhere,"And I feel like my sense of self isn't stable. Like I'm constantly cycling between different personalities to see which one ""fits"" the best. I guess it all started when I got bullied everywhere I went which threw my sense of self out of whack. I'm also a mess of emotional eating despite it taking a toll on my health. I have a therapist but I feel super embarrassed about this and don't want to mention it to her. I also feel like I won't explain it well if that makes sense."
262,How to stop worrying about yourself?,"Idk man this is gonna be tough for me to write, so bear with me.

How do I stop hating the way I look? Just everything about me bugs me. I'm not overweight - if anything I've struggled to gain weight to be healthy, I havent got any disfigurements or anything. But I always feel so ugly, like I'm not even worth attention from people because I'm way below them in terms of attractiveness, and I always see myself as sub par. They could be the nicest person in the world or my best friend since I was born and I still feel like I'm not on their level, through no fault of their own. 

I'm not ugly, I have an okay body. I dont even know why I'm insecure.

My boyfriend will tell me every day that I'm beautiful and it's become a routine that I deny it and I've always meant it. No matter how many times he says that 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' and all that stuff that's supposed to make me feel better, it doesnt. He can tell me a million times over that I'm beautiful but all it takes is for me to look in the mirror and I disgust myself.

Deep down I know that beauty is meaningless and its personality that counts but I dont know how to counter these thoughts and it's breaking me, and makes me feel so worthless and disgusting. I only like myself with a filter on, and on facetimes with my friends I always put a filter on straight away because I hate the way I look, or aim the camera at the ceiling or just turn my camera off, because every time I see my normal face I just get so sad.

Please help, I need to break out of this mentality."
263,I’m a schizophrenic AMA,"Due to my schizophrenia it has affected my mental state of mind, it has gotten me in trouble, I’ve put myself in dangerous situation."
264,"Finally got up and went to my psychologist appt today! After delaying it for a whole year and burning my self out for everyone around me, I’ve decided enough is enough and it’s about me now",I am actually beyond proud of my self. Just wanted to post because no one seems to care in my family that I’m seeking help for stuff that’s beyond my control. Go me!
265,Very insecure,"Hi all! So, I (f-21) have been dating my significant other (m-24) for almost 2.5 years. He’s a great guy and has never actually given me a reason to suspect things, but I can’t help to suspect things. When I was about 7, I found out my dad had another kid, when he was with my mom. From a very young age, I haven’t been able to trust people. This infidelity on my fathers part-and various other instances. When my boyfriend tells me things, I won’t really believe him. He said he was just driving today after he got food, and I automatically thought he was meeting some other girl. And tomorrow he may meet a few of his friends outside, and He said that “guys will be there”. But I can’t help but think he is withholding that girls will be there. Especially when he had a lot of friends that are girls-and ones that are much prettier than me. I know many people will probably just say that I need to trust him-but I feel like no matter what, I won’t be able to trust him, or anyone. Again, he’s done nothing to make me think that he is cheating on me,or to make me not trust him. It’s just like everyday, I am being eaten at, thinking the worst about him hurting me. If others have trust issues, how do you deal with them?"
266,How did you knew you had Social Anxiety?,"So, long story short... In the last 2 years I have started to become the opposite of what I was. I have always been a very energetic/sociable/extroverted person and am now experiencing the worst state of “social phobia” I’ve had so far. I put it between quotes cause I’m not 100% sure that’s it. Specially when you take into consideration that good percentage of people who suffer from that condition have it chronically (inheriting from their families) or developed at a very young age. So I’m not sure if it is possible for you to grow that disorder at my age (22). Although I heavily identify with some symptoms and that makes me question either if I could have it or not (hence why I’m here). Some of those symptoms are:

-&gt; Fear of situations in which you may be judged

-&gt; Worrying about embarrassing or humiliating yourself

-&gt; Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers (in my case, I’d replace the “intense fear” with major discomfort, but still)

-&gt; Spending time after a social situation analyzing your performance and identifying flaws in your interactions

-&gt; Avoiding situations where you might be the center of attention

-&gt; Blushing

-&gt; Fast heartbeat

-&gt; Having trouble catching your breath

-&gt; Avoiding doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment

Now this last item was what made me realize that I might have a problem. Since I was laid off in March due the pandemic, I haven’t worked at all. But money got tight so me and hubby (who is still working from home) decided that instead of compromising my already fucked up health (I got chronic bronchitis and asma) working with customer service, I’d do Instacart (it’s a delivery app where you do groceries for people and deliver them to their houses). And tomorrow is my first day. 

God. Fucking. Damnit. 

I’m posting this at midnight because I can’t sleep. I am taken by fear, horror and anxiety of seeing people tomorrow. And I’m not even gonna talk to them!!! Maybe waive from the porch while I drop their groceries but THATS IT!!
I don’t understand why the idea of having to go outside and socialize with people (even if minimally) is FRIGHTENING me. I worked customer service before and that was never a problem. I genuinely have no idea of where this is coming from. I am now shaking terrified with the idea of working outside all day tomorrow. I feel ridiculous! It’s not like I am sentenced to death, but yet, it feels just like that.

Again, the reason why I can’t know if I have that for sure is that I lack some very extreme behaviors such as: having a hard time eating in front of others,using a public restroom and manifesting physical symptoms like nausea, dizziness and muscle tension. 

Anyway... sorry about writing a bible. I just needed to get it out of my chest and see if maybe someone who is diagnosed with this condition or works with people who do can enlighten me a little. 

Any help/advices is welcome and appreciated. 

Thanks y’all!"
267,"My Mom keep wasting money (even mine) on debt and gambling, and it makes me mentally hurt sometines.","Im saying this off my chest
Actually this is about toxic money management that always struck my family even my mental issues sometime.

But I really cant stand my mom wasteful and gambling habit. And Im from a broken home family, where I lived with my mom and my sister.

She us my scholarship money I hardly get by slipping my permission, I though its for emergency needs. But she use it to sell  medical items for higher price. In the end, she got a lot of losses and debt because it didnt went well. ( she got so intrigued by the revenue it will get, but in the end she got scammed by those monopoly medical items prices)
 And my scholarship money I saved to pay college tuition are gone just like that...
I tried to stay patient bcs of that, but...in the end I felt dissapointed...why did she lied to me like that? 

She looks like a monster when she taking my freelance part time money I hardly get. Its like she want to tackle all my hard saved money to pay her debt.

She got a wasteful hedonism lifestyle. She always want to look great in front of her shitty materialistic friends, she want the best car, best jewelery, best bag, also iphones phones and eating at expensive restaurant. 

I cant stand my mom financial management, after that  bcs of corona economic issues, my mom keep gambling to get money to pay off al of her debt. And the most biggest part of that debt is her stupid car loan......

Not at all, but her stupid waste spending and  consumerism also attacked my relationship. My bf is still working on his business and learning to invest. Thats why he doesnt look very successful now.

Thats why, My mom always attack verbally how me and bf looks bcs we never used the most expensive clothes or the most trendy and expensive shit. 

When she doesnt have money, she even tried to tackle and asking my bf to lend her money with enourmous amount around (500$). I MEAN WHAT THE FUCK? 

After that, me and bf settled to not gave her any money, bcs she is going to use it to pay off her debt or another stupid shit.
my mom curse me and bf saying she doesnt approve our relationship and accuse my bf for being poor. And this hurts me. Also im an asin who live south east asian, we really believe that parents could curse their children for not obeying them, and it pressures me so much to maintain my financial, or to obey my crazy wasteful mom.

I dont know what to do with my crazy mom, I mean being a single mother is hard but I mean when does she going to grow up to maintain financial stability? Its going to her mental eventually attacking my mental.

All what I could do is pray to God for her to change, but sometimes I just cant take it anymore. I feel very angry right now, bcs of her behaviour.

I tried to make and work freelancing so I could save some money to pay my college tuotion myself, and not depending on her. Is still small amount but its okay. 
My college also doesnt decrease the tuition amount. Even though corona virus has killed almost everyobody economy.

Sorry for posting a lot, I didnt ask for money but a way to abstain my mom behaviour of money. I tried to tell her to SAVE, but she never listen to me. And I hide my saved money, get rid of her tackling my money again."
268,I was never the same again,"I’ve posted a few posts on here never get replies but it’s okay, this is more for me, for more background info my old posts are on my profile. I’m 19 I was on 4 different antidepressants/ anti-anxiety/ and an antipsychotic medication in the span of 3 months from November 2018-February 2019 (everything made me feel worse than the other) I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder recurrent, major anxiety disorder recurrent, and eating disorder not specified. I stopped taking them cold turkey because the physiatrist just kept writing me scripts without really trying to understand me. All in all the meds I tried didn’t work for me but I still see my therapist one a week (she’s been on maternity leave for about 3 months) ANYWAY, I’ve never been the same since I took those pills, my emotions are stable, I don’t feel much except for pangs of emotions once and a whole and they are short lived, a panic attack maybe once every 6 months or so (I was having 5/6 debilitating panic attacks a day before) but my personality is so mundane, someone who used to feel everything, someone who used to be so deep and personal, I can’t feel anything anymore, I can’t connect, I try my hardest to think and think and get into a place of my deep rooted emotions, triggers, but nothing, like it doesn’t even phase me, what’s wrong with me?? Where did my personality go, I don’t even recognize myself"
269,How does anyone survive working? (Can't stand it anymore)," Is it some big secret by nearly all people in the working world that it literally sucks? Am I doing it wrong. Have been in my job for 5 years, completely drains my soul and I feel 120% dead inside robot. It seems so hard to get a head, I thought good solid work would achieve that then I entered the world of multi direction office politics and multi layered management that don't communicate with each other. It seems like 99% of places operate this way.

I not sure any job is going to be different. I can't stand being told what to do by someone else just because they are the boss and spend all day doing something I don't care about for someone who is only interested in their own goals. You need to work to live but you can't enjoy living if you are working, even if you do work the cost of living is so high you never get anywhere and struggle to even keep your head above water. It's not enjoyable.

I can't even enjoy the weekends sometimes. Seriously I'm done. I don't even wear a seatbelt on the way to work anymore. Am I doing it wrong? What am I missing?"
270,Worried I may have OCD,"Not sure if this is a diagnosis kind of Reddit, but I was wondering if I could have OCD. At night, when I’m trying to sleep, I often check my phone a lot, and stress over knowing the exact time, date, and percentage it it at. I’ll get annoyed about this, and sometimes move my phone. Another thing is once I change what I do each night, for example checking my phone twice one night instead of once, I’ll have to do it twice the following night or I won’t be able to relax and fall asleep. I have a history of mild to moderate anxiety, but no other mental illnesses. Could this be OCD?"
271,Deep Talk,Anyone down for a deep talk? share our current problems and how we r feeling? pls dm me x
272,"As long as someone reads this, I'm fine","Soooo, I'm just posting this because I wanted to get it off my chest. I never tell anybody anything about this kind of stuff about me because I just hate talking about it. I feel like it'll change their perspective of me. So telling a stranger is kinda relieving. I guess I'll begin from the start.

I grew up in a nice area, friendly people and a decent neighborhood which I'll be referring to house A. (I actually was born and lived in another nice area for about 5 years until I moved to house A). Anyway, at school I didn't have many friends except from 3. Now for some context, I have...questionable parents. My mom is an addict to pain killers, so much so that my dad hides them so she won't overdose. The pills make her very agitated at times, like she'll start fights with my dad for no reason. Try and say ANYTHING about it and she'll scream at you and throw you out of the house. Next is my dad. My dad is very loving and great, if you ignore the fact he's probably a pedophile and looks at child porn. For that very aspect my Mom will kick my Dad out of the house every 1-3 times a month. Arguments are usually 10-20 times a month, which includes screaming, throwing things, and in rare times, calling the cops. Weird thing is, after every fight shes nice and caring. Sorry got off track, needed to give context though. Anyway, between the ages 0-7 i never really though anything of it, never affected me that much excluding some crying here and there. But then, my dad informed my family about moving to house B, which was across the country. We all voted in favor of moving there. I swear to go I solemnly wish I never voted to go. Worst mistake ever.

House B was in a somewhat bad part of town. Nothing like the other places I had lived. I hated it. That's also when my mind got messed up. First thing that happened was in 5th grade I got homesick and was hit with the reality that I weird. I became kinda sad with the news but was still a really happy kid. Next thing, in 6th grade, I was just tired of being at school already, and my mom's screaming at home wasn't helping. I was sick of it and fell into a slight depression. Since I was exposed to the internet I found something other people do in this time of sadness, cutting. I was young and didn't think of the consequences and thought cutting might help, since it did for other people. So I did. One of my biggest regrets. I remember my mom finding out and asking why, why, why. I hate that feeling of her being so mad and disappointed in me. But oh boy, I was not not ready for 7th grade.

I was still handling the depression and everything but in 7th grade I just was so mad at myself for being like that. I cut more and everything and was just falling deeper into this depression. I remember i came to school one day and my friend found my scars on my wrist and confronted me about it. The whole lunch table was staring at me. I was terrified and broke down, still sticking to the ""cat scratches"" story. Ever since then, I don't talk about anything sad and avoid anything conversions about deep stuff with my friends. I also don't didn't cut on the wrist anymore. Anyway, the song ""Empty"" by Jaiden animations and Boyinaband came out. And into the making of the music video Dave mentions pro-anorexia. I didn't know that a community that supports mental illnesses exists so trying to find people like me I searched up ""pro-depression"". I found a community on google plus about them. I became a avid member of it and that taught me to be ""free"" with my cutting. I cut almost everyday and deeper. I had a shirt that was completely soaked in blood and everyday i went to school my thighs hurt from the fresh scars rubbing against my jeans. Now i should mention, after each episode of breaking down and crying I was happy the next. If I looked happy, I was. I still don't know but i would shift between those two emotions rapidly. I don't think it was bipolar or anything, i felt lost though.

I should point out, I have two brothers. Ones autistic, brother 1, other isn't very much, brother 2, (I am too but slightly). Even though brother 2 was very annoying and i didn't like him, i never saw this coming. One night in early 2019 i was sleeping and my brother came into my room. I am a light sleeper so immediately woke up to a presence, sensed somebody but was curious of why they were in my room so pretended to still be asleep. They tried to take off my clothes, I was scared and confused so stood still. This happened a few more times, him taking my clothes off and caressing my body. I felt violated and terrified. Nothing else except touching my body went farther though, thankfully. I could tell it was brother 2 from the noises but never told my mom because I'm afraid she'll blame my dad for pressing his ""hobbies"" onto my brother and throw my dad out.

Finally, the last thing. In late 2019, I was tired of the screaming and fighting. So to tune it out I tried to find something. But instead of alcohol I found sleeping pills. I sure got hooked fast. Passing out and the feeling of stillness was great, nothing to worry about. Until one day. Now before i say anything, my mom didn't handle the situation as one should but whatever i know that. I took 30 pills because the normal 20 pills weren't working anymore. I overdosed and threw up. My mom's response to that was i was my stomach wasn't feeling good and gave me 2 more. it got worse and passed out. Woke up to my parents finding the pill bottle. Later that week my dad gave me a talk about how I need rehab and blah blah blah. ""How many did you take?!"" is something that'll remain in my mind. I said something about 10 and my dad got mad and told me to stay in my room. Around two months later I tried to start it again. Couldn't take more than 3 cause it made me sick. Even typing this is making me want to throw up. I also couldn't drink cold water after that because it remind me of the feeling and i would gag.

Now, things are still shit with my parents but I am now aware about what i did wrong and how to overcome. Starting high school next year so well see what happens. Thank you for reading this whole thing if you did. Really appreciate it. Thank you!

I'm mentally ill, I have depression, social anxiety and PTSD so school has always been hard to me, also a lot of shit is going on in my life but I try to do my best.
I want to tell my teacher about this but I don't know how to tell her, I don't know what to say or how to say it.
I would appreciate any tip or advice from you, guys!"
274,What is wrong with my depression,"Hello everyone. I have had suicidal thoughts,depression,anxiety and paronia for most of my life (16M) im not going to go into detail about what happened in my childhood the point is i would always get anxious depressed and then cry myself to sleep every night and the crying helped me cope. I dont know how but it made me fell better afterwards.Well 2 days ago i was lying in bed as always preparing myself to cry and then go to sleep but no matter what i did i could not bring myself to even shed a tear. I know it might not sound like much but it made me feel worse and because crying made me feel better i could not go to sleep so i slept only 2hours at max.I put it behind my head thinking nothing of it.I go about my day when my mom goes away. I was not able to think clearly and took some pain killers then made cuts on my right [leg .It](https://leg.it) is because i could not cry. I would not try to think about me not being able to cry but when i saw how big of a part it does in caring for my mental health i had to ask somewhere. I would go to my therapist but im in lockdown and i dont wanna cut something again in fear of my mom noticing."
275,Why do I love to have power over people?,"Sometimes I hate someone and like them at the same time. For example, I get super angry when I think about an ex when I was the one who called it off multiple times. Sometimes I wanted to hurt her or scare her, but I never acted on it. I didn’t even call her names. I wanted to hurt her dog who liked me a lot. I feel guilty about bad things I do. I don’t like to think how I affect people. I tend to make people around me feel miserable."
276,Overwhelmed and anxious,"I was productive for the last few days doing academics all day and I was so proud of myself. However, when I encountered some hard stuff I can't answer, I found myself on a break for 2 days. Now, I'm trying to get back on track and I'm overwhelmed for the work that piled up and I can't do them because I feel anxious, I have this heavy feeling on my chest and I can't think straight. How do I overcome this feeling?"
277,INB4 I ruin the best relationship I’ve ever had [28m],"So; to start I’ve been unmediated Bipolar for 16 years and at the end of last year got out of a long term abusive relationship with an ex that held together because we had a child. Fast forward to now, I’m with an incredible woman. She’s the best thing that had ever happened to me other than my own son and I have to say my mental health has gotten in the way a lot. I was cheated on through the old relationship, was taken advantage of financially for a long time. Just generally treated shitty and now I’m in this great place with the perfect woman and my paranoia and anxiety repeatedly strap me down with intrusive thoughts and paralyze me to the point where I just break down and weep most of the time. It’s had an effect on my new relationship as of recently as I tend to death spiral and am not good at pushing out intrusive thoughts. So I’m literally begging you guys for ideas to help me overcome this past toxicity and be able to squarely put it behind me and look to nothing but my future."
278,I try to pretend that everything is fine when it's not,"Today i turned the big ol 22 years of age, but today was one of those episodes you know the memories of being mistreated by someone you love but they just manipulate you and question your insanity, misconstrued your memories all while you make excuses for the things they do to you. It's been a year since then. Today i was supposed to enjoy my birthday but I couldn't with the sudden flash backs and realizing it's a birthday spent without him though i shouldn't miss someone who was toxic and the fact  this person told everyone my mental illness like it's everyone's business not only that used it as leverage  against me and to point out why I'm a horrible person. Though for the past few months I've been trying to act as if it never happened and try to pretend everything is okay, despite this I've managed to get by the semester with flying colors yet the whole time I was dying inside and hiding this pain from everyone else not to make them worry, my mental health plummeted i would spend days in bed putting my assignments off then two days later i get to it working on it at night, i try not to cry and bottle it up even today I've bottled it up and try to prevent everything is okay yet I just wanted to hide in my room but then if I hide in my room they would catch on even though today I didn't want to celebrate my birthday i wanted to sleep it off what ever I'm dealing with. I tried to see the good in people but there are people who go after vulnerable and kind people to inflict pain. I just never understood why I was treated this way to be thrown out and then for this person to go and destroy my social life all because I caught them in a lie and that I didn't want to be treated horribly anymore. I'm tired of pretending to be fine, I'm tired of trying to feel fine, i just want to cry but I just end up holding it in. I want to be able to talk about it to someone but I can't trust anyone's intentions. I'm not okay i haven't been feeling okay since what happened to me, i feel sad and angry at myself, there are times where i want to scream and shout and punch holes in the wall but realistically what good is that gonna make? I feel like verbally i can't express what I feel i only bottle it up till I burts into tears. I'm just tried of pretending to be fine"
279,Unknown problem,I don't exactly know what's going on with me. It's like... depersonalization... a random anxiety spurt (or something like that)... stress... I don't know. It feels like I wanna tear everything apart and I keep feeling so... small. Like when you get an anxiety attack about a deep thought. Could someone maybe possibly explain what might be happening?

281,Free or low cost therapy options??,"Hello! 

So I currently live in Florida (living between Tampa and gainesville) and I've been wanting to go see a therapist for a long time now. Unfortunately I recently turned 19 and lost my health insurance which ended once I wasn't 18. I'm currently applying for medicaid, but I know there's no guarantee and I'm not even sure when I will hear back. 

Does anyone know of any other options? I heard of some virtual things, but I'm not sure. 

Thank you!"
282,I’m worried I might have a cluster B personality disorder,"Obviously I don’t want to self diagnose or internet diagnose but I just want opinions.


Particularly I have a really bad reaction to failures/losses. I have been learning a new game lately (Magic the Gathering: Arena). Since I am new I lose a lot and I just feel wrong. Even when no one could “see” me losing I still feel terrible. I find that I have to whisper to myself or do a mental mantra about how I actually won, or invent stories about how the universe on my side and so I actually won (e.g. “I lost the game but I got the rewards for winning and I didn’t lose any rank”).


When I was a kid I would have so many outbursts in class that I would get sent home and suspended from school regularly. I am diagnosed with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder. I don’t remember much about my outbursts but I remember that I would yell a lot and sometimes I would be violent.


Last year I was in a gap year program for young adults with ADHD (18-21 I was 18) and since there had been a problem with people arguing with each other so the head of the program decided that people who were respectful would get ice cream and people who were disrespectful would not eat dinner with everyone else and would have to wait outside until everyone else had eaten a hot meal and ice cream and then would have to eat something cold, and weren’t even allowed to make their own hot food. I didn’t make the cut for “respectful” and I felt so wrong. It’s hard to put into words how I felt or what happened since it was so emotional. I had a big outburst and I screamed and I banged on things and at one point I tried taking off my layers (this was Wyoming in the winter) so that I would get gold and it would be unhealthy and it would be Their Fault for Doing This to Me. I was a terrible person during the entire episode and still I find myself trying to say that that didn’t happen and I got the ice cream and lying to myself.


I don’t want to be a bad person. I am afraid that someday I will have a big outburst by my friends or my partner and they will see who I really am and hate me. I want help.


Please feel free to ask questions about anything"
283,Learning how to live again after years of being depressed and picking up bad depressed habits,"I've been depressed for five years and in denial about it until that last year where I was just so obviously depressed that I couldn't ignore it anymore. I thought I was coping well, and I was, but how I was going about defeating this just wasn't enough and I had to get on meds. Anyways I haven't felt this happy simce the last time I was in meds haha and honestly I am really enjoying it. The thing is I've picked up some bad habits from my depression.  Even though im happy these days all I want to do is just sleep, I also don't want to go out, and want to list hang out in my room. The thing is this isn't living life. Im still doing the same things that I did when I was super depressed. Perhaps I could do something about my energy levels, so while I work on that I also need to work on getting out of these habits. Like, at night sometimes I feel too tired to brush my teeth so I don't. I can't let me being tired take away my future teeth health. Btws, im not tired in a debilitating way. I am pretty tired, but also I can get up and go brush my teeth so I need to make myself go do that. 

I've been playing dnd and I don't give it my all. I kind of bs everything and this is making the game so boring for me. So today I decided to start putting my all in this game. Ok, so right now im not feeling the game much, but I can't let my feelings take away my experiences to do awesome things. I should try my best to get into this game, even if im not feeling it, because it I do that then maybe it will become more of my thing, but I need to put some effort into it to get that going. 

Like when I was going to school my favorite class was the class that I out the most effort into. I didn't think id live that class ir anything, but I ended up completely falling in love with that subject because I put so much effort into what I was doing. The same thing can be applied here, in my case at least. 

All that being said, if I do get debilitating depression it is 100% ok to just take the day off and do what I want and if that is sleeping then that is ok. 

Anyways I just kind of wanted to write this out and post about it and gather my thoughts on this. I don't know what im expecting from people who read this, if people even read this, but here you go lol"
284,I’m not sure I want to get better,"I’ve been doing pretty well lately, and I don’t know if it’s quarantine or something else but I’m finding myself slipping into old habits. But they are so easy and familiar and they WORK. I’ve put in so much effort to get better but I feel like I’m stopping myself from healing and I can’t pinpoint a reason why. I don’t want to feel like this anymore but I’m also not sure I’m ready to feel different. I feel like I can’t talk about this with anyone because it sounds so selfish. I’m in a position where I could feel better but something is holding me back. Do I even have the right to feel this way?"
285,Rope burn from a panic attack,"So I have anxiety and ptsd on top of a handful of other issues last year I discovered I also suffer from hallucinations and since covid and quarantine getting gnarly it has only gotten worse. Today in my car I had headphones in cuz I figured I want control over the sounds around me... with them in I still heard voices around me and saw shadows moving I called my partner grabbed my bag and planned on bolting inside my computer bag got pinned between my cane and emergency break and I yanked so hard trying to get free I got rope burns on my hands. 

My loved ones claim they can take care of me but I feel like I’m losing my mind"
286,I am unable to be productive.,There is something wrong with me right now where I can’t be productive. At a time when it is most critical for me to.
287,Moving day is almost upon us,"I just don't know how to feel. I am excited about having more space, but upset and mourning the loss of my familiar surroundings, as I have said many times now. I mean, I am sure after a while I will become more familiar with my new surroundings and love them as much as I do these, but my Depression just won't let me feel happy about that right now.

I also had the best talk with our 21 year old daughter, who is in after finishing her 3rd year of college. Well, she finished it at home because of Rona...but anyhow, she is here for the summer. She had to take me to get my prescriptions today, and we also had gone to Burger King because I was craving a Whopper (DON'T ASK LOL!) and fries. Mmmm they were so good! Anyhow, when we got back to the apartment, we sat in the car for at least an hour just chatting about what had happened to her and her ex-girlfriend after I had gone to prison. I didn't know the whole story (this girlfriend had gone on to transition from female-to-male, which I knew about before I had gone away) and I had learned some really interesting stuff about why they had broken up, and how her current girlfriend and she had come to date. It was so nice and we also talked about how she is taking Psychology as a minor and how much her attitude had changed since I had gone to prison for the very real disorder that I have. Now there is NO doubt that I am not faking it or making it up, having been diagnosed by a psychiatrist. It was an awesome chat, and our 12 year old daughter (looks and acts JUST like her sister at that age lol) had also joined in and had stolen most of my fries. Heehehe. :)

That's ok.

Just wanted to post about this because we hadn't ever EVER talked just mom-to-daughter like that. She even hugged me and told me that I am a great mama. D'awwww. No. LOL. I appreciated that though. 

I am not tired in the least, I am anxious about how we are going to move ALL this crap out of here (again, I won't have to do much since I am not feeling well and I have medical issues)...and I am excited to be in the new place.

Thanks for reading! Bye for now. I will post again when we are settled. Until then, I don't know how much I will be around. :D"
288,Friend diagnosed with Bipolar 1. How can I help support them?,"I apologize if this isn't the correct spot to post this, but in an attempt to get advice, I felt like it would fit here. 

My friend was recently diagnosed with Bipolar 1 (lets call him A). A and his wife (S) have been good friends of mine for the past 5 years. His wife and I are really close and I consider her an older sister to me. We hang out all of the time and she has been a great older sibling figure in my life. With that being said, A has recently had this diagnosis and has been having a hard time. He goes to therapy, has a support group, and started his medications. He occasionally goes through manic episodes throughout the day and some of his traits that I have noticed over the years have exacerbated when he is stressed, has bad thoughts, etc. I have found it harder to connect and support him in these trying times. I usually listen to him and talk when he has these episodes, but the main thing that has been hard, is finding things to do (during quarantine) to distract him and let him relax and enjoy life again. This diagnosis is never easy and won't be fixed overnight, but I  want to provide opportunities for him to get his mind off of worrying, and help him with his impulsive behaviors. Are there things/activities that anyone would recommend in doing that could be beneficial to his physical health, mental health, and emotional health. 

My current ideas are asking if he wants to work on his (newly bought house), and inviting him and his wife to join in on small activities that I do, but that only goes so far. Any advice would be appreciated."
289,My (18M) friend (21M) texted me about her mental health and I don't know what to do,"I posted this in r/relationship_advice first and I found this subreddit recently. 

To provide some background, we've known each other since we were born since our fathers are school and college friends. We are part of a bigger friend group, but us, along with another male friend grew close in our teenage years. It wasn't like we were best friends, but we were close friends who met up at least every week when every one was in town and I felt we could talk to about anything. However, over the last year, we've grown super close and communicate weekly. 

Okay I guess that's enough information for you guys to understand our relationship. 

She started college three years ago and she made a couple of friends. However, she soon learnt that they were very toxic. This was also around the time when her sister, who she's extremely close to, moved to another country. I don't know exactly when she started feel a bit lonely, but in September last year all three of us had met up for a sleepover and she said that she felt depressed. Her boyfriend at the time had also ghosted her and started telling people that they had broken up without even telling her about it. The other guy was going to therapy for his own reasons, which I won't mention for his privacy, and he immediately told her to try it. 

We talked a while about it and gave her options such as seeing if her college had a therapist or her talking to her parents and getting her help.She told us that she had talked to her parents and they brushed it off by saying ""you are strong"" and ""it's just a phase"". After this, she didn't want to talk to her parents about it. 

I started to check on her weekly until she told me that she felt fine and doesn't need any help. So, I stopped specifically asking ""How are you feeling"" and would straight go to things like ""You'll never guess what happened today"" and just talk like normal friends would. 

Last week was her birthday and we had a long conversation where she told me that she had a great day even with the virus and I was happy to see that her mental state had improved a lot. 

Well, today I received the following message

&lt;My name&gt; I thought I am okay and that I don't need any therapy but maybe I do! I have mini panic attacks a lot idk I can't talk to anyone about how I feel even if I want to. I dont let myself speak so idk what to do

The main issue I have is that I want to say that you can talk to me and you can try to go for therapy but she specifically says that she doesn't let herself speak. Also, she sent me this message at 4 in the morning, so I wonder if she had a panic attack then or had thoughts about self-harming. Please tell me what should I do.

Edit: we live in India, just read the rule about geographic location."
290,Can depression improve on its own?,"Not exactly sure which sub I should post this question to, but I've tried searching around and I haven't really found the answer I've been looking for.

Although I have not seen a professional, I do believe that I experienced a depressive episode throughout my last couple of years in high school (about 1-2 years ago). This feeling of helplessness and lethargy was constant and ongoing for at least a year. Many of my friends had shown concern with my mental well-being, but I had simply kept denying what I was going through. However, the more that I started to learn about it, the more I began to realize I had felt many of the symptoms and feelings that are described with diagnosis. Thinking about it, I would likely attribute the episode to a bad relationship with my mom and a tough relationship breakup. Many months later as a now college sophomore, I can definitely look back and say that I am fortunate enough to no longer feel the same way that I had did then, having found new friends and started to live a life outside of home, prior to the coronavirus situation of course. Even being stuck at home right now I'm somehow doing pretty well. But I am still feeling a bit lost.

It feels like it's a common/shared thing to say you don't know what to do with your life or you don't understand what you're feeling, especially as a college student/young adult. But I feel like I am constantly in this mood of confusion and numbness. I've heard that depression can cause some forms of brain damage and may have to do with some form of chemical imbalance, and I'm wondering if what I'm experiencing now is a result of that. I don't really have many true interests, and I struggle to make personal goals for myself. A lot of times I have difficulty thinking and concentrating, and I feel like I am starting to forget things more easily. I'm beginning to have trouble recalling personal memories, and I'm afraid if I don't figure out what's going on, it'll just get worse.

Now I understand that self-diagnosis isn't a valid means for help, especially for mental health. But feeling as if I have somewhat ""recovered"" from the worst of what I was going through, I'm wondering, can depression truly improve on its own? Or do the psychological effects continue if treatment isn't found? I definitely can say that I have improved the way I handle my emotions and relationships now, although it may be due to a lack of perception. But would it still be beneficial to seek therapy?

Thanks in advance, and I apologize if anything was worded/described poorly. I'm not a very frequent reddit user, but I figured this might be a way to start to ask for help (also cross posted in another sub). If there's anyone else in the same situation, I'd appreciate hearing what else you've been doing to get better. :-)"
291,Questions about mental health in the classroom (long),"Hello, I would like to preface this by saying I do not suffer from any mental health issues and am not extremely educated on this subject. If I have unintentionally said something offensive in this, please let me know so I can remove it as I absolutely do not want to hurt anyone. I mention suicide ideation/harmful behaviours in passing, but I'm not sure what counts as triggering so I'll just let y'all know in case. This is a long post but I wanted to be as clear as possible. :)

I'm gonna be a teacher in a few years' time, and have some mandatory internships before then. I looked through my modules but I don't know how useful they are in training me as a teacher to care for my students' mental well-being.

I know there is no substitute for trained psychologists or therapists and (in some cases) medicine, and I'm not trying to be one (not to mention that there is a strict procedure to follow if we find out any students are struggling with mental health issues/trauma). However, I was wondering if anyone here has first-hand suggestions for **how teachers**:

1) 3) **Should address the issue of glamorisation of mental illness in the media/mental health in general in class.** I'm super afraid that someone who, for example, might be struggling with suicide ideation or self-harm could hear about how people ""glamourise"" mental health, and feel invalidated/decide not to open up/like they have to ""prove"" that they are ill- which is the absolute last thing, of course, that anyone wants. However, I feel it is still an important topic to address because it is very common for students to claim that they are ""depressed"" or ""act"" otherwise mentally unstable because it's ""cool"". Unfortunately, I suspect this has to do with the popularity of (often violent) mentally unstable characters in Manga/Anime (Yandere-types, ""dark, brooding"" hero(ines), psychopathic villans etc.). Should this issue just be touched on lightly? Is this a coping mechanism for actual mental health issues? I'm really not sure. Any first-hand opinions are appreciated.

2) **Can make the classroom a healthier, safer space**\- or is this impossible? How, for e.g., should we react to bullying, counsel victims of bullying, talk to students who are struggling with material etc. I know the usual, like don't belittle students, don't put too much pressure on them etc. but I would like to know if there are **any specific actions which would have helped you or did help you**. One example of such an action is: my teacher used to have ""Excuse Sticks"". You were allowed about 3 sticks a semester. You could get a stick and put it on your desk, and she would not direct any questions to you or ask you to participate in class/groupwork unless you volunteered, and you could go up to her afterwards and either just return the stick or talk about how you were feeling, but she wouldn't pry. I (as someone who is lucky enough to be mentally healthy) thought that was quite good, any thoughts? 

3) **Should interact with students who they know are struggling with something**, be it family issues or mental health (very common in my country for this information to be given to the main teachers of the student, not sure about in other places). **Should we intentionally check up on them, or wait for them to volunteer information? How can we encourage them to see the school counsellor?** 

Thank you very much for reading to this point!"
292,The medicine that works.,So I’ve been on different antidepressants for around fifteen years. Zoloft being the main that worked most of that time. I have switched several times. Wellbutrin made me feel literally insane. Prozac made me fat and happy. Cymbalta made me feel like static fuzz and quiet. I always come back to Zoloft in the end. The only issue is it wears off over extended periods and it gives me bad heartburn. I would gladly choose physical pain over mental pain all day. I’m just curious if there is anything like Zoloft out there?
293,I think quarantine is making me go crazy.,"Where do I even start.

During the second week of quarantine, I began having this feeling of chest tightness and pressure. Iv'e never had that feeling before and it made me think I had corona because it's a respiratory disease. It made me feel like I couldn't breathe, even though I could. I'm pretty sure now that it was just anxiety and panic attacks. This lasted for about a week. I went to see a doctor on the 5th day, and he did an exam and said I was fine. I was honestly disappointed because he didn't help me at all or tell me how to get rid of this chest tightness. He even told me he wasn't gonna diagnose me with anxiety. I left feeling hopeless because even though the doctor said I was fine, I didn't know what I was gonna do about my anxiety since it was the worst part of waking up everyday. Luckily, though, my chest tightness left 2 days after seeing the doctor. Maybe my brain just needed a professional medical opinion to stop feeling this way. Who knows.

Now I'm in my second month of quarantine and I cannot take this anymore. I literally feel like I'm dreaming at this point. I'm at the point where I have an AP test next week, but I'm not doing anything about it. Like I can't even bring myself to study for it because the rest of life seems pointless and I have nothing to look forward to. There is no good news so I feel like I'm gonna be stuck like this forever. I think I'm going insane. I don't think it's healthy for me to be isolated from people besides my parents for this long, especially since I'm an only child. Before quarantine, I was already an over thinker. But now that I have basically 24/7 to just be by myself with no daily routine to distract me, my thoughts are exploding. And it pisses me off seeing people go out with their friends, having sleepovers or just hanging out because there are actual people (like me) who are actually taking this quarantine seriously and doing the right thing even if they have to struggle with their mental health.

Like I don't think I can do this for one year. I'm already feeling terrible and it's only the second month. I'm scared I'll be totally drained by this fall, mentally unstable to start my first year of college. I might have to even take a gap year. I told my friend about all of this and she told me I should try doing things to keep me busy like journaling, reading, meditating, listening to podcasts or whatever. But I don't know. I'm just not like that. Although, I do seem to be journaling right now.

I just feel like I'm waking up to the same day over and over again. Nothing to do. Nothing to look forward to. Just a pointless, boring, meaningless life. I tried talking to my parents but they don't help or understand. So all I really have is myself I guess. Also, I do have a job that I'm still considering on going back to. I work at a restaurant, and I don't know if it would be better for me to go back to work so I'd have something to do or if it would be better not to because of the virus and the anxiety its caused me.

I have several other personal problems but its just too much to get into. I think I said everything that needed to be said for now."
294,I feel like i’m losing a race i’m not even running in yet,I had a really hard semester. I failed my first class and i’m at risk of losing my financial aid. My university is furloughed so i can’t get answers. I’m dealing with a lot grief because i found out some hard to deal with medical news this week. I’m having a hard time seeing my self as successful in any way as an adult. I deal with Anxiety and Major Depression Disorder and everything seems like it’s caving in at once. I have no clue what to do and i need advice or a reason to keep going. I feel defeated and alone. i’m too ashamed to reach out to those close to me because i don’t want to disappoint. Everything causes me to cry or breakdown. I don’t want to do this anymore
295,Does depression ever just feel like numbness to you? I can't feel anything. I guess feel agitated most of the time.,"I haven't been able to feel any emotions except anger and anxiety, if that is even an emotion. I should be happy and excited because I'm due this month with my 2nd. I'm not disappointed at all. I just don't feel excited or happy. I feel nothing most of the time. Everything triggers anger though, I try to cope by separating myself from others but then that leads to problems in my relationships.

296,Need advice on how to get better,"I’m (19M) not doing too good, I have these weird mood fluctuation and paranoia that comes and goes and just feel overall tired of life, I’m self conscious and don’t feel adequate for the people in my life, I feel very alone as all my friends are far away, we all live in separate countries, and I have no friends in mine (USA). I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for a long time but stopped mid 2019. I feel that I need to be medicated but don’t need to talk about anything because I’ve spoken to a therapist for years and never really got anything from it.. I don’t know how to go about getting an appointment with a psychiatrist.. can anyone show me where to go from here or give me some general info?

TL;DR I’m a 19M living in the US. No self esteem or self worth, lonely and tired of life in general. Want to see psychiatrist but don’t know how to get an appointment or anything. Can someone help?"

(TALKING ABOUT SELF HARM)

My phone got stolen today and the person yeeted it into a cornfield. I have looked for it, but there’s such a huge approximate area that it could in, that there was too much ground to cover. My nerves were already pretty much shot, so I asked my friend, who I have been friends with for a fat while, to do my Snapchat streaks for me. 

He started chaos, basically. It was all in good fun mostly, but it got my family involved. On top of that, he screenshotted a bunch of awkward selfies, drunk pics, and cringe cosplay shit I never posted (for a good reason) that we’re buried in my memories. I got pressed I’m not even gonna lie. He said he deleted them, but when I asked him to prove it he said “there is not even a lot of room in his recently deleted so they wouldn’t have showed up there anyways.” 

It’s not even a huge deal, but it sent me into a full blown panic attack (I’m probably way overthinking because I recently got off my meds). It was a bad one and I fucked up. I’ve been almost a year free of cutting and I slipped up over something dumb and I just feel absolutely retarded. I’m literally sitting here in bed shaking and freaking out over some petty (and pretty funny) blackmail. I feel so stupid."

301,I need advice on how to help my girlfriend,"Hello. I have been dating my girlfriend for about 8 months now. I really care about her and her mental health. We are both seniors in high school and living with our families. She is living in dysfunctional household, stemming primarily from a manipulative and controlling father. 

I knew from the beginning that my girlfriend struggled with depression, but lately it had been really difficult. When we are together, she seems ok, but inevitably something traumatizing happens in her family that causes her to be upset. Due to restrictions with the virus, she has not been able to see her mental health professional. She has no one to talk to in her family, and things she’s been trying have not been working.  

She has been using alcohol as a coping mechanism to run away from her sadness and the underlying issues, sometimes behind my back. As someone who deeply cares about her, this really hurts me. I would like some advice on how to help her avoid this path. I know that I am not a professional, and there are limits to what I can do. What should I do? How can I address her substance abuse in a healthy way? How should I deal with my own frustration and sense of betrayal when she abuses alcohol?"
302,Can someone please direct me to some depression/anxiety services?,"I don’t mean emergency services. As of right now I don’t think that’s necessary. Basically this pandemic has really been taking its toll on me. I was in a pretty good place before. Although I would battle with anxiety most days, most days I would win. I hadn’t experienced a depressive episode in years. During this quarantine I’ve noticed some of my typical depressive behaviors but was denying that it was actually depression. I’ve been losing more and more battles with anxiety. For the first time in 5 or 6 years I considered self harm. Well shit, that’s not good. Instead of doing that I’m writing this post, hoping someone will read it and recommend me a service that I can talk to. A website, a phone number, another subreddit? A licensed professional in the Chicagoland area? I probably should have reached out sooner but I guess I didn’t realize how bad it actually got until I had that terrible thought."

304,Feeling dysphoria after cutting my hair,"This isn't an emergency mental health issue, I feel okay most of the time. I'm a 17-year-old male who has had long hair for the foreseeable past. As anyone would, I often wondered what I would like with short hair. Well, over quarantine I decided to self cut it. Before, it was a little bit past the shoulders/right around them. Now it is very short. The sides are shaved and the top is a little longer (4-5 inches). The weird thing is - I don't think it looks bad. My family loves it. My girlfriend cried when I cut it, because she loved my long hair. I loved it for the first few weeks, but things have changed. I've been looking in the mirror more and my face looks completely different. I don't recognize myself, I feel dysphoria/dysmorphia you could say - where is the old me? I feel a complete disconnect from what I'm seeing and what I ""feel"" like in my face - and the scary thing is that it's changing. I'm starting to feel like I inhabit a complete stranger's body. I want my hair to be back the way it was - and it scares me that it may take years. Part of what influenced me to cut it is the fear that I won't be able to get a job because of my long hair. That wasn't the primary reason but it factored in. I completely regret letting a fear of this have a say in this decision. I haven't been able to see my girlfriend since I cut it, but we've been facetiming constantly. I fear that she's going to not recognize me as me anymore and impact our relationship. There's nothing she's ever done to make me feel that way, she's been very supportive. It's just a fear. I understand this is unusual and probably hard to respond to, my apologies"
305,Im having these very weird desires to hurt my girlfriends dog lately,"Ok, first of all i wanna tell you guys that i WOULD NEVER hurt a dog, NEVER really. I love animals, my mom is a vet and i have 4 dogs which ive never did anything to them. 

My gf have a small pug. During the quarentine im spending time with her and her dog is with us. I love him to be honest, he is very playful, cute and docile, but i have to admit sometimes i think it is disgusting because it drools, snores, make weird noises, have sleeps in the eyes a lot and you know pugs eyes are strange 

because of this i dont like him touching me with his face because its a little bit disgusting, anyway thats not the reason that i sometimes have this feeling to hurt him. 

The dog sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night having bad dreams or something like that and he start to cry and howl loudly with a strange(and sometimes annoying) vouce, i was pretty cool with that. 

But a month ago in one night i was sleeping and the dog started to cry and howl like i said previously, but this time i woke up and the first thing that came to my mind was this FUCKING WEIRD thought/feeling that it would be a good idea to hurt him, it took me about 5 seconds to realize what the fuck i was thinking, hurt an innocent dog? And a dog who i like and care about, i mean wtf? But to be honest i was REALLY tempted to hurt him, it was a thought that i would LIKE to hurt him for some reason. Anyway i just ignored this feeling and started to sleep again. 


Everything was fine but yesterday and specially today these feeling came back, not like the first time that i was REALLY tempted to do it, but these feelings cameback. 

Right now he is in the couch with me, sleeping in my leg, my gf is sleeping. But as i said, i would never hurt it and i really like this dog.
 
I just wanna know if there is an explanation about all of this, am i alright? Is this common? Please help!"
306,I’ve started resenting my upbringing and I’m developing a fear of being naive,"Self-reflective post - thoughts/comments would be really appreciated (but just writing this out has helped me too). 

I’ve been going through a pretty tough emotional journey for the past ~18 months, which I cope with well sometimes, and really badly other times. Overall it’s meant that I have spent a lot of time introspecting and thinking philosophically. 

About a year ago I started noting down big ‘life’ realisations that I had (kinda like epiphanies I guess), reflecting on how I have been living my life, improving my perspective on things, figuring out what brings me joy and meaning, etc. That list has grown exponentially and I have probably over 50 of these life-changing realisations now. I think maybe wisdom developed exponentially once I began to be more open-minded and outward-looking. It’s really awesome and I’m super glad I’ve had all these realisations, but it’s also exhausting! 

The relentless, intense learning experience has made me begrudge massive aspects of my upbringing. Why didn’t my parents raise me with these positive and healthy outlooks from the beginning? As soon as I’ve had the realisation, it instantly feels so obvious and intuitive. I’ve wasted 27 years of my life not knowing these super simple, super important things that others have known and understood for centuries. 

For example one of the realisations I had, related to how I interact with others, was that I wasn’t brought up to really respect or appreciate other people, beyond outward politeness. This has meant that I have developed quite an unhealthy perspective on building friendships and connections with others. Another example was when I realised that it’s my choice whether or not to put value on other people’s opinions of me. I think if I was brought up with this attitude, the bullying that I endured throughout most of my school life would have had a much smaller impact on my life. 

I don’t *blame* my parents - they aren’t super educated and I know they aren’t negative on purpose, and there were aspects of my upbringing that I am sure were much better than average, which I’m obviously grateful for. But I can’t help feeling like my life has been held back in a lot of different ways because I didn’t have these attitudes until now. (A part of me wants to talk to them about it and try and impart some of my newly gained wisdom to them, to help them be happier and gain some inner peace too, but that feels weird. I’m not sure they’re at the age where being talked ‘down’ to by their child is acceptable yet haha.)

It’s also kind of causing me some anxiety, because I keep realising something new and then really cringing at my actions before. At the start, like a year ago I could easily forgive myself for that because I’d only just begun to think in these more positive and proactive ways. Gradually, I began to feel less naive and as though I was happy with my perspective. 

But, then another huge realisation would come along and make me look back on that, more recent time (when I had not felt naive), and I’d even cringe at the actions I took then. It’s becoming a bit of a worry - I become more sure of myself and am then shown otherwise by a new realisation, and the impact of this cycle on my self-assurance is getting more severe as the wisdom accumulates. 

I get that being naive isn’t all or nothing, and it’s impossible to not be naive about anything. I guess accumulating wisdom is an ongoing process, and I’m always going to be relatively naive compared to my future self. I guess in that sense, by writing this I am realising a meta-realisation. I kind of want the novelty of these realisations to wear off, so that instead of feeling life-changing, they just alter my perspective in a minor way. 

I’m 27 and I think that I have a more mature outlook than most others my age. I just find it hard not to cringe at my former self, and not to feel frustrated at how much better I think my life would be if I’d known this from the start. Is that just an inevitability? I guess maybe everyone experiences that - upbringings where every single box is ticked must be pretty rare I guess. I’m not sure whether as I become more wise, the novelty of this will wear off and I’ll feel more at peace with the cycle of feeling insightful and then naive - I hope so."
307,I had a terrible day today depression wise,"This whole quarantine has destroyed my mental health. My school has switched to online work which has just drained all my motivation to do anything. Today was just a terrible day for my depression adding to the mix and I am in such a terrible state at the moment. I have thoughts of suicide but I’m afraid of what will happen after it all. I don’t know what to do since I’ve already planned on it all and I’m worried on if I don’t do it today, what’s going to stop me tomorrow. I just don’t know what to do and if I truly want to go through with it. I feel so alone right now and I hope that this will just help me. 

Anyways if you are reading this, thanks for caring enough to read and remember to tell those you love how thankful you are of them. I believe that we never share how much a person means to you until it’s too late 

Sincerely yours,
Little insignificant me"
308,My Dad. What’s Wrong.,"First off, I never really do anything like this, because I never felt like I had to.


Anyways, before I explain how my life is right now, I’ll talk about myself. 

Hi my name is Case, I just finished my junior year of high school today. Everything for me is great. School is great, and my friends are amazing. I’m happy and proud about the person who I am today. But my family right now is a different story.

Don’t get me wrong. The past 17 years of my life, is one that I am blessed to have. And actually my family is almost perfect. Like any other we have our issues and we have had our ups and downs. But recently things are different.

I’ll just be straight up. We don’t know what’s wrong with my dad. For years my dad has these little phases. Sometimes it drinking, and lying about it and sometimes it strange irrational behavior. It’s like some switch turns and he becomes a different person. In the past we handled it, and he became better, and everything seems normal again. The past year and a half, everything was great. My dad has been his normal perfect self. Up until now. Since this past month, he became a different person. We believe he has PTSD from an event that happened 8 years ago(To keep it short, it was a car accident that had involved the neighbors young child). Since then it left him scarred. And that why he has these little phases. He’s never been truly diagnosed but my mom believes it is. It seems he has these triggers. For example, he’ll get angry and a lot of anxiety when taking my little sister trick or treating on Halloween.  But now, it seems more than JUST PTSD.

My dad has never laid a hand on any of us, never treated any of his children unfairly. But what he’s done now is crazy. Insane. And sick. 

So I’ll now say what’s happened in this past month. It first started with my dad getting overly angry about being awakened at night. If someone went to the bath room, or I or my brother were being too loud late at night playing video games, or my sister trying to hold in laughter late at night talking to her friends. Usually he just tell us hey, quiet down, we have work in the morning. But now he gets angry, and the anger get directed to my mother. They argued nightly. But then it got worse

My dad started making accusations about my mom. Mainly about drugs. (But one one time I think he mentioned something about an orgy?) all of which is clearly false. My mom is the most perfect mother. She’s hardworking, loving and a great role model for any person. She (and my dad) would do anything for us. And if you know my mother, you would think only a madman would make these accusations. But my dad did not just form a hypothesis, and confront my mother. No. Instead, something that is controlling him caused him to set up A CAMERA in her bathroom and closet. We had no idea there was one on there. My mom found out because my dad has been acting stangely with his phone and he would not show her the phone. My mom eventually got the phone, and found the footage. We found out that He went into the attic, drilled holes into the ceiling to install the camera in the closet, and then hid another in the air vent. Absolutely crazy. The man who raised me right, is not the same man doing this. My mom cried and argued with him forever. The next morning while he was at work. My mom called us in. She explained what happen (even though we heard the argument), and said we finally need to talk to him. 

This is a first time as a family that we had to sit down together all together and speak to him. But the conversation ended with him saying he was wrong. And that he won’t ever do it again. What happens the next day? Camera. Hidden in a black sock, cut out, aimed at the bed. Why? Because, apparently my dad still believed in these false accusations. But it’s nonsense. (First off, there is ZERO REASON to why there’s a camera pointed at her bed in her sleep. You won’t find anything doing that (but like I said, he behavior has been irrational) my mom found out because she once again saw him on his phone very suspiciously and found the camera once again. He then said he had to make sure and that it was the last time. The next day, it was my birthday. My dad seemed normal again, and my mom was actually speaking to my dad like normally again. Family came over and he was normal again. But the next day, he set up a camera in the living room. This time, it was to listen to what we were saying about him, to reflect on himself, and know what to do. My mom once again fearful of this. He got angry, oh and turns out, there was another camera inside the couch too. Anyways, the next 5 days have been getting better and my dad showing improvement. He was doing his normal things like cleaning the house, and finishing on painting the door, repairing a pillar that we had outside destroyed by termites. He was normal again. Until two days ago he asked me for the WiFi password. Why would he need a WiFi password, when I have his the password once we got a new router. I told him the password and waited. 

That night I got on my pc and logged into my router. I knew there was a setting to see all devices connected, so I looked and found cameras connected to the WiFi. We normally have cameras around house house actually. (Installed because we noticed someone search through my moms car one night, stole money from my truck, and tried to hijack my dads four wheeler) We have 3 cameras total around the house (but I noticed they were never reset again after we changed the wifi). So I knew they were my dads crazy cams for whatever reason they were for. So instead of saying anything. I just blocked them off the WiFi. I wanted to wait and see how he reacted. But then I noticed something off. There is 5 of us who live in the house. We each have a phone. So why is there 7 new phones connected. I new that they were his backup phones. They relied on the WiFi, and I’m sure he didn’t buy data for them because we could see if he made a purchase through our banks.  I planned on telling my mom the next day, but I still wanted to see how he reacted with broken devices.

Instead, the next night, my mom found my dad with another phone. Turns out all the footage we told him to delete was on there. My mom came back to me crying and told me. I showed her what I found out and I was right. There was another phone and he setup more cams.

I also forgot to mention a very important detail. When he shows my mom footage he keeps finding “evidence”. But no, all the “evidence” are fake and he is literally hallucinating. (For example: when he was in the bathroom-cam-phase. He swears he sees drugs taped to my moms ass and that’s where she’s hides them.) If you don’t think that’s bad, then 1 your messed up, and 2 he also started hallucinating in another piece of footage. One night he goes to my mom and shows her footage of my brother, who snuck in a girl. He shows her and guess what. Nothing there! It’s just a red couch. Now things are getting serious.

When we had a that first family chat i talked about earlier. I suggest mental help. He doesn’t want to. He says it doesn’t work. It’s the classic, person clearly needs mental help and he doesn’t want it. He said if that’s what we do, he’ll walk out the door. (He has said that many times during this and other events) my mom has been suggesting a divorce but because she’s my mother she doesn’t want. She says she doesn’t want that for her children. But we tell her to do what’s necessary. And she’s still hanging in there to this day. She’s loves the hell out of him and my dad loves her too. But this is not the same man.

Now leads to this night. The past two days seem okay. My dad is fine from early morning, to 9:00. That’s when it feels as if he becomes a different person. Because of quarantine, I haven’t really left the house. In fact I purpose stay to watch over my dad. Watch every move he’s making, and I sound weird saying that but I have to, because tonight when I went to go to the bathroom, I looked at him and knew something was up. But instead I go back to my room a lay there. 

Around 12:00, my dog who is around me 24/7 wakes up. She starts looking at the door and growling. Her eyes are looking left and right at my wall that’s connected to the hall way. At that point, I know he’s there. And I once again know something is wrong. But I just sit on my bed and wait. And I listen again. My dog sitting on the bed, and every-time she hears something, her ears perk up and she does this low growl, as if someone were to walk into that door, she will attack. She does this for 30 minutes.

My dog is a border collie. I have a close bond to her, and she is never harmful. She is protective of me. She has done the growling before but it was because she wasn’t used to my sister coming into my room at 11:30 asking for help on math homework. She started barking at my sister because she stood there staring at me wondering if I was awake. Other than she doesn’t do this. She doesn’t randomly growl at the door. Then I hear a bump and she drops down off my bed and to the door. She sits and stares at it. 

5 minutes later I hear my brothers door open, like every night to go to the kitchen. My hall way is built to were if some opens a door, you hear it. If someone walks, you hear it. You have walk snail speed to not make anyone hear anything when you sit in my room. I knew my dad just so happen to be in the hallway, but I thought he ended up leaving to go to the back rooms. Anyways. When my brother walks out, he screams. My dad was standing in front of my door, and the position he was in, was arms to the side, and back touching my door. My brother then realizes it was my dad. Then my mom ask what’s going on. My dads excuse, he wanted to prank me.

My dad hasn’t pranked one of us since we were 10. Not only that he’s usually in bed and sound asleep at 9:30-9:45 at the latest. So why is he there? I don’t really know, but what I do know is this. In the hall ways, it has four doors and at the end, a bath room. First door in right is my brothers, but my door is the first door on the left, but it’s on a shortened hallway. It’s like a 5ft ally way, that leads to my room. 

The reason I think he was there was because he was putting his ear on the wall and listening into my moms room. That’s the only reason I could think of why he was there. But I don’t know WHY!

After my brother sees him there my mom came out and asked what’s going on. My dad then says NOTHING is, and goes to the back rooms. They then argue and accuses my mom of having a second phone. But instead he ends the argument with, “I’m wrong.” Go to bed. She comes back and we all just look at each other like, “wtf”. 

Now I hate to write this because it paints my dad in a bad picture. My dad is amazing, I have so many of my friends tell me I have a perfect family and wish they are like mine. And I’m proud of that. They say my dad is really cool, and wish they had one like mine. But I never actually told anyone about this. I just keep it quiet, because I don’t want them to see my dad the wrong way.

I love him, and he’s an amazing father. He’s taught me so much. But this isn’t him.

Now, we have no idea what’s wrong with him. I still can go into more detail but there’s just so much. 

If anyone can give me advice, or reasons why, or how should we get him into getting some kind of mental help. It’s just sad at this point. I’m always stand on my toes waiting for the next thing to happen."
309,Depression worsening during quarantine...missing my boyfriend so much.,"20F here, college student, extrovert and I have depression. I've been on meds for my depression (Prozac) for a couple years now and it's helped me greatly, but being stuck inside lately has made it worse. Much, much worse. 

I feel like I can't get the social interaction which I need to recharge my batteries, and although I regularly video chat it's really not the same as spending time in person. Because I normally live on campus, I'm used to talking with my neighbors in my student housing, walking with friends on the way to class, and visiting my boyfriend (who goes to school with me) and his family. Now I'm back in my hometown with my parents, and as much as I love my family and where I'm from, I've been going stir-crazy feeling trapped in the house and my mood swings have been coming back. 

The worst part, by far, is being unable to see my boyfriend and his family. Before the pandemic hit, I would visit him and his family every evening and we'd do things like making and eating dinner together, watching movies, playing video games, cuddling and more. Now it's been almost two months since I've been able to see him, and the ""stay at home"" order here doesn't lift until June 1st. Each time I see a picture on Snapchat or video message from him I end up getting upset that I can't see him, and my emotions take what I call a ""downward swing"". Being the stupid but loud voice it is, my depression will fill my head with things such as ""what if you have to wait even longer to see him?"" ""What if the virus comes back and you're stuck inside for months longer?"" ""What if his family becomes do afraid of the virus that they won't want you over?"" Worst case scenario shit like that. I know it's just a chemical imbalance, I know in hindsight that it's not real, but it's loud.

I end up getting irritable around my parents, losing my motivation to do my schoolwork and I just shut myself in my room and cry. Sometimes these downward swings turn into what feels like a panic attack: my hear thunders and my head feels ready to explode. Sometimes it feels like an impossible task to pull myself out of the negative thoughts that swarm my mind as I'm stuck inside, away from so many people I care about.

Is anybody going through something similar right now? Does anybody have tips to deal with worsening depression during this chaotic time? I just want to try and feel better, and see if I am not alone. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during this crazy and scary time."

311,My parents house is a dump it’s affecting me mentally.,"Hi guys! I really need some help, so recently I moved from a rental back to my parents house due to leaving my abusive partner. My parents house is an absolute dump. There is clutter in every single space you can think of, there’s mice through the house, broken windows including in my room. We have no lounge room as it is filled with clutter, our kitchen is barely useable and our sink has been broken for months I have to empty a small bucket underneath the pipes everyday as they won’t call a plumber. My step dad has no job, no friends and sits at home all day and smokes in the house which I can’t tolerate. He doesn’t lift a finger around the house and it will never ever change so there’s no point. To make it worse he lets the dogs out the front to do their business and every single day I am stepping in dog poop not to mention our front yard isn’t accessible and have to walk around through trees to even get to our front door. It’s starting to really get to me because they haven’t cleaned the house in years and it’s falling apart, our house is lopsided due to the stumps needing to be redone. I’m struggling mentally with my break up and all of this is affecting me I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t afford to live alone nor with friends. Any tips would be appreciated! I’ve also mentioned to my mum how depressing it is but she just doesn’t care enough."
312,Do therapists know things about you before you know?,"Weirdly worded title, but are there things that therapists pick up on before we know these things? I’ve been talking about a close friend in therapy for about a year, and every time my therapist says “And you’ve said this isn’t romantic at all?” I kept thinking this was really strange because I’ve said every single time that it’s not romantic. I’ll blab on for ages saying “Yeah yeah absolutely not romantic at all, absolutely not! Hahaha!!” 

I didn’t think about this after therapy once until now, sitting down and thinking about my friend and maybe I might have feelings for them. 

It sounds dumb as hell but would my therapist have known without me even knowing? But didn’t want to say anything? I know this sounds stupid haha"
313,I had a mental breakdown and it's severely affected my grades.,"Earlier in the quarter I broke down because of all the shit going on, I didn't really care about anything, I stopped trying in class and had kinda given up hope and was ready to give up on life completely. My grades dropped a lot, my mom full-heartedly feels that my grades are more important than my ""Silly Emotions"" so she won't care even if I explain, I have 63 missing assignments and am failing half my core classes, I've really been trying hard and pushing myself a bit since I got better but I know when she sees all of it she'll freak and yell at me, I can't really take being yelled at because through the ages of 2-6 Yelling meant I was about to het hit because she took advantage of me being small and dumb, it's really fucking with my mental state, I'm really scared of getting grounded because my only form of communication outside of my mom and brother, I kinda need my friends to be able to vent but I'm scared I might not be able to speak to them again.


tl;dr- I had a mental breakdown and my grades started to slip how do I fix them fast?"
314,I feel like I'm going insane.,"I feel like I'm constantly going around with this voice in my head. It monitors every word I've ever spoke, every action I've ever done, and every thing I'm currently doing or saying. I find myself arguing with this voice all day in my mind.

Every reminder of someone who hurt me sends me spiraling in a world of pain. Everytime I think of a time I told a joke and I didn't make someone laugh, I feel like a social outcast. These thoughts keep circling in my head and I feel like I'm spiraling and I don't know what to fix. And I'm scared because the more and more attention I give the voice, the louder it gets. 

I don't even know if any of this made sense. I'm having trouble making sense of what's in my own head."
315,How to deal with an acquaintance that is depressed.,"I was wondering if anyone in this sub has any idea how to deal with people you barely know, but that you can notice are depressed. I live in student accommodations which means that out of twelve people we each have our own room, but we all share a big kitchen. One of the people i live with (let's call him Shaun) started to talk to me whilst i was cooking several times throughout the week. 

Initially it was only small talk, regarding the weather, the ongoing epidemic etc. After a while though he started to open up about his mental health problems, that he went on medication and that he was still torn up about a previous relationship etc. After discussing these things with him i started to notice that whenever i made breakfast or simply did anything in the kitchen he would tend to come there as well, striking up a conversation, almost like keeping tabs on me. He even once asked me what books i had bought from a package receipt i had thrown in the trash.

Now i get that he's not in the best mental state but at the same time some times i feel as though i really can't be bothered. Sometimes i just want to boil some tea without having to talk about nihilism or anti-depressants or how life feels pointless. He doesn't seem to be able to take hints regarding when i'm fine talking about these very serious subjects, or when i'm in a hurry or simply tired of it. I've suggested talking to friends/family or health professionals about it, but the thing is... i suspect i might be pretty much his sole social outlet.

I don't really see however how i can explain this to him without coming across as a dick. In some  way i really sympathise with him and i don't want him to overreact and never talk about his mental health problems. However i don't want to feel on edge every time i go into the kitchen, for discussing very serious subjects i am woefully unprepared for.

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips regarding my situation? Similar experiences?"
316,I feel like I'm floating and disconnecting from reality/my body?,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I'll delete this post if it is.

I've been experiencing this since a couple of months. It happens to me randomly at least once a week. I used to describe it as dissociation, but I think it's the wrong term. It feels like I'm floating and like I'm not connected to my body anymore. Almost like that falling sensation in dreams. During it I don't feel anything else besides that floating sensation.

It only lasts for a couple of seconds until its over, but it's quite intense. It hasnt affected my life in any way, so I havent seen a doctor or something. I've struggled with depression and anxiety in the past, but I'm doing okay right now.

Has anybody experienced something like this?"
317,I'm Having panic attacks more often by the day,"I feel like I'm always sinking deeper and deeper, I don't know how to react to this anymore. Sometimes  I just have outbursts of tears for the smallest reasons. I'm slowling slipping into my old bad habits and I don't know what to do with myself. My sense of safety is falling apart, I always feel anxious and I can't make simple decisions because of the fear that I'll do something wrong. Things that used to help me with stress now just make me feel bad about wasting time I could spend on learning and getting my health together. I just Can't get back into things that used to give me joy because I feel like they  would make me lose track of the work I have to do if I ever get too much at ease when doing them. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore"
318,I don’t know what to do anymore,"My name I’d rather keep anonymous and for the longest time I’ve been suffering with what I could describe as a deep feeling of darkness inside me. I haven’t been diagnosed by a doctor or something like that  because my parents don’t believe in mental illness, so I’ve never been able to go and seen. Because of that I’m not going to say I have anything out of respect. 

I have a felt a lingering sadness in me that won’t go away sense 5th grade, and I am not in 11th grade. I thought it was normal but then my sadness started to get worst and worst. Soon I started becoming scared of people finding out about my self with my depressing thoughts and my needs. I would rarely trust people and when I did I would become so scared that they would stab my back that they would eventually stab my back, leaving me in a worst state.

I’ve gotten to a point where that sadness is starting to go away but is being replaced by a sort of numbness. I feel like it’s a heavy weight in my stomach. I’ve been having trouble falling asleep more so then usual and even having troubles getting out of bed. 

I’m starting to feel like I’m “turning to the dark side of the story” how stupid that may sound. I’ve always acted nice and I’ve always cared for others, but I’m recently started to feel spiteful and and apathetic. I was able to feel and want to help others, but now I just feel nothing. 

My parents don’t believe in mental illness so I can’t even get diagnosed, and even if they let me they don’t believe in psychology studies so they wouldn’t even let me get out. I’m starting to lose hope, and I feel soon I’m going to disappear and be replaced. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m backed in a corner, and I’m terrified. I’ve even gotten to the point where I think I should just off myself before this turn so I don’t lose what little of myself I have left.

I know I don’t make sense but i just don’t know what to do anymore..."
319,I can't get help,"Hi I'm 19(f) and I have significant trouble getting help with possible mental illness, I haven't managed to get any sort of diagnosis because of this. I'm in Canada, so it's free to see a therapist, and I've seen three, but I just cant open up. I freeze everytime I have to talk about myself and find myself lying about how I'm feeling and other dumb stuff every time I'm asked, like if I felt depressed or suicidal lately. I've made no progress and because of memory problems I've had for years I can barely remember my appointments. If I feel so miserable and uncomfortable trying to talk to people who can help me then how am I supposed to get help ever? It's not even just therapists, I lied to my doctor about smoking marijuana even though it's perfectly legal and could have gotten myself seriously hurt because the sleep meds I'm on now can cause heart problems when mixed with it. I dont even know how im supposed to make progress if I just feel uncomfortable talking about me because what if im fine and it's a huge waste of time and I'm just lazy and not changing my habits because I'm using the possibility of mental illness as an excuse to justify my laziness??"
320,Fuuuuck covid,"I feel like I'm at a breaking point. I feel like I have had a really tough year. I moved abroad (which is not the issue, I wanted to leave the US, I don't feel safe there) with my wife so she could go to grad school, but I was unable to find work and ended up in a string of temp jobs that were horrible and didn't even make enough money. Now I'm relying on my parents. I have been really depressed and anxious and just feeling hopeless and like I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Then, I finally worked up the motivation and courage to apply for my dream postgrad program, and I actually got in. Things were actually feeling normal, I was depressed still but didn't want to die, and I actually started to get help. 
Until 2 days ago, I found out that because of covid-19, my grad program is suspended until 2021. I just feel like this broke me. And we're still abroad and were banking on my student visa to allow us to stay, but now we are going to get deported unless I just pick another random grad program to apply to, and that depends on me getting in. I just feel totally broken and hopeless again, and like if I do another program I still won't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. And just wanted to vent."
321,"I think I might have hyperthymesia, how would I get tested for something like this?","I honestly thought my memory was normal until this past year or so. I've always remembered every minor interaction I've had no matter who it's with or what it was about. For example, I can quote verbatim every conversation I had with a kid I only knew for 5 months when I was 7. I remember stuff like who asked me to borrow a pencil in high school and when. But I'm not that great at remembering stuff in math and whatnot, which I've read is normal for people with this condition. It's like I'm just constantly remembering everything in my life as far back as when I was 5. I'm not sure if this is hyperthymesia or something else but I'm curious. I used to think everyone remembered like this."
322,Dating &amp; Mental Health,"Hi people of Reddit! I want to start a discussion/thread around dating and mental health. More specifically, for those of us who struggle with certain mental illnesses. I'm no pro at dating, I date vary rarely if at all. But with saying that, I've found some of my experiences may be common for others too. 

Some context about me: (22F), I split up with my partner last year and have been dating casually since. I had dated over the years prior to being exclusive with my ex. At 19 I was diagnosed with clinical depression, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorder. I had been struggling with persistent panic attacks up until that point. As of late, I also found out I am on the bipolar spectrum. 

I grew up with an alcoholic mother, who also struggled with clinical depression. She was emotionally unavailable for the majority of my childhood. My father was largely absent, tied up with work and had an incredibly volatile and unpredictable temperament. 

Now, I engage regularly with my psychiatrist, psychologist and GP. I am proactive about my mental health and use a combinatiom of medications (antidepressant and a mood stabiliser) and CBT therapy to keep myself stable and from fluctuating between manic highs and lows. My depression has been labeleld 'highly functioning' - I maintain a full time job, studied part time and have a good social life. I eat well, exercise and adopt healthy coping mechanisms where I can to ensure I stay grounded. You often wouldn't  suspect a thing. 

Since my return to dating, I have been on the receiving end of some fairly negative commentary and attitudes from men regarding my mental health. I put myself in a position to be vulnerable and opened up, when  appropriate and had what seemed to be a respectful conversation with my date (s) about it. We discussed my past, the factors leading up to my diagnosis and how certain life events also contributed to this. Initially they were open minded and understanding of my position. I have though somewhat noticed a change in their behaviour after this point. They back away, or use my mental health as an excuse and point blame and shame when disagreements arise. 


I try to be open minded and independent in relation to dating. I very much live by the attitude what will be will be. I believe it's important to meet someone half way and to be fair. Be fair with money, respect the others persons time, value their word and enjoy their company . Just see where it goes. 

I think too often we fail to truly acknowledge other people's weaknesses. It's easy to discuss your hobbies, what gets you up everyday, positive life experiences. But sometimes, there is more to what's happening and more to what makes us who we are. 

I guess I'm just trying to understand a good way of approaching having 'that' conversation with someone you're dating. I never try and force it, usually just let it come up organically. I have noticed though others reservations when I do bring it up. Struggling with those feelings of judgement, inadequacy and guilt I often associate with my mental health. 

Let me know your thoughts!"
323,Need help ASAP,My girlfriend is having a mental breakdown tonight. I really don’t know how to handle this. I caught her talking with another guy today and it broke into a fight which led to us breaking up. Once she realized I was serious she started completely breaking down. She’s been cutting herself on her arms and she just tried to eat a handful of aspirin. I almost had to force her to spit them out. I’m scared *TERRIFIED* that she’s going to hurt herself and I really have no idea how to handle the situation. What the hell should I do?
324,I wish I was a girl,So I could get all the support my female friends get.
325,Is the Coronavirus not as life threatening as it currently feels?,"People have tragically lost their lives to this virus and my sympathy goes out to all those affected. 

1. Does it still remain true that most people recover, and the death rate is very low? With the way the world is right now, it feels like if you get this virus you are doomed. Is there any positivity out there in the fact that this virus is far from a death sentence? 

2. Once a person has had the virus in a mild form and then tests negative, is it highly unlikely that they will experience any long term side effects? Have doctors proven that it does in fact leave the body and can do no more harm?"
326,Working with a mental illness,"Sorry if this is a little long winded, but I'm in a confused state right now.

A little background on me: I'm 27 years old. I'm coming up off a very long, drawn out phase of my life where mental health issues have plagued me and dragged me down to perhaps the lowest point I've ever been. I've had various levels of treatment over the course of my life, but I seem to always find my way back to the bottom of this cycle my life has become.

Graduating high school is probably the only real achievement I have to my name. I tried college for a few years, but that didn't work out. The only real jobs I've have are customer service/retail jobs, but none of them for very long. My life has been dark, but I've come upon a bout of optimism very recently, and I'm wondering where to go next.

I had seen some ads about web development courses, and that's piqued my interest in working again. Like I said, my jobs have not been the greatest, and I've been out of work for a few years due to my illness. My plan out of high school and into college was to go into mathematics/engineering, but once that got derailed it threw my life for a loop. Not that the material was hard. I've always had an easy time with technical courses. It was the more freeform english and communications classes that walled me. I've always had a logical, rigorous mind, for better or for worse.

There's just a lot of things on my mind right now. After researching about job training program to learn about developing websites, there are a lot of things that sound promising, but a lot of other things that scare me to death. I know people here can't really give advice on this specific thing, but I'm just torn. I don't want to be setting myself up for failure, but my alternative right now is to go back to a dead end job that got me into this mess in the first place. I feel like whatever I do I'm just gonna go back to the way I always do and break down when the going gets tough.

I'm not looking for a fast track to success or money, just a better way to go about things, a path that might help me finally make me proud of myself and the life I'm living. 

I don't know. I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.

Cheers to anyone who reads this."
327,im tired of constantly getting the feeling of deja vu whenever i do anything. it's ruining my excitement for new experiences,"i feel like im trapped in a cycle of never ending deja vu's. at this point it's getting too hard to know what is an actual deja vu of something that i have indeed done in the past, and what is a deja vu for something new. it can be in conversations, games, people, my surroundings, tv, anything. its been happening more often too. i feel like i have for sure done something before, even though it's my first time. heck, i think i've even started creating fake memories because of all the deja vu's. im starting to get less excited by new things because i know that damn feeling of deja vu is going to ruin it.

i once read in an article about a man that had a similar thing happening, except it was worse. turned out it was because of his anxiety and depression, and im pretty sure there was an occurrence in his life that worsened them, but im not sure what it was. i haven't gone through any major negative experiences that would worsen my mental state, if anything, mostly good things have been happening. the last time something happened that really worsened my mental state was from 2016\~2018. im still far from recovering from it, but i've been doing quite better, so why now? i hate this feeling. thank you in advance for any opinions"
328,I CAN'T HOLD IT TOGETHER,"I CAN'T TAKE THE LONELINESS. I CAN'T TAKE THIS CRISIS ANYMORE. THERE'S NO SOCIAL LIFE. FUCK EVERYTHING. I'M SICK OF BEING MALE. BEING MALE IS BORING, THERE'S NO SUPPORT. I'M SICK OF BEING STRONG. I'M SICK OF HOW EVERYTHING IS THE SAME."
329,"Turned 18, I've never been romantically interested in anyone. helpme","Like the title says, I've went through all of middle and highschool without liking anyone romantically and I don't understand myself. I am a straight guy and I'm sexually attracted to women but never had any interest in them emotionally. 

I have 4 female friends and I noticed that since quarantine I haven't reached out to them in any way at all. That's what made me want to make this post as I feel like there's something else that I can't come to realize about myself. I have a lot of friends but I made them by just being in one social group in school and getting intertwined with other groups. I hate talking to new people and I never try to become friendly with people I don't know irl. I also notice that I sometimes fake being friendly to my friends' friends and kinda scare myself. I don't have social anxiety or depression and I enjoy talking to my male friends everyday and find that talking to my girl friends is a lot harder due to me just not being interested to engage with them through text or online through video games. I have a really great relationship with my mother and she's the most supportive person in my life.

I have always put girls that I found attractive in my mind and have never saw myself hitting on them or having a relationship. It's bizarre to me because I really do find them attractive but not to the point where I want to do anything beyond sex. 

I have had sex one time and I enjoyed it but we both weren't interested in each other and she regretted it as she had a boyfriend at the time. 

I was seen as the quite guy in school that most guys in his grade were friends and people didn't try to approach me as I was very anti social in school. 

What do you think, is this a younger guy, gen-z thing? or am i just really emotionally disconnected due to underlying reasons."
330,Does anyone else get this?,"I always manage to have like a 2 week to a month section of time where my mental health is ok (not perfect but a lot better) I finally feel a resurgence of wanting to take up my old hobbies that i couldnt do because I was so depressed, I try to diet and essentially fix my whole life because I want to take advantage of all the productive energy. But always after that stint of productivity it's like my soul starts to die and I slide back down into apathy. I get so sad and I can't finish any of the projects I started when I was ok. None of it seems fun or worth it anymore. I spend a long time where I feel like I physically cannot do any of my hobbies or interests, I can only do the absolute bare minimum for everything. I just hate it where I'm feeling good and i think ""this time I'll fix it, I'll start making friends and doing projects and eating healthy"" only for it all to get abandoned whe next time I get stuck in a depression pit. I don't think it's bipolar because when I feel good Its not really mania (as far as I know), just feeling like how i would imagine a mentally healthy person would feel most of the time. does this mean anything? does anyone else get this?"
331,I lost all of my support networks,"I can't fucking believe it.

332,Friends with Someone w/ PTSD,"I won’t get into specifics but my good friend has PTSD and underwent an extremely traumatic event. She was never someone who talks about her emotions and is very close nit when it comes to personal problems. Quarantine has definitely taken a toll on her and she told my she’s stuck with those very negative feelings and I’m the only one she can rant to. When she talks about her feelings and PTSD, and I’m not forcing myself to hep or taking responsibility but it’s important to me to be good at listening, what can I do or what are tips to help them feel listened to?"
333,I feel detached and suicidal,"I have ADHD and have previously been diagnosed with Agoraphobia.
I'm quickly losing my sense of purpose. in that, i am unable to provide for myself and working a low wage, robotic job makes it even worse.
I feel lonely, detatched, and occasionally sad to the point of crying. I am unable to give my full emotional story to someone else, it just ends up being me trying to be funny and not make a big deal out of it. I don't want to be a burden

I am unable to connect with my peers, and any ""friend"" i've had or have, i've always suspected of my parents giving them money or something to hang out. I haven't had a ""girlfriend"" or SO/companion in almost 10 years, and that fact makes it even harder to try looking for someone.

335,Help,"I'm 22 soon to be 23m in Germany, gay, depressed, suffering from anxiety due to an ongoing daily alcohol addiction with a father that is not understanding with very eccentric behavioral traits.

I'm a college student, and most likely I won't be able to pass my last exams. My university is not helpful at all and does everything to kick us out. I'm not that good at engineering...and even though I loved Germany, As someone from southern Europe people can be really cold and cruel here...and besides I can't seem to find anyone to date, I'm not the type for Germans. So as a closeted person even though I have a lot of stupid friends I feel lonely.

I don't have a private sphere since I live with my parents, my father works 24/7 from home and our health insurance goes over his work. My father does not recognize depression as an illness but rather as a mindset. I can't get help, and I can't afford to pay for it by myself. (E.g. Two months ago I did a long and tiring 7 hours drive, half an hour before getting home I had to stop, call an ambulance due to severe anxiety attack on the motorway at night, my father got mad at me because he had to pay a 400 euros bill before we got reimbursed. We're well off, we have money).

I don't know what to do, talking about doesn't help, it doesn't change anything, people don't change and it doesn't change my situation. I help everyone, I do everything for everyone just to see them smile...that's not fulfilling anymore. I've had suicidal phases, some harsher than others. But I just want my peace, I want to live and I want to be happy.. but the world is just so cruel.

If you have any advice for me feel free. I've taken a lot critics in life so you don't have to sugarcoat. I just want honest and genuine advice.

Thank you stranger."
336,Can I get some life advice? Please? Thank you,"Hi,

I'm currently facing a life crisis now. I'm not sure if I can even call it a crisis, but I just feel really detached and down right now.

I'm in my final year of my undergraduate study but recently I just realised that I'm actually afraid of graduating. I've made a lot of self-sabotaging choices that may possibly ruined my entire study...

It's just that...everything has been planned out for me. Going to university and study 'marketing and management', as well as working for my father or maybe take over his company once I ""graduated"". Right from the start, my future has been paved by my parents. My father is a business man so he has a business mentality. But I'm not.

I like arts, gaming, manga and fantasy novels. I feel like I'm a disgrace to my family because I think perhaps from their perspective, those things are ""immature"" as I grow older? I don't know if I'm putting it the right way.

Originally, I wanted to study drawings or animations when I was little. But when I told my dad about what I wanted, he advised me to ""follow after his footsteps"". That was the day when I first felt a drift between me and my parents as my mother supported his idea. My relationship with them grew apart further more when my mother also advised me to stop drawing arts because I should have ""grown out of it"". Ever since then, I don't think I was ever close with them.

My parents are nice and kind. Apart from the above incidents that I mentioned, they do their best to support me. They care for me. But I've disappointed them so many times. Worse thing is that they never blamed that me much. It really pains me to see when they tried to cheer me and encourage me instead. But this isn't what I wanted. I feel trapped.

I guess somewhere deep down I know I will never be the son they wanted. I tried to go along with their idea, go abroad and study in university...the 1st year was fine, but as 2019 and now, 2020 hits, I have these dark thoughts of wanting to fail and not graduate, running away, escape from this cruel reality. The only reason of me doing my best to banish suicidal thoughts is because it would bring shame to my family. But hell, I think I already did...

I messed up. I think I may have disappointed them again. I feel suffocated. My sleeping pattern is all fucked up. My head burns everyday. I have no one to talk to because I don't think my family will understand.

I need help. I need advice...please, will someone please tell me what can I do...I really don't see a future for me in this world."
337,My shower worked for 5 minutes,"I got in the shower, started washing my hair, put shampoo on and the shower almost completely stopped. It was coming literally one individual stream of water at a time, I fuckin hate preparing to shower, I hate showering, I hate drying. The only part of a shower I enjoy is knowing I don't have to shower again until the next day. 

But this morning it stopped and after around 10 minutes I really lost my fucking mind and eventually i got out and broke some stuff. 

Now I'm in a situation where: My day is completely ruined, I broke some shit, but most importantly I'm really scared to shower again because I have some horrible inability to control my emotions when shit goes horribly wrong. I now have horrible anxiety around showering because I know this shower is awful and if it stops working then I'm going to break something or cut myself or some shit and I just wanna be a normal fucking human being that can process emotions."
338,I have bipolar disorder and i am thinking that someone is running my free spotify account and hacked my phone,"I have bipolar type 1, and i am thinking someone is controlling my whole life. Listening to me, reading everything i type, and giving messages by running my spotify account with songs he sends to me.
This type of delusions ruined my life."
339,Piece of mind,"I hate reanalysing my relationships with people
Why can’t I just be
I hate having to rehearse before I speak
Why can’t I just say what’s on my mind
I hate having to make an effort to look like I check in when I’d rather be left to myself 
I hate how much energy I spend on maintaining fake relationships to not offend the group chat dynamic
Am I living in a hypersensitive nation or am I going insane"
340,I never understood triggers until i found out my girlfriend was raped and abused for years. Now certain things can destroy my day,"Thinking of my partners abuse makes me die inside. I can't breathe and i feel like im drowning. Its terrible. The fact that she feels 10 times worse makes it harder and i completely shut down. I do a good job pushing through it all but there are triggers that will destroy me.

I always thought triggers were bs but now i know they aren't. My girlfriend told me a story about how she was abused while her abuser watched the fresh Prince of bell air and now everytime i see that show i choke on sadness. I love joyner lucas but i cant listen to his new song with will Smith without bursting into tears.

I try to put on a strong face but knowing what shes been through i struggle to be happy. I struggle to keep going and if i didn't think it would make her more sad id seriously consider ending it all. She is the most beautiful and amazing person i have ever met but her abusers have stolen her life away. She has a lot of health issues now due to her abuse. The injustice kills me inside."
341,Am I A Sociopath?,"I have felt that I may be at least slightly sociopathic for the past 2-3 years. No, I'm not a psycho who mutilated animals when they were a child and is completely devoid of emotions, but I feel as though some fundamentally human part of me is lacking. I don't care about other people, except it seems like I do. I think it's a game I have been playing for a very long time. I choose people who are desirable (usually they're incredibly interesting, or 'hard to crack' in some way) and proceed to 'win' them over. I change me personality to fit exactly what they want, whether it be in a friend or a lover, and manipulate them to become obsessed with me. I feel as though I have the capacity to fully understand a person, and so I exploit this to the point where the person becomes emotionally reliant on me. Although I enhance manipulation for some, it is a pattern that occurs with most people in my life. 

I lie compulsively. I find myself lying for no reason, and very convincingly too. I feel as though I am incredibly self-aware.

My childhood consisted of my father treating my like his partner, and I was turned against my mother from a very young age. He never abused me or anything, just shared too much that a young child should not have to hear. Growing up, I as extremely independent and mature. When my parents finally separated, I was the one they told about what was happening (it was ugly but that's another story). I am a middle child, yet I have somehow assumed the role of caretaker within my household. My parents are both manipulative in their own ways, but it seems they are unaware of such tendencies. 

I have not always been this way. I cannot pinpoint when it happened, but sometime within the past five years or so, I've changed. I have thus considered that I may be narcissistic or slightly sociopathic. The only 'help' I've ever received is from a school counsellor which I had to visit during/ after my parents separation in my last year of high school. She told me that I had suffered trauma (from the separation, which as I said: was ugly) and that as a result had experienced disassociation. 

I know this may sound like someone who's watched too many serial killer documentaries or someone with a big ego who thinks they control everyone's psyche, so to give an example: when my best friend told me that they wanted to kill themselves, I couldn't cry with them, and had to force tears. 

Am I a sociopath?"
342,I get really vivid random memories and images when drunk (and sometimes even hungover) and it scares me. Is it normal?,"When I am drunk I always get random memories from my childhood that I am not getting when sober. Often I remember something sad and start crying, but not always. Sometimes they are just memories but they are very vivid. It's very strange because I know that alcohol is not supposed to activate your brain so much. In my case I feel like my brain gets hyper-active when drunk but I am unable to organise and control my thoughts. I get a lot of images, ideas, emotions and vivid memories, like I am on some sort of stimulant drug. It's very interesting because my brain stays in that hyperactive mode even when I fall asleep and I get vivid dreams. Even if I wake up and close my eyes, I get a lot of very vivid images, almost like I see them in front of me. Is this normal?"
343,Lsd psychosis?,".. i took lsd in late 2013.. well nbome...

And I was perfectly fine.. but up until late 2015 I did some cocaine and I burned out... then early 2016 my mentally statted to decline and slowly but surely I started blaming it on the LSD I took..

Mind you it was 2 good years of me doing some productive shit like getting my driver License back, seeking out for jobs(I even worked at a warehouse as a order puller for a week and did what I had to do without all that shit in mind, learned how to use the automatic pallet jack) I did my D.U.I. Class 3 months and Nothing like how im thinking now ever happened. 

In 2016 I traveled to Mexico, Chicago. And other places but my mind started to change.. For some reason I kept thinking my Trip came back... 

I dont know why. And Its been a long time since... I want to convince myself Im not in a Nbome trip but I dont know how?... fuck this shit trully. Makes it hard for me to think and live..."
344,I told my mom about my struggles and...,"I've been dealing with crippling social anxiety for 4 years now. It has almost completely destroyed my will to live. I told my mom and friends a year ago, and they didn't really comment on it. The reactions were so cold and rude, that I decided to shut up about my mental health.
Yesterday at breakfast, I told my mom that a school nurse recommended therapy for me. I then broke down in uncontrollable tears, and she was shocked. She told me she had no idea that my problems were this bad. She's gonna call a doctor on Monday, and I'm (hopefully) going to get therapy sessions.

345,How do I help my girlfriend with her mental health issues?,"My girlfriend (21F) and I (22M) have only been together for about 4 months. At first I didn't see any issues whatsoever, just a little bit of insecurity. A few months into the relationship she opened up and told me about her anxieties and panic attacks. She has had therapy but apparently it didn't work at all.

One time while I was with her she had a panic attack and told me I should go home, against what I thought was best I went home. Since that day she tried getting back into therapy, only to be let down because her condition isn't serious enough.

At times she can be really unemotional and will ignore everyone around her. I don't know how to handle the situation. I want to be there for her but have no idea what I can and can't do. One thing I do know is not to talk about the bad stuff for too long. A couple of minutes and then switch to a fun topic.

I love her and don't want to see her hurt like this.

Any advice is welcome. I'll try to answer any questions as fast as possible."
346,Lies and ruminating.,"For this to make sense, I have to explain something of my past first.

That something is the fact that my father has ruined my mind, I don't have enough time to go all the way into it, but one of the many things he does that has warped my outlook, is lie.
 Now the lies come in all shapes and sizes from little lies like I made this pasta myself (when it was store bought) to slightly bigger lies like this car was $50,000 when it wasn't even $500 to the more severe ""I am dying of cancer"" to the absolute worst. Leaving me a suicide note and going on holiday for two weeks.

There's a lot more that I've had to deal with, violence, control and so forth.

I've worked my way through most of that, so much so that this year I was able to celebrate Christmas without getting violent. Go me.

Now I feel as though I've healed nearly all of my trauma, but I can't stop lying. Small little lies that affect nothing.

Like earlier I told someone I had to leave my friend home because she was very drunk, but she wasn't very drunk. So I just added that little detail for no reason. This is probably a learned habit from watching my old fella.

Now given these small lies aren't that big a deal you're probably thinking ""what's the problem?"" Well the problem is that I can't stop thinking about them afterwards.

Will they tell someone else this lie and will it spread back and will people think less of me for it? That kind of thing.
 I think this is because everyone knows my father as a bit of a bullshitter and like to poke fun at me about it, hell even I laugh at some of the things he has said.

The thing is though, that when I lose control of my mind over these lies, it opens a flood gate of intrusive thoughts.

Am I gay? - I love women, I'm not gay.
How did I get so fat? - I weigh 60kg
Will I have to go back to my old job - this one is my biggest fear, as I worked for my dad in a very customer centered job and the social situations I've been in haunt my dreams. 
Why did my girlfriend when I was 17 break up with me - I was TOXIC I would have dumped me.

I guess I'm rambling on now, I just want to know if anyone else has or had this/these problems and if so how did you handle them?

I know this isn't a substitute for professional help, but it's a start.

Tldr; can't stop telling small insignificant lies and fixating on them untill my brain explodes. Please help."

348,How to Tell If You REALLY ARE Being Gaslighted,"Telling whether or not you are being gaslighted can be extremely tricky ESPECIALLY if you are only around that one person at a time. If their is no third-party perspective then it can be easy for someone to get away with manipulation like gaslighting because no one else will be able to confirm with you that they are indeed lying/gaslighting. You can also very seldom call them out on gaslighting because they can then using gaslighting once again to make you feel even crazier for asking. In this video I talk about some ways to try to figure out if someone is actually gaslighting you

349,My mom is mentally unwell and it affects me too.,"Ever since my mom had a baby with my stepfather, she's really been unwell. I think she might have post maternal depression. I'm 20 and live in a separate apartment from here, one we used to live in until she moved in with my stepfather and I decided to stay because I was starting college in the same city anyway. Being a busy person, I didn't notice how bad she was doing until she came to my place with my baby half-brother one day after a fight she had with my stepfather and cried on my shoulder. I was afraid that he was abusing her or something, but it was really just him being critical and her being sensitive to that and boom. They made up the next day, though, and she had some decent days since, but there are days when she doesn't even feel like her. 

I can see that my stepdad is trying to help more and really do better, but the problem is that he often works all day. And so my mom starting coming to my house almost every day (to my grandparents, who live in the apartment below) and I feel like she wants me to be with her, but when I'm actually with her, or when I come for a sleepover, sometimes it's like she doesn't even know what she wants with me. She asks me about something and I start talking and then she interrupts me in the middle of talking just to ask me something stupid and unrelated like ""Have you eaten?"" It doesn't feel like she even listens to me when I'm talking to her. And I want to help her and I hate seeing her like this, but I don't know what to do. I don't want her to think that I don't care, but I also don't want her to pile her problems on me and have me become her parent instead of the opposite because the very idea of it is enough to take a toll on one's mental health and I'm busy enough as it is. I visit her too, but at this point, she leaves me mentally exhausted way too often. 

I feel like she might also think like she owes me something and thinks that she ""left me"" when I stayed in our apartment to live by myself. Also, I think the idiotic fucking older relatives that are too simple to know what personal space is and that someone could want to live alone, guilt-tripped her even though I told her that that's not the way I feel. And because of post-maternal depression, she might also miss our old life, but we can't possibly get back to that. Things are too different now and as a college student, I can't have a baby in my apartment. I love my half-brother and he's adorable, but there are times when I wish he never happened. Just so my mom could be happy just with my stepfather like she used to be. But there's no changing that, of course.

Anyways, I'm sorry if I seem like an asshole, but I had to be honest here. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What do you suggest I do?"
350,Nasty habits,"I'm really struggling with not resorting to cutting myself....  
I have therapy and im on meds now but I just dont know how to cope.  


My therapist hasn't really been helpful pitching ideas either.  
She told me to just wear a rubber band and snap it instead of cutting.  
But its just not the same.  


I don't know how to get over this urge, any recommendations or wise words from people struggling with depression?"
351,Passive therapists are dangerous,"This trend of silent, passive therapist, the whole 'you shouldn't work harder than the client' is dangerous. It's like going to the doctor who refuses to explain what's wrong, says 'trust me' and that's it.

I know this trend is common and frankly, fucking dangerous. If a patient shows a diagnosis, they deserve to be educated about their problem. Too many therapists expect you to 'just talk' as if that's easy. That's how many people drop off from therapy and don't get the help they need.

People reach out to help all the time. Many therapists are just fucking terrible."
352,Don't Let Your Insecurities Ruin Your Life,"I'm currently 22, soon to be 23, and I can say I let my insecurities stop me from doing so much. From going to prom, dating, making friends in highschool, going out places with people, trying new things, enjoying my hobbies, and more. I've been told im attractive, and have had many girls come my way or flirt with me but due to my lack of confidence i failed to realize, or mentally rejected the idea. Besides that I also never felt good enough for people, so i always made myself seem like the odd one out in friend groups or social events, even with family. Know that your looks dont define you, that youre important as anyone else, and not everyone thinks of you the way you think of yourself."

Sorry if this seems ranty, I just felt the need to get that off my chest. It feels good to talk about shit."

356,Intense mood swings &amp; anger issues after typical endorphin boosting activities,"Short long: exercising and any other endorphin boosting activities cause intense negative mood swings that turn in suicidal mindset within hours that then lasts days/week. Cannot find info about this, please help me find info about this in any capacity?

Long short: So, i've (27F) been dealing with mental health issues for 14yrs - learned &amp; diagnosed Autistic &amp; ADHD brain Feb 2019, and learned in December 2019 was in a mentally &amp; emotionally abusive friendship for 4yrs and these things which have of course intensely changed how my mental health is impacted and drastically different from the 9yrs previous (&amp; onset PTSD from abuse). I have diagnosed depression, &amp; anxiety, and PMDD diagnosis in progress - I win at mood imbalance bingo. (I'm medicated &amp; have weekly psych sessions + more. my mental health is my life bc i dont have another option atm)

When i'm ADHD mentally understimulated I exercise - mainly lifting weights , body weight, &amp; active stretches - it really helps me bring my focus back. however I have struggled for YEARS to maintain an exercise routine because exerting my body routinely that way when not understimulated causes me to have a HUGE negative impacting mood swings with intense irritability and anger. This happens every time with high endorphin inducing activities. I have tried tracking it, but the intensity of swings can get towards suicidal which is understandably not safe and not something I feel comfortable prolonging. 

I have a bunch of other health stuff going on and so far havent been able to talk to my GP about it properly because of other more pressing health issues, state of the world and the onset mess. And i'm really struggling because I no longer feel safe even exercising when mentally understimulated, the downward swing has become a spiral into suicidal thoughts too many times already (which i am aware is bc of the world mess etc)

I dont know how to search for this, I keep just finding articles about 'how to boost your endorphin/dopamine output with \*jazz hands\* exercise!!!!"" ""try this fun way to get a better mood!!"" ""MBAD OOD? TRY THIS ENDORPHIN BOOSTING TASK!!' etc. which is not the issue im trying to search and im so overwhelmed I just need some help trying to find information about anything that could maybe help because its really hard to stay any sort of active, &amp; alive with everything."
357,Teach me how to be strong,"So... I’m just gonna start off with can you please help me.

And another type of blunt speaking out my ass of course and being completely clueless like I look stupid in front of person/people. I’m always the door mat. I let people step all over me because I don’t want to feel “bad” so I just do it to make everybody happy even if it makes me feel like shit. I’m being too nice. Can you
help me change that? Or make it a good thing? Or make it change my mindset and or change my behavior? This is something I don’t like talking to anybody not even my boyfriend,and friends.

359,Coming off citalopram after 6 years,"I started taking 20mg of citalopram daily in 2016 after panic attacks and anxiety took its toll.

Being in lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions, but I have to admit, the time away from people has recharged my batteries and got me feeling more in control of my immediate surroundings. I thought now would be a better time than any to try coming off medication - or at least seeing if I could.

I've cut down my dosage to 10mg, it's been a week and I can't think straight. I have 0 motivation, everything feels like too much effort. Today has been spent sitting on the sofa in a blanket weeping and feeling lonely. 

Guess I'm posting here to feel less alone. Need to keep remembering I chose this for a reason, because I feel stronger. The withdrawal is an inevitable side effect of tapering off and it will get better with time. In the meantime, I need to not be so hard on myself, accept that sadness will come and go - so will anger and irrationality - but I am still the same me. 

Behind every cloud there is a blue sky. Hope you're all coping ok wherever you are."

I also see just like dots all the time, which ive aways seen sense i was like five, so it's not that worring, just its diffidently worst now, like they're normaly worst at night, and its morning, but it looks like night if you know what I mean, and like I haven't sleeped all night and that normally exasperates it, but I'm still not sure if it's something I shoud worry about, so like any advice would very much be welcome thank you"
361,I think I’m having a mental break down. PLEASE help.,"I’m 20 years old and have a history of panic &amp; anxiety disorder which has manifested into something awful since October. Basically I am afraid to drive on my own in fear of having a panic attack, afraid to go into certain stores (Walmart’s kill me) bright open spaces.. I can’t do. Im a stay at home mom and my husband (he is much older, 34) works long hours. 8-8 or sometimes a bit later days. I get really lonely in here with a toddler all day. I have panic attacks which sometimes make me end up calling emergency services. 

The thing is, I know what’s causing it. It’s my marriage with my husband. It’s completely toxic, unhealthy, in a multitude of ways. Basically when I first met him, I got pregnant really fast with our son. We were together about 3 months and I broke up with him.. many many times. I was his first girlfriend at 32 years old, he has a virgin. I’m assuming other women didn’t want to go out with him because they thought he was strange and noticed something a young girl my age didn’t. I was just 18. His communication was bad, he seemed careless whenever we would get into an argument, certain things he said just didn’t sit well with me. So I ended things when I was about 3 months pregnant. I was hoping he would get his act together. He assured me he was going to stay single and focus on being a father. He claimed he loved me, wanted to spend his whole life with me. Well about 2 weeks later.. maybe not even 2 weeks, he was with another woman. In a serious relationship. That’s when my life became hell. This woman was no good, at all. I refused to have my child anywhere near her. I was pregnant and he wanted me to meet his girlfriend of a month. He emotionally abused me. Wasn’t there for me at all even just as a father to his unborn child. I ended up going through a very expensive legal battle. I was devastated. The doctors said if this didn’t stop I was at risk of losing my son. He ends up breaking up with her the month our son was born. A lot happened since and it basically caused such a wedge between my mom and I we didn’t talk for a year. I can’t watch certain movies, certain songs, bring back memories. It makes me physically ill to see happy couples together with happy pregnancies. I got pregnant again by him when we were married. We planned having another child. I wanted this time to be different but it ended up making me so sick I had to have an abortion, and thankfully I did. I now realize what a mistake that would’ve been. I’m 20 years old and never had a job, never got to finish college. I’m dependent upon him financially. Yesterday I was just going through our amazon trying to figure out why I didn’t receive an order I placed for my son. I couldn’t find the order even on the page so I clicked on the “archived” orders. I stumbled across a bunch of BDSM stuff he had bought for her one week after we broke up. ONE. 3 days after my birthday. He didn’t even wish me happy birthday. It was like 7 things, chains, whips, etc. 

Yeah I started crying so hard I couldn’t breathe. I began to hyperventilate which left my head tingly so I knew if I didn’t calm down I was going to pass out. My chest then started racing, pulse got up to 115. I called my grandma crying hysterically thinking I was going to die. She called my husband and told him he needed to come home. All evening all I did was sit there and fight off a panic attack. Now it’s the next day, I’m nervous, shaking, nauseous, didn’t sleep &amp; have a massive headache. I’m not sure what to do. I have one half of a Xanax left and that’s it. I’m afraid to take it because what if I *really* need it one day. I love my husband with all of my heart and leaving him will be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But I know I can’t get over the past. It hurts me and I don’t know if I should leave or stay.. either way it’s going to hurt.."
362,Book recommendations?,"I don’t really know where else to post this but I assume here is okay!

I’m a fitness addict and I have no idea how to relax, if I have already done my days exercise, I know I need to chill out and let my body recover but I do not know how to switch off my brain and let myself chill out.

I’ve had issues with anxiety in the past through my teenage years, I was actually on anti depressants for anxiety before I got so into fitness and came off them since being so active basically cured my anxiety, when I’m not training however I really struggle to switch off.

Can anyone recommend any good books that can teach me how to relax my brain/ mind?"

364,i think im losing my mind,"last few days i think i experienced ego death and just dont care about anything i do anymore. i hit someone i live with for the first time and just laughed at them to see what their reaction is

i know you are going to ask me to get help and i tried but i just cant bring myself to. i am coming up with all these plans and i know its sick but i cant help to. i thought maybe you can tell me how to feel normal again like im actually in control"
365,Is this is a sign of something?,"My girlfriend seems to think I have some sort of signs of mental illness.

Today, we were at the beach, and the combined wind, sound of the sea, bikes going past behind me, trying to watch the kids and hold a conversation causes me stress.

My girlfriend says it’s a sign when you’re paying to much attention to all of your senses.

Does anyone have any idea what this could indicate?"
366,I am worried about my brother,"My brother (22) doesn't talk a lot. He usually hides whatever he is feeling even when we try to ask him nicely. He had broken up a few months ago and lost a few friends in the process too (his gf cheated on him with his best friend). Although he pretends he is over it, I feel like he is not as happy as he used to be. At work he does his work, but he has missed 3 morning meetings (which are basically phone calls rn due to covid) because he overslept. He doesn't pick up my parents' calls, doesn't even text them back. Though he will pick up the phone after 4-5 days and talk normally. I (25) have been through depression and I feel like these are the introductory symptoms that I had showcased. Since he doesn't talk and open up easily, I want to give him resources so that he becomes more aware about his mental health and feels ok to talk about it with someone. Is this the right way to approach it? How should I talk to him?"
367,I can not handle loud voices and noises. Advice?,"My family all have pretty loud voices. Even when they speak ""normally"" it sounds like borderline screaming to me at times. Though they also yell a lot in general. When I was younger, my parents fought with pretty intense screaming matches and almost got a divorce. It is better now and this has not bothered me in the past but over the past two years, I've developed this weird thing in which I get super anxious around people who raise their voice or speak loudly in general. Some teachers and coaches are a bit loud and I get some anxiety even when they are not speaking to me. I get the same feeling around loud noises like blenders, vacuums, and loud footsteps. I've spoken about this to my family before. ""Could you speak not as loud?"" or ""Can you lower your voice; it stresses me out?"" but they mostly brush me off and say this is how they speak naturally. I figure they probably can not change as they have spoken like this their whole life. I pretty much always have headphones on. If I hear my parents having a small dispute about something (it is super minor and they are often just joking with each other), I have to go into another room and sometimes cry a bit. I don't know if this is a mental health issue or something else but do you all have advice?"
368,COVID19 - The Blessing And Hidden Gift In Disguise,"First of all I am going to say thank you for taking the time to read this, I know a lot of people have busy lives so I express my gratitude to you. My heart also goes out to those who have lost family members and friends. I also wish upon those who have tested positive for COVID19 a speedy and healthy recovery. 

What you will be reading is what some have already found out, what people are finding out or what you to what to find out. What we have seen over the last couple months has been a great gift to us all. 

Now you might be thinking to yourself “How Is A Crisis/Pandemic like this a gift” well let me first of start saying that every crisis is the best blessing in disguise or hidden gift I, You and We will ever receive. What’s going on all over the world or what has happened is allowing you fundamentally to get into the present moment that is all.  (Many of us who have already undergone Traumatic Life Events will know)

The present moment for many of us has seemed to escape us. For example, we appear to be thinking about the past, about what has happened or thinking about the future and how it will happen. The blessing off that which is COVID19 has given many of us a reality check. 

It has allowed many people to get back into the present moment and to really think about what we actually care about, for example, potential career change’s, spending more time with loved ones (if possible) caring for family &amp; friends more as a whole, spending time with nature and counting your blessings . It has also allowed many of us to explore our Inner Selfs due to the isolations and lockdowns; such as discovering new hobbies, new passions and allowing ourselves to get creative and discover what we never really knew about ourselves. It has also allowed people and taught them to not only care unconditionally about other people (2m rule and showing respect to others) but also care about themselves unconditionally, (Self Care and Self love). Such as, improving your diet, getting more exercise, acknowledging and being aware and improving of your own mental well being, physiological well being and spiritual well being.

I think so many of us (I myself included certainly in the past) have been guilty of going on ""autopilot"" not really paying attention to what is going on around us, and forgetting about what really means to us. I really strongly do Believe deep down that major crisis and traumatic events such as these are an opportunity to get back to the present moment and to ask ourselves ""What Is This Trying To Teach Me"" and to Wake Ourselves Up and Slow Ourselves Down which I think is happening to a lot of people (certainly those I have spoken to)

There's Hidden Gifts and Lesson Opportunities in every crisis. Life crisis, Family crisis or even Global crisis. It may not seem so at the time but eventually when you do and, if you look deep enough and keep looking with your eyes wide open and ask yourself ""What Am I Being Taught""  The lessons will be revealed. 

Every Crisis, Every Challenge, Everything I, You, We face is is an opportunity for Psychological Growth, Mental Growth and Spiritual Growth.

I wish you all Positive Vibes, Good Health and Wishing You to see the Opportunity and Lessons that are Always there."
369,I don't have the right to feel su!cidal,"I'm not going to go through my life story as it's irrelevant to my post, and I'm not looking for criticism so please refrain :)

I have a multitude of mental health conditions (the worst of which is PTSD) due to abuse I was subjected to from my father while growing up. It caused me to feel su!cidal and want to give up on my life. I could elaborate on that but won't

To cut a long story short, I have some family friends (FF) who have young children (YC). My siblings like hanging out with YC and the son of FF's neighbour who would have been about 8. Today my brother visited FF and sent a text message saying that FF's neighbours had died on new years while camping (from suffocation). It was the father, the son and their dog. I don't know what happened to the wife, but gather she's suffering a lot. My brother simply sent a text that said ""\*boy's name\* died and I'm sad"". I asked who the boy was, and he replied ""FF's neighbour"". It hit me like a tonne of bricks. A little boy who had barely had any life's experience and their unsuspecting dog just gone. I'm sensitive and it affected me. It makes me feel sick for wanting to die. My life used to be horrible and maybe being dead would have been the best back then (before my dad became estranged), but to have these feelings when this innocent young child and dog died make me feel like I'm being selfish even though I know that being su!cidal isn't

&amp;#x200B;

What could I do to rationalise the situation; to remind myself that my feelings are valid and not selfish?

ps. I'm trying to work on my mental health. I'm not looking for people to tell me how to be suicidal or anything"

372,My dad told me to “just stop” having ocd,I tried to explain to him that I can’t just do that but he said I make the choice to have ocd. Honestly I feel like he thinks less of me and he didn’t even try to listen to what I had to say and instead kept repeating that I made the choice to have ocd. I’m not even sure what to think of this.
373,At the end of my rope. Please just let it all stop. I’m at the ultimate breaking point. ⚠️TW⚠️,"I have severe anxiety, depression, and OCD. I was just diagnosed with PTSD. I was assaulted by two individuals a few years back. I am just now facing it and I am not doing well. My toxic/abusive ex not only just told my extremely religious, conservative parents that I was assaulted, but he also told them that I was bisexual. 

I feel completely and utterly lost, alone, and violated. I’m at the very edge. I am having a mental break down to the point where I just want “out” of life. I just want it all to stop. 

I have an appointment with my therapist in the morning... but I don’t know if I can make it until then. Every little thing has been going wrong and I’m becoming more and more hopeless. I hold back so many emotions in therapy, I want to just be free to show how I really feel. I am just trapped. Trapped by others opinions, self hatred, fear of judgement. I have built a wall so tall around me I have no way out and no one has any way in. 

I have nobody. I feel worthless. Please make it stop."

375,what motivated you to get help?,"i’ve been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for the past few years. it’s just been getting worse. i had a breakdown a couple of years ago, it was better for a little bit, but the past few months have been the worst. i’ve been having suicidal thoughts lately. i know it’s bad, i know i should get help, but i just can’t get myself to seek help. i feel like my problems aren’t worth help. i don’t know what to do"
376,Are antidepressants and therapy effective?,"I'm at the point where I can't leave my problems untreated. I know I have to do something but I'm scared to seek help because I know I'd put too much faith in therapy and possibly antidepressants. So if they don't work I'll be in utter despair. 


I've tried some kind of ""self help"" shit for months now but I can't deal with the way my motivation keeps fluctuating. It helps only for a while, maybe two days at most, until I lose all hope that life will get better and that's when everything falls apart all over again. 


However, I can't believe that something as simple as therapy could help me with this. Because when I'm in that despairing mindset, nothing can seem to get me out."
377,I'm tasked too much and I feel like harming myself rather than doing those.,"So, a rundown of this: I have art school and since it's too demanding and with my horrible sleep schedule I wake up past it, I got a lot of drawings I have to do. Now, the amount of those drawings is around 5 to 6, and I have to do them in TWO DAYS. TWO FUCKING DAYS. This much work sometimes makes me want to kill myself since all I want on quarantine is rest, but nope! Do this homework and this one and this one or we fuck you up! And then art school, fuck that shit. It barely taught me anything and got my self-esteem to the bottom of the universe. I barely get any responses on this sub but hear me out, all my friends say that ""its doable/possible"" and I don't think so. The drawings will look rushed out and today I slept 10 hours, but I went to sleep at 5 or 6 am and woke up at 16:00. Yes, that late. Sometimes all this school stuff makes me want to kill myself a lot. If I'd tell this to a suicide hotline they would laugh their asses off. Hahaha. Fuck this. I've been struggling too much. I'm spoiled."
378,"Am I schizophrenic, did I have a mental episode?","Hey guys, I’m not sure if I had a mental episode or not but two years ago I was watching a Doctor Who episode about vampires. Then I went to take a nap and when I woke up, I felt off. I felt like I wasn’t fully lucid, like I was controlling my body through a controller or something. I thought vampires where in the house out to get me, I went to my mum telling her that ‘they’ were trying to kill me.

An hour later, I was fine and realised how weird I was acting. I’ve had these episodes before, but haven’t had them in 2 years. I was wondering if I was susceptible to anything? I’ve smoked weed and such, and have not had any mental breaks or anything."
379,I just had a massive change in my life and want to talk. About anything. Let me know if you’re keen,[deleted]
380,(23M) I want to die. I am suffering.,"I am 23M gay. And I just want to die. That's all. I hate being alive because I am stuck and nothing is changing.

My new therapist cancelled our last appointment 10 minutes in saying ""I can't do this - I'm ending this session"" leaving me in tears and about to self-harm as I call the therapy agency to report her for that.

And my therapist before that said because I wasn't getting any better after 4 months, I needed to see someone else (the one who cancelled 10 minutes into our first session).

But that's not all. Everything that is wrong with my life:

1. Disability
2. chronic pain
3. inability to work with only 500 dollars a month from disability 
4. depression
5. anxiety
6. likely OCD and autism
7. emotionally and verbally abusive parents
8. virgin
9. irrational fear of STDs and HIV (ironic because I really want to be a freeuse cumdump urinal slut)
10. extreme paranoia (likely paranoid personality disorder)
11. physically and mentally incapable of driving
12. financially dependent on my parents
13. no PhD programs I can get into
14. no boyfriend
15. nothing to do in life
16. hobbies bore me
17. no in-person friends (and inability to make them because I can't go places on my own)

I just want to die and I hate being alive. This is torture. I am suffering and nothing is helping."
381,Thoughts on,"People who have made you feel alot of different emotions be it happiness, sadness, confusion, anger or any other combination of feelings Is such a connection with someone if it falls apart something salvagable?   Or  is there simply to much back and fourth so that no form of consistent healthy communication will ever be possible?"
382,My sister who caused significant trauma is coming to stay,"In 2016, I moved back in with my mom. I was dealing with major depressive disorder, anxiety, PTSD and self harm. In 2017, after a massive fight with my sister, I almost committed suicide. Luckily,  I made it through that day and saw a psychiatrist. I've been on meds since then and just weaned off them this jan.

My relationship with my sister has always been complicated. She's six years older and is bossy and thinks she's always right. Needless to say after that day in 2017, our relationship was damaged even more. Over time, we had managed to reach a cordial state. 

In Feb, I had just got off my meds and was trying to get my life back on track. I had a huge fight with my mom about the difference between how she treats my sister and me. This is unfortunately one of my triggers. I had a major panic attack. Heart palpitations, difficulty breathing and started having suicidal  thoughts again. My sister called and when my mom told her what was going on, she said she'll come over. I specifically told my mom that I don't want her to come. She makes everything about her. She kept calling and I kept saying I don't want her here. She carne anyways. She barged into my room and started laying down the law. Even threatened to have me committed. I was hysterically telling har to get out. To try to drown her out, I started playing loud music. She went and cut off the wifi. At that moment I ran and locked myself into my bathroom. She kept banging on the door but I stayed in. Still having my panic attack. I only came out once I was sure she had left. I later talked to my mom and sorted things out. This incident caused a lot of trauma to my already damaged psyche. A few days later,  she barged into my room again saying we need to talk but I just wasn't ready. 

My mom says that she only did it out of concern and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it as her intentions were good. I just can't forget what I went through that day. After that, she came over multiple times but I just stayed in my room and avoided her. She hasn't been able to come over in the past 2 months due to the lockdown.

 Mom told me today that my sister is planning to come and stay with us for ten days in June when the restrictions have reduced. This news immediately sent me into a panic attack again. I've been having chest pain all day. I've not eaten and can't sleep. I don't want her here. I can handle it when she comes and visits for a few hours but having her stay is different. My mom says she has to be fair and can't tell her not to come. My doctor had given me SOS medication and she says I should just take that. It helps for short incidents but I  can't survive ten days on that. I'm scared that  I won't make it through those ten days in a toxic environment."
383,How do you stop being so uptight?,"Hi all

Something that has gotten worse for me over the years is being extremely uptight. I don’t want to bore you with an intense long history of my mental health issues, but let’s just say I’ve come a LONG way in my 20 year struggle with depression, anxiety and just the general issues that come with being highly sensitive. 

Despite being able to (kind of) handle the huge dips I often have, one thing that makes my life quite difficult is that because I have had to live my life in a certain way in order to avoid/deal with triggers and problems and such, I am very uptight. 

This means that if someone else is around me who is very stressed, or draining, or is wasting my time, I get very upset. 

It also means that I struggle to commit to plans with friends because I feel too time-precious. I get stressed when other people are drinking and it ruins my experience at parties because I’m too busy either looking after people or judging them. 

I don’t like being interrupted when I am doing anything. No one does, but I find it irrationally infuriating.

All of these things put together (and more) mean I am slowly isolating myself. The thread here is that I am way too time-precious and cannot go with the flow. 

I’m so sorry for the essay here, but I desperately need help on this. Any advice, activities or good books you can recommend are so so appreciated! Thank you."
384,"My past keeps haunting me, I need some advice","Disclaimer: I apologise for advance if there's any formatting problems, I've never posted on Reddit before. I also need to keep this very vague in case anyone who knows me IRL identifies me as that will make everything worse.

For some background, I (24F) dated someone for about four years who put me through extreme emotional abuse, and would also lie about every detail of their life, from major life events and tragedies to things that were completely pointless to lie about (for example, they told me they had been obsessed with animals growing up. Their mother, unaware they had told me this, told me many stories about how scared they were of most animals as a child. There's many other examples). I tried to leave this person continuously but they would always threaten to hurt themselves or show up at my house and wait outside to talk to me. In the end, they did something I found completely unforgivable and any further attempts to ""fix"" our relationship were shut down.

This led to a blissful period of learning and healing for me. I had never been confident growing up, being diagnosed with severe social anxiety as a child, but I became very sure of who I am and what I wanted to do with my life. I started univerisity, something I never thought I would be able to do, I got a decent job and I began dating someone who is genuinely the most down-to-earth, open, loving human being. The honesty and trust that exists between us is something I didn't think real-life relationships  could ever realistically have. I was diagnosed with a personality disorder during this time but I was in a mindset that felt able to handle any obstacles that would come with it.

Although I have him blocked, I knew my ex was still making snide posts about me on social media, but I honestly did not care. I was the happiest I had ever been in my whole life, and everything was looking very positive.

That is, until a little over a year after the break up. My ex and his new friend group began ringing and texting my friends and family members and threatening them, posting dishonest anecdotes about us on their social medias, and all around bitching about us to anyone and everyone who will listen to them (note: many of the people in this group I only know by name and have never interacted with, and everybody I do know is somebody I was once on good terms with, but cut them out of my life for unrelated reasons. I find it very weird that they've all banded together when the only thing they all have in common is their dislike of my friend group - my ex was very critical of these people when we were dating, and vice-versa). I'm kind of in two separate mindsets about this:

1. Its childish. The logical part of my brain is telling me this is stupid, surely people who are not directly involved in this drama will also think they're being stupid, and they're making themselves look like idiots. We are not in high school, we are all adults with our own lives, goals and careers. The problem with this is that while I think its childish, THEY clearly do not, and their dumb little pastime of harassing the people in my life is getting very annoying.

2. The emotional side of my brain, however, does not see things this way. I have gone through some really traumatic events in my life yet none of them have affected me quite the way this whole experience has. Even though it has been months since the last incident, I am becoming incredibly suicidal. I dread running into these people in public. I have become very afraid of social media and deleted all of my accounts out of fear of being harassed further. I have become very paranoid and suspicious of everybody who is not in my closest circle. I'm afraid to leave my house. My academic work is declining in quality. I started developing problems with my physical health in January of this year and have not been able to afford care, so I can't work out, which normally helps keep me sane through hard times. Since quarentine started in my country, I seem to have forgotten any semblance of self-care, and hearing all these things being said about me, however childish, makes me not want to take it up again. I am aware they are being childish and hateful - so why is this affecting me so horribly? Why do I, a woman in my mid-twenties, feel like I'm being bullied?

I feel like a shell of the person I used to be; all of the confidence I had built up since the break-up has been sucked out of me. I actually had my roommates sit me down recently and accuse me of being cold, mean and distant, and they all expressed concern that my friendships with them seemed to be going down the drain. I broke down and reminded them of what had been happening and explained it was affecting me far more than it should be, and they all said they understood completely and forgave me. I promised I'd make more of an effort to get back to my old self, which has led to me simply staying holed up in my room most of the time because I don't know how to be that person anymore. I had so many projects planned for the next couple of years and now I don't even want to attempt any of them - which I know is EXACTLY what they want, but I can't even fathom having the confidence to attempt any of those things any more.

The worst part about all of this is I thought I had become somebody who was genuinely likeable, fun to be around, and rife with self-love and confidence. This was such a huge achievement for me as growing up I was always aloof, distrusting and thoroughly despised everything about myself, something that dating my ex really didn't help with. I don't even want that bubbly, enthusiastic girl back, although it breaks my heart. I just want to be able to wake up and make it through each day without wanting to overdose on my medication or go down to my hometown's river and jump in. I want to be able to think about something - ANYTHING - other than this pathetic situation. The stress it is causing me despite the situation being dormant for a number of months is becoming beyond unbearable.

I feel like dating this person was the biggest mistake I have ever made and that it is a mistake that is going to follow me for the rest of my life. How do I overcome this? Are there any steps I can take to make day-to-day life a little easier? I know this issue is realistically minor and it shouldn't be affecting me as much as it is, but it truly is becoming more and more unbearable by the day.

TL;DR: my ex and his friends have decided to harass me despite it being over a year since the breakup, and I have become very suicidal over it. Any advice on moving on from this is appreciated more than you can imagine."
385,Plz I just need someone to hear me out.,"So it may just be rambling, sorry for this, I need to write this stuff down.
I've always had a peculiar relationship with my mom. My father left us flat when I was 3 or something, and since then it was my grandma, my mum and myself, and since I was 15 - my mum and myself. My mum and I have always been really close. Like, very close. She's never dated anyone, had almost no friends and kept calling me her only friend. She invested A LOT in me so I could pursue my (and kinda her) dreams. Since a very young age I knew everything about her financial and personal struggles. In high school and during my undergrad I was borderline shocked to find out that kids aren't normally that close with their parents. I don't want to demonize my mum here, I love her very much. 
But I constantly feel like a failure. She's arguing with me on everything that I may do differently to what she taught me. She became (or maybe she's always been) extremely controlling. The result was, when I finally left home for real, I didn't want to go back. I felt happier and more motivated. Before I came back (because lockdown, I lost my job and am financially dependent again) I was, frankly, doing great. My masters course is awesome. I was getting published. I was out of relationship with an a*hole (nothing particularly toxic or abusive, but we clearly weren't meant to be lol), and started learning programming. I was also going out with girl friends and well, I was alive.
But I got back. My depression plummeted, to an extent I just didn't have any motivation to go on. I reached out for professional help (for which my mum had to pay, because I'm jobless). My psychiatrist told her some generic stuff about my diagnosis (depression, possibly connected to childhood epilepsy - literally this) and she now tried to ""help me"". Now, I have what she calls ""hysterical episodes"", one of which her fiance accidentally overheard. Now she wants me to TALK TO BOTH OF THEM because 'it will help you, you need to combat this depression'. I fucking do. Every day. I don't want to discuss my mental state with a fucking stranger (I've literally known her fiance for 2 months, he seems like a nice guy). I don't want to be forced to talk to anyone.
I haven't discussed my personal stuff with her since I left, but she didn't even notice. She tried to force me to ""talk"" to her, which is literally me admitting that I'm a terrible person and I need to work on that, and that I keep dragging her even though she does everything for me. She does do a whole lot, and I admit it all the time. But I want to be myself. Hell, I this point I don't know what do I want, I just don't want to be forced do ""discuss"" things with her."
386,Is this a personality disorder?,"I'm told my face is unreadable, and that my disconnect in body language is unnerving when I'm not putting conscious effort into it. I have relatives who are on antipsychotics. Those that aren't, and are highly successful in life, have admitted that socializing is objective for personal gain. I allude through actions but never admit to Autism-Spectrum as a card in my back pocket. I've never had to directly play that card.

A coworker spent some time trying to get under my skin with comments alluding to insults. I played up ignorance, deflected, diffused, etc. They finally resorted to direct insults. I never gave a reaction. They were up to some bullshit that was going to backfire on them eventually. So I happily played a minor background role in a lawsuit that financially destroyed them. It sounds like /r/pettyrevenge material, but my involvement and level of effort was unnecessary and probably inconsequential in the long run. I enjoyed it such that I had thoughts of trying to further screw with their lives even years later.

I worked with an especially insecure person who took it out on their coworkers. I made a point of never giving them a reaction. I made a point of behaving differently around them, baiting them, etc. I made a point of using double entendres involving their insecurities around them, mixed messages with body language, and generally ramping up their social anxiety while gaslighting with plausible deniability. It was surprisingly easy to turn the tables and have them under noticeable stress for my own enjoyment.

I worked with someone who has a gossip addiction with a heavy negative spin. I made a point of telling them worse versions of things than I told other people, knowing their existing reputation. I leveraged connections in office relations to indirectly force senior staff members to question anything they say. Then I started treating them differently, taking more (still indirect) stabs at their insecurities. It makes me feel better in a way I associate with recreational drugs.

I take advantage of family members with in-depth knowledge of their insecurities. Their own therapists have pointed out this emotional manipulation. It is entirely to my personal benefit for easier living.

I've probably spent more time thinking about how to anonymously inflict property damage than I'd like to admit. I feel I'm not stupid enough to try anything that would lead to consequence. I have similar impulses about small animals, to the point of dreaming about it, but think too highly of myself to indulge in that.

I play up victimhood when it's possible to do so, and enjoy that attention, but shirk attention otherwise. I've done so to the point of undermining important things, even at other people's expense.

I enjoy the company of people I think lesser to me, and feel good doing nice things for them.

I'm becoming confident that if I finally saw a therapist, they'd suggest a personality disorder."
387,Advice for overcoming severe emotional/ mental burnout + depression?,"Hi. I’m not myself, typing stuff still feels hard. Sorry if this is long and mobile formatting sucks.

My mental health is very, very poor. It’s been declining for months. 
I’m supposed to be medicated and in therapy, but it’s not a possibility right now for me. So I weaned myself off the meds and stuck to therapy...well until the pandemic.

I have a severe anxiety disorder, depression and mild autism. I’m struggling to break free of this current depression episode if that’s what this is. It’s taking over my life and I’m really overwhelmed...I always get overwhelmed easily and it’s really hard to deal with.


I’ve had a lot of things come up in my life recently that have been stressful and traumatic to deal with:

•My dog had to be put down last week.

•I may be going blind in one eye.

•my grandma is in the hospital from breaking her foot and may die there now alone.

•my family is toxic and i live with them. There is no love from them towards me here, besides my sister.

•I got laid off due to covid and rehired a week later because of covid...so i always feel like I’m on edge and like all my time is limited.

•I’ve just failed most of my classes because of my inability to cope like a normal person, and my parents don’t know yet.

• my bf is probably about to leave me or can’t emotionally support me because of his own issues right now... i keep blowing him off and shutting down and it’s affected our relationship a lot. I feel like i can’t reach out again because i kept blowing him off and now that he’s upset with me...(and that’s still my fault, even if i feel like this).


Most of this happened in the last 45 days. That’s not even 20% of everything but I’m wasting everyone’s time bitching about it.
My anxiety got worse and worse. I’ve even begin feeling the paranoia again, my gastroparesis is coming back because of the stress and anxiety, and not eating or being able to keep it down makes everything worse...but i can’t help it... i started waking up in the middle of the night thinking i was dying but I’ve realized they’re panic attacks. I haven’t had this many in such a short time. I feel like I’m having heart attacks everyday..Everything is so messy and overwhelming and i can’t think straight.

But the last few days, it’s not just crying and the weight depression brings. now i just feel void. Not sad, just totally numb. Empty. The most i feel are tears but even with it i just feel NUMB. 

I’m looking at pictures of my dog and memories and i feel numb. I can’t even cry or get upset. I’ll just randomly realize i started crying and it stops without any emotion. My bf is upset and i need to reach out to try and fix things, but is so completely numbing that i just don’t care about DOING anything. 

I stopped caring about everything. I don’t care if i eat, i don’t care if I’m thirsty. I don’t care if my family even doesn’t like me. I literally don’t about anything. My sister has started taking care of my pets for me because i can’t make myself go feed them. That’s how horrible i am now. I can’t even make myself feel anything enough to feed my CAT. 

This lack of everything is new. I want it to go away. I want to feel. I want to talk to people. I want to keep mourning. I feel like I’m a sociopath and I’m not even really human because i stopped feeling. This apathetic feeling has never been this bad before and i feel like i can’t break out of it.

I googled my symptoms and i think I’m severely emotionally and mentally burned out. It makes sense but i don’t know how to make it go away. It’s already hard enough to deal with my mental symptoms on a daily basis, but now it just a feels impossible. 

I don’t want to kill myself, but i feel like i can lay in my bed right now and stay here until i starve to death and literally not care. I haven’t gotten out of bed for two days now. Haven’t really needed to pee or anything since nothing is going in me but air...


I’m sorry I’m so disgustingly apathic. I feel so derailed that I don’t even know how to reach out or start anymore. I can’t be a good gf, daughter, friend and sister because I’m too wrapped up in my own head to escape myself. If we didn’t have a pandemic I’d consider checking in to a hospital for treatment but can’t now. 

If you could still give me advice on wtf i can even do besides just dying at this point I’d appreciate it."
388,I’m feeling sad :(,"Is it just me but is anyone struggling with mental health Bc of COVID-19? :( if so, what are you doing to get your self out of the dump ? Bc I’m struggling :((("
389,How can I?,"Today is my birthday, I turned 22 years ago. I’m not sure when things started to get bad. I don’t remember anytime in my life when I’ve been happy. I don’t have anyone. I’ve tried so hard to win this battle but maybe I’m just cursed. I have schizoaffective disorder, I’m not on any type of medicine because my insurance got cut off. Everyday feels like a nightmare and my health is taking a turn for the worse. I’m losing all touch I have with reality, I just wish somebody would tell me that it’s okay to feel like this. Instead they constantly make me feel like I’m a burden, like I don’t do deserve to be here. My body dysmorphia has become so bad, I see myself more like a cartoon than even a person. If schizophrenia can’t be cured, why am I even trying? Nobody listens...really, nobody cares what happens to me. People always think I’m exaggerating when I say I’m alone 😞 I’m not sure I have anyone that will even care when I’m gone. I tried to talk to counselors, I tried to talk to the suicidal prevention line. I couldn’t even get the line connected. Maybe I should just give up..I really can’t bring myself to keep self harming, I’ve destroyed every good part of myself. I don’t want to feel like I need drugs, even that doesn’t make me happy. I was never meant to be born because of my health conditions, I feel like I’m just playing god. How can I feel living like this, if I can’t take care of myself."
390,I don’t know what’s wrong or right in me.,"From class 7 to 12 my whole life was based on a joke, all of which I was following memes on Instagram I have a weak personality, in addition to that I used to send girls only, not children, I did not know how to send children, at school I was very childish and joking and I find, I was a joke expert and I was really shy with some girls, but not all girls, with ugly girls I was joking with them and I find beautiful women, I was afraid and I find that I cannot speak to them 

At university my hair was long and many thought I was gay, I was very childish until I shaved my hair and changed myself to gangster but I was childish and everyone was saying this to me. Then I became alone, and in my mind I was very personal and many were afraid of me until I returned to home from abroad and took the medication prescribed by my psychiatrist."
391,Are ‘mild’ hallucinations anything to worry about?,"I have experienced very mild hallucinations since I was young, maybe 14 or so. I’m now 21. These hallucinations range from things like textures that swirl and move and breath, to seeing the corners of rooms crumple into each other, and more severely to floors and furniture looking like it’s made out of glass or that it is ‘sharp’. They’re more like visual disturbances really.

I normally have them when I’m tired or dissociating, but sometimes just randomly. 

I’ve never noticed them when I’m stressed which is what a lot of people talk about in relation to this type of thing, so I’m wondering if anyone knows or has had experience with this type of thing themselves.

I have PTSD (which I believe is quite likely Complex-PTSD), Derealisation and depersonalisation and EDNOS.

Edit: just to clarify, PTSD and DPDR started at around age 16, EDNOS around age 12."
392,How to deal with work depression?,"I graduated last year and got hired fresh out of university. After working for a year under immense stress and long hours, combined with repeated failures, I am starting to develop panic attacks. I have panic attacks during work hours and go to the bathroom to cry my heart out, then come back to the work space as usual. I talked to my manager about quitting already. But I don’t know how can I cope with another job position in the future, since I have not worked any where else before this company. I’d like to know how do knowledge workers manage work stress? I have been wearing a negative glass lately and it’s not working out for me."
393,Can I talk to you about how you cope with stress or anxiety?,"Hi, everyone, I am doing this school project related to mental health, and I want to conduct some short interviews about how people copy with mental suffering such as stress and depression.

I am looking for interview participants who are 35-55 years old and have an overall medium or high stress or anxiety level in everyday life, personally or professionally.

The interview should last no more than 20 minutes.

394,"""But mental illness was never talked about before..."" (Response)","I thought it was about time this post was due:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Back in my day, mental illness/depression/anxiety was never talked about!

I am sorry that mental illness wasn't a popular conversation starter back in your time, but to say that it was ""never talked about"" is quite a big claim. Never talked about by your family and friends? Maybe. Not as talked about as it is today? Sure. Never talked about in the whole United States? Not even close!

I mean obviously, someone must have said something for the government to go on such a big mental asylum-opening spree as it had throughout the 1700s-1800s, starting with the state psychiatric hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded in 1753.

Now, although there's technically a chance you might be correct in saying that mental illnesses were never ""talked"" about during these times (there are no audio recordings from back then to use as counter-evidence), they were certainly written about (and by some high-profile writers too, like Charles Dickens, the author of *Oliver Twist* (1839) and *A Christmas Carol* (1843)*)*

Now, wait a minute...Charles Dickens, a British author, who is from the UK, wrote a book discussing the occurrence of mental illness, specifically in the US (a country he otherwise had no involvement in), and was able to go into great detail about those issues involving mentally ill Americans at the time, despite the fact that not even those actually living in the US were knowledgeable of it enough to talk about it. So if others abroad were able to pay attention to the United States' mental healthcare problem while its own citizens were busy ""never hearing of it"", then whose fault is it for not listening?

But yeah, it's just one of those 'ya blink, and ya miss it'-type things, so here's a li'l historical recap of mental illness-related events in the US for all those moments you blinked:

1773: The Eastern State Hospital opens up in Williamsburg, VA

1792: The New York Psychiatric Hospital opens up in New York City, NY

1817: A 2nd Mental Asylum opens in Philadelphia, PA due to overcrowding

1824: The Eastern Lunatic Asylum opens up in Lexington, KY (Note: ""Lunacy"" is what depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, and all other mental disorders were labeled back in the olden days, among other names like Hysteria, Insanity, Craziness, and Demonic Possession)

1874: Danvers State Hospital (the real-life inspiration for Arkham Asylum) opens up in Danvers, MA

1876: The Worcester State Hospital opens up in Worcester, MA

1890: All 44 states (UT, OK, NM, AZ, AK, and HI aren't states at this time) are mandated to build at least one public mental asylum within their jurisdiction, each having to hold a minimum of 500,000 mentally ill patients

1896: The Overbrook Asylum opens up in Cedar Grove, NJ

1830s-1840s: Over a hundred inmates at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, PA (founded 1829) are revealed to have been wrongly declared ""legally sane to stand trial"" and are promptly transferred to mental asylums (or ""Looney Bins"").

1848: Dorothea Dix takes a stand against the treatment of the mentally ill in the US (particularly the nightmarish abuse they've been enduring in MA) and starts the first ""real"" mental health awareness campaign. Her hard work pays off, and eventually, in 1856, a psychiatric hospital in her name opens up in Raleigh, NC

1887: 23-year-old Nellie Bly gets herself admitted to the Blackwell Island Asylum in New York by pretending to go looney. She wants to document everything she experiences inside for her expose *10 Days in a Madhouse*, which she plans on releasing to the public, exposing the corruption within the US Mental Healthcare System.

There are tons of other events, but yeah, it seems like we've dedicated a whole lot of time constructing buildings and writing books to something that was allegedly so ""unheard"" of. It's such a shame that the mentally ill and disabled have never really gotten their chance in the spotlight throughout history. At some points, you can see where a big revolution of their own is about form, but just as it rises up, it gets overshadowed by another civil rights movement for some other group. In the late 1890s and early 1900s, it was about Irish-Catholic immigrants. In the 1910s, it was about women. In the 1920s-1940s, it was about Chinese immigrants. In the 1950s-1960s, it was about African-Americans. Then in the 1970s-onward, it was about those of different sexual orientations. Each of these movements has an iconic figurehead attached to it that its members can look up to (Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King Jr., Harvey Milk), while mentally ill Americans don't really have much of a selection. I mean, there's Dorothea Dix and Nellie Bly, who both made important impacts on society, but they never really started a big protest or revolution that gained any traction. If I were forced to name a group that I feel has been greatly underrepresented throughout US history, I'd have to say the mentally ill and disabled.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""This was unheard of before, but now, everyone is suddenly mentally ill/depressed/anxious!""

It may seem like that, but you really need to take the bigger picture into account in order to fully understand.

Going by statistics from 2000-2020, 1 in 4 US citizens, on average, have some type of mental disorder (mood, anxiety, psychotic, dissociative, OCD, PTSD, personality, behavioral, emotional, learning, sleeping, eating, phobic, manic, paraphilic, any). That means out of 330,753,490 people in the US, 2,688,373 have a mental illness.

Do these stats mean that the number of mentally ill Americans was 0 before these 2,688,373 people suddenly came along? No. How do we know? Read the answer I wrote to the last statement. See, the trick is that they were always there; it's just that no one cared enough to take count.

If you're looking for data specific to only certain types of disorders (depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, etc.), then, uh, good luck with that. See, as time progresses throughout history, more and more words get added to the dictionary, and, with the study of medicine being more physiology-based than neurologically-based in the past, specific clinical terms weren't assigned to different mental disorders. You just fell somewhere on the craziness scale, and whichever point you landed on determined which synonym of ""craziness"" you'd be diagnosed with (Hysteria, Insanity, Lunacy, Madness). Just because depressive or anxious symptoms weren't labeled as ""Depression"" or ""Anxiety"" back then doesn't make them any less real. After all, how could they be, when those words weren't even invented? Think about it like crime rates. When we hear the word ""crime"", we automatically assume the worst of the worst: murder, rape, theft. But when we look at historical crime rates, it seems like they get lower and lower as we go back through the past. Going by numbers alone, you might wonder how we abruptly went from a peaceful, crime-free society to a society full of criminals.

Well, the answer is, naturally, when you declare more things to be crimes, that means there's going to be more criminals (obviously). You might be quick to assume that older societies were more peaceful and less violent, but that's not how it works. In fact, there were probably tons of more murders and acts of brutality being committed back then than now, because they weren't considered crimes and would go unpunished. To illustrate, let's say there's a society of 100 people. Now, let's say that 5 of them are murderers, 10 are rapists, and 15 are thieves. If the society agrees that all 3 acts (murder, rape, and theft) should be considered crimes and receive punishment, then that means 30% of their population are criminals. Now, if they want the criminal to society ratio to be 0%, then they can simply declare murder, rape, and theft to be legal. True, no ""criminals"" exist by definition (after all, can't be a criminal if there are no crimes to commit), but does that mean the activities we consider to be ""criminal"" in modern-day didn't exist back then? Nope.

The same concept applies to mental illness. Just because we didn't have doctors to diagnose them doesn't mean that they just simply didn't exist. Just to be helpful, here's a chronological list of when mental disorders became recognized:

500-300 BC: A mood disorder appearing among Ancient Greeks is given the name Melancholia (Greek for ""Black Bile""). Later, in South America, the same symptoms are called Lugubrious (Latin for ""Mourning"")

400 BC: Ancient Greek physician, Hippocrates, assigns the name ""Mania"" to a disorder causing extremely high moods and energy levels

1401-1500: The term ""scrupulosity"" is coined to refer to those who suffer from superstitious beliefs and repetitive behaviors during the European renaissance

1850s: The Greek term ""Melancholia"" and the Latin term ""Lugubrious"" are translated into the English language as ""Depression""

1683: Scrupulosity has its name changed to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in England

1883: Emil Kräpelin publishes the first manual of psychological disorders in Germany

1902: Dr. George Still, an English physician, is the first to use the acronym ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) as a diagnosis. He describes the condition as an ""abnormal defect of moral control in children""

1908: The term ""Schizophrenia"" is coined in Switzerland

1906: Dr. Alois Alzheimer studies the mysterious case of an elderly patient experiencing bouts of confusion and memory loss in Germany

1910: Alois Alzheimer finally gives names to the mysterious illnesses affecting his elderly patients: Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease

1918: Many young men who were drafted into WWI against their will come back displaying symptoms of ""Shell Shock""

1926: The term Anxiété is coined in France, which then makes its way over to English-speaking countries as Anxiety

1942: The term ""Autism"" is coined at the John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Even though the existence of intellectual disabilities predates long before the 20th century, this is the first recognition of them in the US

1944: Another variation of Autism is discovered by Hans Asperger in Austria, which he names Asperger's Syndrome, after himself

1960s: More physicians in the US start noticing the presence of ADHD-like symptoms in not only children but also adults. This provokes further research, which leads to the diagnosing of ADD as a separate disorder

1963-1966: Sharpshooter and marine, Charles Whitman, starts experiencing severe headaches and symptoms of Shell Shock, but he's told to ""tough it out"" like a marine. Being left untreated, his symptoms progressively get worse until things come to a head in 1966, when homicidal delusions come up. He turns to Dexedrine to numb his senses, but that, unfortunately, proves to be ineffective. In a paranoid and panic-stricken state, Whitman brutally murders his mother and ex-wife, both of whom he believes were conspiring against him. After, he gets his sniper rifle and some hunting equipment together, and he makes his way to the University of Austin, TX. There, He climbs up the tower and starts firing down on people indiscriminately. After claiming 17 lives, he takes his own. An autopsy reveals that Whitman's brain had a small tumor in its hypothalamic region, which explains the severe headaches he had been experiencing. However, what isn't explained is the paranoid delusions and impulses he had been exhibiting. Those were certainly not attributable to a small brain tumor. Around this time, Shell Shock is renamed PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) for updated psychological manuals"
395,There is a lot of things going on right now and I keep feeling worse,"My phone was stolen, my friends are being dicks, I freaked out on my friend, and my parents are pissed at me. I’m overwhelmed and I seriously can’t function. I’ve fallen back into bad habits and I feel genuinely horrible. I really don’t know what to fucking do. It feels like so much shit is going on right now and I need help."
396,I miss having friends and it makes me feel really lonely and very sad knowing I probably won't ever make a new one,"I had to cut ties with my last friend because he was very racist towards me one day. He had always been casually racist but nothing more than a few stereotypes here and there. He even yelled and harassed me after I told him that we weren't friends anymore. I tried to be nice too, telling him a few ways to help cope with his problems instead of spamming my dms trying to make me feel bad and talk to him again. I didn't want to end our friendship because I knew I'd have no one left except my mom. But even my mom knows having friends is different. I chat with my brother every day too but it's not the same. 

I'm just tired of waking up every morning knowing that I won't have anyone to talk to or no one is waiting for me to talk to them. It's an awful feeling. My sister eavesdrops and she always tells me things like ""I'm your best friend"" and ""we can do stuff together like friends."" I won't ever do anything with her because she is manipulative whether she admits it or not. Friends don't manipulate each other. I have a bad history of having ""friends"" that used me and threw me away like trash. I'm always the replaceable one in every group I've been in. 

I feel like a failure of a person because I can't even function properly when there's people around. I get extremely anxious out in public and I can't even order my own meal at a restaurant, my mom has to for me. I can't talk to people face to face. I just don't want my mom to worry about me never finding another friend or even a significant other. I just want to make my mom proud that I can actually make and keep a friend. 

Does anyone know where I can possibly try to make new friends? I've already tried the subreddit MakeNewFriendsHere but that didn't work out at all."
397,Should I cut off my only 2 friends even if they are toxic to me ?,"So recently I kinda confronted my friends about their problem with alcohol in hoping they would get better but they got defensive and now one of them , I think , considers me as a enemy. Since then I have not been included to any activity with them making me feel worthless. I always struggled with massive anxiety and depression , but knowing that I had someone I could talk to made me feel a little better. But I have never felt the needing to hurt myself and considered suicide so badly. In my heart I even think posting here is not a good idea."
398,Motivate me to get a psychologist appointment!,"Before, I was very adamant about going to a psychologist to get my problems checked. Then I did go to one. Just that one session was so overwhelming, I was in a constant fight or flight mode for more than two days afterwards. I'm not even exaggerating. I was supposed to book another appointment the next week and then keep going consistently for about a month and a half. I didn't expect I'd have to go so much. Since it was my first ever visit, my parents were like I should also try another psychologist and see who I like better and who I'm more comfortable with, so going to the first psychologist got delayed. Also they were slightly expensive for me, so I was kind of unsure if I should continue. And then the whole Corona thing started. But now it's getting harder for me to wait. But because I was so overwhelmed with the first appointment I'm too scared to book an online appointment even with someone else. But I think I really need it. Just the thought of having to open up and talk about 'feelings' just like last time is really scary. There is this fear of getting exposed. I want someone to say something to me which will make me actually go for it.


I'll probably delete this afterwards because its kind of embarrassing :p"
399,Certain words just screw me up horribly,[deleted]
400,I am a super obsessive person,It ruins my life.
401,I think my job is causing significant mental distress and I'm not sure what to do,"I currently work at Target and in the midst of this whole epidemic I think my workplace is causing some serious mental distress. 

Despite the fact that I'm still attending university classes online, they keep ramping my hours up to full time and when I tell them I can't work that much because of school they are dismissive of it because ""Its only online class, you'll make time"". 

On top of that, the customers at my workplace have been just downright nasty and and ungrateful to me and all of my coworkers. When I don't force a fake smile on my face I have customers that say stuff like ""it wouldn't hurt you to show some enthusiasm"". Well yeah, when I'm treated like absolute garbage by my employer and customers, it is hard to show some enthusiasm. Its unhealthy to pretend to be happy all the time

Other things that are annoying me is that while almost all the other Targets in my state have closed non-essential parts of the store (clothes, electronics ect..) our store is still running full function. And our store is making almost no effort to limit the capacity so every single day feels like black friday. This is putting my health and my coworkers health on the lines so ungrateful people can spend their stimulus checks on Airpods and other non essential stuff.

Lastly, my work environment is dramatically effecting my overall state of happiness and I am bringing this mood home with me to my girlfriend. It is causing tension and causing us to argue which we otherwise rarely do.

So safe to say, my job is causing significant distress in my life and I think it's time to leave. The only thing is nobody else is open and I still have rent and Bill's to pay so I don't know what to do with myself. It's only a matter of time before I mouth off to a customer or employee and get fired or just quit. Just wanted to get this off my chest"
402,what can i do please help me out,i have no energy i wake up everyday tired and exhausted i physical couldn't kill myself but i honestly do not like living i have some mental health problems and i haven't got all the help i need but my family say they understand and i know i can say some horrible thing but they know i do not mean what i say i cry and try and make it right all the time but they never apologise for the things they say to me and i can honestly say i do not like them but i cant move out i don't have the money i don't have a job i hardly leave the house i have so much anger in me i have 0 friends and i do not know what to do so much more to this story but well i dont know
403,Connection to a Nervous Breakdown,"Can anyone answer this question?


When my aunt was 5 she was run over by a car and fractured her skull. For a while half her face drooped down. It still does but it’s not noticeable (barely) Anyways she was fine for the most part and pretty normal. However personality wise she’s very sensitive, takes stuff to heart, and stresses easily. When she was in her 20s, she had a bf that ended up cheating on her with her cousin and her cousin didn’t care much. It hit her hard but she kept going thru life. A little while after the breakup her job was giving her POUNDS of work and they took advantage of her kindness and would give her more and more work. Her sister (my great grandmother) has a pretty big pair on her, and told the company if they give her more work she’ll make them pay. They stopped for a bit but let their work pile and then gave it back to my aunt. My aunt wasn’t sleeping, eating and just worrying until she finally had a nervous breakdown. She was forced to leave and now she’s not the most intelligent in the bunch. She talks about things that have nothing to do with what me and my family talk about, she doesn’t “focus” in a way when all of us are crowded and talking, she laughs sometimes and talks to us about the most random things and is very polite, but she never smiles, in a way she doesn’t have a personality. She quickly changes her mind all the time. She never says she has to go to the restroom, she has a lot of accidents tbh. No one else her age in my family is like that. I just have a question to see if there’s any connection to her breakdown &amp; the way she is now. She’s currently 83."
404,Sudden fits of rage,[deleted]
405,I think my Bf is depressed and in denial,"Kinda venting, kinda asking for help.

I got a checklist/questionnaire from my psychiatrist. It had multiple sections such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, ADD, etc.

Lately, my bf has been describing symptoms of depression but denying he's depressed. I asked him the questions on the questionnaire in a way he wouldn't become suspicious. From the conversations we've had, he checks off almost every box for depression and a few for anxiety. If I ask him to fill out the questionnaire himself, he'll say something along the lines of ""there's nothing wrong with me""

His behavior and overall attitude has changed. He has no motivation for anything, he stays in bed all day, he keeps his room dark, he's barely eating, he feels hopeless, can't sleep at night and struggles to stay awake during the day, etc. I don't know what to do for him.

I think quarantine is getting to him. I'm definitely not going to suggest he goes on medication because that would have to be his decision but, I was thinking he could use a counselor or therapist. I'm really worried and it's strange to see him gradually get worse over time.

At the end of the day, there's not much I can do until he comes to terms with it and wants to feel better."
406,How is everyone today?,Seriously how are you?  Do you need anything?
407,Luvox Fatigue,"Luvox fatigue

Hello!

I have OCD and was prescribed Luvox (100mg) and 50mg Lamictal. I’ve been taking this for 2 months now. At first i had insomnia for about a week but now I can sleep up to 14 hours and still wake up extremely exhausted. Started having vivid dreams. Definitely notice some help in ruminations but I’m CONSTANTLY exhausted and my motivation has gotten a million times worse. 

Does anyone have similar experiences or advice? I drank coffee for a while before reading that you shouldn’t because Luvox increases the half life. 

Additionally, I’m sure all my hormones (cortisol, testosterone etc) were completely messed up from the stress from my last OCD episode. I was already very fatigued and had a hard time regulating my sleep pattern, but was still dealing with recurring thoughts and compulsions (dpdr, checking on my mental state) that have gotten better. Just always so so so tired."
408,Am I wrong? Am I broken? Am I insane?," I am tired of being excluded, I have been for years and I wish I could simply join in conversations or stuff like that, but I simply can't and feel pushed aside or just ignored. It hurts even more where the place you're excluded from is a place where everyone is supposed to be a misfit. I own a discord server for roleplaying but even then I don't feel like I fit in even there. I have sat down in front of my laptop ready to delete the place as a sadistic side of mine would like to take away everyone's enjoyment since I can't have any of that. Thanks to my anxiety I have imagined many scenarios if I do this, but I know it is selfish and wrong. Am I going insane? I am not taken into account and as so I feel like taking away from others what I don't have would be ""fun"". I know I will become infamous and ruin already fragile and one way friendships but clouded I feel like it is the right to do for me to feel good, at the expense of others."
409,"Wife is extremely upset, directing all of her anger/frustration at me. I know I’m not perfect but it seems like she is becoming unhinged, nothing I say seems to help the situation. When is it time to seek professional help for her outside her wishes?","She acts like I’m a horrible abuser because I stacked dishes up haphazardly last night. She started reorganizing them, violently.  She says she wants a divorce and is going to a homeless shelter, which is absurd.  I’d live in a gutter before I let her go to to a place like that.  I’m messy and disorganized, always have been and I’m trying to do better at that.  Talked to a therapist and got medicated, I feel it’s helpful but she has done nothing but give me a hard time about it ever since. She tells me I need to go to the therapist and I do, when I get back she accuses me of talking shit about her, I mean of course we’re married she’s going to be part of the conversation.  I sense a lot of paranoia and delusions but I don’t know what to do about it.  She demands my behavior change, and complains about how I haven’t changed in 10 years but then says I’ve changed and I’m not who I used to be 

Sorry, I just realized my rant.  I don’t want to complain about her.  I just want things to calm down and I think she is far more upset than I can understand given the circumstances. 


I’m not the perfect husband by any means, I don’t listen as well as I should all the time, and I am messy at times but it’s getting better.  

I’ll add that she has fibromyalgia and endless discomfort, cut her meds back (baclofen, buspirone) without telling me until she hadn’t slept in 3 days.  She isn’t eating and has given up it seems, saying she wishes she didn’t exist.  I’m pretty sure she is ready to leave me forever.  Am I out of bounds to seek emergency mental health evaluation?  No specific mention of suicide, but I’m worried about that considering her mental state.  I don’t want to make things worse, or make her think I’m doing it to be retaliatory.  I need some advice and help please!"
410,inability to cry,"hello. So yesterday i was lying in bed feeling empty so as usual i would try to cry myself to sleep but no matter what i did try or listened to i could not bring myself to even shed a tear.I did not think much of it sleeping only around 3 [hours.Today](https://hours.Today) i was super anxious and stressed because of how little i have slept (i usually sleep around 10hrs) and because of lockdown im at home with my parents. Anyways i tried to crymyself to feeleng better but just like yesterday i was unable to cry no matter what i did.

 i would just not think about it but crying is a big part of making me less anxious depressed etc. so if anyone has any suggestion please help"
411,I just don't know what to do anymore.,"Fair warning this post is probably going to rambley and long.

I'm a 34 year old woman and I just don't know what is happening in my life anymore. I'm a chef and for the majority of my adult life (since I turned 20) I've worked seasonal jobs. Every six months just pack your stuff and move. And you might think hey! That sounds like so much fun! And honestly it was at first. But after a while it drags on you. Your personal life, your finances. It's hard to find friends/SO's and save money when you have to move every six months. And I have tried so hard over the last six years to be able to stop moving, but every time I thought I'd found something it has fallen through or other circumstances caused me to just say f-it and pack my shit and leave. But now I have actually been in one place since October 2018. It doesn't pay much, I work in a small town grocery store deli, but because I'm in such a small rural town I can actually afford a beautiful 2 bedroom apartment that gets so much sun and I actually have space for a craft/game room. This is the first time I haven't lived in some type of employee dormitory since 2009. Now, I love my job. I honestly do. But since December I've felt trapped here in what I jokingly call my Tower. I haven't wanted to do anything but lay in bed and read or watch tv. I don't really have friends here because I don't want to hang out with party crowd, I'm not religious at all, and I'm not married with kids. There isn't anyone local who is remotely my age who has the same interests as me. The nearest 'city' with a Walmart is over 2 hours away. Its gotten so bad that my place looks like one of those disgusting hoarder houses with dirty dishes, trash, and laundry everywhere.  Its gotten to the point where every time I look around to try to get some energy to clean up I just sit in a corner and cry. I've also gotten to the point where I am the heaviest I have ever been. (250) I just don't know what to do anymore. Every time I've started to feel like this in the past it was time to pack my stuff and move on. And the chaos and excitement from going to a new place or returning to a familiar place always managed to knock me out of my funk. And its starting to affect my work. I honestly think the only reason I haven't been fired yet is because there is absolutely no one else in 200 miles who can take over my job. Things came to a head on Tuesday though. I rolled out of bed with just barely enough time to get out of work after being awake and staring at my clock for 2 hours. But I couldn't find my keys anywhere. I can walk to work but I couldn't find my apartment keys or the keys to the store because I'm the first one there in the morning. My boss could have let me into the store no problem, they are amazing people who treat their employees so well, but I just broke down at the top of my stairs bawling. And I called in sick to work. I feel like such a disgusting failure of a person. I haven't been back to work since and I still haven't cleaned or found my keys. I've just been laying here going back and forth between numb and bawling and I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like a failure. What happened to the girl who wanted to start a travel blog before youtube was even a thing? What happened to the girl who was so excited to get a passport but has never had a single stamp? What happened to the girl who was so excited to meet new people and see new things? Who took joy in making amazing food that people loved. Who loved to go hiking and camping and fishing? What happened to the girl who loved to sew, and crochet, and paint and draw? What happened to the girl who loved to play games with her friends and go out dancing? What happened?"
412,I always try new things... And that's a wierd problem ?,"I think that I have been afraid all my life, once i get into a field and get reasonably good at it, i get stuck and change/field or hobby. Why ? Because 1. I don't really come up with what to do after learning a hobby to a certain extent, I am not very creative i think. 2. I fear trying new thing/advanced things, might be again because of creativity - But as the same time find it easier to change to a new thing about which i have a little idea about and if there is someone helping me, Like a colleague is willing to teach/share something with me or the internet is there to help to read.

I involve less in creative projects - I do try them out but end up as a bit slow in them.

Am i running away from my responsibilities ? Am i afraid ? Am i looking for a scapegoat ? Is this called something ? 

If anyone knows about this please let me know. Thank in advance !"
413,My mother and I are both struggling emotionally,"I am 19, living with my mother trying to get my first job after flunking a semester of college due to coronavirus. I have severe anxiety and depression, and I have recently stopped taking antidepressants to help alleviate an unhealthy level of fear of dying. If I am not at least a little suicidal, my fear of death makes it so that I never take any risks at all, and even things like swimming in a pool or riding in a car become terrifying due to the possibility of drowning or crashing. Depression is relatively comfortable compared to a fully activated fight or flight response 24/7. My mother has always been emotionally fragile and was absent through most of my childhood while I was under the iron rule of an abusive and neglectful stepmother that hid her actions from my dad who was gone due to work and a long commute. My mother and I are extremely close, even willing to talk about topics normally taboo for a mother and son like sex. I do not feel codependent with her but we both try to be supportive and I try to keep the house as organized and clean as I can while I look for a job. I should probably mention that I have asperger's syndrome and am looking with the help of job placement specialists for people with disabilities at goodwill.  My negativity grates on her and the feeling is mutual. It is difficult to be around her when she cries and i'm sure its hard for her to watch me gasping, shaking and nauseous with a panic attack. There is literally nothing I do not feel comfortable sharing with her and she is also very open with me but sometimes I swear she is bottling up her feelings and really needs to talk to someone, something that pretty much cost her two of her marriages. A lot of times she will come home visually disturbed and will start cleaning anything that I have not already and I try to help as that is sort of a trigger from my days with my stepmother but she will push me away, saying that it's fine and that she would take care of it. When she is upset it is often impossible to get her to talk about what is upsetting her or if there is anything specific at all as I know that there are times when both of us are in a state of anguish or despair for no reason at all but the fact that she is very reluctant to say ""there's nothing in particular upsetting me"" or an equivalent makes me think something specific happened but she is unable to tell anyone, only saying things like ""i'll handle it"" or something of that nature. I am not a therapist though we are usually both seeing one but neither am I a child so I'm not exactly sure if just letting her stew is the best plan of action or what because I can't make her talk if she doesn't want to. Soon she will be quitting her job as an office worker at goodwill and she will take something part time while the two of us move in with my mom's sister who is a diabetic transplant patient. I will be paying for most of the utilities and bills while mom and her sister will be paying the mortgage, food and any bills my paycheck won't cover. I know that under less stress she will be more stable but I can't shake the fear that one day she will start exploding again like she did when my sister (who lives with my father) were little. Funny, the system gives the meek no quarter so until I gain the life skills needed to take on college once more and hopefully move on to greener pastures three disabled people will be living under one single-wide trailer roof attempting to make up the capabilities of just one fully functional adult.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: my mom and I are both fragile and sometimes I think she is hiding her emotions from me."
414,What should I expect on my first psychiatrist appt?,"A few days ago my mom scheduled me an appointment for what she said was a “mental health doctor.” Before you ask, I’m 18 but I’ve wanted something like this for a while, my mom just had to enter my room and let the person she was calling know that I consented to the whole thing. I’m not really an independent person.

But yeah, I guess in two weeks I’m seeing a psychiatrist, and I’m kinda nervous. I don’t know what to expect. I even wonder if this is what I need, I’m worried that he’s just gonna sit me down ask if I’m sick, throw happy pills at me and kick me out of the room. Cause I know therapists and psychiatrists are different.

It’s probably not anything to worry about but I’m nervous, I’ve never done anything like this before. I’ve just kinda waited for my mom to stop putting these things off and as a result my problems have manifested into some dark shit. Sometimes I worry I’ll say too much and the psych will send me to a mental ward or something. I don’t know, I just need some reassuring."
415,hard to explane,"First of all I am perfectly fine, well ecpat for the weirdness that i am gonna explane. And bevore i start I want to say that i am so thankfull for that. And every body that has insecuetys or depression: Stay strong YOU ARE THE MASTER OF YOUR MIND REMEMBER THAT.

So here it go s. I don t know what to say, because it is difficult to discribe...  I siply explane my situation to you all:  recently I watched Beastmaster on Netflix, and i can t get it out of my mind. It is like realy weied. Sometimes it is ok and i don t think about it. But other times i wish that our world is like the one in Beastmasters.  So that reminded me of the time when I watched Furry videos on youtube. it started because i wanted to lern about the fandom. Why is it such a meme or a hatet fandom? But than i keept watching and sympathising, not that that is wrong but it feels so weierd now. Than i stoped watchin after a while, because of the shit that happened with Kero. And When i dared to rewatch the videos it is not like it used to be.  Now i hate my self for watching the Videos and Beastmasters. Especely with the feelings regarding those. Tho Beastmasters is fucking awesome.  So it came that i don t want to speak about it, especaly when there is a chance that any of my Friends ,  family  or work  colleagues finds out. My problem is that i was a social outcast until the  10th grade staring 1st grade. So,  because probaly being a furry and definetly sympathising with Furrys, is not socially acceptable I hat the strongest thougt of suicide when someone fins out about my secrets. And no my psycic sefe thougt of liting mysef on fire as an option. I got over it by guidet meditation videos, i hope so. But still that isn t normal and i don t dare telling anyone even a  psychologist.  Because i dont how how i will act.
So what are you thougs? just be honest. And Please don t tell me that suicide is not an option and so. Like i suggestet in the intro I am the master of my mind, i think, and now when i am gettign depresed i ""just""  say to me this is like the worst idea today, be happy you asswipe. But the key - question is: What to do when i am a furry? How to act? Bc as mentioned I  absolutely don t want to keep it as secret as possible.


Thanks for reading. Down below are some explaning side notes

417,Anyone else stressed about not having a family?,"Wondering if anyone else is just constantly stressed out and always worried about not having a significant other and having kids. Everyone around me is either married and/or has children, that's all my coworker's, cousins, friends and just seems like most people in general. Getting married and having children just seems to be one of those things every society/culture expects of you and to be almost 30 years old and be no closer than I was at 18 is very distressing. To know your entire family legacy just ends with you if you don't have any kids makes you feel like quite the failure."
418,Is it my fault?,"I’ve had this friend that I’ve grown up with that I trust with my life. she knows the struggles that I’ve gone though and I know hers, but she does this thing where she won’t talk to me unless she needs something or has something to tell me. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even feel valuable as her “best friend” and I don’t know if it’s me making things worst or I have a reason to be upset with her. 

Whenever I go thought this with myself, I sound selfish but I genuinely feel like she just doesn’t care. I honestly don’t know if it’s just me though 🤷🏽‍♀️ There are a bunch of things that she does that really hurt me that she just doesn’t seem to care about and whenever I try and bring them up she just ends up getting angry at me. I’m at the breaking point now and I don’t know where to go from here at this point 🙁"
419,i don't know who i am.,"I can't stop thinking and i don't know how to express myself.I take bunch of tests,quizzes and such just to find who i am and what i believe in but they almost never help. Spirals of thoughts and me not really knowing what i want are constantly stopping me from what people call life.What even is life,i question everything including sanity and what being normal and leading a fulfilled life is. And when anyone asks me this exact questions i reply with ""Whatever you want it to be"",which almost all people take as a good answer. But the thing is I'm at a period of life (16) where i should start forming my personality,but mine is completely blank. 
I don't know what my favourite song,movie or hobby is,nor what i want to become in the future. There is literally nothing i find pleasure in. 
Also getting close to other people bothers me,especially extroverts,even though I'm considered by most people i call acquaintances ""good person"",some even go to the extremes to call me kindest person they have met. 

And the thing is I'm nothing,I'm completely neutral in everything and i see no point in me existing. I have no idea what to do now nor in the future,nor do i want to do anything because i know it will eventually end with death and after that nothing really matters,and nothing i have done will really matter."
420,mental health services neglect,"so i am in a living situation with a mental health provider that has me on assisted living and i cant leave because i have a legal guardian and she overrides my decision to leave them so i can go and get the help i need elsewhere. the current organization that i am involved with is the nord center and they are neglecting me and i am not getting the help i need. they lie and twist my words around to benefit them and there company, i am sick of dealing with them and there abuse. i am sick of the legal guardian who also abuses and neglects me who keeps me stuck where i am and with the nord center. the staff where i work are never available when i need them. one person does uber while she works night shift. all they do is call mental health evaluation services everytime there is an issue. they threatened to call the police if there were any conflict between me and them just because i was upset with them and how they treated me. and they even wanted to call the evaluation service on me just because i wanted to file a grievance. now mind you this evaluation center is called ESS and all they do is decide whether or not you need to go to the hospital and whether or not you need to be pink slipped there against your will. i would appreciate any help"
421,What is happening with me?,"I have a constant mild panic and I feel like the world is disintegrating around me. My memories do not seem real, they seem like I imagined them. I feel blind and deaf without being blind and deaf, like my mind in in a dark room."

423,"""Imaginary friends"" and Depression?","Warning mentions of self harm and suicidal thoughts! 







So I suspect that I might have depression. Honestly I suspected it since I was young. Recently I made up two imaginary friends by the names Charlie and Cameron. (Idk why they're the opposite gender then me but oh well.. I mean I am Non-Binary but as in my original gender.)

I need to mention that I was most likely parentified and never had my brother or my mom there for me emotionally. My dad was the only one who actually was with me both physically and emotionally but still couldn't be with me all the time since he works most of the day to keep our family going.

Charlie has a very overprotective and motherly  personality while Cameron has this tough and brother like personality.

I have seen Cameron getting hostile towards those he doesn't like (Or that make me feel I'm a negative way) but calms down after Charlie argues with him.

I guess I made them to help me with my depression since I have tried to self harmed before. They're more like voices in my head then visible characters but I know how they look. Kind of. When ever I think badly of myself or have suicidal thoughts or get mad I'll either be calmed down my Charlie or motivated by Cameron. 

I'm not sure if it's normal for me to do this but here's the shortest I could make it. Hope somebody knows if this is healthy or if I should be worried. Oof.."
424,Run away,"I was diagnosed with suicidal depression and anxiety 5 years ago and things have been going ok but.
Lately, I’ve been thinking about getting in my car after work and driving away, just leaving my old life behind and not telling anyone and just going. I don’t know where I’ll go but just as far as a full tank can take me I suppose. I don’t get why I feel this way I mean, I have everything I could dream for an amazing fiancée, a great job, and a great network of people that are always here to help but I never turn to because I don’t want to burden them with what’s going on me. I don’t wanna be here anymore, I just wanna disappear"

426,I'm wasting my life away - please help," 

So, I (M21) have been in a bit of a bad place for a while and could really do with some help.

Until a few years ago I would've considered myself as pretty sharp and intelligent. Over the last few years I've noticed my procrastination levels raise through the roof. I'm in my final year at university and everything has caught up with me. I know I can do this level of work, it isn't that the content is incredibly hard. But honestly, I just dont even know.

I've either handed every assignment in late, not at all, or have left it til the last day to start actually writing. I put a lot of effort into the research but I just have a block when it comes to actually writing it. But essays were LITERALLY my strongest point. I've kinda done that again today. It's fucking breaking me honestly, I don't know what is wrong with me. Quite often I struggle to remember words and information that I definitely know and it frustrates me so much. I feel a lot less happy than I did a while ago. I was in the gym for a solid two years, made some amazing improvements and then lost interest.

I really don't think that I'm just lazy. I spend hours TRYING to improve myself but I feel like I'm literally losing my mind.

It's reached the point where I look at other people doing normal, productive things and I think, ""How are they actually doing it?"" I can literally take days replying to people's messages. I sit in my room with my laptop open from 9am - 6pm trying to do my work but I've just wasted an entire day and in the process I'm ignoring everyone.

I also lose and damage so much stuff and it's the most frustrating thing. I can't put a finger on it. It's like a part of what makes me who I am is just gone. And it has been for a while.

I'm losing my mind. I want to be productive as that's when I'm happiest. But I can get lost in my own thoughts and daydream all day. I don't want this to set the tone for my adult life. I want to be better than that.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

(stay safe!!!)"

428,Is it normal to feel emotional and even cry whenever I say certain words?,"The word ""trapped"" makes me cry. I sometimes try to rationalize my fears by writing them down. Every single time I've spelled the word ""trapped"", I broke down into tears."
429,I’m so tired of fighting,"It it so exhausting living with a brain that is trying to self destruct. I think of death and despair everyday, and I see vivid images of self harm/suicide too. I heard someone say once that fighting mental illness is like shovelling snow in a snowstorm and I think that’s very accurate. The result is inevitable, and I could save myself the trouble if I just give in and accept the snow. I’m losing the will to keep shovelling and it scares me. I feel like I’m out of options, and I don’t know what to do. I wish some days that I could be in a terrible accident so it didn’t seem like I took the selfish way out. I feel so trapped."
430,Quitting my job,"I work full time at a cell center doing customer care. I'm.good at my job but it also causes my anxiety to go haywire and doesn't help depression. I fall into a high risk population for Covid-19. I've been thinking of resigning and going on unemployment and taking time to work on myself and get things together to go to school. Or even just working on myself and coming back toy job maybe because I do like my job for the most part. Its just the strain it puts on me is overwhelming. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also, due to Vivid part time is not an option and also financially it doesn't really work out. Thanks guys."
431,How many times should one be tested for COVID to participate in a mental health program?,"Seriously. I understand the worry of the virus, but one of our programs has to please OSHA in order to be considered reopened. No joke. One of the things they plan on doing is making the public transportation screen members, then reporting to the program the results. Apparently a bus driver with no medical experience (assuming sadly) becomes a tester? Then get screened when coming in, maybe through out the day, and get a testing site to come in and test people twice. As in, shove the swab in the nose twice a day. Members who refuse will be dismissed until further notice. Really? How many times a day do people get tested at work for it? One, yet we have to give up our rights because someone is paranoid? 

Had the government shut the dang transportation down to and from at least China at the 1st sign of the new virus, they probably wouldn't of needed this in the 1st place. I don't see how some of that is discrimination and we don't get protected, while others do. It is a work rehabilitation program for mentally ill adults."

434,Getting a dog is making my anxiety way worse??,"My sweet baby boy is curled up at my feet right now but my whole body is coiled with tension and fear. I felt ready to get a dog because I was in therapy and on medication, and hadn’t had a panic attack in over a year. I had always wanted a dog and thought I could handle one. Hell, I thought he would *help* with the residual feelings of panic I have.

But instead all I feel is horror and pain. He bites a little, all in play, and even though the behaviourist said that it was just leftover puppy biting and would go away with training within a couple months, I’m constantly having panic about his biting. He had a fight at the dog park that the other dog instigated and I felt whiteout panic for a day (no more dog parks now). I feel anxious when he doesn’t poop, when I need to take him to the vet, when he does normal dog things like try to chew shoes. What’s wrong with me? I’ve literally dreamt of having a dog my whole life, and volunteered at a shelter and walked dogs for money for years. But now I fantasize about never having made that decision, of getting a knock on my door from the people who lost him to begin with, and happily returning him to his old home. I have been thinking about returning him, but I think I'd just replace the anxiety with guilt. I love him. And he’s A GOOD DOG. So sweet and snuggly, already responding well to the training for the biting. I just don't know how long I can do this.  Anyone else experience this?"
435,I feel like my mind is composed of 2 different minds,"(I'm not a native speaker)

First of all, it's not something that bothers me. It just makes me feel really funny sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

For example: when I'm enjoying one activity (like playing video games, watching anime or youtube videos...) I feel like something in my mind gets upset after some point, and I start hearing (in my mind) comments like ""you are not enjoying this"", ""this is getting old"", ""I don't like this anymore"". But it is not something that I actually feel. These comments come from nowhere, even if I'm really enjoying the activity. It's like someone trying to tell you something, but you don't hear. And then suddenly the person just shouts to get your attention. This happens since I can remember my entire existence.

I also have a habit of talking in my mind referring to me as ""we"". Although, it happens only sometimes. And I don't know why I do this.

&amp;#x200B;

However, one thing that happens really ofter is the same commented before, but in different contexts. When I hear about something, or learn about some news on tv, I then hear, from nowhere, comments that are not my own, and don't align with my personality. Let's pretend a tragedy happens and it shows in the news on TV, I would suddenly hear the comment ""serves him right"" or some variation of it.

Or even more creepy. Let's pretend I tell a lie. I suddenly hear ""are you really saying this""? ""phrasing it like this they will know you are lying"", ""what ugly thing to do"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm certain that it's not I'm thinking these things. They just come out of nowhere, like a huge scream that I don't control. And it happens without thinking about it. It just comes."

439,Am I experiencing signs of psychosis?,"
Hi! Thank you for reading. I posted this in Ask Docs over a day ago and got no response so i deleted and figured I would try here, hopefully that is ok. Female, 25, currently on Wellbutrin 300mg (for only 3 days), history of wellbutrin and effexor use, diagnosed depression, anxiety, PTSD. 

Length of symptoms: 2 weeks.

  

Ok, so I kind of just have a list because this was the easiest way to type it up. This is the 2nd time this has happened, it also happened last spring but that time it eventually progressed to where I was  not participating in reality and I'm not there yet this time. It follows a consistent/predictable progression:

o Depression that gradually worsens, starts the week before my period but instead of lifting when I get my period, it gets worse.

o Depression progresses to the point where I struggle to do basic things like work, housework, self-care, etc. and I’m exhausted all the time.

o Then progresses to suicidal thoughts- but they’re very calm and “reasonable” not like desperate. Just like suicide is an option, like one would choose the stairs vs. the elevator

o Then I develop a “fixation” it’s usually just my perceived intelligence level but this time it is both my intellect and my appearance. I spend most of my day obsessing over my appearance, I’ll frequently blurt out “I’m ugly” or “I’m disgusting”. Every time I shower, I do a list of all the plastic surgeries I would have from my feet to my head. I don’t want to look at myself in the mirror and I dissociate if I have to do my makeup or hair because my reflection is grotesque. I perceive myself as grotesque and monstrous. I fantasize all day long that my problems would be fixed and my life would be different if only I was pretty.

o I also obsess over my intellect (or lack thereof) and I just constantly berate myself for being dumb, worthless, failing at everything, and that my lack of intellect is so limiting for the rest of my life. I’m like actually angry that I don’t know more and that all these people, great thinkers, that  I admire, I will never be like them. 

o I see things in my peripheral vision but they’re not there when I look directly at them, just like eye ""floater"" type things, flashes of light, not like people or anything.

o I occasionally have extreme thoughts. Ex. I was washing my face and my brain was just like “gouge your eyes out”. 

o The obsessions become so intense that I eventually start thinking “I shouldn’t be here, I’m so insane, I’m so unstable that I’m incompatible with life, what if I don’t get better and I just keep getting worse to the point that I hurt people around me.""

But I question whether something is actually wrong with me because despite all this, I’m still…functioning. I sat here and typed this totally calmly and thoughtfully. I can recognize these behaviors and thoughts as abnormal. I do not feel wholly detached from reality.


Any input would be appreciated, thank you in advance!"
440,I can’t feel anything. My life is on autopilot.,"I’m just realizing how I can put this into words with all this time I have to introspect during quarantine. I’ve been in some sort of ‘autopilot’ for a while now. 

This is going to be a pretty long confession, so buckle in or leave now.

I can’t feel anything positive. Nothing in my life has felt as real or as funny or as happy as it did since I was 12, back when I was playing Pokémon games on my 3DS without a care in the world. 

I’ve tried getting a girlfriend, 4 times this year, and none of them made me feel happy. I’ve laughed and enjoyed myself for a while, but it just gets too awkward and mushy for me. I ghosted them just to see how I would’ve felt and I still couldn’t feel anything. 

When my crush stared at me like I was dead to her for doing so, I couldn’t feel anything. 

When another girl cried about it, I couldn’t feel anything.

When all of them moved on, I couldn’t feel anything.

I hang around the people I love, I can’t feel anything. 

I put a hole in my wall, I can’t feel anything.

I isolate myself, I can’t feel anything. 

Sometimes I feel like my whole life is behind a shitty video game and someone else is controlling and making the worst possible decisions, I can’t even empathize or sympathize with myself most of the time.

I barely if ever respond to anyone’s texts or DMs anymore. 

Seeing other people of all ages that I know have it much worse than me, whether if it’s in the physical or mental department, and knowing that they’re living their best lives “making the most of it” with their girlfriends and boyfriends and husbands and wives really makes me envy them.

Because I just fucking can’t. I really want to be in a relationship, but I can’t stand any of part of it.

Everyone thinks I’m just being an asshole or stuck-up hard-to-get fuckboy, but this isn’t something I have full control of.

The only thing I feel anymore is anger and sadness. I have these random thoughts in my mind just to get angry and fucking punch something for no reason. 

People in REAL LIFE can and have complimented me and I couldn’t even force a smile, but some coward on the internet calls me a dumb piece of shit or an ugly motherfucker (even though they’ve never seen what I look like) and my blood will genuinely start boiling. 

At this point, I come to realize it might be my fault.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Is this a teenager phase? Is this a self-esteem problem? Is this narcissism? Is this depression? Am I forcing happiness? How is everyone else my age moving so fast? Why can’t I just enjoy my teenage years before they’re gone like everyone else? Why is it so difficult for me to be a regular 16 year old boy? 

TLDR; I haven’t been able to feel truly happy in a long time, and at this point I feel like it’s only my fault. I can’t feel any positivity or excitement about myself or anyone else anymore. I’ve been going through most of my life fake-laughing, joking around and pretending everything is alright when it usually isn’t."
441,Alcohol and Mental Health,"So after a bit of thinking during this quarantine and thinking about my next moves in life I wanted to talk about and share my story about alcohol. So a few months before Graduating High School in 2018 I used to work at a restaurant with a couple of friends from the same high school as me, after each shift we would send out an older co worker to go out and buy us packs of Corona to drink after each night shift we completed and stay there a few hours after closing just drinking and having a good time, but for me it was more to release the stress of coming to terms that we weren’t going to be the kids we once were after graduating and that we’d have to start thinking about what college we’d want to attend or if we wanted to go straight into working straight out of high school. So fast forward a couple months later and I’ve already graduated and I’m drinking for 5 nights every week, I noticed my thought patterns have started to change a bit, I’ve started to become a bit more lazy, anxiety has started to become a problem since I had to interact with costumers since they wanted to know my plans after high school and I’d tell them a lie. A month later I quit my job one day without notice on a weekend because the anxiety has started to overcome and I couldn’t really handle the pressure that graduating has brought to me and I was always overthinking about my future and what it would look like and what my next move would be. After quitting my job I stayed home for almost 2 months jobless with only 500$ that would later $0 because I had gotten scammed by people selling fake festival wristbands. So during those two months I was always staying up late at night, overthinking and anxiety ridden, waking up at 5pm not wanting to do anything until I finally had a break through and one night decided I wanted to change my life entirely now fast forward to today being sober for 2 years I could officially say I’ve become a better happier person than when I was 2 years ago and so happy to what I’ve become mentally since breaking through that little curse, that 500$ I lost when I was 17 doesn’t mean anything to me anymore because I have now officially hit 10K in my bank account and have never been this financially stable with this much money to my name in my life, I’ve become mentally stronger since not touching alcohol and become way more happier since. This is a little story for anybody out there struggling with an alcohol addiction and mental problems, just know that you could change your life too and it’s never too late to turn your life around, all it requires is a bit of patience and motivation ❤️"
442,Contemplating suicide,"I promise im not a troll. I promise promise. 
This Sounds super selfish but im contemplating suicide. I am worthless, selfish, and no matter what i cant make my brain act like everyone else's. I am forgettable. Everyone knows ill listen to their issues with love but it's not the same when it comes to me. Everyone has their problems. Mine are no more important. I have one friend who knows. But i cannot do to her what has been done to me. I cannot steal her time ans energy with my selfish thoughts. My kids... Goddammit
My husband.

My life doesn't seem worth shit. No one cares anyway.

Today after failing to do my job(im new. Im in my 4th week) i was written up.

That was the last straw

Ive suffered with depression anxiety forever and it's just not getting better. Its never going to get better

Thats it. Ive had visions and even what it would feel like to hang myself. Im a shit person. 

I decided as a last ditch effort to come here.

Idk why though

My head and eyes hurt

Im hiding in my bathroom

I panicked this morning at work

How goddamn embarrassing"

I'm so mad that I ever let myself slip so far. I'm mad at myself for being so wildly naive and optimistic. I just can't tolerate my own body, as well as my own mind. I legit had a panic attack in the middle of a workout.

I just don't know what to do. Do I keep trying even though all I do is fail? Because it just doesn't feel like it's worth it anymore. I'm sorry for this rant, I'm just hoping someone might have some advice for me because I'm hitting every wall."

I hate it. I hate this.

445,my brain automatically assumes any kind of affection is fake,"the only kind of affection i like is when someone talks to me and has a heart to heart and you can tell theyre concerned about me and want me to be okay. but if someone were to just say ""aw baby i love you"" instead of that id get really uncomfortable. does anyone know why im like this? tbh even when people do so much as send me a wholesome meme saying they love me it makes me lowkey want to throw up."
446,I feel like I'm slowly losing my mind.,"So these past few days have been like a reoccuring mental breakdown for me.. And it doesn't seem to want to stop.
I've been having a very shitty couple of months, even before the covid19 stuff and it's kind of because I have no idea where I'm headed in life anymore, I feel completely lost, maybe less alone than i did before at least knowing I have friends to talk to about this..
Yesterday was almost a full blown tantrum mental breakdown where I just wanted to bash my whole head in and could not stop weeping and making these noises.. I actually decided to get drunk but I can barely handle my alcohol so I just barely drank 1 beer and gorged myself with food. Most of the time I mainly eat my feelings away.. or not eat at all.
And my sleep schedule is so fucked that when i actually plan on falling asleep i don't succeed in doing so, but when I wanna stay up I just fall asleep so quickly. 
There's so much going on in my head that I have no fucking clue how to express or describe it because I know it will make any living person listening to me go insane.. 
I got fed up with society and the economy and the rotten world we live in, I would have to say that is a very strong reason why i feel betrayed by society and the government. I have also regretted being gay because I know for a fact that things will never change for me and I will never stop feeling afraid of expressing myself or even feeling comfortable leading a ""gay life""..
I feel like different people sometimes because of the frequent mood changes and the levels of sanity vs insanity that my mind shuffles through.. 
I know for a fact that this just even typing it down sounds made up but I feel like my brain can not be fixed and I'm considering running away somewhere.. or killing myself.. 
Idk if this is a rant or a call for help but I'm going to try to cope and move on. But it always feels good to let it out because this shit clutters my head and leaves me  speechless and too anxious..  
I know I need therapy but I'm too afraid to go there because i would probably get admitted to a facility of some sorts.. I'm not sure how I will be able to function in any society anymore..
Everything that has lead to my situation right now has managed to break me. 
Okay thanks for coming to my whatever rant."
447,I have the urge to kill myself,"So this last year, things really changed in my life. I'm not really going in to detail , but it has changed in a bad way. Idk how to explain it but things have been fucked, I feel like a loser, also that I don't have any meaning at all and that people don't like me or hate me. The last 3 months have been really hard, I broke up with my girlfriend after 4 months, wich sucked. I'm also struggeling with anxiety and depression really bad now because of this. wich has lead to suicidal thoughts and such, I just feel like im wierd and don't fit in anywere . I always get told by haters that Im ''Worthless''  ''Selfish'' and ''ugly'' these things just make me wanna kill myself, Idk probably cuz im wierd and all of that is true."
448,Why does seeing couples make me so jealous?,"I [17M] have been through some really traumatic stuff recently. I won’t go into it here, but it’s taken it’s toll on me.

The past month or so, whenever I see a happy couple or hear a friend talk about how happy their girlfriend/boyfriend makes them I get so jealous. 

People keep telling me “Oh, your young, don’t worry about it” But then I just see someone younger than me happy with someone and I feel jealous. I keep telling myself that the reason can’t get a girlfriend or boyfriend is because I’m so irreparably damaged by everything I’ve been through, that I don’t deserve to be in a relationship. Hating myself helps make it feel better, as it’s harder to feel bad for someone you hate. But then I see someone just as damaged as me in a relationship with someone, completely happy and I just want to scream. It takes away my one way of coping and it makes me so angry.

I feel so jealous to the point where I think things like “I hope they break up” and then I feel so angry at myself for even thinking that. It’s a loop, and I just keep getting angrier until I’m at that point of rage where I’m seeing black dots, my breathing feels weird and I feel like I’m outside of my own body. I’m normally a pretty chill guy, and it takes a lot to get me angry, so this is really weird for me.

I feel like life has been fucking me over. I have been though so much trauma, I have had to be other people’s emotional life support because for some reason everyone runs to me when they need help, to the point where I feel so much older than I actually am, but I can’t even get a girlfriend or a boyfriend. 

Here’s an example of this: The other day I was talking to an online friend of mine [15F]. I’ve spent the past few months pretty much being her emotional life support, listening to her vent, trying to help her, to my own emotional detriment most of the time. I know that I’ve gone through worse hit than she has, but it never bothered me, I always tried to help her, no matter what. But then she mentions something brout her girlfriend and I instantly feel my blood boil. She’s about as damaged as I am, and yet she’s with someone she loves. That makes me so confused, I don’t get why she has someone and I don’t, and that confusion just makes me so jealous and angry. 

I’m bi, I statically have a better chance than most people to find someone to love and yet my romantic history is abysmal. 

How do I feel better about this? I feel awful, I am such a horrible person. How do I stop feeling like this?"
449,I was physically &amp; mentally abused by my father until I ran away from home at 15. Also realizing now I was probably molested in what I thought was a “child’s play” incident by my older sister when I was in 4th grade. I’m looking for help,[deleted]
450,How to find a way for two mentally ill people to live a decent life?,"First of all, sorry for all of my misspellings and bad language overall, English is not my native language, but i hope i can get my message to you.  


So, there's a lot of going on in my and my girlfriend's life, and i can't seem to find a solution to figure out how to deal with those problems.  


I suffer from  **Borderline Personal Disorde**r (or, as it says in my medical record, it's ""Emotionally unstable Personal Disorder""). I'm very impulsive, though i manage to control these impulses most of the time, my emotions feel a lot deeper and heavier than it should be (that results in a constant feel of derealization), but despite that i don't feel anything most of the time, only apathy. But when i get to feel something, then it's becoming just unreal (sadness, jealousy and etc.). And i'm heavily dependant on my mood. I can't do anything until i get the right ""mood"" to do it.  
And i have a girlfriend. She suffers from **Schizoaffective Disorder (**though her diagnose can now be different, because before she was always diagnosed with recurrent depression and bipolar disorder after that), and she's really going through some hell right now. She always wants to die, her body is covered in scars. Her mood changes almost every hour, she can't handle even a slight stress without having some sort of psychosis or switch in mood (recently she had a really hard psychosis because the floor was too dirty). She works at a part-time job in some office, not a hard job at all, but still it burdens her sometimes. And her mindset is completely tied to her emotions. She can be aggressive at times, and sometimes she throws it on me.  


We've been together for 2 years already. We were dating at a distance, but year after she moved away from her parents to me, now we live with my parents. And they're really friendly to her (except step-dad, he's just doesn't care that much), but that doesn't help that. She fells really uncomfortable in our appartement. She feels restricted in many ways, because she hates doing something or even leaving our room if someone is home. So it all really makes her feel worse, and she wants to move out to some rental apartment and live an independent live. But there is a problem - money.  


I've never wanted to be anyone in this life, and didn't had any idea of who i want to work as. But recently i become really into cooking and wanted to become chef. But i didn't had any education, so i just tried to find a place where i could work without having diploma or any work experience. So i found a job, and worked there for two months. It was great at the start, but then our administrator started being to harsh to me and constantly made rude comments about how i work. And to top it all one of my colleague wanted me to be kicked off so she could take my place and work 30/0 to pay off her mortgage. And after all i was downsized due to this pandemic. So now i can only work as an advertiser and we don't make much money, not enough to even rent a room.  


So it's hard for me to find a job due to my mental problems, because working as a cook was really exhausting and  provoked a deterioration of my mental state even further. And she definitely can't handle another work due to her mental state. Though it became more stable with medicine that she's taking, but our psychiatry is really lacking in any kind of help expect just throwing pills down your throat (we live in Russia)  


And here we are, living with my parents in small apartment with no real income and unabilty to find a decent job just to move away and live on our own. And i don't even know what to do in this point. Maybe there are people who encountered same problem in life and managed to deal with it, because i fell like this is a dead end for us.  


I hope i made my message as clear and understandable as possible."
451,How do i live with someone and get over their personality?,"I've been back from school in another country for about two months and am just realizing the effect that my mom had on me from childhood and continuing to now. It's not bad. It's just the ever-most subtly annoying gesture or thing that she says and upon analyzing my behavior from her actions, I realized I had slight mental health issues. 

Whatever she says, she most likely already knows the answer to and most of the time asks a question or comment or repeats the same question or comment that I have already said as if just because she enjoys hearing herself talk. It may not be what she intends to do, but she always does this and it drives absolutely fucking insane on the inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've realized that my slight annoyance of being watched was a symptom of mental illness, and when it was more apparent when after having more stress I *actually* *became anxious and afraid that a monster was hiding behind a door or somewhere in the room and was out to get me*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we never can really talk about the relationship but if we did, I'd imagine it would go something along the lines of her apologizing and that she never meant to do any of whatever to piss me off, which would piss me off even more because it's her subconscious nature and she can't control it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mainly, I was happy when I went off to college in another country since I could finally learn to become independent. Since coming home because of the pandemic I haven't really enjoyed any of the things I used to apart from distractions and living under my parent's roof, I'm spoiled just as ever."
452,I could use some positive reinforcement,"Long story short; one of my friends ghosted us and I dont know why, I tried to make anemds by paying him back the game I owed him early but that didn't work. The reason I need reinforcement is because I'm being hard on myself about it thinking its my fault and stuff and I'm afraid it'll make me upset tomorrow. I don't want to be upset tomorrow because it's my ceremony for graduation which is already sensitive enough given the current state of the world. So I just want some happy thought to make me feel like its not my fault and make me happy again.."
453,I'm struggling and I want to give up,"I can't cope with all this pressure anymore, I'm basically homeless, in rent arrears, I can barely afford the private treatment I desperately need (the free stuff would take years to even be seen for), and my medication has been absolutely useless.

I even wanted to adjust my medication and get a refill but still nothing has been sent to the pharmacy after nearly two weeks. My medication has been super fickle already and now it feels like it's not working at all anymore. I feel depressed like I did before starting any meds and not even the drowsy effect is there anymore so I can't sleep either.. It was already pretty bad in terms of my mood, but after experiencing an ongoing series of nightmares about the sexual abuse I suffered as child I feel absolutely broken and dead inside.

Because of the nature of these things I can't really tell anyone. I've been going through countless support sites' reading material and don't feel any better. I know already that it wasn't my fault, I was just a child, but the effects are still absolutely devastating and I can't cope with this on my own?? There's not any type of support for how I feel right now, not among my friends who I can't open up to anyway, and not professional support either.

These feelings are so severe, I have no life force left in me and I keep wishing I was dead and considering if maybe I could just kill myself to escape this.

I can't call my GP about this because it's just a huge bother and they're probably not equipped to help me with this anyway. The mental health services in my area actually make me feel a lot worse, even just thinking about them does. That's because last time I was having a crisis and became gradually more set on killing myself, they ignored it.

I'm almost 100% sure now that they didn't take me seriously because I disclosed my borderline diagnosis, so clearly that and the fact that I showed up there was only for attention, and ""totally"" not because I was homeless, ran out of money, was forced to drop out, wasn't getting any support, and was going to starve anyway and then met with a mental health nurse who was more focused on violating my boundaries and making sexual comments toward me. They even knew I had plans for how to kill myself, but all they did was continue to tell me there's nothing they can do to help, and to even fucking yell at me.. I bet they were fucking laughing their assess off at me when I left, but I was dead serious when I said that this is the last try I give it before going through with it. Of course I tried to kill myself! There was nothing left for me to do and the people who were supposed to help me treated me like utter shit! I wish those people knew what they did, but given that I survived they'll just think it was for attention too. Nevermind that I wasn't the one who pushed me to go to hospital. Nevermind that I still wanted to die after that and only didn't because I felt too guilty to do that in front of the presumably only person who still cared a little bit about me..

So yeah.. I would actually rather die than ever seek out that service again... At least, I wouldn't go there unless I had some kind of advocate with me..

The only two reasons I haven't tried to kill myself again are the guilt of how it would make my friend feel, and the knowledge that if I survive I'll just be left without any type of support once again. I'd just be miserable throwing up bile for a week again..

I really don't have any hope for my life and at this point my dreams don't really mean anything anymore.. I wish I could be dead already because I'm alone in a country where people just don't give a flying fuck"
454,Suppressing emotions for 10 years has made every feeling completely overwhelming now that I’m letting myself feel again. F19,"About ten years ago (around age ten) there was a lot of stress in my family life and I completely shut down emotionally. I rarely felt any emotions because I was so desperate to block out the bad stuff. Unfortunately all that suppression also blocked out the good feelings. I am starting my third try with therapy this week, and something I’ve realized is that as I’ve begun healing and letting myself feel emotions over the past year or two, every emotion is completely overwhelming. If I’m sad, I am absolutely in the dumps and I can’t shake it for days. If I’m angry, I feel like I might explode and I don’t know what to do with it. If I’m happy, I feel like I’m on top of the world and invincible; I get reckless with drugs and sex and I feel like nothing could go wrong. The thing that concerns me the most is the anger though. Generally I can keep it to myself and not hurt anyone else, but after doing that too long I can’t keep it in any longer and I snap on someone. Usually this is my parents or myself, but last night I snapped on someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and it was a real wake up call. I regretted everything immediately and let him know I was sorry and that this was one of the reasons I wanted to go to therapy again (we had talked about it previously). I guess the basic question here is, has anyone else dealt with this kind of suppression from such a young age? Do you feel completely overtaken by every emotion you have? I don’t know what to do or what’s the deal with me."
455,I feel alone,"I’m 23, female and recently been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I’ve never met anyone with borderline before. I was supposed to go into group therapy, but because of the pandemic I can’t. 
I really want to meet someone like me.
Preferably a girl of similar age."
456,Seeking new solutions for anxiety and depression,"Hi, F26 here. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression as a result of CPTSD for about 18 years now. These problems manifested into an eating disorder and substance abuse, both of which I am in recovery from. I have been sober for 9 years, and my ED has been under control for almost 2 years now.

I have been in therapy and on medication for most of my life, and have yet to obtain any sort of peace of mind from either. After choosing to come off of medication, and cease therapy (with the exception of my bi-weekly PTSD support group) in January, I find myself struggling again. 

I sought out more “natural” methods of coping such as meditation, practicing mindfulness, diving into spiritual and sobriety based literature, getting back into beloved hobbies (like crafts and early morning jogging) and being more open and honest with my loved ones about my thoughts and feelings. I thought maybe I could face my demons on my own, but I am learning that I do need help. 

The big issue I am having right now is my anxiety and insecurities manifesting in ways that are hindering progress in both my job and my romantic relationship. I know that I AM enough, that I do my best and that I am worthy of good things and love. In my core, I truly do believe that. But my brain likes to tell me otherwise all day long. So I have found myself underperforming, overthinking every single thing, and projecting my insecurities onto my very undeserving and wonderful partner. It has gotten to the point where I am no longer eating or sleeping, I have gone from casual cigarette smoker to 2 packs a day, I am picking at my skin and pulling out my hair again.. But I have not lost hope. I know things can and will get better again, I know that change is possible. 

But still..How can I be so aware that these feelings are unfounded yet still be unable to combat the ugly thoughts?

So I guess what I am looking for here, is to see what others who may be experiencing have done to fight this. Perhaps I need a different medication or a new form of therapy, perhaps there is a particular book that will resonate with me, or maybe I need hypnosis! I am not sure, but I am open and willing to try anything - preferably non-narcotic approaches- to help myself heal again.

Thank you if you took the time to read this, sending a big warm hug to all who are struggling in these weird and scary times!"
457,covid-19 mental health ramifications,"Hi everyone, hope you all are able to stay safe and well in this time. In this time, I'm sure you all may have come to a similar realization that I have - that the wellness consequences of covid19 may very well outlast the presence of the virus itself. I wanted a way for individuals to share experiences in a moderated safe space and would love to hear any reflections from your experiences. 

We created this simple platform to submit tales, experiences, poetry, anything and everything related to experience anybody may have had, healthcare worker to reflecting on picking up dinner takeout last week. Personally I've noticed an incredible shift when I went to support a local restaurant by getting a take out order - despite standing outside six feet apart, there were individuals looking at each other with steely eyes and a level of distrust I have never encountered before.

We started this initiative because we have close family friends working the frontlines in NYC and were disappointed to hear about the death toll not only from the pandemic, but also how significant the mental health ramifications have been, and will continue to be.

So I welcome you to check out the site, read experiences, and submit something if you'd like -hopefully you'll also find a sense of therapeutic wellness in sharing these experiences with others going through similar challenges. 

COVID Chronicles ( [covidchronicles.com](http://covidchronicles.com/) ) is a repository in progress of reflections, experiences, and stories serving to bring together stories of the world on one platform, adding an element of humanism to facing a pandemic. The goal of this repository is to contribute to greater wellness in not only those who contribute stories, but also for readers to be able to personally connect and empathize with anecdotes shared.  
Thank you all for reading, hope you stay safe and well!!

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - [covidchronicles.com](https://covidchronicles.com) therapeutic wellness via sharing and reading reflections, prose or poetry, of compassion, empathy, humanism in an especially challenging time"
458,Why do I feel like I’m not worth anyone’s time or affection?,"I’m 21 years old and for as long as I can remember, I’ve never felt worthy of anyone’s time or care. I’ve tried seeing myself how I see others, and it just seems fake. So why so I care about people around me so much, but feel like I’m worthless to them? I just don’t get it. I want to feel worthy, but I don’t know how."
459,Just a quick question,"Hi I'm 14, and my name is Ruaridh. I've not had too many mental health issues throughout the years but today when I was playing a game with my friends some random people started talking on the microphone.

Before I go into further detail about this, you should know that I am 14 but I sound 8 and am about 4'10. It's one of my biggest insecurities and I hate it when people make fun of me about it. 

So anyway these random dudes start talking and i say hi, they told me to shut up and that my voice was so annoying. I felt a little annoyed but brushed it off because it happens a lot. Then they went on to more profanities and said some... Suggestive things. Keep in mind I'd never met these guys and they were just going off at me.

Somehow I feel really sad about this. I know I shouldn't but I do, I don't know why I do but I do. I like to think of myself as quite a positive guy, but when this sort of thing happens I tend to dwell on it and the stuff they said really linked back to my insecurities.

Anyways I was just wondering if anyone had advice for me to stop feeling like this and if this is normal. 😴"
460,I feel like all my friends don’t like me,"I’ve had this feeling hiding in my brain for the past 5 years. Since this started, I have met a bunch of new people, and I like to think I became friends with them. However sometimes, regardless of if I’m alone or with them, I feel like they don’t actually like me. I never talk to people outside of school/work, and no one ever tries to make contact with me, even when I try many times to do so. I feel like it’s something wrong with me, maybe I’m just not a likable person, maybe I’m “too much.” No one wants to be with me when they don’t have too. I have never had a best friend, I’ve never had a significant other. Am I crazy to think I’m just not that enjoyable? It makes me sad to think I will always be alone, never being able to successfully connect with someone. Sometimes, I wonder if the problem is with my personality, in that I pretend to be like someone else so they like me. I honestly don’t know anymore, I’m lost"
461,This probably doesn't belong here,"I've had a crisis

I have relapsed in self harm

Huge disappointment on my pc

No friends I can talk to anymore

I feel like I'm about to throw up

Anyone got advice?"
462,Is this normal?,"So I’ve recently started having trouble sleeping, because I would get bad thoughts when I tried to go to sleep. But then also sometimes I would just curl up into a little ball and just not be able to move. There’s nothing physically restricting me, but I still couldn’t move. I can’t even talk when this happens. I was just wondering, if any of you have experienced something similar or am I just going crazy?"
463,Feeling like living on the inside of my body watching the world through frosted glass.,"Hey, I'm writing this because I wonder if anyone can relate and maybe has some tips to handle this. 

So I have this constant feeling of a big distance between me and every sensation my body is able to register. For example I can't read long text anymore because it feels like there is such a big distance that I keep skipping words and can't figure out every single letter. It's not a problem of the eyes but it's concentration related I guess.

Also I have this feeling of living as a smaller version of myself inside my body and everything from the outside needs way to long to reach me on the inside. In the past I had some nervous breakdowns and the days after I always felt like i pushed myself on the surface and I could finally experience the world. After some days everything went back to ,,normal"". 

I thought that maybe I cant stand all the emotions and impressions of the outside world so i hid inside myself living in my head not capable of processing any information from the outside. I really want to break through this. I feel so stuck.   

Well I have a bunch of physical conditions which make things worse but I want to focus on the head for now. 

tl;dr:  I feel like living under water."
464,(TW) I don't know if I can keep living,"I keep fucking up. everything I do is wrong in my mind. I was calling my best friend and laughing and I was so happy but when we weren't talking I felt like a weight was put on me and I just became so unmotivated. when he had to hang up I started crying and nearly had a breakdown simply bc I hadn't talked to my grandma for a week or two. Everything in my head is screaming I'm going to die anyways so why not do it now. Last night before I went to sleep I imagined myself hanging in my closet. I've been crying myself to sleep every night. I know I have people that care and some people said they would kill themselves if I died but I dont think they mean it, or they mean it until they get sick of me and leave. I've started to distance myself from people but I feel like a bitch now for doing it. Last night I cut myself after a year of staying clean. I'm afraid if my mom finds out she'll say I dissapointed her again and send me off somewhere. I don't know what tk do anymore."
465,I truly believe I will die within 3 months. Why? Because a week ago as I was watching a flock of bats fly 20-35 feet above my I felt like something dropped in my mouth. I’m convinced it was bat spit and I have rabid. I can’t get off the couch.,I’m a dead man walking.
466,I don’t know what to do,I used to be with camhs (child adolescent mental health services) and they discharged me last September. They never diagnosed me with anything or helped me or tried to figure out what was going on or did therapy and now I’m here. I feel like I should’ve never been discharged but I’m so scared to tell the truth about things so I guess it’s my fault. I am truly not okay and I feel like because I got discharged and no diagnosis or anything it must seem like I’m just choosing to feel like this. I’m not. I’m struggling with minor (?) substance abuse and just feel so Lonely and so sad and just feel like everything’s so much bigger than me and I just don’t see myself getting through this. How do I tell someone? Do I even tell anyone? I don’t know what to do. I have 0 support and I just don’t want to get back into old habits but before I had to get to that point before anyone even cared???? What the fuck do I do because I can’t keep on like this
467,I had a ton of edibles last night and kinda got paranoid/anxious. Does that reflect anything on my personality? Am I ‘close to a psychotic episode’?,"
I used to have a fear of losing touch with reality. I had over 200mg I think and couldn’t stop shaking. I had memories of childhood randomly. I worried if I was molested by my neighbor or something.

Unfortunately when I was around my teen years I had some weird incest fantasies... and that came up last night. I get that everyone makes mistakes but does that say anything about my personality? What if I’m a ‘bad person’?

Am I just overthinking stuff?"
468,What is the psychology or biology behind “the 7 year itch”?,"

So I’m sure we all know about the 7 year itch.

(for those who don’t know, it’s essentially getting bored or falling out of love during a long term relationship and wanting to leave)

My thoughts are that it’s to do with our Male ancestors needing to have as many offspring as possible so once they have raised there kids they needed to move on and find a new female to have more kids. 

Am I thinking along the right lines here? 

The reason as I ask is I’m currently in that situation and my mental health is really suffering. I have a loving wife and son, my wife would anything for me, literally anything. She is a decent mum, she works, she’s attractive and I honestly think I’d struggle to find anyone better for me. 

Yet I still feel the yearning to move on and find another woman. Thinking logically it’s clear I’d be stupid to do this, so there must be some inner physical/biological/emotional rational behind it. 

Thanks."
469,I'm in psychosis. Again.,"Nothing feels real and I can't do anything. I can't risk telling anyone about this or my life will most likely go to shit. I'm not in danger, I'm not planning on hurting myself or anything like that. This just sucks cause I feel like shit while I also don't feel anything."
470,Talking to myself normal?,"A bit of background. I'm M (32) and I've been single for 10+ years and have lived by myself for about 8 or 9. Over the last 2-3 years I noticed I've slowly started talking out loud my imaginations. Like, whatever scenario is going on in my head, instead of it staying there, I end up verbally playing through it. I have to stop myself when I'm in public. I do have a (one) friend that I hang out with fairly regularly but this keeps progressing.   


About two years ago, I met a girl who I became super good friends with. I had begun talking to myself a little bit just before meeting her. As I got closer to her, it was going away. Then, she got scared because we started to like each other and I haven't heard from her again. The talking to myself started to get worse. I can control it but some times I have to catch myself when I'm in public. Am I going crazy?"

474,counseling/therapy?,"so i have terrible social anxiety, and recently i told my mother that i have it. she wants to help me and get me counseling (or therapy, i can't tell the difference, may someone clarify for me), but first she wants me to try to socialize with other people because she doesn't want me to do nothing to start overcoming my anxiety (now that she knows), and become too dependent with the counselor. i think she also said that if i don't start socializing, it'll take longer to overcome my anxiety with the counselor.   
she wants me to start socializing with my family by talking to them about anything (ex: work, what you did today) every day, or asking them a certain amount of questions about anything every day. i don't see a point in it because it feels forced, and we don't really have anything relatable or interesting in each of our family members' lives to talk about. (is it bad to think that?)  
i have tried talking to people (before i told my mother about my social anxiety), make friends, but i can't because im deathly afraid of the negative things they might say to me, that they'll think of me negatively. my mother keeps saying to think only of the good things that might happen, but i can't, because of that small possibility. am i bad because of how obvious and simple the solution might be, and i might not be trying hard enough?  
she won't change her mind about getting counseling until i can start socializing. should i trust her with this? is it worth it to start overcoming social anxiety with her advice before counseling?"
475,TW: Suicide,"For the first time ever in my life, I finally feel like I have a friend that would actually care if I killed myself. I've always been passively suicidal; it's like a crutch to me. At the slightest inconvenience, my first thought is about killing myself.  I have treatment resistant depression and schizophrenia, and things are definitely difficult, to say the least. My past therapist and I had been working on trying to find some other coping skill other than, ""well, just might as well die,"" but she unexpectedly quit and there are no more local offices that take my insurance.   
But, about a year ago, I met this girl. Our children are the same age, we both have had significant trauma in our lives, and we both have special needs children, so it feels like we are just on the same path with life.  She knows about my mental illnesses and accepts me with them. I feel like she reciprocates my feelings (platonic) and that the friendship road is finally a two way street. She's extremely special to me, and we have both told each other things that we have never told anyone else. Suicide still pops into my head daily, but for the first time ever in my life, I feel like if I went through with it, it would actually affect their life. And, I don't want to lose her either. I feel such a strong feminine bond with her, like we were friends in a past life. I don't ever want to lose that.    


I'm sorry, this post kind of left me a little and became disorganized rambling."
476,New feeling,"I don’t remember being really happy ever but I’ve lived ok so far. I’m in my 30s, married, son. This week, for the first time, I felt nothing. I’ve just moved my body and answered questions when asked. I managed to keep my son fed and did some laundry, just on pilot. I guess I can live this way. Are any of you living this way? Do I just keep going? I don’t feel anything which I guess is scary because it’s new. Thank you."
477,I might not be ok,Been in and out of a disassociation State all day I’m scared
478,Im in desperate need of advice,"Hey 14 year old girl here, 
Let me explain my situation, My mom expects me to take care of my younger siblings and tells me that i need to act like an adult eventhough im only 14, and she says things like “if you want adult privileges then you need to also have adult responsibilities” she thinks that going to friends houses and skateboard and stuff are “adult” things eventhough those are all things that normal teenagers do and im expected to have the house clean and do all the dishes and the laundry and make my brothers breakfast and make them do their schoolwork and if i dont do every single one of those things she dosent let friends come over and she dosent let me go out and skate or go to my grandmas house for the weekend. My younger brother stresses me out so much, hes embarrassing and he dosent listen to a thing i say and my mom does nothing about it , i hate to say it but he makes me miserable and always gets me in trouble, him and my mom cause me so much stress im mentally exhausted from being at home. If i mess up even one thing she yells at me and calls me lazy ingoring everything else i did right and i hate it, i hate cleaning up after everyone, i hate being punished if i dont, i hate being called lazy when i dont get everything done, i hate being home. The only escape is the 2 days that i spend at my grandmas i want to scream i dont know how much longer i can keep doing this. 


Anyways now that you know my situation let me elaborate a little more on my brother ,jerad 8 years old, and i cant stand him, neither can my other brother, grayson age 7. Grayson is a pretty well behaved kid, he always does what i ask and is generally a very sweet and compassionate kid, but he does enjoy his alone time,he is very spoiled though  im not gonna say hes a perfect angel but really what kid is?, on the otherhand jerad is the polar opposite of grayson , he is very selfish , obnoxious, annoying, and worst of all.. manipulative , jerad dosent like to listen to anything i say, and it usually results in me getting in trouble, he makes huge messes in the kitchen and when i ask him to clean it he refuses, same with pretty much anything i ask him to do, he wont play outside unless i force him too, he also does things purposely to get a reaction out of grayson and me, exsample, jerad will do things like ride my skateboard around the house, “jerad please get off you’ll get hurt” 
*no response... “jerad i said to get off”
*no response “jerad i told you to get off if you dont ill have to make you”
*no response 
So ill pull the skateboard up from him and he will start yelling at me and acting like he didnt do anything, and says things like “OkAYYyyyyY, you dIDnT hAvE To pUsh mE oFFff” 
And after that he will ask me if he can play on my playstation, and of course since hes grounded from videogames i say no, and what does he do? He grabs my remote anyways, ill tell him to give it back and he wont give it back and move around as i try to get it back

,   i learned very quickly that punishments have almost no effect on him, taking his xbox? Nope, tablet? Nope. Nothing works, (he will cry about it tho) no matter how much of his things you take away He just dosent seem to learn, so i tried spanking/ smacking in the head like most hispanic parents, i thought, maybe this will work.

No things have gotten so much worse 
He will do things repeatedly to get me to hit him (ex: hit his grayson, push my dog down the stairs ect) a couple days ago he came into my room and straight walked into my closet looking in there like it was his, and as a teenage girl that did not go well with me, i got up and smacked him in the head with a “what do you think your doing??” And he said “looking for something to borrow” in a whiny voice. And then he swung at me, obviously I wasn’t going to let a little kid hit me so i evaded, he ended up breaking my mirror, another reason to hit him again, and as he left he slammed my door angrily and broke it which caused me to go out again and hit him once more. He then started screaming as if i was murdering him at this point we were outside as he tried to run, he started throwing a tantrum so i said “im gonna lock the door tell me when your ready to calm down” and he started banging on the door and screaming. I think of another way to punish him as physical discipline clearly wasn’t working. So when he was finally done screaming i told him to go to his room and lay down , he asked “can I please say something” i said no, knowing exactly what he was gonna say , and he said “why do you always hit me, in a sad tone” the same question he asks over and over that i have to answer over and over again, i reply “because you don’t listen” 
And he crys and whines and acts like the victim, i raise my hand and he starts running acting like hes scared, i know hes not really scared or he wouldnt come and push open/ slam my door trying to get me to hit him, at first I didn’t reconise him as manipulating until my friends saw his behavior and pointed it out to me, he plays victim to get what he wants. Ive already had issues before this but since we have been staying home with him due to corona my mental health has broke a new record of instability for me, ive been dissociating almost constantly from it, ive been sleep deprived, yesterday I almost hyperventilated while disociating, my anxiety has gone through the roof. Usually im a pretty calm person, not letting most things bother me, but that kid, i cant stand him, he fills me with rage, almost like i could choke him, i got so mad one day I wanted to cut myself, but i ended up stabbing a waterbottle instead of my arm, also ive been burning myself quite a lot more often than usual, i feel like shit


If you got it this far, thank you so much for reading, if you can give me some parenting advice for my brother please do"

480,Vent.,"Hey guys, just got off the call with my father, it was about paying some bills. Now this man, has never made up to the promises he made me, I was always lied to, and when I confronted him about being lied he just brushes it off saying he doesn't have money. Lie, again. He's the guy who has 300k worth of cars sitting in the fucking garage. All my life I have felt that I wasn't a good son, because of his treatment. I was a 90% student till my 10th grade, and I passed 10 grade at the age of 14. Now? Im a depressed failure of a 16 year old who smokes 30 ciggarettes a day and is waiting for an opportunity to rid myself of my suffering. Now during the call, he has the gall and Audacity of rubbing salt on my wounds saying how my cousins are smarter than me and he likes to spend time with them. (He is in the US rn, and stuck there for obvious reasons.) Obviously, rollercoaster of emotions, and now I want to fucking kill myself. Thanks for listening to my rant. Everybody cares about my cousins getting As in their school in my family but no one came to visit me while I was lying in my bed after overdosing in sleeping pills."
481,Lockdown is making me question my life choices.,"I work in bar management and have the expected schedule to match,  my relationships are all tied to work and the bar in some way and generally involve lots of drinking/partying, I have done this for 10 years and spending so much time alone during lockdown is seriously starting to wreck my head.

I am 35/m now, I currently live above the bar I run by myself,  when i am done with this bar i will likely move above another...(this is about my 12th flat above a pub in 15 years)


I'm starting to worry if the way I work is fucking my head, I have always struggled with really bad depression and in the past when I start to feel like this I have always cut and run (I have moved to a foreign country with nothing to my name twice before when I was feeling like this, but I have been at this for 8 years now and make decent money)

Life in the  new places is good for a couple of years and then the same loneliness/depressed feelings take over

I just don't know if I should quit and try to change career while I still can or if it's my brain doing it's normal thing, I just don't feel like I have any way out of the party lifestyle, how am I supposed to find a nice girl who will be happy above a pub? If I stay in this for another 5 years I'm hitting 40 and then I have little time to study a new skill, moving career would almost certainly include a significant salary cut (but does that mean it's a better time now before I have kids??)"
482,I need a better way to deal with anxiety,"Okay y’all lately, in order to deal with my anxiety I have started taking long showers. One long shower in the morning and one at night. And they do help my anxiety , but it’s taking up to much of my time and then I get anxious because I spent to much of my day showering not enough cleaning or working. 

Can you offer a helpful alternative to handling anxiety ? Or a way to help wean off this habit. Right now when I think of taking less showers and trying to discipline myself more I get anxious and just want to cry. The whole not being able to go the gym part of quarantine has kind of induced this habit I think."
483,Smoking weed once ruined my mental health.,"Intro:   I am currently 20 years old, and six years ago I smoked a lot of weed and completely freaked out. Ever since that night, my life has completely changed. 

(Before I continue I am not trolling, please don’t try and defend marijuana. I am actually all for weed being legal. I wish it was as accepted 6 years ago so I could have been informed more on how to safely consume it.)
———————————————————————
Anyway here’s me story. 

Background:   Growing up my dad, sister and all my cousins smoked weed and I was introduced to it by them. After hearing all these cool things about it I decided to save up some money to buy some myself. 

The night my life changed:

Fast forward six months I finally got enough money for an eighth. I had paid my sister some money to get it off one of her friend’s. She gave me the bag and we smoked that night. I didn’t feel any effects. 

The next night I wasn’t planning on smoking but it seemed like a perfect night. My mom was gone, my dad was working the next morning so he was in bed early and my little brothers we upstairs sleeping. I texted my sister, she told me where the stash was, told me to be careful and hung up. I got the weed, packed a really big bowl (about a gram), and smoked it all by myself. 

The effects hit. 

I immediately felt the urge to run to my bed after 5 minutes of smoking it. I couldn’t move at all, my mouth was dried out completely, my ears were ringing super loud, my heart was beating out of my chest and my head absolutely killed. At 14 years old I was truly convinced that was gonna be the last night of my life. Memories of my childhood ran thru my head, then like a movie, was my family crying at the scene of me dying and my funeral.  I always have known you cant die from weed, but I was convinced it was over for me. I was having a full blown panic, anxiety attack.

All these weird things kept happening, and after about 20-30 minutes things stated to get better but my head really, really hurt.  I was still nervous because my heart was beating fast and my mouth was dried out.  I fell asleep that night.

The next morning:

I woke up the next day for school.  I immediately looked for my phone and took a picture of myself. One of my eyes looked lazy but I was happy to be alive. I immediately got up and got dressed for school. I felt good. I told my mom I loved her and went to the bus. 

Thought the day of school thoughts kept re o occurring about the night before. It was all weird to me. I felt kind of dazed but I just figured it was because of my experience the night before. I talked to my friend’s about and they laughed. U realized life was not meant to be taking for granted and I wanted to live each day like my last. I texted my sister about how crazy the night was and how I’m never smoking again in my life.


Everything changed again around 5 o’clock while
Eating dessert with my brother and sister. I felt that same anxiety and panic as the night I smoked weed.  I started to freak out, but I tried my best not to show it. I looked over to my sister and she looked extremely disturbed. She had a shocked face and looked at me and said are you ok in a really concerned voice. I said yes. 

It’s hard to write my life out from now to six years ago, but I went through a lot of panic attacks, anxiety, and regret everyday. I spent all my free time researching the way I feel.  My life since this day has felt like a dream. This doesn’t feel like reality. I’m writing this now because I feel it getting worse. I just hit the six year mark and April-May is the time I think about it. I’ve completely changed from that. I have never told my parents, and sometimes I wonder if they notice. They know I don’t smoke weed but they think that’s because I’m a “good kid”. I believe I have depersonalization and derealization. I pray it goes away sometime soon. This has caused me to look back at all my childhood memories and pray to get those times back. My personality I feel like has changed. Maybe it’s not all the bad experience I had,  more of just growing up and puberty and all that but I don’t know. 

Due to this experience here are a list of things I struggle with.
-self diagnosed depersonalization and derealization (my symptoms are 100% accurate)
- Anxiety, and not depression I don’t think but a lot more sadness. Dwelling on the past.
-I’ve never drank alcohol because of this. I have smoked weed again after this and had a good time (still had anxiety, only took one hit) but it hasn’t fixed anything. I will not be smoking again. 
-I’m afraid to feel anything other than sober. If I feel slightly different , like a head rush or something I go into full blown panic mode. 
-social anxiety. I think because months after the experience I spent a lot of time to myself and kind of forgot how to socialize.

Now, I have never received treatment for any of this and for the last month I’m thinking about opening up to my mom about this. I don’t want her to think I’m insane, but I just want to see a therapist or someone who can diagnose me for real and see if there’s any treatment options. I feel as if I could have ptsd/depersonalization and derealization, and at least extreme anxiety. If I had one wish it would just to feel like my 13 year old self again without a worry in the world. I fantasize about waking up the morning after and feeling “all there”. 

If anyone has something to motivate me to get help, or have gone through something similar please share this with me. If you are young please if you are gonna smoke and experiment start with a little and work your way up. That’s my life advice right there.

Thank you."
484,just a random vent,"living 23 years with noone to help me, when i try to look for help with professionals or people that ""can help"" me they just end up telling me i'm probably the problem and yeah maybe on the end i am

i mean i have always wondered if it is worth it, even though i study what i like i don't see a future of me doing anything, every day it is more notable for me how i dont mean anything to anyone, i mean more than 2 months of quarantine and noone has tried to make contact with me... even when i send the first message, but hey i'm with my family, whom insult me on a daily basis but i guess that's better than nothing i guess

let's see how things are later on, maybe my demons will keep haunting me or i'll become more numb to all this, maybe i should just live on not expecting anything from anyone not even myself and just survive or try to at least

i wish i could just dissappear, not like that would affect anyone, i mean i dont wish for much just to not be so miserable 

oh yeah, sorry about my bad english"
485,If you have time to read this,[deleted]
486,If you have time to read this,"Hello, I am a student of English language and literature. I attended all four years and haven't graduated yet for I have to pass exams to get my diploma. Now, you probably wonder, well, why don't you study and get it already? But it gets more complicated... I'm quite struggling with studying, it may sound ridiculous, however, I always feel this pressure on me, so much pressure that makes it all feel like a bomb ready to explode-- I am indeed sometimes a lazy person, I won't deny the usual disease of probably every human, however, each now and then I have these anxiety attacks, especially when an examination week is approaching, it gets hard to focus, I know i could get things ready but dealing with sudden anxiety and depression that attack me out of blue ruin it for me. I feel so empty inside, like something crushed, I suppose that's the feeling of rooting inside? It's really difficult, let's say in this manner, to get my shit together.

What always comes to my mind bothering me: A) my parents that will treat me like a useless garbage, it's always like that ever since I enrolled this university, whenever I fail I feel as if I committed a crime, especially now when I unfortunately must live with them again (I studied at another city so I had some freedom and fresh air), I come back home like some beaten dog with my mother asking me how come I failed, didn't I study and so on. It exhausts me to even reply because I already feel bad for failing. B) Myself. Quite sad, but I work against myself, I can't gather courage, I can't be strong and be at least 5% of the person I used to be, lacking of self confidence especially when one day at debate, I was told by my professor that my English is the worst thing he ever heard. I've been told that many times. I was humiliated in front of many for it- I don't know, maybe my spoken English sucks that much, however, there are probably few factors that destroy it, lack of self confidence, fear of public talk and generally oral exams, and stress. Or maybe I'm just, ironically, being the worst at speaking.

Last summer it really sucked for me, for several days straight I couldn't stop crying and feeling bad. It was this time when I was preparing for exams. I felt enormous burden on my shoulders, I couldn't stand it anymore so I went to seek help from doctors. They sent me to the 'best psychologist' so they can tell me 'you are a bit anxious and depressed'. Did they even listen to what I had to say? Nope. Here, have antidepressives! Next time I came, I tried to tell them that I have this terrible conflict with my parents and how our relationship is toxic and how I'm disturbed to the point i have no will to study nor to live, of course, I got more antidepressives. I don't feel like they help me but ruin my moods more.

This year hasn't been better, I'm not going to blame the virus, I shall blame myself. I don't know if you ever felt like 'oh why this must happen to me?', well, yeah. It's just those stupid little things that keep happening and ruin your mood, like something is up with your laptop, then phone, then a tooth starts hurting etc. Things like that. I know they sound ridiculous, but once such unfortunate events keep coming one after another one may wonder what have i ever done to get bunch of this things on me? Am I cursed or something?

And there depression hits you, especially if you are a female, experiencing the eruption of awakened sensitivity. There it gets double worse. So worse that when I'd get depressed during such times I wish to end my suffering. I'd gladly hit a wall with my head until I faint or whatever I could possibly do- it's a very awful thought. I try not to think about suicide since I gave myself a promise I will never try to kill myself for once I tried. I admit it shamefully. 

I know this story sounds messy and actually there could be a far greater Bible sized story about my problems but this is a little summary. 

I don't know what to do with myself, I realize these feelings are the worst and that could probably even end my relationship, although, my boyfriend wouldn't agree with it- but I'm paranoid, I know whenever I feel those shitty feelings I can be really unbearable and negative that can also drag him in this hole. He's always trying his best to help but, of course, it's hard to understand all this mess within me. I wish I could solve it, I wish I could work on it but every attempt results in faliure. It's difficult, guys and no one ever tells you that."
487,Anxiety and fear now i'm slowly fading away,"I have social anxiety around my neighbors and friends/family.  I am always afraid when they are out drinking and I come out of my place that they will reject me; however never happens and they give me bear all the time time.  So much that I get a little socially then too overcome that I can hardly keep up with what they are saying and nothing makes any sense.  I am over it now that I decided to sober up and that's not on me anymore.  I want to go out and hang with them however now I just curl up on the couch or go in the garage and smoke a lot.  My family hardly comes over to visit because the smell maybe or they always got something going on.  People tell me I need a girlfriend.  I can't believe I am still single I am good looking and look 20 years younger than I actually am.

I am so lonely and just meditating on the bible.  I feel like I don't want to exist and am just in everyones way.  People judge me and are sometimes darn right cruel.  I want to end my life but can't think of any way to do it so it doesn't cause anyone harm.  I'm not sure why I quit drinking and will quit smoking, it's like I think everything is just going to get better somehow.  I want to reach out but have no one to turn to.  I wish would just be raptured into heaven and not go through the fear of ending my life.  

I have lot's of people from the state helping me out because I am on SSD because of my disability; which is mental illness.  That got better and should be grateful because it really sucks when you are paranoid and think that everyone is out to get you all of the time.  

Is there an easy way to end your life?  I thought about purchasing a propane tank and having it slowly leak in my car and the fumes would suffocate me in my sleep.  I am afraid of it blowing up or accidentally hurting someone.  I thought of many ways and even tried to overdose on my meds however just ended up in a coma for almost two days.  

I'm not going to kill myself because my faith is too strong.  I just wish I could have something or someone in my life with similar interests that we could hang out and be friends with.  

I am new to this and I meditated on the verse from the bible :

""seek ye first the kingdom""

hence my screen name."
488,My brother just texted me: “Would love to see my baby brother graduate” because I told him I’m postponing college.,I’m 23... really dude?
489,I'm a pathological liar and I just can't stop,"For as long as I've been alive and been able to speak, I've just lied and lied and lied. And I want it to stop because eventually, I fear that I'll lie about something that may actually seriously hurt someone (though, I possibly may have done that as well) or hurt my own reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

I lie about a lot of things. Mostly things I can easily get away with. Such as where my parents live and their partners, but it's mixed with truth so much that no one can prove me false.  


I often lie about my own financial status to seem more attractive to people as I usually only go for women or men who hail from wealthy families and seem to be rather smart themselves. Such people have finer tastes and as such, they usually aim high. It's easy for me to get away with that as my father was a rather successful actor in his youth and a politician, I was in a private school, where I was surrounded by the children of other successful musicians, actors, and businessmen.  


But the truth is, I have never known the rich life myself as the entire time I spent living in the city, I lived in an old apartment in one of the poorest areas in the city, while my dad spent most of his money on guns and a fancy ranch on an island of the western coast. And I was never given an allowance. Even the kids from poor families, who I met in my karate classes and other hobby related clubs, got more money from their parents than me, which infuriated me as I thought my dad was being greedy. In the end, it did help me get a strong work ethic young and I filled a lot of my free time mowing lawns, working in different shops as an assistant, etc.  


But even doing so, I never had all those fancy clothes and phones all the people around me did. I bought my own smartphones, tablets, computers, clothes but they were never as good as the people around me had so they often called me poor.The people who lived in our apartment block knew us as well and we were often resented there. We weren't the same nationality as the minorities who lived around there so I never really understood what they were saying but my father would often demonize them. Our cars often got keyed, wheels popped and one of our cars got lit on fire by some old lady. At some point, some crazy junkie got sent after my dad as well. But the craziest part is, dad never wanted to move as he had some shady business ventures going on around this part of a city that I never fully grasped (I knew he gave out loans a lot and many people who threatened us were people he had loaned money to). This drove my mother away from us.  


This whole thing had really made me hate the notion of being associated with being poor. I can easily play someone rich and successful as I can act really well and googling my name brings up a bunch of pictures of me winning all sorts of national competitions, being associated with successful startups and such, but the truth is, I am making just a little more than average income on the side of my university course. But I know that lying about visiting all sorts of exotic lands and making truckloads is a lot more attractive to people.  


I also lie about progress on stuff a lot as well. It started in school with homework and such, I often did everything last minute and now the same has happened with work. But it's never backfired, it has only produced great results and I feel like that has really put me into a dangerous mental state. Often during competitions, I did all the preparations in the last 1-2 days, though I had months in advance and I still found success. I feel like lying about progress just comes naturally. Eventually, it'll probably end up costing me a lot.  


I also lie a lot about being a badass who did a lot of substance abuse, got into fights, and all that as that is attractive to people. The truth is, while I may have a lot of tattoos, piercings, know martial arts and workout daily, I'm just a softie. I often play an extrovert, put in a lot of energy, try to assert myself in situations, do public speaking well, but I often feel more like a shy introvert who enjoys talking in cute and silly ways. But life has taught me that I need to put on this act to find success and for people around me to accept me. And so I lie about my character. And I will probably never stop doing that.

Some of the worst lies I do have been to previous partners when I want to break up. I start pretending to have a lot of mental issues and fake depression and fake crying. I'm sociopathically good at that when needed. I usually decide to break up with people once it becomes clear to me that they have no ambitions for success or when they themselves are mentally troubled or feel depressed. Sometimes the sex just isn't good enough to bury the rest of the faults as well. Through life, I have seen that people with troubles themselves rarely ever provide comfort to others in times of need and I've experienced that after enduring the worst day of my life when my male boss sexually abused me as a teen and I sought comfort from my partner but it was clear that such weakness from a man is not something people are willing to tolerate. And so, anytime I want to break up with someone, it can usually just put up an act whenever we're together and I focus more on my university work and communicate less frequently. That makes breakups less hectic as they won't feel dumped and it won't break their heart. It makes it feel like it was their decision instead of mine so I won't be vilified. And they won't go spreading gossip about me being some terrible monster.But with one person, it didn't go so well as they felt a lot of guilt over leaving me when I put up an act (and I never admitted to it being an act) and so they themselves fell into depression and lost track of their goals. I do feel bad about causing that but I don't feel like I could admit the truth as They could start destroying my reputation.

Some other lies involve different skills. Athletic, cooking specific foods, using different programs, knowing certain instruments. The thing is, I've had so much contact with all sorts of different instruments, sports, and programs, cooking from a young age as well, so that if I ever need to demonstrate the skill, I will prep myself enough to actually play it off like I know what I'm doing and talking about. Sort of making my lie a reality.

The final sorts of lies are often about people. Often mix lies and truths so it's hard to tell the difference and check for validity. They can be negative lies but also positive lies about how good someone is at a certain thing, etc. I'm very strategic about who I tell those lies to as well. Always make sure they would never have direct contact or any reason to bring those things up. I feel like most people tell those kinds of lies but I do want to stop.

I want to stop those lies. I guess I'm afraid that if I came clean, the people around me will not accept me. Perhaps I need to distance myself from everyone I know and start a clean slate where I only tell the truth. But I do sincerely love my partner and I think they deserve the truth. So, I'll do my best to be a more truthful person.I've been thinking of tattooing ''No More Lies'' somewhere on my arm where I can be reminded of this promise to myself every day.  But I don't know if it'll ever help. But doing nothing about it won't help.

Anyways, that is all for now. No one will probably ever read this but at least it's out there. At least I was finally honest."
490,Ask for help and you shall NOT receive (rant about lack of resources),"I have been suffering for mental illness since I can remember. I begged for help for so long I couldn't do anything as a minor so I suffered in silence. When I turned 18 things got really really bad. I was in and out of the ER almost every other week for attempts. Each time they sent me for 2 days to this crisis center to monitor me before sending me home. I begged and begged to be hospitalized to get the therapy and help I needed. They refused each and every time. I called hospital after hospital begging for help.... nothing. All the hospitals told me that my case wasn't extreme enough.They eventually told me they had enough and sent me into out patient. I thought this would be a miracle, all my prayers answered I was wrong. I dont get therapy at all thier job is just to come by my house once a week to check in and take me to co-occuring (mental illness/addiction group). I am disabled because of my illness. I have multiple panic attacks a night and can barely get through my day. Everyday it seems to get worse and worse. All I want is help and the system has screwed me over time and time again. For anyone going through something similar I wish the best to you and I hope that you will get the help you desire."
491,What lessons can be learned from people who died trying?,"People often tell me it is okay to fail and just keep going, but I wonder: what if someone kept failing in life and they finally die of natural causes? How do I see this optimistically?"
492,Feeling alone,"Hello! I recently graduated college, and was fortunate enough to get a job prior to school ending. Unfortunately the job gets out at 11pm. Since I recently graduated I am living with my parents again. They are usually asleep and my brother who picks me up, goes to his room almost instantly. Leaving me by myself. I love my job, but I find myself missing my friends and isolated when I am alone after work. Lately I’ve been doing reading up on pets that might be good. But does any one have any other advice?"
493,Part of me doesn't want this self quarentine to end but can't figure out exactly why,"I'm hoping someone could help me understand maybe why someone with depression/anxiety/introvert/social anxiety would feel this way. My boyfriend is very much an outgoing person. Anytime he talks about ""after this is all done"" and seeing a group of his friends (most I don't really like), I get annoyed. angry. Anxious. I like having more time together, more time with the dogs. Idk.

Maybe some input of how to handle it? I'm feeling very alone in my thoughts about this Pandemic."
494,Do I have to talk?,I'm so tired of talking. It hurts and I can't describe how it makes me feel. It's almost as if my throat is being slowly compressed. I know it's not a physical thing but it just sucks. I always wished I didn't have to talk to people. If I'm alone it doesn't feel bad but the second I'm talking to someone it just hurts. I'm so tired of it but I don't know what to do. I feel like it's too late now. I've been pushing through it my whole life and now I'm 20 barely able to speak without wishing I could just vanish. I don't know what to do.
495,My mental illness story,"I've been on the mental health subreddit for a very long time and just made a new account. Usually on my other account I would just vent about whatever is bothering me. I'm not sure why I felt compelled to make a new one but I thought it might be beneficial for me to share my story with you guys.

I don't want to write something really long so I'll try to summarize it as best as I can.

I'm 17 now and have spent about half of my life with diagnosed mental illnesses. I first got diagnosed with debilitating anxiety that started when I was 8. I only slept a few hours every night because my anxiety wouldn't let me sleep. I couldn't do the normal things that other kids do because of it and would often spend my time shut in a dark room. I would watch the same tv shows over and over again because predictability was one of the only things that helped. Around 12 I started to experience derealization and depersonalization that I had no control over. It quickly got out of control and my longest episode lasted for 3 months straight. I spent almost all of my time alone and barely spoke. I think it might've become something more serious because I started to believe that I was some kind of superhuman and I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. Then the depersonalization and derealization started to go away. I'm still not sure why it did but it brought a lot of relief. Around the same time though I became very depressed and would get close to taking my life many times throughout the next 3 years. Right when I thought my mental illness was going away it got a lot worse. I developed conversion disorder that would cause me to have multiple seizures a week and I spent a lot of time in the hospital. The doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with me and I genuinely thought I might be dying. I was suicidal, had episodes of dissociation that might've been psychosis, and my mental health was literally causing my body to shut down. 

I got better though. I started antidepressants that were hell at first but after a while I became stable. I wasn't suffering anymore but I wasn't thriving either. That was until I started really working on myself and experienced several serious wakeup calls that made me change. I still have a few bad days but my life now is so much better than it ever has been.

Every one of us is a unique being with unique experiences and so our paths to overcoming mental illness will be different. I want to let everyone reading this know though that overcoming it is more than just possible. Please don't give up. You're a beautiful person and always have been even when you're at your worst. I don't care what you've been told about yourself or what you made yourself believe, you're an incredible person with a lot of potential and strength. You've made it so far, please keep going. You can thrive and be the person you want to be. I believe in you ❤"
496,Random stress twitching,"Whenever I'm stressed I get these weird urges/twitches (I'm not sure what to call them) Like for example, whenever I'm anxious my head jerks to the side, I can stop it, but it's a bit uncomfortable to. Things like that keep happening when anxious. What's going on?"
497,The worst out of the family ( sorry for the structure being awful ),"After having planned where to live on my own I think my time has come I don't have any directing and always was the weakest of the family.

For you see most of my family live in a country in civil war with a lot of bad situations, but they still managed to stay happy to keep studying to keep improving in life.
While I live in a well developed EU country and end the least successful.

After falling in love with masochism and death itself I can't stop thinking about it, it makes me really excited and I should feel horrible for it.

I am the troublechild of the family, obsessed with death and the joy of pain, never has a positive outlook and low confidence.

I never felt sad on it self, more of the feeling of disappointment from parents to friends to myself.


I'd like to know from you guys what you think about this.


And I really need advice to stop romantisizing suicide and also with masochism, because it will only make more people worry."
498,I just really need a friend,"Today, my neighbor was being such a cool dude ya know, I’m 19 and I came and hung out with some girls I happen to know from high school. For the life of me I can’t get words to come out of my mouth, I just exist in the room. Being alone for the past 2 months has sucked because my roommates (which are really the only real friends I have went back to their hometowns) these are people that know my name and know I’m a pretty interesting person but I guess I’m too awkward. Sitting here crying alone venting on this app and I just want to hug my best friend who’s 5 hours away. I miss having friends that love me for who I am."
499,I hear stuff that isnt there sometimes,"This isn't a common occurrence. Just every once in a while, with seemingly no correlation as to why. The noises vary from police sirens, alarms, noises from video games, and people saying my name right in my ear. 
I was diagnosed a long time ago with mild depression and chronic social anxiety, but have since recovered very well from both. I'm not sure if any of these things might contribute to it, but I really just needed some sort of advice on whether or not to get myself checked out for it. It does concern me, but i'm not sure if it's necessary to see a therapist/psychologist for. Thank you in advance"
500,Anorexia and anxiety,"So. 
My anxiety is bad I don’t wanna eat and can’t eat, and then I end not eating for days and days. 

Is there any advice for people like me? I wanna eat. Lol 
But damn. It is A BATTLE."
501,I(22f) found my Bestfriends (22m) plan to kill himself,"
I’m not sure what to do, I found a very detailed “to do “ list and his plan to commit suicide. We’ve been best friends for two years and this seems out of the blue, we just booked a trip together for next year and he wasn’t planning on making it past this July. I didn’t even know he was suicidal and when I confronted him about it he was calm and content. He told me this has been his wish for over 9 years that he feels “ready” and is in the stages of making his final preparations. I love him and care about him, he grew up in an abusive household and doesn’t know his own worth. While he is the shirt off his own back kind of guy he wants “to make his first selfish choice” and “stop the pain because he is so tired.” He is emotionless about the whole thing. We talked and he did want to at least try medication, his Tharapist got him to agree to the emergency room where I sat with him until he was admitted into the voluntary mood disorders unit. He seems so sure that all of this is prolonging the enviable and I don’t know what to do or say other than being there for him. I go to visit everyday and we joke and talk but I will hug and hold him telling him that he is worth so much but besides that I’m lost.  
Please if anyone has any advice I’ve had a lot of suicidal colleagues in the past but this is the first one that has me truly shaken and lost I know he’s going to go through with it if he can.

TLDR; How do you get your bff to not commit suicide when it’s all he’s fantasied about for over nine years?"
502,Driving,Sometimes when I’m driving I start thinking deeply about if I just turned the wheel hard left or right in the highway. I did it one time and stopped myself. I don’t think I’m depressed or anything it’s just like a deep thought in my mind that’s like “what if...?” And sometimes I just go to far.
503,Can I confess my dark secrets to my therapist?,I’m about to see a therapist and I know therapy is all about talking to them but I want to ask. Can I confide in my therapist by confessing to him my secrets and dark secrets and just everything I’ve done in my life that I regret and is keeping me from living my life? I want to tell them everything but I’m scared to. Just to note I’ve never done anything illegal but just embarrassing things that I don’t want anyone else to know. And this person being a therapist I want to know if I can tell him in hopes he will help me with me problems. Thanks.
504,My dad died in December and Today I heard my mom having sex with some guy,"Hi, so I wouldn’t usually post something but I’m in desperate need of advice. So basically I’m 17 and live with my 16 year old brother and my mom. My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer in July and passed away on December 16th. My parents always hated each other since I can remember but got divorced when I was around 14. My mom has dated since then and we have always been close. So obviously the horrifying lung cancer death was bad enough. I relieve the time in hospice over and over again. Half his body was paralyzed, it got to the point he couldnt talk, then he couldnt open his eyes, then he was delirious. About two months before that I had a concussion, so my brain was already going through enough. My dad was amazing  and yet he didn’t think of us/prepare well enough for his family. He left us with nothing meaning we had to move the week of Christmas. Fun! At the wake I walked in with all my poster boards I made for him. Hundreds of family photos. My older brother(he’s always been crazy) who is 21 and half brother 55 had promised me the casket would be closed. Guess who walked in to see there dead dads body laying there? His face was cold. That traumatized me. We don’t speak anymore and never will. Anyway fast forward to March, I happened to find out that my mom was a prostitute my entire childhood. Yes you read that right. She denied it but the proof was there. I kind of suspected it as I read something on her phone about how much a certain act would be when I was 8 or so. That traumatized me and I ran away and slept at my friends for two days. The cops had to check on me because I was freaking out. I started therapy as I’ve been extremely depressed and struggling just to keep myself alive. It feels like mood swings and each day it’s either up or down. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and started lexapro. That failed and made me even more suicidal. Come to find out as of three days ago, I have ADHD but my moms to scared to treat it. Finally to the whole point. 

My mom has been talking to this guy for a few weeks and I’m always supportive. I’m going through a lot right now and have always been extremely sensitive. My mental health is extremely bad and right now I’m framing out. My anxiety is there the roof. I heard my mom and this guy fucking downstairs in my kitchen. I want her to be happy but it’s really freezing me for some reason. It brought me a panic attack and I’m not sure if I’m making a big deal or not? Should I talk to my therapist about it or is it not a big deal? I’m just lost and would love some advice. Sorry if this was all over the place. Someone please help."
505,A couple questions.,"I’ve been having- well not so nice thoughts for a while, but especially now during quarantine. I just have a few questions as to handle a couple things. Oh, and I feel like you may be asking, “why ask here?”. Well, I’m too much of a coward to ask for help from my friends or family so, yeah. 

Okay, let’s say that i have a knife. And I take that knife and begin to just scrape it along my arm but with some force; possible intent. Breaking maybe 2 layers of skin and leaving quite a large scrape. But then later on, i get bored. Grab the knife again, and then mindlessly saw into the top of my hand. 

For some context that knife is very dull and has trouble cutting anything so it takes a while and some force to break any skin or cut anything. But taking all of that into consideration. Is that considered self-harm? 

Sorry I know that’s a lot of explaining for one question but I felt it was necessary. The harm wasn’t really an urge, more of just “oh wow that kinda hurts. Oh I can feel things? Cool.”  Because most of the time I’m numb. But anyways

Next is relating to that sort of. Should I ask for guidance from my therapist? We’re doing some virtual sessions and I had a bandage on my arm to keep myself from messing with the scabs and she noticed it. She asked about it and I just said, “oh yeah... I didn’t do anything (lie) it’s just to keep me from messing with a scab (true)”. So knowing that, should I tell her what really happened?

I just realized how long this is so I’ll keep the last one short. One of the main things I worry about is if other people are worrying about me or if I’m a burden. But should I tell someone about this if it is self-harm?

Any answer appreciated, thanks!"
506,Difficulty processing what I read + no interest in starting anything. Am I just lazy or is there something else going on?,"I love reading and learning but recently I've found that I can't remember what I read. I will read one sentence, and by the time I move on to the next sentence, I completely forget what the previous sentence was about. I will have to reread multiple times before I can process what I am reading. I feel like everything I read goes in one ear and out the other immediately. I remember two months ago I read a book, and after a week I completely forgot what the book was about. I didn't even remember the main character names or plot or anything. I only remembered the book name and author. Also I watched all 7 seasons of Parks and Rec recently, and I don't remember much. I can remember the character names, but I honestly don't remember much of the plot. I can maybe remember 1-2 things that happened. Like if you asked me why I liked the show, the most detailed response I could say is ""it was funny"" because I just can't bring up specific moments that I found funny.

I feel like I had a pretty good memory when I was younger (I could always remember life events and small details that happened), but recently I feel like my mind is blank and I can't think about anything. I'm also a huge fan of reading about social impact and organizations like the ACLU and UN, and I've found that I can't get myself to be patient enough to even read a SHORT description posted by the ACLU or the UN on instagram, even though I know I am interested in what they have to say. I've found it hard to get myself to do anything, even if that thing interests me. I'm honestly starting to feel like I might have ADHD, but I feel like it's just me not concentrating or working hard enough. I want to do stuff and be more productive, but I just can't bring myself to do whatever I want to do because I just can't concentrate on that thing. I feel super disappointed in myself since I have done NOTHING this entire quarantine and I feel like my brain is just blank and I can't retain anything. Also I'm Asian and there's a stigma against mental health in my family and I feel like if I tell my parents about this they'll say I'm just lazy and not working hard enough. I don't know what's wrong with me.

Edit: Also I'm worried that I'm falsely making myself believe I have ADHD. I'm going to go see my school therapist when I go to college this fall, but I'm worried that I'm conditioning myself to believe I have ADHD when I really don't if that makes sense and thus be falsely diagnosed with it? Does that make sense? "
507,How to be okay with being single forever? My biggest fear is living alone.,"Hi everyone. I am a 23 year old male who just graduated college. I currently live at home with my parents. I am content here because I have my parents to live with, so I'm not alone. However, I have been having an issue.

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 years now, and we planned on getting a place together next year or the year after. I thought that was great! I'd get to live with her and have a place of my own. But now we are having relationship issues. Back in March, she started to talk to a guy who she used to have feelings for. She confessed to me at the end of March that she has feelings for him, and feels really bad about it. I told her to stop talking to him, and she said she did. Things were fine; until I found her sending him hearts.

Things blew up, and since then, we have been fighting 5 or 6 out of 7 days a week and it is now mid May. I've been pushed away so far that I don't know how much longer I can continue in this relationship. But I can't leave.

I have a fear of being single forever. I have a fear of living alone. It is VERY tough for me to get anyone to like me, and even more tough for me to date. I'm a socially awkward, below average looking male. I don't have any luck on dating apps. She is my first serious girlfriend, I had another before her, but that only lasted 4 months...I got cheated on then too. Only reason I got lucky with my girlfriend is because I met her on an online game.

I don't know how to get over this. She is causing me so much depression and pain, that I know I should leave, but I can't, I just can't get myself to. Please I really just need some help. I don't know what to do."
508,Where should I start when dealing with bothersome thoughts/feelings?,"For example, whenever certain things come up at work/at home I find myself getting defensive or upset. Sometimes, freeform journalling just feels like to much of a barrier when I'm already feeling overwhelmed. I want to work through my thoughts - what are some ways to do this that ideally are more structured/accessible?"
509,"I can't take my life anymore. I think about death everyday, but I'm gonna ask a simpler question. In order to take my meds I need to eat and even though I'm hungry I can't eat. What should I do?",I've lost 7 kilos in one month
510,Is medication in pill form an option for ex pill-addicts?,"My boyfriend quit pills cold turkey almost 10 years before I met him. He was 16, and in a really bad time of his life. He has not used at all since (the only thing he does now is weed a few times a month, and even then, it's only a small hit or two and he's done for the whole day). However, he's got a ton of anger management and disassociation issues. While he's finally agreed to go to therapy, and has been making strides in the last few months going (We go individually and to group therapy with an amazing therapist), he is still having wild outbursts and threatening to leave the relationship at least once a month.

We've been together for four years and he's had this same pattern. I'm not excusing it in any way, but his anxiety manifests itself in bursts of anger out of fear of being wrong (which stems from a fear of his abusive father being angry at him and screaming at him if he *is* wrong about the smallest thing). Small things that really shouldn't be a big deal and that can be a quick, ""Oh crap, you're right, I'm sorry"" can turn into a 48-hour long argument. He has this irrational fear that if he doesn't act on what he's feeling *right now*, no matter how destructive it is, that something bad (not sure what, neither is he) will happen. These anxious thoughts also make him assume the outcome of entire conversations, nervously stewing in anger over things that haven't even happened for days until he breaks, and has affected his life in various other ways that have nothing to do with me (not believing in himself, talking himself out of positive decisions because of fear of things going badly, etc.).

Therapy has been an enormous help, and I've seen a drop in tons of his other issues, but it isn't enough. After four years of all of this, coupled with the pandemic and me coming to terms with valuing myself and going through my own therapy (I was in therapy on my own for 3 years before this, because I have a narc parent that I'm no-contact with, clinically diagnosed PTSD, Depression, and Anxiety, and suspected bi-polar and OCD), I am at the last leg of what I can do for him. He is improving, but recently, I asked how many more outbursts I have to endure before he stops having them? Is his ""healing journey"" going to take 2 more years of my life before I can stop being afraid of my relationship being temporary? I told him that at this point, the only solution I'm willing to work with him on is if he gets medication to help manage these outbursts. However, his biggest fear is that, as an ex pill addict, that this is even a valid option for him? He is emailing our therapist tomorrow to ask about this, but I don't want to insist he goes with an option that may be harmful for him or hasn't worked for others. 

Does anyone have experience with this?"
511,my mental “health” is almost nonexistent,"before i go into this: i am not trying to self diagnose. i FULLY intend on seeing a professional as soon as possible, and i have seen multiple in the past. i do not want to invalidate ANYONE. i posted this in r/offmychest too.

i have four diagnosed mental health “problems”. just to make it simple, and i am not embarrassed, the diagnosis was: severe generalized anxiety, severe social anxiety, severe general depression, seasonal depression. these were diagnosed at least three or four years ago. since then things have only gotten worse. i tried meds, had to be taken to the hospital for one of them and the others made me feel more dead than usual, plus i stockpiled them habitually. since then, i’m now in college (just finished my freshman year!) and have seen the therapist there a few times. she isn’t a psychiatrist and isn’t able to “diagnose” me. however, she told me i most likely have a fifth, ptsd. i’m not going into the reasons leading her to believe that, but i felt a weight off my shoulders. 

this is also undiagnosed but i feel this is slightly different, as it’s more physical than a “mental disorder”. i have been struggling with an eating disorder for the better part of a year. i told my therapist a little. it only gets worse and completely controls every single day of my life. but this isn’t about that.

however, there’s still something “off” that never fit into any of those diagnoses. i and a person who has seen me through everything i’ve been through are starting to consider that i have bipolar disorder/manic depression. i personally think it’s not an extremely severe case, but it would explain EVERYTHING. i haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. it would explain the blowups, the screaming out of nowhere, the sudden burst of tears, the extreme excitement from one simple thought or idea.

guys, i really don’t know what to do. i’m so scared. do i really have this many problems? did i really treat everyone in my life horribly, and never realize it? i’m crying again. i just need help. i haven’t stayed sober more than a week in over a year. anything to not feel like this, fucking nyquil even. if anyone has any advice or can relate to any of these diagnoses i would so so appreciate it.

i don’t have anyone to talk to about this who understands. i’m so scared. i really hope someone can help. please"
512,Relationships damaged by mental health,"This has been on my mind a lot lately and I'm hoping maybe someone here has some insight.

So I've got a handful of diagnoses now (MDD, GAD, BP2, ADHD) and before I was diagnosed I was a really volatile person but I had a friend who stuck it out when many others wouldn't have. I ended up drifting away as I started to realize I was the toxic person and eventually we just parted ways but still remain loosely in contact. 

I'm not near fully recovered but I've got a better handle on myself now. I just feel like I should reach out and say thanks but then the self doubt in me says that weird and maybe not fair to them. And honestly if I did reach out what would I even say? 

Would it be unfair of me to potentially open that door again or should it just stay closed?"
513,Is it possible to not be traumatised by a traumatic event? Or should I expect the worst is to come?,"Hi, throwaway account because it’s a pretty specific situation and I don’t want it on my main one.

About a year ago, I had a pretty crappy run of luck. Things were good at the time - i had a newborn baby and was thoroughly enjoying motherhood, the world was so new and exciting! Then one day I was driving with my partner, baby and mother-in-law (MIL) when MIL had a sudden and unexpected cardiac arrest. I called the ambulance and did CPR - my first time ever doing it on someone who wasn’t made of silicone. She died, although my early intervention gave her the best chance of survival. It was a big rupture and the docs said that she wouldn’t have made it even if that happened in a hospital’s cardiac ward. At the time I was calm and collected - I even made the phone calls to tell the rest of the family when the paramedics took over. They said they didn’t realise how serious it was because I was so calm.

A few weeks later, after the funeral etc, I spent time in hospital with meningitis. While recovering, I was at my Dad’s house and an intruder broke in and attacked my Dad. He was violent and probably on drugs. I had to act to protect my old dad and my defenceless baby. The guy choked my dad into unconsciousness and threw him to the ground.  I put the baby (now screaming because of the scary loud noise) in a nearby room and ran out to help Dad. The intruder was about to kick him in the head while he was unconscious on the ground. I grabbed a shovel and hit the guy in the head before he could. I called the police and chased the intruder out of the house with the shovel. The police found the guy and he went to jail, luckily Dad was not badly injured.

I have had a Tele therapy session after these events, but only because I thought I probably should. I’ve not felt particularly traumatised or upset by the situations themselves. Maybe it was because the grief overshadowed it - I was very close to my MIL and felt her loss quite strongly. 

Anyway even now I’m not really bothered by the events, I have no triggers or flashbacks or anything. I’ve seen people fall apart over things like this so I’m just worried that that’s going to happen out of nowhere one day for me. Have I just processed these traumas really quickly, or am I just waiting for an inevitable avalanche of emotions? Am I missing something here? Thanks for your input."
514,I have no idea why I get an intense sadness at night.,I get really sad sometimes at night and I don’t know why. It’s normally when I’m tired. I just get really negative on myself and feel sad. Any idea if this is normal?
515,My Mental Illnesses and Fetish made me loose hope.," I am about to turn 19 years old and I don't see a future for myself. I believe my psychological issues are endless or that my anxiety is so bad that I've tricked myself into believing anything remotely bad is what I have. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds when I was 16. However, these did nothing for me after taking them for three months so I stopped. I'm a gay male who went through an abusive relationship with my ex, my mother left the family, I was left to raise my 3 younger siblings, I see my father maybe 3 times a year, The stress to maintain a 4.0 GPA in college is taking a toll on me, I'm watching porn that terrifys me. I feel i'm incapable of loving...I don't see myself being able to truly ever be loved or to love someone else. I crave it but yet it doesn't turn me on anymore. I have to reach to extreme porn to even masturbate and it is the only thing that will turn me on anymore and I hate myself so much for it. I want so badly to just be normal...to have a relationship with a guy. I want to crave plain vanilla sex, even though I've never been able to actually enjoy or get off during sex i've struggled every-time. The only porn that is getting me off these days sadly is \*sighs\* beastiality. The weird thing is growing up I told myself I HATED dogs. To be honest I still do? I don't understand why this is turning me on. I was hoping it's a phase but it's turning into a habit that makes me feel so guilty that I just wanna end it. I don't feel I could be fixed. There is no way in hell I would ever talk to a therapist about something so disgusting. I either will get over this on my own or I'll die. I want so badly to be loved. I am also a psychopathic liar who lives in a fantasy world. I've created this fake image to myself that i've made myself believe that i'm gonna be the richest person ever who has a capitalistic empire and I don't care who i'll have too step on to get too it. When someone call's me evil and a bad person I smile. I want to get better I really do and I don't want these thoughts of beastiality controlling me anymore. I see dogs in public now and i'm so scared my brain says ""I bet that person has sex with their dog"" even though I know nobody thinks like this. A year ago I would've NEVER had thoughts like this. I was only addicted to porn that was a little brutal but it was only humans. I can't live my life like this anymore, it's become too much for me. I try so hard to sext guys who have interest in me and it's something I can think I'd like to fantasize about but it just doesn't turn me on anymore. I have to resort to the nasty porn I hate so much. I need guidance or else it's gonna be too late for me I suppose. 

I don't think anyone will read this, but it was nice to vent and feel unjudged for even a second even though I don't deserve this."
516,I've been struggling with alcholosim and looked into rehab.,"I can't afford anywhere near the treatment payments that they offer, and if I wanted in patient it would cost all of my savings tor only a couple months. It's cheaper to just keep drinking until I die over living in dept and having to quit my job to afford 3 months of care, cool."
517,"Every time I try to open up, I just cringe about my problems","I am not sure if this happens to everyone, but it's just so hard for me to open up to others without cringing at the way I feel. It gets to the point where I have to delete entire conversations so I can never  see what I shared every again. I usually always play it off that I'm okay, but part of me feels like I am not. It's becoming harder to open up to my girlfriend because every time I do, I hate myself for sharing that information, and I usually scold myself afterwards. I want to open up to her more, but I can do it without feeling that I need to shrivel up and throw my phone in the garbage after I say something. 

It's also really hard to feel proud of my little accomplishments, because every time I think back on those moments, I find some faults. And it makes me want to bash my at how cringy I looked or sounded. Even this feels like absolute trash, so I am not sure if I will delete this later."
518,My mental health is really bad. I (14F) need help,"Hi there. This is my first post and I've never vented to a bunch of random strangers before. This is kinda scary to me, so please don't judge me or anything. This is hard enough as it is. I'm gonna tell my story now and why I'm here. Warning, there's multiple sections to this, a lot of things that could trigger some people, and a lot of information.

**Parents:** So when I was little, my parents broke up (they were never married). I was three when it happened, so you would think I''m used to it and everything. I live with my mom and see my dad every other weekend during school and every other week during the summer. Every other year, my mom gets me for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Those years, my dad has me for Easter and 4th of July. My mom gets me every Labor day and my dad every Memorial day, which Labor day gets tricky sometimes because my birthday is the beginning of September. The reason I mention all of this is because when I'm at my dads for more than the weekend (Friday-Sunday), I tend to be alone with my thoughts and I get homesick, I start feeling lonely, and then I have panic attacks. Its been like that for as long as I can remember. If I had to put an age to when it started, I would say maybe 7. I would always text my mom and she managed to calm me down after 2 hours. All she did was tell me to stop crying and calm down tho, which didn't help. My dad caught me having one once and he didn't help at all. I think he made it worse, actually. I don't really remember tho. I was 8 or 9 at the time. I never got used to the schedule with my dad, but I sadly got used to the panic attacks for a while. Luckily I gained more friends and I had somebody to make me not feel lonely anymore. (I should've probably mentioned this before, but I have no siblings. That's partially why I felt so lonely) I also had a really hard time getting used to having a step mother and 5 step siblings, which were all in their 20s at the time, so it was hard to talk to them. Looking back at it now, I should've realized something a long time ago. I'll get to that later tho.

**Family:**

 Every weekend that I'm home with my mom, I have what we call Sunday dinner at my grandparents house with my aunts, uncles, and cousins. I used to hate it for 3 reasons. First, the food was horrible unless my mom or grandma made it. Second, my uncle liked to harass us kids. He would drag us along the carpet, pinch us, throw us onto his shoulder like we were sacks of potatoes, pull our fingers, walk on us, etc. He always called us wimps and crybabies when we said it hurt. He still does it a little bit to this day, but because I was so young when he started doing this, I get so uncomfortable just being in the same room as him. I can't even look at him or say hi. My third reason was very hurtful. Up until I was 6, if one of us 4 kids got in trouble, then we all got punished. We got spanked a lot and/or time out with extremely hot sauce in our mouths. I remember gagging on the spoon one time and having bruises on me. At the time, I blamed my cousins for it because my mom told me it was. Now I hate Sunday dinner because my family always makes fun of me. Its always the things I'm insecure about too, like my weight, my body shape, my eating habits, and how I look. This is important.

I also went to my grandparents house while my mom was at work. It was scary at times because my grandparents fought a lot. I know its normal for couples to fight, but I thought it was going to go violent at times, which it did, but not in the way I expected. After my grandparents fought, my grandma would have a lot of anger built up inside her, so if I did one little thing wrong, she would yell at me, grab my arm, and slap me. She sometimes left bruises on my upper arm from it. My mom would talk to both of us once she got home. I could never talk well because I was crying so much, but I got in trouble not matter what happened. There were 2 times grandma got mad at me for absolutely no reason, like she snapped out of nowhere, and I still got yelled at from my mom and grounded afterwards. Sometimes my grandma getting mad like that caused my mom and I to fight, which also ended with me getting slapped except my mom went for my face. In 2019 though, 2 things had happened. I don't remember why my mom got mad at my this day, but I managed to escape from the fight as she grabbed my arm. her fingernail got caught in my arm and I now have a scar from it. A few months later, my bunny got stuck under the couch. I was freaking out because it was so hot and I was worried if I didn't get him out, he would have a heat stroke, but if I moved the couch too much, I would pinch him or something. I was having a really bad panic attack to the point where I was screaming and I could barely see or breathe. My grandma came over to help, but with me freaking out, she thought I was mad and yelling at her, which resulted in a fight. I tried to defend myself for once by pushing her away, but that made it worse. She then pushed me onto the floor next to the couch, sat on me with all of her weight pushing down on me, and punched me in the face. She then left and told my mom it was all my fault. She believed it until she called me, which I was hyperventilating and at that moment, I was extremely suicidal. It was the first time I had ever felt that way. It scared me. I got my bunny out from the couch, which holding him and knowing he was ok calmed me down so much. This was the only time I didn't get in trouble from a fight like that. Once school started up again, I started having flashbacks to both of those fights. Anytime somebody yelled or raised their voice, even if it was just slightly, caused me to have horrible flashbacks and I became depressed and paralyzed with fear. And history class also made me have flashbacks with all the talk about war and abuse from slavery and stuff. I would hold in my feelings until I got home and then I cried in my room, sometimes I cried myself to sleep. My mom could hear me sometimes, but she just ignored me and didn't care at all. This is also important.

**Friends:** I had a group of friends that I had regularly hung out with, the majority of them were girls. One of them was changing a bit, which was fine and I accepted it. All she was doing was exploring social media for the first time. My mom didn't like that and she manipulated me into thinking she was going down a horrible path and was gonna do horrible things, like drugs or be abusive. I believed it and I was scared I was gonna lose a friend, so I talked to the rest of the group about it. Some didn't believe me, but a few did and tried to help like I did. After a few months, the whole thing stopped and our friend group went back to normal. I remember apologizing for this whole thing and I tried to move on from it, but the memory haunted me and it still kinda does. After that school year, I noticed they stopped inviting me to things as much as they used to, which I didn't think much of at first, but as the school year started, I was slowly left out more and more. I even felt left out being with them. This was after the whole thing with my mom and grandma, so I was having the flashbacks and everything. I also started to feel super depressed out of nowhere from time to time and I started getting way more anxious than normal. My eating also started changing that summer. I would eat a lot at once, but I hated it so much that I ate so little for a week, which wasn't good because i almost blacked out a few times. I also started exercising a lot to try and loose weight. This didn't stop and still hasn't. I started freaking out because all of this stuff was new to me. I had never dealt with it before and I didn't know how to deal with it. I started looking up things to try and figure it out. I found that some therapists recommended their patients use hair ties on their wrists to use if anxious or if they feel the need to hurt themselves. It wasn't the best coping method, but I thought I would try it since it was useful for 2 things I was dealing with. It was actually helping me. I felt bad for keeping it a secret from my friends, so I slowly started to open up about it. They didn't like that I was doing it, so they just grabbed my wrist very tightly, took it off of me, and cut it up right in front of me. It really hurt me and I told them this, but they did it the next time they saw it, except they laughed at me and expected me to be ok with it. In November, I got a new friend/crush. I really liked him and I didn't know why. I barely knew him and it didn't feel like a normal crush. I eventually got his phone number and we had day long conversations. We would start talking as soon as we woke up to the time we went to bed. I'm not exaggerating at all. The more we talked, I fell harder and harder for him. We had a lot in more common than I thought. I felt like I could trust him enough, so I opened up about my mental health, what I thought was wrong with me, and what had happened with my mom and grandma. He opened up to me about a few things too. Over Thanksgiving, I was at my dad's and I was the most anxious I had ever felt before. I talked to my crush about it and he managed to calm me down in 20-40 minutes. He told me that he had never hugged somebody outside of his family before, but he was willing to hug me once we went back to school. When we did, I was extremely happy. It didn't feel fake or emotionless like every other hug I had given or received. It felt real, safe, warm, and full of happiness. I had never felt that happy before ever. (Bonus, his jacket was super soft and he smelled amazing, which he still does). I remembered him saying he liked chocolate, and since he was feeling horrible the night before, I gave him a bag of chocolate with his name and a heart on it. I was nervous giving it to him, but luckily he didn't notice at first. A few days later, December 4th, he noticed it and asked me about it. I was gonna tell him that I liked him, but I chickened out and said it was just to cheer him up. A few minutes later, he told me that he was scared he would ruin our friendship, but he had to come clean and he confessed that he liked me. I told him I had lied about the heart and told him that I liked him too. He told me he had an oath to himself that he wouldn't date until high school. This really worried me at first, but he told me he was willing to break it for me. This day we became a couple. This is the happiest day of my life so far. For a while, my mental health was so much better. What I didn't know was that my boyfriend has seasonal depression, so the next month he was freaking out a lot. He scared me a few times because he was suicidal. I managed to talk him out of it. I was reading a book on mental health at the time, so we both sat down at one point and looked at it. I know self diagnosis is bad, but based off the book, he shows all the signs and symptoms for seasonal depression and separation anxiety. I showed 90-100% of the signs for general anxiety disorder, depression, and bulimia. We didn't want to self diagnose, so we kept it in mind. I tried opening up to my friends about what I had and finally I tried telling them about my mom and grandma, but they tried telling me that I was lying and trying to get attention. My boyfriend believed this for a little bit, but then he remembered Thanksgivng and apologized to me. Ever since December, my friends started making fun of me, but it got worse in January. At the very end of the month, my boyfriend and I made a very big decision for our relationship. We ended up uh.... losing our v cards. (I'm sorry if you don't understand that, but I don't feel comfortable wording it any other way on the internet.) We ended up talking about what if we were parents for a while, which my friends overheard things, put together a few things, and spread a rumor around school about me being a teen mom. It was horrible. Not only were they making fun of me, but random people I didn't know were calling me awful names. Now I need to explain something here. My mom didn't know about any of this until recently, so she accused me of ignoring my friends for no reason and my boyfriend being the rude and manipulative one just because I started spending more time with him. She started to limit my contact with him, which was super hard for me because I needed to talk to him about this stuff at the time and with how bad both of our mental healths were, I was paranoid that my bf was gonna hurt himself or worse. Luckily, we found a way to talk where my mom can't limit us. The whole situation with my friends got worse. They pulled me aside one day, which just happened to be a day where I hated that I woke up and had to exist, and they decided to tell me how awful of a friend I was for pulling away from them and how I supposively never apologized about the thing where I thought my friend was going down the wrong path. Because I was so depressed that day, I believed them. I truly thought that I was the bad one. I still can't stop thinking about this day. Once quarantine started where I live, I cut off all contact with these people I no longer call friends. As of today, I don't have any friends. At the beginning of quarantine, my boyfriend came over a couple times to check on me and to hang out for a bit. We had to do it when my mom wasn't home because we knew she wouldn't let him come anywhere near me. She still thinks he's horrible for me, even though he's not.We got in trouble the second time because his mom told my mom. My mom then blocked him on my phone and all of my social media apps, which I wasn't using anyways because of my former friends. I still have a way to talk to my boyfriend because we help each other. My mom was making me feel worse and my mental health extremely worse. She started making fun of my weight, how I eat, how I look, and how lonely I am. She's even calling me crazy because of my mental health. My mom caught me on a call with my bf once and she yelled at me for it. I then finally told her everything that had happened and how he saved me from doing awful things like hurting myself and how my former friends had been the ones that were manipulating me. I told her how much she's hurt me for so long and how much it has effected me. I told her she was abusing me and I would never forgive her for it. She tried telling me that she wasn't and that I wasn't hurt. With her yelling at me the way she was, I was scared she was gonna hurt me physically. She tried giving me a hug to make up for everything, but I was so frightened by her that I screamed at her to get away from me. When she finally left, I remembered that I was still on a call with my boyfriend. Since he heard everything, I easily talked to him about it and I calmed down thanks to him.

**What I need help with now:**

My mom has been talking about me behind my back, same things as normal, but she's also made me do things I didn't want to. I had major panic attacks over them and she called me a wimp and laughed at me. All the change that's happened lately has been getting to me. I've become extremely emotional and sensitive over everything. My boyfriend hasn't been talking to me as much, which was freaking me out. I was scared he was gonna leave me for no reason at all, so I accidentally became extremely clingy and kept trying to talk to him. I've only had bad things to talk about tho because of my mental health and everything happening. I've tried so hard to be positive, but it hasn't worked. I've stressed the both of us out over little things. I've had a lot of horrible thoughts too, telling me that I'm worthless, nobody loves me, I'll die alone, etc. Even though it hurts him, my boyfriend has put up with me. Last night was the final straw tho. I became extremely depressed and suicidal out of nowhere. I had the worst panic attack that I've ever had. This was the first time I had a sort of out of body experience. I could see myself rocking back and forth on my bed, bawling my eyes out, screaming, and hyperventilating. I felt like I was going insane. I started apologizing to my boyfriend for everything I felt I had done wrong, like force him to deal with me, vent to him, be so depressed, etc. I got close to cutting myself because it was that bad for me. He randomly left and went to bed at one point, which lead me to write a huge paragraph explaining how I was feeling, what I was scared of, etc. I cried myself to sleep. Unfortunately, I woke up and I still felt horrible. I couldn't understand how he loves me or puts up with me or why he cares anymore. He didn't answer me until noon, which by then I was freaking out and I thought he had committed and left me alone on earth. He told me we needed to talk. He actually came to reddit for advice. He told me what they suggested to him. He's taking a break from talking to me for a week. He's worried about my mental health and just like everybody told him, he told me I need to get professional help. He made me realize that he can't help me the way I need it. He will support me and help me cope, but if I truly want to be better, I need to talk to a therapist. I promised him I would try to get help this week while we aren't talking. I have a few problems tho. 1. I have major trust issues and I'm scared. I don't know where exactly to look. 2. I can't let my mom know. She doesn't believe I have mental issues, plus we don't have the money for it. 3. I would prefer free online therapy, but none of the ones I found were actually free or available 24/7. I can't find anything that will work for me. Can somebody please give me a good recommendation of any free online therapy for teens? I really need help and I don't know where to go or who to trust. If anybody is reading this, thank you for taking time to read this. I really appreciate it."
519,Does anyone else experience these symptoms?,"Since I was a child I’ve had obsessive thoughts and hypochondria, with anxiety. Then as I got older I also developed derealization. Lately I’ll have random crying spells, which involve a lot of sadness and turmoil for no reason. Does anyone else have random crying spells?"
520,I (18F) am an emotional wreck and my boyfriend (19M) isn't good at comforting,"I started making this for r/ relationships but the more I typed the more I realized its more mental health than r/ relationships can probably handle (sorry if that sounds mean I just mean that I'd probably get ""break up and get in therapy"" when therapy isn't an option T.T)

My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year now. He is a bit ignorant when it comes to comforting me. He truly tries his best of course and he has no experience with girls (he had a gf before me for a month and she was mean and not a girlfriend at all), however he says things that are a bit off. 

So I'm really going through it right now (as a lot of people are) and it's testing many relationships. My boyfriend and I don't live together and I don't need much physical attention for comfort but he is the type of person if he was sad he'd be perfectly fine with just a hug and he'll move on. However, as the title says, I'm very much emotionally unstable. As in I've been having many depressive episodes and just not very nice issues.

We are very open about our feelings and I used to be the type of person to bottle things up so now I make it a point to vent to him what I know he can handle (which is pretty much everything) and it's worked out great. The problem is that while he is supportive and makes it a point that he's there if I need him, that pretty much is all he says and does. 

He knows what I like and don't like so I would think he'd know how to comfort me (I very much enjoy deep discussions on things especially feelings but he's very I guess surface level when it comes to feelings) but he pretty much just says ""I'm so sorry babe I'm here if you need anything"" and it's kind of odd to me. I might seem like one of those annoying girls who says one thing but wants another (please call me out on my bs if you think that's happening) but I like to think he'd understand me by now but he just doesn't. I'll list some examples that I can think off to paint the picture better:

- when I was clearly very sad and needed some comforting words, I finished my vent and he said ""that must be horrible I'm so angry and sad for you"" I replied ""yeah"" expecting him to continue but the conversation just ended there and he didn't text me again till later (normally I wouldn't mind this because we normally don't text much throughout the day and have most of our conversations at night before we go to sleep, but I really needed words of comfort or a deep conversation at that moment and he just thought that was the end of it)

- earlier when I was feeling so low about my mindset and how I deal with things I said ""it's frustrating I don't know how to fix myself"" and he said ""we'll learn how to fix yourself eventually"" (I know he was implying ""we'll figure things out together"" but it was just worded so poorly and I had already told him how making my problems an ""us"" thing wasn't very comforting because these are types of problems I should fix kinda within myself. I know that sounds kinda mean but I just strongly feel like my mental and emotional problems aren't his responsibility to fix, they're mine, and if he felt like he was responsible for making me happy then his own mentality would go down the drain and I don't want that to happen.) 

- I've been very insecure and down about how I look, especially weight wise. I ended up not eating for a day because of it and I told him how I was so proud of doing that. I was secretly hoping he'd immediately get some kind of red flag and stop this mindset before it took off but because I used the word proud he said ""yay! I'm proud and happy for you! But please don't do that to yourself"" and I'm in such a place mentally where I can't even see the ""don't do that to yourself"" I just keep thinking ""he's proud of me. I should continue."" And it's taken its toll on me. (I know he was just trying to be supportive but I mean there are times to be supportive and not to be)

I know he does these things due to a lack of awareness and his own happy-go-lucky way of thinking, but some of the stuff he says is very much taken a wrong way. And it's like I understand what he truly means however my brain only runs with what he said literally or even didn't say. I'm not sure what to do. It's not his fault and I even understand his true meaning and I love him for how pure he is, but his comforting isn't very comforting it's just more confusing and sometimes hurtful.

Is there anything I can say or do to help him understand? Any article he can read to get more educated? If I told him ""I like being comforted by saying x"" then he'd only say ""x"" and it takes away the comforting feeling. I'm not sure what to do or what I can tell him. Should I show him this post? I'm just not sure. How can I help him learn to comfort me without me telling him step by step what to say and do?

I want to make it very clear I appreciate how much he cares for me and how much of a ""good boyfriend"" he wants to be and how he wants to make me happy so much, but I don't think he quite understands how I personally like to be comforted or even how his words can come across. I appreciate his meaning behind his words so much but when it worded so poorly it's hard for my unstable brain to take it as facts or his true meaning. I hope this all made sense.

Tl;dr when I vent my boyfriend can say things that are meant one way but sound a different way and mentally that's not okay because I only take things the bad way right now. How can I help him learn to comfort me without me telling him step by step what to say and do?"

522,Supposed to be sad,"I feel like I'm not supposed to be happy.
All my relationships end due to them not loving me any more. 
I was pregnant and miscarried."
523,What’s wrong with me? Saddens overwhelms me.,"
Let me (21F) start this off by saying that since high school I’ve always had pretty bad anxiety/depression, and for some reason as I’ve gotten older it’s only become more crippling. Lots of panic attacks and “unreasonable” freak outs about what may be considered minor situations to some. 

In the few months pre Covid-19 (December-February) I had done a lot of self growing, trying to figure out my triggers, how I can calm myself. And just being a overall more balanced person, being more self aware etc. I was finally feeling sure of myself and confident I could manage my own feelings/thoughts. 

But let me just say, Covid had propelled me so far into this mental health crisis and I literally do not know what to do. At the beginning of covid me and my boyfriend(30M) of a year and a half moved in together, we have a really good relationship and actually really like each other lol! We obviously have some up and downs like anyone but nothing major, and we were actually planning on getting engaged soon (b4 covid happened). At the beginning of this worldwide crisis, when everyone was told they have to self isolate/quarantine I was actually relieved because I had been working 60+ hour weeks and it was nice to have the “break”. 

Fast forward 2 months and I’m going CRAZY, like literally I cry for 50% of everyday. Every time a situation doesn’t go to plan or something goes wrong or whatever small inconvenience happens I just can’t keep it together. If I’m upset with my boyfriend over something I just start crying even if I don’t mean it! Even if I’m not sad just annoyed or frustrated or mad, I feel like I have no control. And then it makes every situation so much bigger and then I’m actually upset because I’m mad this huge issue now and now the vibe isn’t good and then I feel like I’ve ruined everything and then I feel like I’m spiralling. I just feel so down and I hate that I’m being this negative person, I hate that I ruin everything by freaking out or crying. I feel like I don’t even recognize myself, I hate that I’m being this person for my boyfriend, I love him and I don’t want him to resent me. He trys to be patient most of the time, and try’s to help, but it’s hard because my boyfriend is so normal, like I just feel so fucked up in the head compared to him. 

It sucks because I’m really trying to do everything I can to keep busy, I’ve picked up multiple hobbies, I cook all the time, I’m cleaning, going on walk starting projects etc. But I still end up feeling like this, I don’t remember the last time that I didn’t cry for a whole day. I’m so tired of this I can’t imagine how my boyfriend feels. 

I’m someone who I guess without realizing keeps myself busy because there’s too much going on in my head that hurts I guess?? And now without things to keep my busy I’m just feeling everything so deeply. I just think about anything and it spirals into 100 other things and I just can’t fix it I’m ruining everything I just need help. 

I know I should go to therapy, but I haven’t had any luck with phone therapy in the past and I need to wait to find a new one in my city. Just any thoughts or any positive outlooks or suggestions please give them too me. I’m just tired of feeling so sad. 

tl;dr since covid start I can’t stop feeling overwhelmingly sad, I cry every day for hours. I know it’s hard on my boyfriend I just need help."

525,"I don't know how to start this, but I have depression and ADHD and who knows what else. I'm really just venting because I've never posted here before.","I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but I've never been diagnosed with anything else because I don't go to the doctor. I know I have depression because it runs in my family. My mother and grandmother have it so I've seen both the anger and darkness close up, so I know what I'm feeling when j go through it. I'm relatively self aware so I know what I'm feeling when I feel my moods fluctuate (I feel like I'm bipolar too but idk because I don't go to the fucking doctor). I'm really just trying to say that I don't talk about this shit with anyone, I have one person I used to really trust about it, but I feel so disconnected from people lately. 

Dude idk, sometimes I really feel like I'm so deep down in my hole no rope will reach me, but I've also been here so long with no cries for help that I've gotten used to it. I have suicidal thoughts, but I just think about them. How peaceful and easy it would be. I think about how it would affect everyone close to me, but I know I won't do it because I know it would only help me. I'll be 21M in a month and a father in November, and I want to get myself on the path to fully mentally healthy and stable, mostly. And the first step is conversation, I guess.  Idk, if you can't think of anything to say, don't sweat it. I'm just another human in a sea of 7 billion people."
526,I am really struggling with my mental health right now. I don't know what to do.,"Without going into overwhelming detail, over the past 2 years my fiance broke up with me, a pet of mine died, I almost became homeless after my abusive parents threw me out of their home one night, and I had to remove my only IRL friends from my life because they were extremely toxic and treating me terribly.

I have my own apartment now and I am working - even able to work remotely right now which is good. But my mental health is struggling a lot right now.

It's hard to describe what I am feeling. The closest I can describe the feeling as, is being burnt out and fed up with people as a whole. I've been treated horribly by friends and family alike. I feel very alone, especially in these current times. Ive tried reaching out and making friends, but I've struggled immensely with any kind of long term socialization. I'm constantly flip-flopping between ""people treat me like garbage. I dont want to talk to anyone ever again"" to ""i'm so extremely lonely. I want to talk to someone but nobody will talk to me for more than a few minutes"". It's been such an extreme internal turmoil that it fucks with my entire day sometimes. It makes me feel like I'm never going to be able to meet anyone ever again - both platonically and romantically - and that I am going to be alone for the rest of my life.

I know seeing a therapist is going to be recommended, but I really dont want to. Before the current world events I saw 2 different therapists, who didnt work out for me. And talking about this stuff IRL to people I don't know beforehand is extremely uncomfortable for me, I had a really hard time opening up to therapists. I just dont think I could do it again."
527,Seratonin vs dopamine with depression: question about my 34M bf,"My beloved boyfriend is on fluoxetine (SSRI) for depression from his primary care physician and has been for some time. I also have struggled with anxiety and depression for years and have found great success with Cymbalta but the way he describes his depression is very different from what I have experienced and what I typically hear and read about depression. I was wondering if anyone has encountered or experienced depression that sounds like how he experiences it, and if you’ve been able to find successful treatment (since the SSRIs so far haven’t been very successful).

We are intending to see a dr about this! Just wanted to get any experiences first hand. 

The way he describes his depression is much more in not experiencing much of the emotional reward in the ups in daily life. He doesn’t feel satisfaction in success, work, in being in love, in sexuality. He describes it as missing “the gold star” feeling, almost like anhedonia. He’s generally mostly optimistic in outlook and works incredibly hard, but has a very hard time finding joy in life. He lacks concentration and motivation and feels his memory is bad. Sexually and romantically, he wants it but doesn’t feel the warm and satisfied feeling even though we have a great relationship. He says he’s constantly searching for some sort of stimulation to make him feel something, and often does so in food even when not hungry. 

Any ideas? I’m wondering if Wellbutrin or a dopamine balance drug might be better."
528,why am i(f17) embarrassed to talk about my emotions/struggles with my friends/family/boyfriend? i honestly just need someone to talk to but i feel like i get so annoying so i just shut up and kinda hold everything in.,"sorry if this is everywhere...i just need to vent :( 

right now, i don’t feel right. i just don’t feel like myself. i feel lost. i want to find myself so badly but i feel like i honestly have no personality because i always change myself depending on the people i’m around. i’m afraid to be myself around certain people but then again, who am i? 

i understand my friends and boyfriend care about me and my mental health &amp; well-being but i feel like they don’t really understand me :/ i appreciate everything they do for me and i love them so dearly but i just feel like i expect more out of them when they try to help me? maybe i’m too sensitive? why do i expect so much from others and get disappointed even though i am fully aware they might not help as much as i want them to? i just want someone to understand me and i feel like i don’t really receive that from my friends (which i fully understand bc i’m sure they don’t deal with some stuff i discuss). 

every time i try to discuss my mental health with my family i always get shut down. “it’s all in your head”, “you’re only 17, you have nothing to worry about”, “you aren’t even an adult yet, how are you suppose to face the real world if you can’t handle this?”. and so on. “there’s no reason for you to feel anxious, you have nothing to worry about”. 

instead of a “just try to get over it” from my friends i’d rather get a “hey i understand ____ but maybe do _____ and maybe that’ll help”. am i expecting too much from them?? is this why i hold my emotions back instead of talking about how i feel now? 

also i was really happy earlier and felt great, but now i’m crying for no reason? or maybe there is a reason but i have no idea what it is? or maybe it’s 11 things that are all jumbled together and are creating a massive wave of emotional distress for me??? 

one of my best friends just broke up with her boyfriend and she’s someone i talk to about my issues sometimes and i really want to talk to her but i feel like she has her own issues to deal with so i feel like it would be incredibly selfish for me to just pour my problems over her’s. 

with my boyfriend, from what i know at least, he’s always had a very loving and supportive family/parents who support, care about him, apologize to him, show him affection, etc. so i kinda feel like he doesn’t know exactly how i’m feeling whenever my mom curses at me without apologizing or how it is to have only one parent. and to have issues with that one parent. when i was at his house his dad apologized to him after making a bit of a rude comment on something. his dad came up to him and apologized to his face and hugged him and i don’t mean to sound like a fucking bitch/selfish but like??? that sounds so nice and heavenly to have your own parent apologize for their wrong actions and even have them hug you afterwards!!! :(( and i feel like maybe that’s why i’m so clingy but i get super sad easily when i notice the slightest bit of change in someone’s actions or tone of voice?? 

anyway, i feel like everyday i’m always crying about something to my friends and it must be so fucking annoying for them :/ i feel so bad. i just wish i wasn’t always bothering my friends or boyfriends with my problems. i feel like it just be a chore for them. lately i’ve just been holding everything back so i don’t annoy them. i feel like every time i have something wrong come up my friends are thinking “wow again?”. :( 

TLDR???: i feel annoying/selfish to talk about my mental health to my friends/boyfriend/family."

530,Where can I vent?,"I was once a happy, outgoing little ray of sunshine. Then my life took a turn, very early on, and I underwent some of the most horrendous abuse you can imagine. It went on for several years (and to my young mind it felt like an eternity.) I spent my childhood and adolescent constantly angry and constantly repressing it. In addition to the abuse, my abuser kept me isolated and silent. I had no one to turn to no one to trust (in fact was bullied and abused at school too) When the abuse ended in my teen years. The anger ebbed into a depression. That depression turned to suicidal ideation/attempt and substance abuse. That started another miserable cycle which led to further worsening my mental condition. Everything spiraled downward until it reached its peak (or whatever the downward equivalent would be) and I was deeply entrenched in hard drugs, multiple suicide attempts, and anxiety and paranoia so bad I couldn’t stand to be around ANY human beings. I’ve made progress this year, by the grace of my higher power, and am taking serious steps to find happiness and peace. The main thing I need, I believe, is somewhere to vent. I can’t go to a therapist in light of the tragic outbreak, and the stuff on my chest is heavy so I don’t want to burden someone who would be uncomfortable, doing it out of a feeling of obligation, or going through something of their own. However, if I ignore my own needs nothing good will come out of it in the long run. So if there’s some sort of resource or Anything that can help me I would be forever grateful."
531,Happiness is all that matters in life...,"&gt;*“Life will never be the same, nor fate. The darkness will go one day. And the moon will arise with all its glory. To fill the world with love &amp; peace. There will be struggle, as it is a part of life, but, not for success but for happiness. The time will tell you what to do next. Your destiny still stands afar. All you need to do is to choose your path to move ahead. Stay true to your heart. Stay true to your soul. The heart will guide you to the path you behold.”*

In this raging pandemic situation, Job loss is getting common day by day. Due to the financial crisis, people are having panic attacks and suffering from anxieties. This is my miniature attempt to give hope to those disturbed minds and say them, *""You can do it.""*

532,i(f17) feel like i’m in a fucking loop and i just want it to stop :(,"sorry for posting again but i’m so fucking drained of feeling like this. 

i feel like every fucking night i just lay in my bed and cry. i cry about the small things, i cry about the big things. i don’t tell anyone because i don’t wanna be a burden to people. 

i feel like this happens so often that i’m in this loop. i wish i could escape it. i feel so hopeless every fucking time this happens. but i’m also extremely confused because earlier today i was feeling absolutely fantastic and i was so happy but once again here i am laying on my bed at 11pm silently sobbing about everything i can possibly sob about. what the actual fuck. 

TLDR: i feel like i’m in a fucking loop, consistently crying at least every night, i just want it to stop. i don’t bother my friends when i feel this way so i’m not a burden to them."
533,Research Project,"Hello,

I’m a student of Clinical Psychology and I’m conducting a study under supervision of my professor on the impact of Covid-19 across different age groups. 

We are exploring the thought processes of our community during these troubled times. It’s very important to understand how individuals in different phases of their lives are perceiving the pandemic, and drawing a comparison of this sort would help us in understanding how we could help each of the age groups to cope with uncertainty better. 

We would be grateful if you would spare out a few minutes to take this survey research. 

Please feel free to pass it around in your family and friend circle too. Anybody above the age of 12 may take this survey.

534,Am I insane?,"So I little about myself before I explain what just happened. I'm gonna cut to the chase, I've made peace for the most part with my trauma.

My father left me when I was young and my mother abused me my whole childhood until I tried to kill her and was admitted and then later taken by a relative.
My father overdosed on drugs when I was 14. I was diagnosed bipolar 3 which most doctors believe is environmental bipolar disorder brought on by your surroundings. It is not accepted in the medical field as a real diagnosis.

So lately I've noticed when I have manic episodes and low depressive episodes. 

I have a dark interests in gore and horror, and as I was sitting in my room with my roommates, I watched a movie called stutter island. This movie made me dissociate from reality.

I had no idea who I was, I didn't know my roommates, I didn't know what day, month or year it was. I looked in th mirror and didn't recognize myself.

My roommates noticed and asked me what was wrong and I asked them what their names were and they helped me ground myself to where, who, and why I was here.

It was a scary feeling and I'm still shook, what do you think could have brought this episode on and what do you think it could be? 

Am I losing it? Have I been stuck here in the governments grasps for too long?  Is my life real? 

No I'm not high, I'm just asking for help and advice."
535,Looking for resources to get through a trauma,"I have a traumatic sexual experience in my childhood that has been affecting me my entire life and I have been ignoring it. With nothing to do in lock down it has become impossible to do so. I need help. But I can go talk to anybody. 
Are there any specific resources where I could make a call or send a email and have someone get back to me for free. I don’t know what else to do. I’m tired of loving like this."
536,How to get over the fact that you can't stay around your mother for ever...," 

I'm a 24 year old guy, have an extremely strong bond with my mother, I feel like she basically spent her whole life raising me, protecting me from an abusive father, sacrificing her youth and all of her time and money to raise me to be the best man she could raise, and I'm at a point in life where I'm realizing what she had to go through to raise me. I can't stay around her for ever. I need to live my own life, but whenever I go out, stay at work for a couple of days without coming back home, I feel this huge guilt, I know that she basically has nothing to do during this time, she has no friends, no hobby, she's a tired women, she just spends the time watching TV series

Our relationship has reached a very damaging state, I can't live my life the way I'm supposed to, I can't move out, she's always in my mind despite the fact that she never actually asked me to stay, she is getting old, and she'll increasingly need more help and support, and I'll increasingly need more freedom as well, and I feel like it's my responsibility to be next to her to hopefully pay her back a tiny fraction of what she had to spend...

Sorry if I can't make a clear point but just felt like writing this somewhere...Any advice would be appreciated!"
537,Putting my kids in a bad place,"So a few days ago my mother and father wanted to go for a ride, my kids cried to go (4yr &amp; 6yr) with them to get out the house. My fiance and I agreed thinking they would stay in town(live in a small town). Before they left I told my parents don't let them out the car on the account of this dam pandemic. They come home and maybe 20 minutes later my mom says ""Yeah they wanted to touch everything and play the games""... Finding out they let my kids into a travel center 45 miles away with no mask. I get mad and tell my mom 'why the hell are you letting them out?!'. She gives me a look and go back to her room. 15 mins pass I'm on my bed with my fiance and 2 month old he starts yelling at me saying I have mental problems because I won't let them do anything. I'm thinking to myself You can but without my kids... He gets louder and closer to my face and I hate when people do that, few people got in my face and didn't end well. My mind snapped and pushed back almost into a tv stand and them he starts yelling more and more. My 4yr &amp; 6yr old hear him and start crying because they are scared. He continues to tell me I'm crazy for because I got mad at my mom and not letting him have his freedom yada yada...they had my fucking kids go into a busy travel center and expect me not to mad and cause a scene. They are my kids!! Then my father says ""go ahead and hit me! I'll put you in jail!"" ..with all my strength...I didn't. I looked and seen my kids crying holding onto their mom... I hate how some people aren't on the same page as you and want to be safe from all this. This pandemic has takin a toll on my mental health and I can't imagine how I'll be trying to fix that after this blows over. I just got my medical card approved (which my father didn't care as long as it is legit) but can't get anything yet. Not to mention my inlaw not doing the same. We got into it and he ends up saying ' it's not cancer it's not gonna kill you' ..I'm thinking how fucking retarded is he comparing this pandemic to cancer. Anywho, I really need help coping with this,my family and worry about my kids safety because the other people in the household don't give a dam. We tried moving out but the places we want we have to make 3× the rent income and just can't afford what they want..Lord help my family overcome this. I just want to not stress as much........"
538,How to feel guilty again?,"Last time I felt true guilty I was 11. I kept a secret in from my parents that I have never told. What that is doesn't matter. But the guilt from doing what I did left. And from that guilt leaving almost all of it left. I live a very secretive lifestyle towards my parents. I hide many things about me from them. I want to feel guilty again because I don't want to live knowing that I may be unfortunately a sociopath from being born into a situation I didn't choose to be. Being a sociopath comes with being ridiculed by the world, knowing that no one can ever trust me and me knowing that, and never feeling guilty. Something that we as human beings need. Something that I know I need. I don't know what I'm going to do if I can't get it back. I really want to be in a relationship some day but if I can't be mentally right ever, what's the point? Only if I had guilt. I wouldn't feel like such a bad person..."
539,i have no self worth without him (sexual assault TW),"Tonight my friend finally convinced me to leave my abusive boyfriend. I loved him so much I still do. But for the long time I was with him a lot of the things he said about me were terrible and degrading. He made me ask him to go to the bathroom, text back family and friends, open instagram, eat, watch tv, and more. He only addressed me by my 3 names bitch, hoe, and slut. If we couldn't see each other in person he would make me do sexual things on face time. A lot of it was painful or disgusting. What drew the line is that he said next time I saw him he was going to rape me. And I told him no. He yelled at me and just told me shut the fuck up you wouldn't tell anyone so I don't care. The time before him I already had a terrible self esteem. Once I got together with him things only got worse. Anytime I tried to leave before I couldn't he would convince me to stay. But now that it's over for real I'm not sure what to do. I lost all my friends because of him except for 1. I don't know my next move or what to do next. Any advice?"
540,.....,I feel like only music and my one true friend are getting me through times rn. I haven’t been the greatest mentally lately but my friend has always been there for me and I constantly tell her thank you. Music is always helpful too and I feel like that’s all there is to life anymore.
541,My semester ends in a few days and my potential failing of two classes makes me feel like I'll lose it,"I just failed one of my finals, and looking at my scores in that class and others, I may end up with 1 or 2 failed courses. I go to a CC and this will drastically affect my prospects during transfer, I think. I just got my grade back and I feel that sort of numbness right before I crack. Does anyone else know what that feels like? 

My stubborn self deserves this, I believe. Time and time again, my psychiatrist, my therapist, and my parents told me to take fewer classes to transition into college well and I didn't listen because I wanted to finish in no more than 2 years, and then transfer. The course that is expected unless you have class issues or something. 

I think it's best to push through these last few days. I feel like I have to hold it in until then or else I'll just break now and fail everything. Admissions offices won't care about the person who didn't transition to online well if there are others that transitioned flawlessly and got a high GPA. I am not one of those people."
542,I often think about killing myself and fantasising killing other people.,I am stuck with clinical depression (aka major depressive disorder) with no seeable cure. I’ve been through every drug possible and every therapy’s and even hospital with no change. It has worsened over time and all the drugs I have taken have now numbed me to the point that all my anger is now how I express myself and it’s ruined me. They said I may also have borderline personality disorder on top of it all. I have dreams about killing my self and others and don’t feel much. I believe I’m dangerous. (AMA)
543,Emptiness and anxiety,"Hi guys, this is my first post in this subreddit. I have been feeling real down recently. Not sure if this has been made worse due to the lockdown. I feel restless and can’t seem to bring myself to get productive after work. I also can’t seem to stop comparing myself with my colleagues and have been feeling inferior when things go wrong even though they are beyond my control. I am also super sensitive to the comments they make even though I am not sure if they are targeted towards me. Things like this really get me down bad. I am really finding it hard to stay positive and really wanna know what is up with me and want to find ways to stop feeling like trash. What can I do to feel better? :("
544,Does it ever go back to normal?,"For those who suffered from anxiety and/or depression and have recovered from it, how is it like? I went back to my childhoom home recently and while going through my old things, I realized how happy and productive I used to be. I really wish to be that way again, but after suffering from depression for about 7 years now, I don't know if that's even possible. So what do you think? Is it possible or do I have to accept that things aren't gonna be the same anymore, even if I recover?"
545,Depression and anxiety,"I've suffered from depression for years. I'm 21 now, so 8 years now. Its on and off. It's back again. I'm not sure why I'm posting this. Everyone has anxiety and I know that. I don't say how I feel about things because I don't like to be a burden on people or stress them out. I just dont know how to beat it and why it keeps coming back. I can be as optimistic as possible and the depression still comes back. And then i stop eating. I used to not even get out of bed, but I have responsibilities now, such as animals. But if I could just curl up in bed and never leave I would. I dont know what's wrong with me.

I'm not sure if I'm asking for advice, but I live in the United States. So if ya got any advice, ill take it."
546,Feeling numbness and blahs. But also libido has sky rocket lately?,"I don't need a diagnosed, I just need to vent. Advice is welcome though. I feel numb and emotionless, especially at night. Lately I am also much more irritable and easily angered. Oddly enough, my sex drive has returned after a year of not having any. Weird, I know. It makes me feel dirty and sad after masturbating, but it doesn't stop me from doing it again. I don't have anyone right now and I crave being in a relationship. 
I feel like my life is slipping away, even though I'm only 23(f). I feel like I need to hurry up and find someone. I want a family. I want to get out and do stuff and meet someone. This virus has triggered depression and I feel trapped. 
I'm done venting, thank you for listening. :) If you have similar feelings, I'd love to hear how you're coping. I need help coping."
547,I'm extremely toxic to myself and I don't know how to fix it.,"This has been happening for 15 years, but now it seems to just have taken over entirely. I'm a 32F with no real ""high school education"", no college degree, no training skills, no family/kids etc. I constantly compare myself to others and actively hope I can drag someone down with me if they don't have everything together like me. I analyze people hoping to find they're just as unaccomplished as i am. I've even built up resentment towards others over it and that's not fair to them. 

I'm insanely hard on myself. If someone messes up I just say that it's ok and things happen. If *I* mess up, i spend half the day dwelling on it ""*way to go stupid*"". I set unreasonable standards for myself and then wonder why I'm not good enough. I don't try new things anymore because I want to get it right the first time and I don't allow myself to just be ok with making a mistake. When you already have no talent or passions it just makes this 1000x worse. 

I'm starting to see a therapist and I'm bringing this up in our next session. I want to work on it outside of therapt, but being stuck in this for so long I'm not sure I know how to."
548,Looking for guidance.,"I (28M) have been struggling mentally, with my mood, and socially since a teenager. It comes on typically in waves for lack of a better word. About a year ago I tried therapy for the first time and lasted 4 sessions before I stopped going. Other than that, this is the sum of my experience with mental health professionals. There is some disorders that seem to match up with my experiences, and I guess I’m finally at the point where living like this for the rest of my life is not sustainable without being proactive on my part, as everything from friends, my job, to people I love suffer... I believe a diagnosis is in order. In short the guidance I’m looking for is who to see? A therapist, psychiatrist, or psychologist. Of course any other suggestions are appreciated. My first plan of action was to schedule an appointment with my PCP as a physical is in order anyway and inform him of what’s going on and that I’d like to take action.

On a side note, this is my first time on this sub and it’s overwhelming how many post are on here. Stay strong everyone, you got this."

550,I've been suffering from health anxiety (hypochondria) and it's the most severe anxiety I've ever had. On Friday I had my assessment to start CBT.,"Hi, this is something that I haven't really spoken about outside my family but I finally wanted to. Right before lockdown started here in the UK, I had a temperature for about 4/5 days. With everything that's going on I naturally decided it was best to keep an eye on my symptoms to ensure they didnt worsen and that I didnt develop a cough. My temperature went away but I was now into the habit of body scanning. 

Initially, I'd be focusing on every single breath in and out and I wouldn't move for hours for fear that if I did my chest would tighten or I'd shift then start coughing. These things didnt happen of course but I couldnt convince myself that it wasn't a risk. Eventually I was able to breath without thinking about it but still became focused on the feeling of my chest/throat, any slight tickle or remote discomfort I'd chug water in the hopes it would go away and I became hysterical if it didnt go away. 

It's at the point now where I'm having panic attacks and meltdowns about 3-4 times a day. Each time my mum has to rationalise the way I'm feeling and tell me that I'm ok, that I'm not sick. She become that best and deescalating the situation but it's becoming a lot for her to handle. That's why I reached out for help 

I self referred myself online through my local NHS mental health website and had a phone call on friday for an assessment to start CBT. Theres anwaiting list of about 2 months, so this is something I am going to have to keep fighting with until then. 

I just wanted to put what I've been going through out there in case anybody else has been through something similar and can find solace in the fact they aren't alone. 

Also sorry done all this on my phone so sorry for any spelling errors."
551,Hi I’m not good with titles but like—judge my sanity?,"Hello humans (and other creatures if you identify as such)! 

I need to know that I’m not going insane. Lol.

This has been going on since around last summer. For context, I’m around 17—adolescence is a mess, I know. :) 

I keep alternating between these states. I go from one where I am incredibly excited about the future, making an impact, and just living in general. 

It’s akin to suddenly being able to see life in full color and breathing it in and getting high off it, so that, wow, I want to do a thousand things at once, my creativity and motivation are in full swing and nothing can stop me. It’s chaotic but unmistakably happy. And God, I get loud, annoying, and speak even faster than usual (a bit like being drunk but with energy ig?) 

Then, I’m normal for a few days. Aaand, boom, I’m agitated and swiftly pacing around my room in circles for hours because there’s this nervous energy inside of me that I can’t tame. 

Then I’m insecure out of the blue and crying for absolutely no reason or completely deflated in a nihilistic dream state where life no longer holds meaning. I’m disconnecting from humans and all my responsibilities because I can’t find the energy to care, and if I do living starts to feel like a chore that I’m better off without. 

When I need to find a way to snap out of it or feel like I need some form of punishment for my “lack of worth” I end up (I’m not quite proud of this don’t judge, ahh) cutting. It feels good and sometimes manages to make me feel more alive.  Black coffee becomes a necessity, too. 

I’ve been trying to ignore the problem. I mean it’s fine; it’s manageable. Sure, my grades went down, and I would be a lot more productive if I wasn’t so unstable, but I’m still alive. And, yeah, it would help if I had a cohesive perspective on life and could settle between “OMG, LIFE IS GREAT” and “life is meaningless let’s just die.”

I guess my real question is, woah, is adolescence really that wild, or do I need to get my shit together?

552,help idk,"i dont wanna be a self diagnoser or anything like that but i have seriously noticed that i have little motivation to do anything and dont enjoy the things i used to enjoy as much as i used to. I am under eating for some reason (about one meal a day + boredom eating) and i cant sleep at all. i also find myself just laying on my bed all day or moping around the house aimlessly. another thing that happens is fidgeting a lot or moving my legs around a lot. relationships with friends are a little difficult, i find us arguing everyday. i thought it might be depression or something like that but i just dont cry. can you be depressed without crying much? thanks, if anyone has any idea on what should i do or any diagnostics please let me know and comment."
553,Where to start,"I honestly have no idea where to start so let’s get into it. FYI this will be a mess and just one big rant that’s gonna go all over the place. I’m honestly just so tired and confused with everything. My best friend committed suicide November of 2019 with absolutely no signs or warnings and everything’s just going down hill. I’ve struggled with a lot of bad thoughts for years but man did that put the cherry on top. So many people reached out to me saying they were there for me and yet a month later I’m laying on my bedroom floor drunk trying to call anybody just to talk to nobody picks up. I cannot talk to my parents about this because I could not physically bring myself to do it. They have struggled enough in life and don’t need to learn that their oldest kid is completely out of reach mentally. They are two amazing parents but I want nothing to do with them.. or anyone in that matter. At the same time though it pains me to see people and friends hanging out with eachother while I sit in my room for days on end without making contact with anyone. Sure I have friends. I have a lot of friends. But as soon as I try to get ahold of anybody their suddenly busy. And I mean sure it’s a good excuse if your actually busy but how can that be true when your posting yourself at a party at the exact same time, literally inviting people to come out but when I ask if I can stop by it’s an immediate “sorry we can’t have anybody else over.” The only time I step foot outside my house is to go to work which I can’t stand my job. I used to love writing music but it’s a chore to pick up my guitar now. I just graduated Highschool so I can’t even hold a conversation with an adult or my parents without hearing “so what’s the plan?” I don’t have a plan nor do I want one. I wish I could fade away from all of this. I wish I could just completely disappear from this area and go somewhere else without being remembered so that way all those people who pretended to care wouldn’t get the satisfaction of getting attention for fake missing/mourning me and so that way the few people who do care wouldn’t be in pain. I think of myself as a caring person. I’d be there for anyone in a heartbeat and I’d take a bullet for a stranger that I pass on the sidewalk, it’s just how I’ve been raised I guess or I feel like that’s what makes a good person, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to be there for myself. I’m considered funny by almost anyone who knows me but if only they knew all of those jokes were just brief moments I make for myself to numb the numbness that I’m already feeling if that makes any sense. I saw therapists when my friend died and they did nothing for me. They just told me what I expected to hear. So if a professional can’t even help me than who can. It also doesn’t help that I have pretty bad ADHD/ADD, yes it’s diagnosed and anybody who ever met me can easily tell, so anytime I get remotely interested in something it consumes my entire week and then I suddenly get bored of it and I realize I just waste my time. I don’t know where any of this lack of motivation came from I mean sure I dealt with “bullies” when I was younger but it was nothing bad. The worst was maybe getting back into a corner in the bathroom at school once and getting made fun of for my Tourette’s, once again yes I’m diagnosed, I don’t mind people making fun of me for my ticks. I do it more than anyone. I genuinely find it to be hilarious and maybe being made fun of for it first helped with that. But who knows maybe those slight altercations ruined parts of me. I never minded the fact that I got picked on when I was younger. I mean I get it, I was a weirder kid back then and I can’t blame people for teasing me. It’s just nature and I feel like it did toughen me up quite a bit. Even though I kind of thank those kids for giving me that opportunity to toughen up I still absolutely hate them to this day, small town and they still live in the same area. I could go in for longer and longer but I’ve probably bored everyone already and if you actually managed to read this catastrophe then congratulations because I surely couldn’t read all of that in one sitting. I’m honestly not even sure what I’m expecting out of this but I guess I’ll have to see what someone has to say. Thanks for your time."
554,Can't eat,"Never had any problems with weight, food and always had a healthy mediterranean diet, even eating a lot one could say. My bf left me last week and my stomach has since closed. I thought it would last a day or two at most but it's almost the 4th day and I'm forcing myself to eat. I'd say I eat 1/8 of what i ate before, and I'm always on the verge of throwing up, after  meals and the rest of the day too.
Is it normal? What can i do?"
555,I’m done,"Growing up in a first gen, former soviet Russian household was always going to be tough.. to keep it short.

M23 living @ home w/parents, taking time off from Uni since I couldn’t finish it “the normal 4year way”. It sucks since I never knew how to get thru college being a first gen student. It’s even worse asking for help from mom since her advice is always tied w/ scripture and I’m tired of hearing that from her. TBH that’s not even the tip of the dysfunction in my fam (PM if you wanna bother hearing the whole saga) im just tired of not getting the mental support I need but I’m afraid of asking parents since their answer is sitting down with a pastor from a church I know longer associate with. How do I even begin to start healing myself and moving on.."
556,"I am living at home, struggling with my mental health and relationship to family","I'll try to keep this simple, I feel like there is so much going on in my mind it's hard to sort it out. I recently (4 months ago) came home from living overseas. My mom said I could come stay with her. My sister lives here too with her two kids part time. I've always felt like I haven't had much of a relationship with my mom because she was emotionally unavailable for much of my younger years. Especially while I was going through the most difficult period of my life. Part of me knows she wasn't given the tools to be the parent I needed her to be but another part of me still holds a lot of resentment for it. When I came home there wasn't any space cleared up for me. My old room and the guest bedroom was filled with storage and stuff from Christmas. I felt hurt but didn't say anything. When I first got home I wanted to help out with getting rid of all the stuff in the house. Help clear out. I was very motivated at first. That died down. Then covid became more of a thing and my mental health has seriously deteriorated. I also feel like I've reverted back to being a teenager. I don't feel like I do enough around the house but I also don't think about it or don't have the energy to do anything most of the time.
Long story short, I have a mixture of guilt and resentment that's been brewing in my mind, but I don't feel like I can properly open up to my mother about it."
557,i wish i could support my long distance gf(f 18)when i’m 10000 miles away from her,"my girlfriend is the most important thing to me and we’re coming on a year of dating, when we were together it was the best our mental health ever was. she lives in a very non accepting country (we’re a gay couple), so i can’t visit her since i’m in uni etc etc, she can’t even move back to her home country right now because her country is kinda just shit with handling that and overall bad for her mental health. i think it’ll get better once she moves out, but i don’t know how to support her from where i am. she’s struggled with the worse for someone who only spreads love and kindest to this world. she’s dealing with eating disorders, severe depression, extreme panic attacks and overall she’s a very anxious gal. we call every night and i do everything i can to stay with her and be with her, she doesn’t like to tell me everything going on since she doesn’t want to put it on me, i want to listen to all her problems and thoughts but in some aspects, she’s right that i can’t give her advice or be there to hold her while she’s crying. i can only listen to her and tell her my thoughts, but she needs someone there for her. her family is the main cause of those issues, i don’t know how to help her when she’s at her worst ):"
558,Currently experiencing constant anxiety along with a tightness in the chest. Is it serious?,"When I wake up, when I sleep, take a shower, eat... Its like im experiencing a mild panic attack that lasts 24/7. Is this serious? I've had anxiety problems my entire life but I've learned how to manage with it (getting rid of social media etc). Has anyone experienced something similar? How do you handle it?"
559,Trapped,"I feel like my mind is enslaved by a TV show which I shall not name. The thing is I have grew up with the TV show and therefore there is an emotional attachment. However I am now considerably more grown up and more mature but I am still attached to this show. Each day I feel empty if I do not rewatch some episodes of the show, but if I do decide to rewatch I just keep digging myself a rabbit hole full of bittersweet nostalgia. There is also a sense of disappointment of the TV show not being real, where I wish I could live in the universe of the TV show but I have to keep reminding myself that it is not real. It is so distracting that I think about it first thing when I wake up as well as lowering my productivity. Thinking about it could be loneliness from quarantine, but how do I cope with this in a healthy and mature manner?"
560,How reliable are the online self depressions tests?,I just took a few online self depressions tests and want to know how reliable they are.
561,I want to be passionate about things,"For a very very long time, I don't remember since when, I can't be  passionate about anything. Everything that's a bit fun kind of dies within a few days and it very difficult to do. People around me do great things with their lives and their talents, get really passionate about their hobbies while I struggle to eat more than twice a day  because I lost the joy of it. Everything feels so empty and I wasted my entire life. I feel like life just passes me by and I don't know what to  do. Should I force myself to enjoy things harder? Is there any point in  living if I can't like doing things? I don't know what to do anymore."
562,"My lifelong struggle with mental health, and unable to find treatment.","I am a 35 / M who lived in Los Angeles, and recently decided to move to Canada with the support of some family that helped me get here after a failed relationship, and picking up an arcane christian ideology while communing with an ethiopian family and pastor in inglewood. While in LA I tried to get mental health support but perhaps I never could communicate my issues to psychiatrists and doctors or they just seemed like they didn't have a solution, I am not sure what to do, people around me would often say I have something wrong with me, and I would often self sabotage my friendships and relationships to the point people would end contact with me, including some doctors because of how i would talk on the phone.  


Without getting into too much of my life story here are some of my personal diagnosis;

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest struggle is my thoughts and dreams,

when trying to communicate this issue to a doctor in a single sitting, they prescribed me a psychiatric drug for schizophrenia, and after reading the side effects and what it was generally prescribed for I did not want to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

In my day to day life, my issues are motivation, depression, lack of energy, video game addiction, 

easily frustrated and angered over communication with others.  My house is always a mess, I procrastinate extremely, and rarely finish anything I start, I feel hopeless in the world, and would often seek for relationships to help, but I am so homely and ""boring"" that I would never do anything unless I am dragged around with someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for Disability but they couldn't find any reason to approve me, but I really didn't think they invested enough time talking to me to come up with a diagnosis.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the few drugs I had taken nearly 10 years ago was adderall, and I liked that it helped me to ""get things done"" as well as loose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I have many food allergies  and struggle with my diet and Energy Levels, Motivation, Routine, Discomfort, Lack of Feeling of Control, Denationalization""  Hunger Cravings, No sense of feeling full, not feeling present, no self control""  obesity, skin rashes, nasal congestion, food allergies""   
 

My friendships and relationships are a  Catastrophe , and I just want to reach some level of my potential, in regards to business, employment, wealth, and friendships and family.

And at least be able to live in the world comfortably and take care of myself at a level that is socially acceptable. 

When acquaintances see my life or my home, they often say "" how does anyone live like this"" 

  
I've seen many doctors but could never find a solution, my family that I haven't spent much of the last 15 years with, consonantly says ""get on medication, call this mental health number ect, but they don't realize those things will never come to a solution especially if they take such a lazy approach in it to help me, as well as they think it's just ""how I act"" and nothing is wrong with me except for that one thing, they think I can just grow out of it or snap out of it, and often think that ""getting a job"" is going to magically fix my problems, I grew up in an abusive home as it was.. I dunno

564,eating disorders,"it all started eight months ago when i started my new job at a fast food restaurant. previously, i had been working at a daycare. and during this time, i had just graduated high school and no longer played sports. i started putting on some weight, especially after sitting most of the day and not getting much physical activity. i weighed myself a couple weeks before i started my new job, 170 lbs. 

i had worked fast food before, but not for a long while and the constant running around took a little adjusting to. i didn’t get to eat as much as i was used to, so i started eating less and less. by this time, i had started putting off some weight. a lot of people noticed. my friends, family and co workers. they said “wow, you’ve lost weight” “you look so good”... this motivated me. 

at first my reason for not eating was the fact that i had no appetite. i never had that hunger in the pit of my stomach unless i didn’t eat for very long periods of time. but hearing people say these nice things and actually getting compliments for once really made me feel good. i rarely ate. i ate my break food and that’s all i would have for the day. i pushed it to the side, said i was “starving myself”. i made jokes when people asked why i wasn’t eating most of my break food. 

on thursday, while at work, i began to feel sick. i was out of it. couldn’t concentrate, my arms and legs were numb, my hands were shaking and i had the worst headache i’ve ever had. i got sent home and looked up my symptoms. i found out i was malnourished and that i had low blood pressure. thinking about what i had eaten throughout the week, it probably only added up to about 1000 calories. 

this is when i realized that i’m developing a problem. i no longer avoid eating because i’m not hungry, i avoid eating because i want to be skinnier. because i “need to lose 10 more pounds”

ever since then, i’ve been having an even harder time with eating. when i smell or look at food i gag. i don’t want to eat in front of people anymore. and when i do eat, i feel completely disgusted with myself. i’ve barely talked to anyone about this issue. when i do all i hear from them is “just eat”. they don’t understand that it’s not that easy.

i guess my question here is, should i go see a therapist or doctor about this? am i developing an eating disorder? what can i do to stop what’s happening? i am welcoming any advice or stories you may have. i want to go see someone, but not unless i absolutely have a problem because i don’t have money to just spend. 

i now weigh 130 pounds. and it is just now gradually getting worse. i’m not sure what to do."
565,The common cliché DV (domestic violence) in Social Media,"idk if this belongs here but Social medis does affect ur mental health to a great extend. agreed?

Is it just me or videos across social media particularly about domestic abuse are just horribly depicted. Its either MoM gEtTiNg hiT bY aBuSIvE dRunK dAd n the child dealing with it, or its just emotional/ sexual/grooming abuse . Physical abuse is just not relatable. So it made me feel like this is something that people dont care about n i just felt so ALONE main reason being my dad didnt drink (or alteast thats what i have been told).

Also the people in the internet being all like ""oH diSciPLinIng oUR cHilD Is nOT a fOrM Of aBusE, i gREw uP iN tHat hOusE SurrOUndINg n i Will uSe tHis pAreNTinG ON mY chILd""/ ""iTS aMerIcaN cULtuRE tO bE rESpeCTfuL oF ur chiLd, gIViNG thEM peRsonAl sPAce n sHIt n in oTHer CULTUREs itS COmPLeteLy fIne to hiT ur chiLD tO dEAth cuZ i bROugHT iT inTO thiS woRLd heNcE MINE"" BS

Resently i watched a video named ""Young Bae Confronts Her Abusive Dad"" or somethong along those lines n i was a lil confusion by the way she acted n MAYBE just maybe they were milking her (the victim?) for views JUST MY OPINION im just saying.

Most of the other YT rant story time videos out there are just someone lunging at the camera cussing out their past Abuser n its just not something i should watch UKWIM i found reddit where people share their sories n i feel like im in a safe community, a safe space to be with each other to uplift people n not be judged by anyone. The video said before(young bae one) felt like they were making her look bad with those dramatic soundeffects n edits. It just felt insulting to watch in a way, like we are some mentally sick freaks n we dont know how to act or something uk, like people won't edit their videos with execive filters n edits n make it ""entertaining"" just for youtube when it comes to people losing someone, greiving, or when they talk about depression n other mental illnesses.

I personally have dippresion, Anxiety, PTST issues. I dont feel weird talking about that in someones comment section cuz YTbers do a good job in letting people know that its ok to have a mental disorder n we'll get through that but theres no such with DV n i feel weird watching these videos in particular.I get it its hard to talk about a few things but we dont need those cringe a&amp;&amp; ""awARd wiNing bAd aCTing aWarenEss sHort fiLms "" about DV thats not helping anyone lets be honest, we already have enough of that.

Any of you guys feel the same or is it just me"
566,Why do i hate myself so much?,"Hi im new to this I'll do my best to be clear From a young age, as early as i can remember i have had a strong disdain of myself. A good amount of self doubt, shame, guilt and i would say a feeling of dislike or maybe unapproval just emenated from the thought of myself to the point where i started to think of myself maybe as a slightly seperate person i don't know it's hard to explain. But when faced with questions like what i was going to be i would only be able to think of bad things like i would think at age maybe 7 or 8 when asked about my future that i wouldn't finish school anyway id probably be dead or a shut in loser living in a basement when thinking about what i would turn out to be i thought there's no way id be able to live with myself beyond that point and that it would all end. These feelings have always stayed with me. My short sighted view of the world ruined my life i was careless i didn't think about the future i didn't really know i had one because at the same time all i ever wanted for myself was destruction these feelings over the years have amplified as i am now living the life i predicted as a child. I am a pathetic waste of human life that lives with my parents and off again with shit jobs. Not to say people that have a similar life have it bad it's all about how you look at it and your perspective i get that but my perspective is warped as i have developed my inner critic into a voice of violence and hatred. Im always berating myself with insults and hatred but a couple times a week or sometimes only a couple times a month my brain and my emotions go into a strange state of frustration and guilt over me doing this to myself and generally getting in my own way and i end up saying terrifying violent things to myself asking for mental torture self destruction mutilation the eradication of my existence the torture and slow death of my soul and body basically the worst things humanly or maybe not even humanly imaginable. I've thought about trying to end it all for a long time almost tried but didn't i was too scared and i don't think i could have gone through with it anyway too scared i guess. Now given all this info you might think im a rude or depressing person to be around on the contrary im in the workplace or as far as my reputation goes im described and i behave as i very upbeat and positive person a big smile on my face and as far as how i feel about other people i love other people i love knowing about peoples passions getting to know and meet new friend's or spending time with family what im trying to say is i don't think im harmful as i never think anything violent or strange about anyone else and never really have. and ive talked to several people about things not exactly giving the whole story but a lot of it ive heard things like suggestions to get some kind of help but i can't afford any and have no idea where to go for help i don't even know what the problem is or what this means or even if thats normal or if im just being a wimp or overdramatic do real men just suck it up? I don't understand."
567,What to do about physical anxiety symptoms?,"Every inch of my body is in agony. My head, shoulders, entire back (especially my lower back), legs, feet, and even my toes ache. I’m constantly shaking and when I get a panic attack it looks like I’m having a seizure."
568,Understanding how different people perceive mental health issues as,[removed]
569,I can't take it any more,"I suffer from depression. I'm suicidal. If I just stop paying attention and just zone out for a bit, my immediate thought is either blowing my brains out or my crush. The only person I've ever told about this is a very close friend. I told her after it got so bad I was cutting myself every night. I've stopped doing that. For a bit I relaxed and took my mind off things and got better. I almost felt happy again. The last time I felt happy was probably 2nd grade. My whole life has just been a shit-show. The internet practically raised me. Which took my life down a bad path. I started wanting to grow up faster. My life began being more sexualized. I started dressing like a slut ever since I could fit into forever 21. And I have to admit I still do. I don't really remember, but I think I was around 8 or 9. I was kinda chubby, so to make this better I just starved myself. I was happy with how skinny I got, but I nearly got anorexia. Thank the gods my family started to notice my loss in weight. I don't think they realized what i was doing, but I realized that I needed to stop. So I did. I started to gain weight again, I was a growing girl. So I tried starving myself again, but now guess what, I'm an over eater. One day I'm shoving cake down my throat to try and feel happiness again, and then next day i'm vomiting it all up for the same reason. Then once I got older I realized there is another way to be happy, maybe. I had moved and stared attending a new school. I don't mean to brag but after moving there I felt like Aphrodite among a bunch of Hephaestus's. And so guys started falling at my feet. I became instantly popular and I was dating a total hottie. I have to admit I felt, *happy.* I felt like the queen of the world. I felt like Regina George or Heather Chandler. I thought my life was gonna be perfect. Then the guy I was dating broke up with me. He was actually the school player. I started losing ""friends"". I lost my reputation. They made me their Regina George. And then in the blink of an eye they compare me to trash. Do you know what that does to mess up someones head? It's like putting on a bandage, then your wound finally starts to heal a little bit. But when you realizes it's started to heal, and you rip it off at the speed of light. My dads been deployed before, I still have emotional trauma from that. And I have more fucking issues from what those snobby little private school shits did to me! They don't know what it's like to sometimes not know if you'll eat dinner! The only reason I was in that private school is because of a government scholarship. My dad works for the foreign service. Those arrogant little fucks have left a scar on my life! If it even last any longer. As I said before all I think about is blowing my fucking brains out. Those little rich cunts don't know what it's like to crying with fresh cuts and a noose around your neck. ALL I WANT IS HAPPINESS. I DON'T WANT MONEY. I DON'T WANT FAME. I WANT TO FEEL HAPPY. CAN'T THE WORLD JUST ACCEPT PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY ARE. DO YOU THINK I WANT TO BE STARVING MYSELF. I STARVED MYSELF SO I CAN LOOK GOOD FOR THEM. WHEN IS IT EVER FOR ME. IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THEM. I'M ALWAYS THE ONE WHO'S WALKING OFF THE SIDE OF THE PATH WHEN WITH FRIENDS. I TIRED OF GOOGLING ""*how to be happy*"" JUST TO RECEIVE SOME CHEESY LITTLE BUZZFEED ARTICLE TELLING ME TO ENJOY LIFE. DON'T THEY THINK I'VE TRIED THAT? All I want in my life, is happiness, love, and affection. I would give up everything for that. I kill anyone for that. I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR THAT. My life plan is to do as much in life as I can till I reach 21. I'm gonna get famous, rich, and live the american dream. Sure I wont be happy with my life, but oh well. You are probably wondering what happens when I turn 22. I'm gonna get a gun, some wine, Doritos, Skyrim and the newest play-station console, and some mtn dew and starbucks. Then I'd go to Oahu (my place of birth), climb a mountain, and just stare at the stars from the top of the mountain. Then I'd write a detailed suicide note and blow my brains out. But that's if I can take life until 21. I don expect y'all to upvote. I just want a friend. I want someone to talk to who will listen. I have friends, but not one like that. All I want in life is happiness, love, and friends. Is that to much to ask for?"
570,Sunlight,"I have usually worked night shift my whole life because I was making a little more money doing so. I recently went back to school full time. I have been training myself to sleep at night now, and its amazing how much a little bit of sunlight can change your life."
571,Overwhelmed and Blacking Out,"I’ve had this issue for a long time and don’t know if it’s common with mental health, or if I’m just not expressing my concerns coherently to my doctor. Unfortunately, it’s been getting worse as I age.

If I become overwhelmed with my thoughts or my surroundings, I black out, sometimes even shake, vomit and pass out. 

First example: I can’t go to fireworks shows or concerts anymore because the lights and loud noises will cause me to pass out and sometimes vomit. 

Second example: if I become anxious over a situation and am unable to calm myself down, I feel as if I am drunk; slurred speech, difficulty walking, vision loss, eventually black out. My partner and friends who have witnessed these episodes say I shake uncontrollably and become an unresponsive dead weight. 

*TL;DR* My mental health has been impacting me physically  and I’m uncertain if this is common."
572,Recurring dreams making me think crazy things,"I had a traumatic childhood due to a dysfunctional family... an abusive sibling and narcissistic parent. 

One night I was talking to my crush on the computer (I was maybe 10 years old) and my sibling became enraged.

After then I stopped talking to my crush and pretended not to like him. He liked me back but eventually moved on. 

We had eachother on Facebook as teens but it never went anywhere. When I added him he asked ‘why did you add me?’

I haven’t seen him since I was a kid but I always have recurring dreams of needing to tell him I’m sorry for everything - cutting him off specifically. 

The dreams have changed as I’ve gone to therapy and progressed (like me being able to connect with him) but as an adult now I’ve started thinking in my waking life of sending him an email. 

I even look him up online and he’s engaged (I’m also in a relationship).

Two of my therapists have said he represents the child in me, and one of them has said if our in-session work didn’t satisfy me then I could reach out to him as we’re both adults now. 


Why is this happening?

Am I totally deranged for wanting to write him an email and say sorry for something that happened at least a decade ago?

It’s making me even more depressed and grieving. I don’t tell my partner because he wouldn’t understand without feeling jealous"

575,I [M15] have over-time developed a habit of doing things equally and its now burnt into my subconsciousness,"First of all. I don't know if this is the nost appropriate sub to post on, so any recommendations will be helpful.. And also please excuse me for my bad english and grammer. Thank you

I would like to keep this post short since this is not harming me in any way but it is affecting my consciousness.

Over the years I have developed a habit of doing things in a 'symmetrical' or 'equal' way. For example : If I bump my right toe into something I would deliberately bump my left toe as well in the same way but with much less force; This also applies when I touch something with my left hand and feel it and its texture, I would also want to feel it with my right hand as well; Also applies to cracking my knuckles; or doing any physical activity... If I am unable to do this, I start feeling highly uneasy and will do it some time or the other even if my conscious is unable to react to it.. This has inevitably been burnt into my subconsciousness.

I don't know how to express it in words and therefore this was my best attempt at it.. I also know that this might not be a big problem but it bugs me to say the least. I also don't know if any of you reading have/had the same problem.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank You for reading"
576,I don’t know where to go from here,"So during this whole quarantine thing, I’m slowly slipping deeper and deeper into some of my darker thoughts. I don’t know why I keep ending up feeling this way, I just need to get it out there somewhere where someone will listen. I’ve always felt useless or like something that can be easily thrown away. Trash basically. All of my relationships, whether it be like friends or family,I always feel like the back-up or the regrettable replacement. In my head, I keep telling myself, ""They probably wanted a better friend in place of me but they were probably too busy” or hell, even my family I feel like just something that they didn’t want but ended up being stuck with. Hell, I feel like a secondary character in my own story (if that makes any sense). I know it’s a self-anxiety issue or something, but because this whole quarantine thing has no end in sight for now, it’s slowly eating away at me from the inside out. I feel like I’m just going to break soon, I don’t know I wish I could restart life and just be not a fucking unhappy loser nobody. Sorry for all this negativity, I don’t know who to tell this to, who better than the people of the internet right."
577,Dreams on Benzodiazepines,"Always when im going to sleep on benzodiazepines I have pretty positive dreams. Last night I dreamed about a ex friend who I actually dont like anymore and I'm not friends with her anymore, but in the dream we were talking to each other like nothing happend.

There was a story between my friends and me and after that we chose to go different ways, actually we just aborded the contact and no one contacted me anymore or I them. So this hurt me a lot and its still hurting me to lose all my friends and no one of them is concerned about me, this is going on for a year now. 

I never remember dreams in sober state about them, during the day I sometimes miss them still, but always when I fall asleep on benzodiazepines I dream about one of them and we're doing things together like nothing happend. After the first time this happend I woke up pretty happy.

Can someone tell my why I always, really always when I take benzodiazepines I dream about my ""fake"" friends? I call them fake friends because they just left me without anything and never contacted me again.
Is this normal for this medicine?

If someone wants to know detailed storys about the dream or what happened just ask in the comments."

Thanks."
579,Family keep bothering me,"I currently take medication for diagnosed severe anxiety and depression. This mainly comes because of a mix of my family and a emotionally abusive first boss in a job i stuck at too long.

I have Been in and out of therapy regarding this issue and it has always come back to the fact my dad is emotionally abusive to me through my childhood up to the current day. 

To my issue. So 5 years ago my parents bought me and my wife a house to live in near them and my sister, which at the time seemed a great idea as I wasnt under therapy or realized what they do isnt normal. It wasnt till I moved out into this place I realised how controlling and emotionally abusive my parents and sister are. Ie knowing my schedule so if I went out early to work or came in late after some overtime my phone was full of messages asking where I was and what I was doing. I had to take my spare key back off my sister as she was coming in the house and my wife was asleep from her night shift and searching around. For example we had some trying to conceive tablets ontop of the kitchen shelves (quite high up) and she found them and suddenly everyone knew about it which upset me, she even came in and used our electric supply when we wernt in and when we got a big bill she refused to pay her part and my parents supported this and regularly jibe at me ""thanks alot, shes using our electric now, should be yours"" despite the fact she indeed has her own electric supply in her own home.

She also has a habit of monitoring my Facebook messenger online or the WhatsApp last seen feature to see when I'm online or awake.

She currently has a daughter who I cant see or get a proper relationship with because her and my dad have trained a fear of dogs into her and we have two dogs and anyone who knows me knows I love dogs and always have. It was Christmas 3 year ago and I saw them openly training fear of dogs Into her and I challenged it but they got back with well you shouldn't have dogs.

Shes pregnant again now and has no intention of working again. She only got a job last year because someone shipped her for benefit fraud which she had been doing with my dads advise on how to for years. Meanwhile myself and my wife both work full time and due to some biological factors we will struggle to have a child naturally and knowing this I struggle to fake happiness for her. Especially now every second word out here mouth is I can't do this or that because I'm pregnant etc.

I have recently transferred out of the pharmacy sector to work for a big energy company in a call centre which my family didn't approve of as it's not a proywwfession like the pharmacy technician I was qualified as. But again, I got into pharmacy because of a favour from my godfather to my dad and what eventually turned into 8 years of emotional abuse from my godfather and godmother who both owned when I worked and got alot of public humiliation, left out of company events, docking pay for no reason which obviously I told my parents about and they just shrugged their shoulders and continued to go out with them as if nothing was wrong.

To my final and most recent issue. After leaving my job with my abusive bosses I moved to a local pharmacy where for the first 18 months was the greatest experience of my working life, not just because I wasnt being emotionally abused, great owner, great manager, great staff, was always included, it was great.

Then our manager left and was replaced by a guy who was basically a bad manager, he had favourites. He emotionally abused those he didnt like, myself being one as the owner gave me alot of responsibility over the 18 months as i proved myself but he came in and tore it all down and started to bully me, using my mental health as a weapon and basically said if I wasnt in a good mood all the time I would get the worst jobs and a warning, queue two months on the sick end of last year start of this year. I didnt want to take the time off as I couldn't afford it but my gp and therapist said please do as I was borderline suicidal at this point, so having no option I went to my parents and asked them to loan me a months wages as that's what I worked out I needed and I agreed to pay them back when I was stable in a new job etc. 

So at the end of this period I got my job out of pharmacy finally and I felt great, got a month into my training at my new place and was great till this virus hit and I got furloughed for a couple of weeks whilst home working got set up. Which I'm grateful for dont get me wrong. But the issue was I was going to be short for my Bill's again by about £300 because of emergency tax and low pay due to not working a full month etc. So again seen as I could not sell anything or the like because of the virus I went for my only option which was ask my mam for another small loan which again I could pay her back separately later in the year. I refused to ask my dad again after what he was like last time I asked for money because of my mental health issues. So my mam agreed to leave it between us and that was that until the other day she emailed me from her work email saying that my dad had been rooting through her phone and personal banking details and found out about this and gone wild about me needing money again. She said in her work email to only contact her on it about this as he was monitoring her phone. 

To the last point, my sister regularly borrows money off them as well as forcing them to give her lifts everywhere etc (even pre-lockdown) and in 5 years since moving out this was the only two times I've had to ask whereas shes at Least twice a week.

Now today they (mam and sister) are ringing me non-stop and I just dont Want to talk to them anymore as I'm sick of the monitoring and double standards and pressure I get subjected to every time I interact with them.


I don't know where I was going with this. I just needed to get it off my chest. I don't know if I'm being a arsehole but everyone from friends to my therapist have said how fucked up the situation is"
580,I don't know what to do anymore,"I'm just tired of the constant bullshit life has thrown at me. The abuse, the bullying, the betrayal of friends, the abandonment, the eating disorders, the debilitating social anxiety, my grandma dying, my mom having cancer (terminal btw so we're just out here bidding our time) and now the possibility of my husband having a either an esophagus  disease or straight up cancer. We have no insurance, where do we even go from here? Either way we can't even do anything. He is the only one working for our family as I am too mentally handicapped to work a job. We dont qualify for state insurance and his job doesn't offer insurance we can afford either. I am terrified. And then this covid shit happens and I don't know what to do or where to go. I'm already struggling to live everyday but how could this happen? We're only in our early 20's. I can't deal with anymore cancer. I can't deal with not knowing where to go anymore.  Im so tired of this. There is no happiness for me, at least not long term. I just want him to be okay but he can't because we cant afford to be okay."
581,Why do I need music to function?,"So I was struggling to fall asleep, and I realised it was because I'd forgotten to start music on my phone after shutting off my pc, and I finally remembered to ask this question of, well, hopefully someone at least XD.

Other than going to sleep, I basically need to listen to (or play/hum) music pretty much constantly in order to actually get anything done, not that I'm always focused when I listen to music, just that I'm seemingly never focused without it. It's not like it's a specific genre for specific tasks, although sometimes I suppose that can help"
582,"My sensitive, gentle heart keeps getting hurt.","I often wonder if I'm just too sensitive and need to get used to not so nice people. I often tell myself that ""this is the real world"" and I just need to go along with it. I've been at a low point in my life recently and I'm struggling with how I should proceed. I want to be a social worker. I primarily want to work with children. I currently work with the homeless population and its hard to work in this setting at times. They are having their worst day, everyday. I can't expect them to be happy and giddy. However,  the smallest actions they make can often have a big impact on my feelings. Something stupid sometimes will hurt my feelings. Other than this, my coworkers aren't the nicest and random encounters have just really been bringing me down. For example, this car made an illegal U-turn as I was turning and one of us had to stop or we would collide. I stopped and politely waved and said go ahead with a smile on my face. My heart sank when she lifted her finger angrily and I saw her mouth word ""bitch"". I was so being so kind just for something like that to happen. She was in the wrong and I wasn't even mad. I hate how something like this got to me. I also hate how I feel the need to invalidate my feelings. I often hate the word sensitive. Why should I be ashamed on how I feel? Its who I am. I also know I'm not the only kind hearted person out there. Not everyone is unkind. I shouldn't conform myself to meet their standard. Why can't I just be myself without feeling like I'm not enough or weak? I wish I could embrace my kindness and run with it. Not hide it. I often have to tell myself ""don't talk to anyone at work to avoid getting hurt"". Why should I stop being who I am? Sorry if I'm making no sense. Just hope maybe someone can relate. I don't want to feel guilty or stupid for HOW I AM. Its just who I am."
583,Is it normal to watch movies that remind you of your own insecurities and / or nuerological conditions?,"I suffer from cotard delusion, and I've been watching a 90s movie called Jacob's Ladder over and over again during quarantine. I feel like watching it attenuates the effects of my conditions, but it's a super depressing movie, and it also makes me feel a bit sad when I watch it as well."
584,I messed up irreversibly,"I sought help after escaping an abusive relationship, accepted a referral to a cpn. In hindsight I would have been better venting online or seeking help through a womens charity. The cpn has ruined my life by exaggerating, misinterpreting and lying ultimately leading to a psychiatrist getting involved and diagnosing me with schizophrenia. I am now forced to take medication via cto as my disagreement with diagnosis and medication meant ""lack of insight."" I felt hopeful after leaving and now I accept I would have been better off staying.

 The medication has left me constantly anxious and nervous feeling, even left me feeling like I completely lost it at times. I'm a parent and feel I can't give as much to my children anymore the antipsychotic is numbing and made me apathetic. My cpn wrote I had thought broadcast and heard peoples thoughts, also that she thought I heard voices, although I only worried what others might think of me. Now I worry even more which I think proves it is anxiety. She was constantly asking me if I had psychotic symptoms which I always answered no, I wish I figured out why back then and wasn't so stupid to think she was there to help."
585,I self harmed yesterday,"I want to start this by saying that i am going to go into details, so if you are not in a place where you feel comfortable with the topic please don't continue reading.

I don't know what happend yesterday. I kind of dissociated that evening, but i know that i self harmed for the first time in a year and a half. Before the last time i had gone almost a year without doing it. I just don't understand why. I've wanted to do it so many times before but i managed to stop myself. Why couldn't i do it now? Nothing major has happend, last time was the first time i told someone about my sexual assault. That is a valid time to have a relapse. I've been doing well the past few weeks. Unusually well, i was feeling more like myself than i had felt in years. It's so frustrating beause how am i supposed to stop it in the future if i don't know why it happens. I guess i have pms but i've had pms plenty of times before without self harming. . . . . .

The thing is too that i do the soles of my feet. One of the things that has helped me the most with my mental health is running. I've essentially just self sabotaged my own mental health. Oh and of course old thinking patterns from my eating disorder has been flaring up and i'll probably relapse into that as well. Why not drugs and alcohol too? I really really really want to drink something or smoke something now to just numb myself out. 

I woke up depressed. I don't want to eat, cry, laugh or play the guitar, which is the thing i usually can always do regardless of how shit i feel i feel. I haven't felt like this in a while. I don't really know what to say about it. It all went downhill so fast. It might go up just as fast again but i don't feel like it will. I don't feel in control this time. I don't want to go through it all again. It took me years of daily struggle to get where i am now. I'm just so tired.

I'm trying to remember this quote from bojack, ""sometimes life's a bitch and then you keep living"". I might even get it tattooed."
586,Mu miserable life,"Hi I'm Darryl. I've had depression since I can remember and it has only gotten worse.

I was born and raised with an absent father and an abusive mother, but apparently that's normal for black kids. I was an accident and honestly I wish I was an abortion. My mom came to Belgium to study and was stuck here when she was expecting and so became an illegal immigrant. She was stuck here and every she lived in fear of getting deported.

She also wasn't the best of moms since every day she would scream and throw stuff at me for the smallest of inconveniences. At the age of 5 I started despising her and I even had to refrain myself from hurting her.

During elementary school things got even worse. She put such high expectations on me that I was demotivated to put in any effort. She even threw a knife at me foe getting a 7/10 in 1st grade. Because the importance she put in school I started to also despise that.

My grades in elementary school were always around top of the class, but things got more tough in secondary school. By then I had a stepdad and a 1 year old half brother. My stepdad wasn't as physically violent as my mom, but he was more verbal. Since he reminded me of her I despised him too. They would often have fights and the fact that my grades weren't too hot didn't help either. I rarely did my homework in elementary so getting so much in secondary made passing complicated.

It was also during this period that I developed sleep problems. I would fall asleep late at night and wake up early in the morning. My parents blamed it on video games, but I only started playing at night after I realised how long I was staying awake. Nevertheless, having something to do while falling asleep kept me from going crazy of not being able to do anything in the dark for hours.

At the age of 14 I failed my grade for the first time, which meant I had to spend more time in school. It was around that time that my parents noticed my lack of effort in school work and found out I was depressed. What they didn't know is that they were the cause of it. Being physically and verbally abused almost every day since the age of 4 and it took my mom 10 years to realize that maybe I didn't like that.

We had a fight the day before my brother's 4th birthday and for the first time in my life I hit my mom back. My stepdad was furious and started pushing my against every wall in my room. I didn't talk to them for weeks until they forced me to go on a family vacation.

As the years went by my grades kept getting worse and my stepdad kept getting more violent. One day after a barrage of insults from him I threatened to kill him. I figured that if my parents were gone I wouldn't have to deal with their abuse anymore and that I could rot away in jail peacefully, but he got pissed off and pinned me against the wall. Before he could hit me I punched him in the face and called the police.

I was so mad that they were on my parents side despite me acting in self defense. My stepdad told the officer that I was gonna kill him, which is true, but I refrained from doing so by dropping my weapon and saying it was useless.

Because of that incident I was abducted to an asylum and stayed there for weeks while there was school. I just told my friends I was sick.
Those 2 weeks were the worst of my life. After arriving in my room there I couldn't contain my anger and destroyed everything in my room. They called the police to carry to an isolation cell where they would attach me to a bed for 3 days straight.
After that whole situation I was sure that there is no place or tolerance for depressed people like me.

Everyone kept saying that ""everything will be better"" and ""there's people out there that want to help you"". The more heard those lies the more I was sure that they just don't care about mental health.
Every time I bring up my depression to a psychologist they assume that it's because I have low self esteem and not because of my abusing parents.

When I look up case of depression I mostly see people that think they're useless, but in my case I'm depressed because other people are useless and the fact nobody has or will ever acknowledge that keeps making my situation worse.

I am now 20. My parents have split up, my half brother is 8, I quit secondary school and I can't find a job. If there's still a possibility for me to enjoy life despite having the first 20 years of it wasted I'll gladly follow it, but right now all my paths are leading to a noose"
587,Lockdown+breakup+no motivation,"I've been feeling very depressed and unmotivated lately bc of the lockdown. I also have been going through a break up and not being able to go out having no distractions has made it worse

I'm also not that connected to my friends and have been feeling very alone. I know the activities which make me happy but I'm not being able to bring myself to do them. I feel very drained and low energy. I just feel like sleeping all the time

How can i motivate myself and how do i feel energetic again?"
588,I spent $300 on plant pots two days ago and it's eating me alive.,"I buy these beautiful terrazzo pots from a lady who makes them herself, I got about 8. These pots make me happy, as do plants. But man $300, it's just eating me. I usually don't have an issue with it because at least it's not spent on clothes whose novelty will wear off sooner rather than later, and plants and pots bring me joy. But I just feel so sick in the stomach that I did that."
589,Chew Toy,
590,I am 18F and no way to seek a therapist. I cannot tell my parents and hence don't know what to do," I feel like I need to see a therapist. I don't want to go into the details. I just want to know if something is wrong with me or not or if I am faking it. I try talking to close friends, people who have done therapy and whoever was willing to listen and was educated in the topic. Everyone has told me see a therapist. I don't know if I need to see one because again it could be fake, I could be making excuses. And primarily because my parents will not sponsor a therapist. 

 I just want to know if there is something wrong with me for sure and what it is if it exists."
591,"You are not lazy, losing interest in a loved activity could be a warning sign",
592,I (23M) feel empty and very low,"When I was younger, I was grown up with not talking about whatever bad I'm feeling because my parents always fought and had a very bad effect on me.

But after that I got a girlfriend (23F) she always said things like why don't you talk about things, why don't you speak and always said that me not talking about things is not good.

Slowly and gradually I changed myself, I now talk about anything and express all my feelings. But now she's like why are you so so emotional, why do you take things to your heart, why do you overthink, why are you so insecure. And told me that I shouldn't tell her anything that would distract her from studies. So know I have decided I'll just shut myself. But it's very hard. It's hard to not express things, because if I do, if I act emotional she would start fighting with me.

I'm tired. Literally tired. My friends are ignoring me. I think I loved her more than what is required that is why she is behaving that way.

This lockdown is also giving me anxiety. I don't feel well. I'm sad and low. I masturbate to get my daily dose of dopamine. I can't sleep at night, I sleep at 7 am in the morning. I need help from y'all because my own people are asking me not to talk about it. 

Please don't criticise me, I'm already down. Please don't talk about my post history, I know it's toxic."
593,Identifying Girlfriends episode(?)," Hello everyone, I'm looking for advise on the mental health of someone close to me, as I'm a bit at a loss of what to do.  Forgive me if I use terminonolgy that is incorrect, like 'episode', I have 0 knowledge on mental health.

  
  Backstory: Me &amp; girlfriend both mid 20's, we have been in a 3 year happy relationship living in the UK. Girlfriend has suffered traumatic events in the past, suffering panic attacks and has tried to kill her self – however since we've been in a relationship she's only had a few panic attacks and we are generally happy in life. 

  
  Last night my girlfriend and I enjoyed a drink indoors, she got pretty drunk but no biggy, however when we went to bed in the early hours, after about 5 minutes of her falling asleep she becomes very fidgety and keeps repeating that people are going to get her - this has happened before, usually she will have a panic attack and I can calm her down with breathing.   

This time was alot more intense, she began screaming so loud I thought the neighbours would call the police, I would calm her down a bit but she continued the screaming, and telling me they were going to get her, how she should kill herself, even things about daemons getting us, this went on for nearly 2 hours before I got her back into bed and she finally went to sleep. 

  
 She woke up today hungover, but in a pretty good mood, she said she couldn't remember the screaming and apologised but I'm not sure what to do next, she's always been reluctant to go to therapy again and doesn't seem to want to talk about it. 

  
 It's one of the scariest things I've ever had to experience, and with no knowledge of mental health issues I felt/feel really unsure what to do next. I love her to bits but I just don't know what to do. 

  
 Any advise on what this was (PTSD? Psychotic episode?)? How should I approach her about it? Do I speak to anyone else about it? 

 Thank you"
594,I have Intrusive thoughts and dreams about killing,"Sometimes I'll be chilling and all of the sudden think about how I could kill the person next to me, and sometime it's for my friends and family too, and sometimes they scare me a little and I'm pretty sure I don't have a mental health disorder and I don't have a bad life either but it just happens I just want help also I've been told that they're called 'Intrusive thoughts' is there anything I can do to fix this ?"
595,"I've been cutting for five years, but I'm not sure if it can be considered self-harm","I’m sorry if this is all over the place, I just need to know if anyone else can relate to this, so I don’t feel like I am completely insane.

I’ve been self-harming for five years now and yet I’m still not sure if you could really call it that. I only do it occasionally, on especially bad days when it just feels like I deserve it. When I first started doing it, I was in my senior year of high school and was afraid of going too deep or getting some kind of infection, so I would take one of those box cutter knives and just graze my wrist with it until it drew blood. I would only leave two or three marks that completely faded after a couple of days. I didn’t know self-harm could leave permanent scars.

It’s five years later and I still use a box cutter knife and don’t go as deep as other people probably do. I don’t have many scars and the few marks that stayed aren’t really visible. It’s never been my goal. To leave scars. 

When I tried to find reasons for why other people self-harmed, I couldn’t really relate to any of them. When I googled pictures of people’s scars, I was left horrified. Mine don’t look like that. All of that made me think that I’m just being dramatic when I think of what I do as self-harm. 

I don’t do it because I feel numb and want to feel something, I don’t do it to have control and I certainly don’t do it to gain attention. I cut to leave a mark, even if it only lasts for a few days and turns to an almost invisible scar. I cut so that the mark will remind me to stay quiet when everyone else is talking, because I don’t want to be annoying. I cut so that when a cute guy looks at me, I won’t think that it’s because I look nice and that it’s probably the opposite. It will remind me not to get my hopes up. When I think that I look good in an outfit or that my hair looks nice, the pain from the cut brushing against my sleeve will remind me that I think too highly of myself and should be more realistic.

I don’t cut all the time, because when the mark stops hurting and eventually fades, I still have that voice in my head that brings me down every time I start to feel happy again. I’ve always had it, it’s like a different person in my head whose only mission is to remind me how worthless I am. I tried to talk about it to my friends and ask if they have that too, but they just give me weird looks and shake their heads. Recently, the voice has gotten more present somehow and I just go saying “shut up” to myself multiple times a day. I don’t know if it’s just quarantine getting to me, or the fact that I’m supposed to graduate from a university in a month, but I feel like I’m going insane. Like the voice will just get worse and will never let me be happy.

And the only option that I have is not even an option, because I can’t do that to my family and friends.

I don't know if other people feel like that. Maybe I'm just taking self-pity to an extreme."
596,I made a dangerous impulsive mistake and I'm hurting my boyfriend,"Trigger warning: self harm. 21f. Diagnosed with adhd, depression, anxiety disorder, pcos, and suffers a lot from rejection sensitive dysporia. Everything was going so well. I had a good job. I made a good friend at work. I was so happy. But then my abusive father died. Immediately after, I lost my job due to corona and lost my health insurance. I need badly to go to therapy but I can't afford it. I didn't qualify for unemployment so my boyfriend is paying for literally everything right now. I feel so useless. This quarentene has made my mental health so much worse. All I do is lay in bed on my phone all day. The laundry I did a week ago is still sitting in the hamper. I'm forgetting to eat, forgetting to take my medicine, forgetting to shower. Three days ago I did something really stupid. When I'm having anxiety attacks, I make stupid impulsive decisions. I was crying in front of my boyfriend because I was overthinking and became convinced he was going to break up with me and started panicking. And he was being silent while I ranted to him. When he doesn't say anything it makes me really angry. So out of anger, I grabbed the nearest thing and I cut my thigh way deeper than I intended to. It was an accident. I didn't know the object I used was so sharp. When I saw the cut I was shocked at how deep it was and my first thought was the medical bill that I couldn't afford. My boyfriend started crying and got my blood all over him. He bandaged it up for me and it's been healing really well. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself for doing that to him. He knows I have an addiction to self harm but I'm worried seeing this is going to traumatize him. He seems fine, he's just being a caring boyfriend. Reminding me to take my meds and clean my wound. But he shouldn't have to do this. He deserves a girlfriend who's mentally well. I'm just a huge burden to him and it makes me feel so worthless. We've lived together for 2 years and been together for 4. He knew I was mentally ill when he first asked me out. He has yet to ever talk about leaving me. He loves me with his entire heart and takes care of me. And all I do is make life hard for him. I don't deserve him. I haven't had a bad breakdown like that since I was a teenager. Not being able to work is so hard for me. I wish I didn't have to live like this. I wish someone would tell me it's all okay and fix my brain. I wish the world wasn't such a shitty place. Might sound like I'm being a baby but I really wish I could be a child again and my mom would just hold me and tell me she's never going to let anything happen to me and she will protect me. Wish I was young so I didn't know about all the bad things that happen in the world. I wish I could wake up and this whole existence has been a dream and the world we actually live in is beautiful and perfect. If it weren't for my boyfriend I would've killed myself already and that scares me. I don't want to die, I just want to live a life where I feel like I actually have control of my own emotions. I just want to grab my brain and throw it out of my body. I'm sick of emotions. I'd rather feel nothing at all. I have adhd and I need to have a set schedule. I just have to. Or else this happens. Why does the world have to have horrible things like viruses that kill people and cause pain and suffering for no reason? It makes me sad that this is all there is to life. Just waking up every day trying to avoid pain. I want to have kids with my boyfriend someday but I'm most likely infertile and definitely not mentally stable enough. Barely scraped by getting my high school diploma because of my adhd. Was always working retail and menial jobs until my last job. I was so excited to get that job and it quickly all went to shit. Sorry I'm being such a bummer."
597,Does my wife have psychosis?,"Four years ago, my wife had a miscarriage at 8 weeks. We had already been trying to conceive without success for more than two years, and the miscarriage, while not unexpected due to the fact that the baby was growing too slowly and she was bleeding throughout the pregnancy, was devastating. Early the next year, we also had a failed  cycle of IVF.

However, in late 2017 by wife became pregnant again and in September 2018 she gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Our daughter is now 20 months old and doing great. But for my wife, the trauma of the miscarriage came back after she became pregnant for the second time. She felt that she was somehow at fault for the previous miscarriage and developed a terrible fear that the same thing would happen again. When she was pregnant, she imagined that our baby was suffering from various illnesses and genetic diseases and would not be born healthy.

After our daughter was born, my wife's condition seemed to stabilize. But when our daughter was two months old, my wife became convinced that our daughter was having seizures. Finally, after a number of hospital visits and tests, she was reassured that there were no seizures. But since then, she has a recurring dread that our daughter is sick. At various times, she has convinced herself that she has terrible illnesses such as skin cancer or Rett syndrome. She has also started to become anxious that I have bowel cancer or skin cancer or that she herself has breast cancer. On a number of occasions, this anxiety has got so bad that she has started to have hallucinations where she sees and hears a man talking to her. At first she says she knew this man was not real, but more recently she says she can't always tell. On one occasion, she was convinced that I had died even though she was talking to be at the time (she said she didn't know me and that her husband was dead). She has also run out of the house on several occasions. On a few occasions she left the house in the middle of the night and went to the bridge near our house and thought about jumping. Thankfully, she decided to come back home. I had no idea at all about this until she told me later.

She has been seeing a counselor and a psychologist. Her psychologist now thinks that she is suffering from psychosis, although he also says her symptoms are atypical. Although she has had hallucinations, these generally only occur when she has severe panic attacks. She often goes many weeks or even months without any episodes and can function normally and take care of herself and the baby without any problem most of the time. She can talk logically and rationally. To be it seems like she is functioning normally most of the time, but this normality is punctuated by very severe panic attacks.

The psychiatrist has now prescribed her medication for psychosis, but I am concerned that because her symptoms are atypical, he might have missed something. Could there be some other explanation for her symptoms? Would it be worth getting a second opinion? Thanks for the help!"
598,Would you classify me as insane?,"I tend to get extremely violent fantasies over people I actually don't dislike or hate. I've fantasized about killing all of my family, friends and girlfriends over the years. Nowadays, I have had a recurring thought of stabbing my father's throat in, or boiling him to death. Just the other week I compulsively started to picture torturing my Girlfriend (I couldn't help it; it was like it popped in out of the blue and was overwhelming) and started to let out a weird cackle that doesn't sound like me/my normal voice/laugh or personality. I don't plan on committing any of these acts and I doubt that I will, but they are very strong and cause me a lot of pain.

I also see demons in my sleep all the time, and sometimes if I lie awake I have vivid visions of brutal/evil looking demons and monsters that actually shock me (my heart has nearly felt like it would pop out of my chest, etc).

I don't take pride or comfort in being the way I am mentally, but I have no idea why it is that way or what I could do about it."
599,I feel like a very strange person.,"I do not know why, but I feel so strange. Like, I am a complete freak or something like that, and it's making me uncomfortable. My own head seems like a madhouse sometimes. And I am 21 years old, so this is seriously hurting my self-esteem. What should I do?"
600,I feel like Anxiety is back,"I had a spike of anxiety from april 19th to the 25th that was quite bad, lost weight, panic attacks daily, then I just became perfectly fine and stopped caring I guess.

601,Bad habit or not.,"For my whole life there have been times where I will, kind of leave- mentally go somewhere else. Essentially a story line/world in my head. I have been told this is a type of active dissociation, and is not healthy. When I stop doing it, or do it less my mental health declines. When I do it too much I get nothing done and feel horrible for ""being useless"". It works as almost a ""recharge"" from being around people too much. It is better than real life, and sometimes I feel not great when its over, other times I feel refreshed. Is it really such a bad thing if I can balance it?"
602,Anxiety From Guilt,"Hello guys I have been dealing with anxiety for about a week now. It is so bad I can’t even eat as my stomach is in a knot. I know where it comes from, I feel guilt and shame from something bad I did as a teen. Not something that will put me in prison forever, but still very bad. It was years ago and I thought I could move on. It would be days before I thought of it before I brushed it off and said, “Well I’m never doing that again” However, just recently something triggered it and now it consumes my every waking moment. The thought of knowing I will have to live with what I did before my life had even really begun is agonizing. I’ve prayed, I’m going to see a doctor soon but I can’t say tell them the real reason where my anxiety comes from out of embarrassment. I know I can’t go back and change what happened, but I want to forget. I know it’s selfish but I really wish the mind wiping technology you see in movies and stuff was real. I’ve thought about giving myself a head injury to cause amnesia too. I’m jealous of every person I see because I know they don’t go through this and I don’t know what to do anymore."
603,A sad little fraction of a life,"Hey

I'm 40F, and I just don't know what is wrong with me.  I'm hoping I might ring a bell for some people and maybe they can let me know how to help myself.

I'm diagnosed with bipolar II but there is something else that is wrong and I don't know what it is or how to help myself.  I've always found people difficult, even as a very very small child I struggled to understand people and found social situations distressing.  This has never really changed. I go through periods of being social and am generally successful when I do, but the majority of my life, and now, aside from work, I don't go out, I don't socialise, I don't have close friends.  I've never had a relationship.

Certain behaviours in other people I find nearly intolerable.  If people lie to me, or I observe that there are discrepancies between what people are saying and what I can observe to be true I can get really upset.  It has almost terminated really good friendships where they have lied to me and I really struggle with this behaviour in the workplace.  Once I understand that people are compulsive liars they have virtually no value to me at all as I can't trust anything they say.  And when people are illogical or inconsistent it throws me into confusion and annoyance.

If I can't understand the 'truth' of a situation, where it relates to another person I can become completely overwhelmed by compulsive thoughts running through the situation over and over.  I get completely obsessed and very distressed.

Social situations can be excruciating for me.  Sometimes I'll do really well, I pull out some sort of false super-confidence and am the life and soul of the party, but other times I can't stand it and will literally go and hide to get away from it.  Being out in public with people in crowded places have induced complete meltdowns before and the pressure of being with people all the time when on holiday means I haven't taken a holiday with another person for over 15 years.

I've spent my money on therapy, trying to change things but the talking can help where I'm distressed by a person, but has never changed how I feel about the world or how difficult I find it, and for the last 10 years, since I was diagnosed with bipolar my life has just been in constant decline.

Although I don't experience much distress about the situation,  I have this sad little fraction of a life and don't understand how to help myself.

If anyone can give advice on what the hell is wrong with me and/or what I can do about it please do...."
604,Breaking up with r/mentalhealth,"I've been a reader, poster, and commenter here for a few years on this account and for several years more under prior accounts. My whole story is a lot to cover, but I've been betrayed and hurt by every therapist I've seen. This includes privacy violations in two instances and unwanted physical touch in one instance (I was a kid, he was my shrink, he said he required hugs at the start and end of each meeting.)

So I think, given my past, it's understandable if I make a post asking for advice and noting that returning to therapy isn't an option for me right now. But whenever I do, I get some comments that fly directly against my stated wishes. And I find it's never things like ""Those therapists did wrong, try again and you'll find the right one."" It's always ""You didn't stick with it long enough"", ""You didn't put the work in"", ""Those examples aren't that bad"" and otherwise. I thought that this subreddit, of all places, would be understanding of folks who pursue improvement on their own, but even here it's rare that you can talk about bad experiences with therapists without getting lumped in with fools who think mental health isn't real or isnt important. 

I'm getting so much more use out of r/selfhelp, r/selfcarecharts, r/mindfulness, and even r/vent or r/msw, the degree I intend to get next. Journaling, goal setting, meditation, affirmations, exercise, mood tracking, and breathing exercises have all been of immediate use. Being trained in mental health first aid and keeping up with that certification has also helped me. These are the practices and skills I encourage for others in my daily life. I neither encourage or discourage therapy, I just don't talk about it. 

I think, also, that this subreddit is a large and kinda-negative place. Most posts are made by people in distress or in bad situations and if you read too many posts you run the risk of getting a biased, everyone-is-suffering viewpoint. You may be better served by finding more specific subs like r/madover30 or r/adultdepression. I myself mod and benefit from r/anxietysupporters since I want to support the anxious folks in my life. 

hey, if this sub helps you that's great, but I've been burned too many times by redditors here who insist their view is the only correct one, their advice the sole solution. What happened to the rule on the sidebar that says **""please show respect and empathy when replying to posts""?**

My healing ain't your healing, but I wish you all well. If anyone needs a sympathetic ear please PM me, but I'm finally unsubscribing and choosing the happier, free life."

610,"Same shit , same man.","Hello world.

I have been struggling with consistency all my life, repeating same mistakes over and over. I'm sure I have attempted to change that hundreds if not thousands of times.

I can't stay consistent even with the things that I get good at quickly.

For example sports, I do Martial Arts and I have fallen in love with BJJ, I joined the club around 4 years ago and I have been showing up to classes for about a year if you add up all the days together.

I do it for 2 -3 months and disappear  for 6 or 12 months, even though I do really well against people who have done it for years on years, I come in I out match higher belts and I'm gone again.

This isn't only with BJJ but everything I attempt to get good at, I get to a certain level where I'm amazed by how little practice I took  to get to where I am just to drop it,It's just killing me every time, I have wasted 2/3 of my life.

Same goes with friends and people, I leave relationships constantly, I have no friends, I haven't talked to anyone in over 6 months, I have disappointed people in every way possible.

I haven't had a girl in over 5 years even thought I had many opportunities, its the same, we meet up, we flirt, maybe kiss and I just vanish.

My first suicidal thoughts started to come in when I was around 12-13 years old and they have been part of my life ever since, I'm 27 now. 

I have finally went to psychiatrist, been on pills for about 6 months , it's been a relief in some way.

I became consistent for about 3 months and now I back to rock bottom, every time I fall it's becoming worse a little bit more. If I used to stop myself from ending my life because I worried about my parents now I'm caring less and less and my suicidal thoughts are becoming more clear cut.

I was diagnosed with mild to heavy depression and a bi- polar disorder a few months back.

I'm still trying, planning to move to another country maybe and start over with everything new but I don't know  there are few things I'd love to to go to university for either psychology or physical therapy but I can't even study it on my own, there are these cycles, the longest I have ever been consistent was 6 months , I had an intense routine containing of about 8 different things that I practiced, I felt amazing and then I fell again and its been almost 3 years since that time, I had a few good cycles of about 1-3 months in there.

I'm killing everything around and everyone around me.

614,Struggling to Determine Whether I have Body Dysmophia or if my Legs are Truly Fat?,"Hello,


For the majority of my life, I have disliked and even hated the appearance of my legs. What currently bothers me about them is that my calves have an ugly, bulky shape, and the width of my thigh right near the knee (and in general) is so big. It doesn't help that I have a thinner torso, waist, and arms. 


I've wondered if what I've been seeing is real for quite a while. I check my legs every day to see if they somehow magically got thinner (or my nightmare: got fatter). No matter what, regardless of mirror or lighting, my legs just look fat and naturally stick out to me. The reason I am wondering if I have body dysmophia (and am not actually fat legged) is two-fold. First, my parents and friends that hear my complaining always say my legs are skinny; idk if they are just trying to cajole me, but if anything their comments make me feel worse because now I'm fat and crazy.


The second reason for my questioning is because when I set up my phone in my room and take a video of me walking, for some reason my legs look amazing (on the verge of male runway model) which made me happy. I don't think my camera has any slimming properties. 



I'm pretty confident I have BDD, but I'm just confused why my brain only sees my legs as fat when I look in a mirror or reflection, but when I take a video recording, my brain sees me as skinny(ish)."

616,How do I (F17) cope with emotional burden after being the therapist of someone depressive ?,"First of all, for context : From 12-15 years old, I have essentially been unknowingly the ‘therapist’ for my older sister. 
When I was 12, my older sister (15-16) was majorly depressed. Our parents are religious so they were not very informed about mental health, this led to misunderstandings/fights between my sister and my parents. Essentially this meant that she could only confide with me sincerely, though she had a therapist, she did the sessions with our dad present (who was always saying “god doesn’t like this/just pray etc.” so progress were not made. 

Long story short, I feel burdened emotionally : 
1 because I've engrained it in my mind that I should avoid making my sister feel sad etc. which led to me servicing her in any way, putting her in a pedestal which makes me unable to validate my feelings (for ex. when she hurts me with words)
2 because I looked up to her so much, I feel as if I don’t have my own identity. I've this nagging feeling that I've built my entire identity off of her..(Idk if this makes sense..)
3 right now, I'm unable to validate my own feelings (Sometimes I suspect that I also have depression but I just can’t accept it)
I can't help but compare what I'm feeling to what she felt, so at the end I minimize the importance of my feelings since for me, they’re not sad enough or Idk. 

My parents also told me when I was 12 (whenever my sister was away) to not believe her and that she was just influencing me. This kinda messed me up, admittedly now I have trust issues. 

I find myself unable to come into terms with what I feel. I cannot talk to my parents since I don't trust them with anything to do with mental health. I cannot talk to my sister since I don’t want to force her to become my therapist. I do not have anyone else that I trust to share this with. 

So I just want to get some advice on how to take care of my mental health and cope with my emotions. I also would like to know if pursuing a relationship while being in this state would be more disadvantageous than beneficial."
617,i need some motivation,"ive been incredibly depressed the last 2 months but i want to try and get out of it. ive even deleted instagram already which im proud of :0
i think an alright first step would be to clean my room, i really want to cause its a complete disaster but i just cant bring myself to do it,, so if anyone has any tricks or advice to get the energy to do it id really appreciate it"
618,Why could it be that I'm really happy and excited to start the day as I am waking up and then less and less happy until my mood drops to feeling unmotivated?,"Why could it be that I'm really happy and excited to start the day as I am waking up and then less and less happy until my mood drops to feeling unmotivated?

For example, I might be excited to do X, but then Y metaphorically comes along and makes me feel like I can't. Then I would try to do the thing I was excited to do, but not nearly as happy when waking up. It's like I'm happiest when sleeping and/or having a good dream, but when I wake up reality isn't as fulfilling. 

I had a traumatic childhood, and intend on seeking counseling, but I also want to ask random people what they think until I can afford a professional. Not asking for advice per sé, I just want to have a better understanding of what could be happening in my brain as I wake up with this specific instance."
619,I feel like I’m losing it. Maybe I am.,"I (minor F, not super comfy with disclosing age) was never really one to hurt myself until now. I found it messy and too flashy, something everyone would look at and assume you were crazy.

And now my entire arm is fucked up. And my upper thigh.

It started when my mother got into an argument with me over grades and the fact that my room wasn’t to her liking, and the fact that I don’t get out of bed (I don’t see a reason to, I’ve given up in trying)...etcetc, list goes on. She later proceeded to *lock me out of the house* and then get mad and hit me hard, multiple times when I knocked on the door trying to see if she’d done it accidentally (she hadn’t).

I’m really bad about hitting—it makes my anxiety flare up like a mfer. I can’t even stand when people move too quickly around me, I flinch and jump away half of the time.

Cue panic attack. I noticed the fabric scissors on my desk and didn’t even think about it as I picked them up. I cut and I was able to have a clear head a bit after (which scientifically makes sense given the endorphins and all). I made it through the rest of the day just fine. Let the cuts scar over and didn’t think much about it. Cool. Whatever.

Until now. To shorten the entire shitshow:

-My dad was screaming at my mom even though he’s a lazy prick that expects everyone to do everything for him

-I stood up to him for her, to which he responds by ripping up my favorite shirt and getting in my face, threatening me to “do something to him” because I apparently look like I was ready to beat the shit out of him

-Cue to him shoving me on the couch after I try to get away, yelling at me about how he pays the bills etcetc (which, okay, I get, but WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO. I’M NOT EVEN IN FUCKING COLLEGE, WHAT BILLS ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO PAY?)

-He mocks me about probably needing therapy and then claims that if he hits me i can “call 911—sure, I might go to jail for a bit, but I’d get out eventually and you’d still be around here somewhere” 

-Goes in his room and comes back later acting perfectly chill like I should be his best friend, then gets mad when I “have an attitude”. Like, dude, you just threatened to beat the piss out of me and then hunt me down, the hell do you expect me to have? A bouquet of roses with a thank you card?

-I went to my room to vent, cut again despite trying to stop myself this time, then got screamed at by my mom as well

-Debated ending everything then and there by just ODing already

-Aaaaand lastly, was threatened by my mother to get sent to a psych ward or whatever for cutting—but not because she cared, because she said she was tired of my shit...I don’t ever come to her about anything because she makes it about her, so I don’t know what shit she’s even talking about.

Am I...in the wrong? It doesn’t even matter what I do or say or think. I just exist. I’m tired of doing it. I wish I could just die.

There’s no other side to death.

I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or losing my mind. It also doesn’t help that there’s another side of me in my head. Not like a voice or anything, it feels like another person. There are times when I get lost and can’t even tell which mind my thoughts are coming from. I don’t even know which personality or person or whatever is even real at this point. It got even worse after my ex and I parted ways.

What on earth is even wrong with me...?"
620,How do I not feel like a loser?,I often feel useless all the time. Everybody said I would end up big. I somehow believed it. And now the reality is that I won't ever end up big. I just want to end it. But I won't because my girlfriend loves me.
621,I (21M) cant get over my obsession with height,"Ever since i’ve learned that height is one of the most (if not even the most) physical attributes for determining a dude‘s attractiveness I‘ve gotten obsessed with the topic.

I spend whole days reading reddit, thestudentsroom and quora‘s threads about why girls prefer tall guys and it makes me depressive and my self-esteem shatters. I can‘t stop it. I‘ve been told often that I‘m attractive and up until I found out how important height is, I walked into clubs feeling like I own the place. 

When im out now, I constantly compare myself to other dudes and see how the vast majority seems taller than me, even though I should be average height (5‘10 without adding 2 inches)

I feel like a fool now that I know that im not nearly as attractive as I think i am, and i have a very hard time enjoying clubbing. 

I imagine former crushes rejecting me because im ‚just not tall enough‘ for them. :( 

My biggest insecurity/concern is that I will never be as physically attractive to her as a taller guy. I mean i get why it‘s so hot to girls, he seems much more stronger, manly and dominant and im inferior. I fear my future SO will always wish that i was taller, even though she wouldnt tell me that. 

I imagine when girls see a tall guy its the same feeling when i see a girl with big boobs. (I always take myself as a measurement when dealing with mental health issues) They probably get an instant ladyboner like me when i look at titties. And this feeling cant be replicated with an average guy like me.

Any suggestions how I can get over this?"

I had a lot of trouble in school from middle to high school and dropped out at the end of year 12 mainly because of my parents advice (it was all on good terms)

The only way I can explain how I feel is that I get self conscious to the point of where I can't think of what to say or do so I just shut myself of from the world around me. I don't talk to the people around me and I get stuck in my head. I find it impossible to set my mind on something and my brain feels the opposite of clear, I feel I become almost completely incompetent. I don't feel anxious/butterflies, it's all mental. I feel stuck in my head and it is very frustrating, I know I just need to stop thinking, but I find it hard to stop myself.

Getting through this is impossible by myself. I saw a psychologist 4 years ago who helped me a lot with it but he's not at the practice I go to anymore so I am seeing someone else and I find it really hard, he asks me questions that I can't answer because my head isn't clear enough which is exactly my problem."

630,Undeserving.,"Romantic love is something that I have placed at the forefront of my life for quite some time. That's a toxic thing, because before you realize it, you have crammed your other relationships to the bottom of the hamper.  It's a practice that I've realized and am addressing. 

It's a gross thing. You place all of your time into your attractiveness, wether others find you attractive, changing things about yourself to be seen as more attractive, sex, or titles, and you miss out on so many great moments in your other relationships. You forget how to relate to people especially if you find them attractive because the entire time you worry if they'll find you attractive, but you missed the moment to make a new friend or to actually learn something about someone else. 

Disney movies have taught alot of us that romantic love is the ultimate goal. That someone else being interested in you romantically defines your worth as a human being. 

That is such selfish way to think. 
Why have someone focus their time on you when they should be focusing on themselves? Why put that burden on another person? It's not their job to make you happy, it's you're own. 

That's why you're undeserving of love. 
That's why I'm undeserving of love."
631,I cant see my therapist due to covid-19 so maybe someone here can offer some advice?,"Hi y’all, I’m a 21 y/o gay male &amp; I’m in a tricky situation. Basically I’ve been in a relationship for almost 4 years, (currently now single), but for the last year of my relationship my boyfriend would not give me any physical affection, he also stopped spending time with me. As someone who has had serious mental health issues in the past this obviously severely affected my self esteem, one night we got into a heated argument because I was fed up with him treating me in that manner and we decided to go on a break. 

When we went on a break I downloaded tinder and started talking to other guys but didn’t have sex with anyone. Long story short a few weeks went by and me and my ex start frequently seeing each-other again, ever since the break he apologised for what he did and he wants to get back into a relationship. I’ve also noticed that his actions have changed, he’s now showing me a lot of affection.

Basically I’m finding it hard to move past how he treated me and I’ve been feeling extremely emotionally numb to the point were I don’t care about anything anymore. I literally stay in bed and do nothing all day, if I do build up the energy to do something then it would be studying but that’s about it. I should also mention that a close family member passed away recently so that was also traumatic. 

He hates the fact that we aren’t together anymore and it severely affects him mentally when I talk to other guys, to the point were he has a mental breakdowns. (It has been much better these last two weeks or so) he just talks to me now instead of loosing it. 
What do you guys think I should do?"
632,Build up / Break down,"Hi everyone , my friend and I are started a podcast and our first episode is dedicated to mental health.

633,My head always feels crowded and “full”,"
I don’t know how to explain it, but I never have a clear head.  I usually have one or two songs stuck in it, and I worry so much about stuff that it’s getting hard to fall sleep.  I can’t stop thinking about my sexuality, and I get hooked on different illnesses to be worried about.  I don’t do it for attention, I’m really worried about what people will think of me if I do have those.  Half of my brain is calling myself a lying attention seeking bitch, while the other is freaking out.  I also keep thinking if what if’s.  “What if someone at your new school thinks your weird for being (possibly) gay?  Well then I will think of what I’m going to say, even though it won’t happen.  But a lot of the scenarios are more outrageous but make me feel cool, as I was a social outcast at my old school.  They pop into my head randomly, and I have tried pinching my self to make them stop, but they keep coming.  And lately I’ve been really hating my weight and body, and have been eating less, but again my brain is divided on whether I’m an attention seeking bitch, or actually somewhat developing an ED.  Plus I worry about my lying problem, which just makes me feel so stressed out all the time.  I get into bed at ten and fall asleep at twelve.  I am constantly in a battle with my brain, and I can’t stop it.  I’ve asked so many advice questions in this sub that I’ve had to keep making new alt accounts in fear that someone will think I’m a troll.  I have 5 fucking alt accounts.  5.  I can’t keep living like this.  Please help me."
634,Wrote good things about myself today.," 

So this is my first time ever posting on Reddit, so forgive me if this post is horrible as i'm not 100% sure what the normal courtesies are and what not.

I (30M) (man, just writing my age like that made me now realize just how old I am. 90s babies, we old af now) have had sever depression and anxiety and thought about how many of my therapists over the years have said to write good things about yourself and to feed the ""good wolf"" and starve the bad one. Of course, I always said I would and never actually did it because my bad wolf would let me know there is no reason to because nothing will ever come of it, I will be like this forever. So I believed him and just decided to live with it. This morning I decided enough was enough and started to write good things about myself. I finished and decided a way to also help my anxiety is to post this here and put myself out there. So I am sharing with you guys my first out of hopefully many more writings.  
If posting this means, just one person is helped or moved to do something for themselves as well, then it would be worth the feeling of anxiety and embarrassment i'm sure to feel after posting this. I don't know how personal I am supposed to get on a post, but for now this is what I am OK with.

I know my writing is horrendous, so don't care to hear about that, But I will type it up for anyone who understandably can't read it.

P.S. while type the writing out, I realize it can sound a lot better and can write it out differently below but decided to keep it word for word. I had just had a dose of my medical marijuana and might have taken a lil more than I should have.

635,I can't stop having violent thoughts.,"I can't control when they happen. Sometimes I'm even in public and zone out and start twitching and sweating profusely. It's almost a trance like state and I imagine harming people that have slighted me. This has happened all my life and I'm known as ""Ape hands"" at work because the twitches have made them so strong. Sometimes during the ""eoiaode"" I stop breathing. I also scream in my sleep. Has anyone heard or been afflicted by a similar condition."
636,My OCD gut intuition feeling is causing me distress?,"I feel like I have this gut feeling inside my brain that tells me what to do like move things in a certain way or do this move in a game and for example when I play poker my brain is also correct a lot of the time when im like I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose, usually I can ignore it but sometimes it gets stronger doing different things and is like some kind of OCD, but the problem is its usually right except for when its inane details that don't matter haha."
637,We were abused constantly as children,"Now another of my mothers partners is trying to bully and gaslight me. It will never stop until I die, everyone around me will hurt me.

The professionals have admitted they cant help me in this situation. It never stopped being a grind for me, barely coping for so many years.

I cant relate to people that want to get back to ""normal"" or get back on track, all that shit, it doesn't apply to me. There was never a ""normal"". This has been nothing but a horrible experience, and I want out. sorry"
638,Sudden changes in emotional behavior.,"I (24m) have always been an emotionally distant person and normally wouldnt even be talking about myself let alone to strangers on the internet. So as stated above I usually keep everything to myself and some close friends but lately I notice some level of change in myself and it's quite strange, I get emotional about random things that I normaly just pay normal attention to. I will start to tear up at pictures or scenes that are neither sad or happy. It's not necessarily a bad thing, I'm just wondering what is going on with me."
639,Always feel like I'm choosing wrong,"It started years ago when I was making wrong choices.  I was not always the best person and fell on drug addiction and it got to a point my then wife took the kids and left.  Ever since I have never been able to make a choice without regret.  I constantly feel as if every choice I am making is wrong.  It's gotten to a point I have almost choice paralysis.  I have tried treating the thoughts like I do intrusive thoughts by just ignoring them but they won't leave me alone.  I feel like it is almost a form of deep depression but I dont feel anything will help.

On top of this I recently started having intrusive thoughts about my own mortality and being alone.  The quarantine pointed out just how few friends I have and how few people i am connected to.  If i was to die today no one would know for weeks.  I have been a loner most of my life and i dont know how to change into something i like.  I am afraid of being alone.  I am almost afraid to seek help cause I have pets and no one to take care of them if I go inpatient.  I know I cant keep going like this but I dont know what needs to change to make it better.  I have a therapist through the VA but it doesnt really help.  Any guidance is appreciated."
640,Need Help,"Hello strangers, I’ll cut right to the chase. There’s something eating me up inside right now, and it has given me severe depression and anxiety, and I don’t know what it is. For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt alienated. I’ve always thought that I was a wierd, lonely guy that no one would ever like to talk too. I’ve only ever had a couple good friends, and it is so hard for me to make new ones. My mindset when trying to make friends is that everyone is so much cooler and more developed than me, So I have to act like someone else and follow a script  constantly to maintain their friendship. I have 0 motivation. I’m a senior I’m high school now and I’m failing two classes right now, and what’s worse is that I don’t care the slightest bit. I know that summer school is on the line but I still have no motivation, not even the fear of summer school. My grades have been getting worse and worse, and without my parents, I’m almost positive I would have had to repeat many years. I do have some dreams. I want to be an airforce pilot, but I know I won’t be able to be one because I’m too fucking lazy. I hate myself. I’ve never tried to kill myself because Death scares me, but I want everything to end at the same time. I feel trapped in an eternal state of nothing. I have no values, I have no opinions, I just say what I think people want to hear. What makes it so much worse is I haven’t had any hardship in my life, not really atleast. I grew up in a middle class family that loves me. I’ve had countless opportunities. There’s no clear source and that makes me so much more hopeless. I need help and I need someone in my life that understands. I want to be better, I want to have a personality and values, I want to have the motivation to follow my dreams. I want to be able to talk to someone without effort. Please guys It would be so helpful if you could give me some tips on how to beat this. (Pls don’t say therapy because I’ve had multiple therapists and can’t say they have helped me)"
641,Husband switching meds - need help,"My husband (m32) is a week into weaning off 20mg Escitalopram he's been on for 1.5 years and switching on to 25mg sertraline. He's been in a bar spot for a few months and just lost his job in the midst of the pandemic too. We've been fighting so much and it's really difficult for me to figure out how to help him. He keeps pushing me away, saying hurtful things, and I react more than I should - yelling back and just not being the support he needs. Pandemic making this worse in some ways, we are just stuck in studio apartment. I have no one to talk to this about and neither does he. How can I be a better support system through this and can anyone provide advice on how to help him through this mental health crisis? He's said a few times he wants to kill himself, but wouldn't. I've reached out to therapists and they've either not responded or we were put on one wait-list. He doesn't want to do crisis health line or headspace types. We just need help."
642,Anger issues,"Hi , Breaking my cup after FIFA game brought me here. So I get overwhelmingly angry when losing , not only in games but in general. Doc  told me to work out, play sports etc but doing any activity that contains win/lose format or achieving something makes me super mad. I cant play sports without raging , being toxic and aggressive and if somebody tries to talk with me I throw my anger towards them and later I have to apologize. If I'm in a bad mood ( mood swings every 10 minutes ) and friend makes a joke about me I start swearing or making even more toxic and dark joke about him. I was always like this and I want to stop being impulsive and stop disappointing my family members with toxicity. Sometimes I manage to stay calm but it is eating me even more from inside, gives me urge to break things or swear , shout and so on. Don't get me wrong I'm pretty supportive, motivational and courageous person."
643,Tapering off medication,"I have spent the last 6 months tapering of Remeron. I was initially on 45mg which was the highest available dosage but I have been tapering till now which is 15mg. 

I am also in my final year of university and meant to be graduating 2 months from now but current crisis has changed that plan. 

Do you think it’s a good idea to come off the medication at this time with all of the uncertainty in the world and the job market for a college student like myself?

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the next phase of coming off it completely?"
644,Sometimes I just want it all to end,"I’m a 26 year old female nurse working in a COVID unit for almost 2 months now. Because of the pandemic, we are obligated to do extra hours. I’m doing 12 hour shifts and lately I haven’t had proper rest. Any off duties I have, I spend in my room alone just trying to distract myself with movies/series/memes or sleeping. My interactions with my loved ones are usually thru phone because I’m trying to stay away from others in case I am a silent carrier of the virus. I cry silently in my bed whenever I feel overwhelmed with fatigue/sadness/isolation and everything that’s been going on with the world because of this pandemic. All the suffering and pain and loss of lives. Whenever I try to open up to someone, I feel worse because one or two of these things happen: they try to dismiss what I’m feeling, they will say others have it worse (I know how true this is), they will start to talk about themselves or they will be so worried I’d feel guilty of opening up. I am mentally strong most of the time and people rely on me a lot for comfort but recently I feel like I am not allowed to feel down like everyone else. There are times when I just want to stop feeling anything. When I just want to sleep and sleep because when I sleep, I don’t feel all of these emotions. I don’t know if this is all just from my exhaustion or what. I’m so miserable. I feel like shit"
645,I’m miserable,"So I am 17(F) I had a another reddit but I deleted it and now I’m back. My story is that the I’ve had horrible high school experience which included me not being able to get work done,failing, teachers being really unsupportive. I recently asked my school counsellor to help me again after I felt like scared to seek help. He’s great but somehow I don’t feel better. He validates me but I still feel so low and unmotivated. He has a lot of patience but I do feel really guilty about not being able to do what we decide on. I don’t why I don’t want to get things done. I’m a mess. He encouraged me to try and work one hour at a time and I couldn’t even do that. I feel ashamed and guilty about seeking help when I am wasting it away and don’t deserve it. He shouldn’t waste his time on someone who doesn’t try right?"
646,Tired of feeling dead inside. What could I do to be motivated again?,"I'm trying to heal from my trauma and get my life together again, but it's really difficult without any motivation to keep it going.

I'm doing therapy now, but I really need some advice for some motivation to kick in. 
It's really important for me to break this cycle and move on, because it's coming back suicidal thoughts feeling that I'm  worthless.

* My background story
I'm 27 years old, only child. Living with my parents till I finished my master thesis, they're older than the parents of my generation. I don't talk to my dad since I was 13 years old, except good mornings and goodnights ... can't remember why, he has some anger issues and flips from nothing ... and me and my mother always had a trouble relationship. She always bullied me when growing up, comparing me to others and being associated the worst child in her group of friends, saying that she only have done what is the best for me, putting me in a lot of stress and blaming me for the discussions with my father. I've already forgive her, I think she's really naive and can't deal with her problems so overwhelmed me instead.

Had my first panic attack with 14.
Had a eating disorder around 17, my mother put me in diet since 7 because I've always had more weight in my legs and arms than the other kids and with a lot of body shaming through the years I started to hide food and eat almost nothing in my teenager years. I became bulimic after that, evolving to anorexia in the end.

Had my first abusive relationship with 19. I never had much self-esteem but this relationship put me in a lower position with the mental abuse and sometimes physical. I was also dealing with not feeling fulfilled with the course I was taking in college... I wanted something more artistic but because my mom knew better ...my whishes were taken as childish.
I tried to commit suicide two times, failing because someone always decided to skip a class and get home early (I was living with colleagues then).
 I reach my best friend for help, but because we were living in different towns she made new friends to spend time and stopped showing for hangouts. I've never felt so abandoned and never made other strong relationship since. I pushed away the other friends in that time because I felt betrayed and I'm always attracting toxic people so they don't last long in my life.

 I reach my mom for help and the solution was meeting with my family doctor and start medication without any psychological support. I was on Prozac, a medication I can't remember the name but it was for the eating disorder and Xanax. I hated that numb feeling so returning to medication for help is not really an option for me.

Anothers unhealthy relationships later and never truly healing my depression problem, I finally enter a course more artistic, getting a degree, and anxiety was already part of me. 

I attracted the worst type of person, normally called  narcissistic sociopath and made him my boyfriend, ending that relationship one year ago.
In that time I was in a really stressful environment so I had a stroke, with 26, and my dominant arm became numb so I needed physiotherapy. Really hard for someone who uses her hand for work like drawing and making objects. One year later it's better and it looks normal, but it's still becomes numb sometimes when I try too hard.

I started  therapy because of my stroke. I have more problems with healing the past relationship and what scars it has left me than the hand numbness, despite being fundamental in my course.
 I need to finish my master thesis so I can leave my parents house and be fully independent but it's really hard without the motivation needed. I want to finished this but it's hard feeling always dead and tired. 
I'm stressing because I need to finished my wills so that I could move on and stressing because I'm always feeling like I can't do anything or I'm not worthy of anything."
647,an insignificant post about a part of my life,"  

Honestly, I sometimes feel that I am the cause of all this, I feel like before I was brought into this world it was a better place, but now it’s becoming worse and worse as time goes on, more meaningless and boring, more pointless and closer to being destroyed. It’s not even just the world, everything around me looses its charm, greatness, meaningfulness. In my country you attend 12 years of just one school without going to different elementary, middle or high schools, of course you can transfer but that’s not the point. For 8 years of my life I went to one school, I don’t really remember much from my younger years, but after 6th grade the class started becoming more of a mess, bad grades, careless, lifeless, teacher kept reassuring it would be better next year so I we didn’t have to transfer, but it got worse, in 8th grade some good students were going to come back so it was going to be great, right? Nah they joined in the mess and again it got worse, so I transferred… it seems that’s when the whole class decided to go wild: teachers were angry, students were like rebellious punks, we practically had no lessons it was quite hilarious, but by the end of the first semester most students left, transferred so I skipped a grade , I was now in 10th grade, environment was completely different, suffocating, but at least I knew  what I was doing, at least we were learning stuff, but having to go to school everyday was deteriorating, I had silent breakdowns daily and even ended up running away from home at the end of it because I was too scared to take the exam, running away was something I had never done nor thought would actually do, needless to say it was a disaster- everyone was freaked out, angry, desperately looking for me; ever since I filled in this role of being a perfect student and was swarmed with expectations from everyone around me, I grew to have this fear of disappointing them, but I did just that and I had disappointed the people I cared about the most, I did something I never thought I would do and in a way I broke the mold that gave me a certain shape and now I had no shape, no place, no purpose, I was confused and didn’t know where to go from there, obviously I wasn’t going to keep fucking up and making my life worse, right? Hahaha obviously not since in the 11th grade I went to Poland, it was my first time in a different country so I was very much excited… BIG MISTAKE!... I don’t know when it started, but for a long time now I’ve known that the more I expect something to happen and get emotional over it, more it won’t happen, in fact, it sometimes turns out completely opposite of what I imagined, this does come in handy though because every time I stress about something bad happening it ends up not being as bad, but as convenient as it is, it’s obviously draining and makes me lose all sense of purpose because as a result of it I have to always stay negative, pessimistic and expecting something terrible to happen if I want things to turn out not as bad, therefore when I do get exited I’m always disappointed, when I’m being positive things only turn out bad, so I don’t allow myself to think good thoughts, be happy or hopeful… well it won’t be hard to guess that when I was excited and hopeful about the trip it turned out a disaster (yes, I say that word a lot but as I keep using it it’s supposed to mean something even worse than it did before) sure it was boring and tedious and absolutely draining, sure I was annoying and people didn’t like me as much, but I kept deluding myself that it wasn’t that bad, until the consequences hit me like a truck, because apparently my host texted our principal a letter about how terrible of an experience she had with me, it’s like she was on the verge of tears because if she had to live with me for her stay here, she’d much rather not come to this country, principal also added to the complaints and needless to say I had brought even greater disappointment to people, I just feel like whatever environment I enter, I ruin it (so basically a normal human), whatever class I’m in becomes even worse and take this one for example, we’re supposed to be finishing school this year and look at the situation of the world. Honestly it doesn’t have to be related to me, you can just say that things like this happen, just a coincidence and I’m just full of myself, it’s as if I think the whole world revolves round me no wonder people hate me (no wonder I hate me), but when your life feels like a chain of bad events and the rings of which only get bigger and bigger (size correlating to how bad it is), as if to outdo the impact the last one had, makes me not look forward to what the future might bring, at all."
648,Downward Spiral,"I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression(possibly bipolar), and this whole Covid situation has pushed me into a downward spiral. I’m on a very low dosage of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic. I started this long break from school in a good mood for a month, but then I started to go down. I’ve going through a breakup and a death in the family and it’s driven me downward. I’m so anxious that I can barely do any simple task requiring human interaction. I am constantly on the verge of tears. My medicine is too low to even do anything. Ugh"
649,I hate my little brother and need advice,"I don't know if that fits here but i need to talk to someone so here it goes: i hate my 9 years old brother.
I asked for a sibling when i was 8 because i was so ""shy"" i had no friends -now i know it was all because of anxiety- so they made one but he was a baby :/ i still had no friends and now needed to share everything. It was okay tho. My parents hate each other, there is not one peaceful month in this household. I learned to live with it i knew what started a fight i knew how to behave yet i still made mistakes they still fought all the time. I think my hate for my brother started because he doesn't know the things i know he doesn't even care actually. They started to fight because of my brother, i hated that one little sentence he said and caused a fight i knew it wasn't really his fault but couldn't help it. I can't explain how happy it makes me when they talk to each other, laugh at each other's jokes. He was crashing it. 
Now everything he does annoys me so much. I can't stop yelling at him. He used to love me i hate myself for being like this but i don't know how ro fix myself. 
For example he wants water from my mum in a kind of rude way then i go crazy ""why don't you go get it yourself?? Ever heard of respect?"" I don't want to be like this i swear I'm not like this to anyone else. My mom yelled at me today ""why are you so jealous of your brother??"" I'm not... i just hate him.
I tried to fix this, we painted together -it was after a big fight between my parents, he cried- the way he spent my precious acrylic paint and ruined my brushes really pushed me but i stayed silent tried to act like i was having fun with him but it was torture. I told myself i will be nice from that moment on but it didn't work out at all.
I am 19 btw if this helps"
650,Mental Health fell apart. Yet again.,"For years, my family has tried to convince me that mental health issues are a myth. I agree it's a major inconvenience but denying it hasn't helped me at all. 

I have GAD, Depression. Also, very bad mood swings triggered by hormonal cycles. I'm in a pathetic state full of selfloathing and insecurities. 

I almost broke up with my boyfriend today, again. He's a very practical guy who is probably done with my shit by now. I have very reasonable issues but I get too overwhelmed and emotional. The discussions become rather very counterproductive. 

I really want to grow strong and not hurt as much as I do. I have been in this constant cycle of denial and outbreaks. The pandemic felt good for a while. Then loneliness got suffocating. Now it's destroying a lot of things for me. 

I am just really tired of being me. I am tired of being weak and sad over and over and over again. 

But one thing that's trapped me even further is:
What do I do to get out of this state? 

I don't have an answer to that. 

I really hope people would have empathy towards others, one can never know what they're going through."
651,I need advice on my situation.,"I am 20 years old and have been suffering from sadness frequently over the past years, I think it is linked to some kind of mental illness. Apart from feeling depressed I get quite stressed or concerned about irrelevant situations sometimes and I feel very uneasy not being in control of everything, it is getting worse at the moment and some days I feel like I am unable to live at all. 

The problem is that I act like everything is fine around people, except for my closest friends, almost everyone sees me as a joy spreading and life loving guy, even my family and I got used to it. During the corona lockdown it became harder to act up like that. I want to get professional help but can't without my parents knowing it because I live at home. 

It's getting more complicated because my cousin suffered from a mental illness a few years ago (but managed to recover eventually) and now my mother talks about him like he could not live on his own anymore (which most certainly is not the case). Now I am afraid she will see me the same way or be disappointed if I tell her I want to go to therapy. We never really spoke about mental health or feelings in my family so I need advise how to tell my parents and how to handle the situation."
652,I just finished grad school and I keep catching myself thinking I will die if I don't get a job.,"I have a history of mental health problems, in past I've struggled with anorexia and BBD. Now I deal with just anxiety and depression (which I've had for 21 years). Every time I think about not getting a permanent full time job I keep thinking the alternative is being dead (note I'm not thinking of killing myself, although that has happened in the past). I keep thinking if I don't find a job I will just somehow drop dead or my loved ones will. I have no idea where this came from. Help!"
653,Hollistic medicine,So I'm really into hollistic medicine and it seems to be the best option for me. What are some ways you guys cope using hollistic methods
654,I feel alone. I feel suicidal.,"My first time ever on reddit. Someone told me it could be good to speak to more people. 22f 
I had depression first about 17 and it’s  come and gone ever since. I’ve found life really hard recently. My mum almost died, my father bullies my younger sister and I and my mum doesn’t react. I feel a stranger in my home. I have 2 friends and they are off living their own lives. My younger sister I don’t think realises how much I’m struggling mentally. My fiancé, who I can’t see because of everything in our society today, is miles away and has his own problems.
I don’t like feeling so alone. I feel as if those around me are too preoccupied with their own problems or they straight up are not interested. I sound harsh, but my mum and my sister have seen me cry recently and know I’m not myself, but they don’t say anything. They just turn the other way. My father knows he’s partly to blame for this but he never understands what he’s done and hasn’t tried to consult me after his last explosion. That’s how it is in my family. We never talk about our feelings and or others. I feel so alone and I wish to leave but lockdown. I keep getting suicidal thoughts more often recently. It’s horrible. I wish it would all stop but that’s too easy. I don’t want to die. 
I’m sorry for venting. I’m not really sure what to do about anything
I hope if anyone’s reading this that you are doing well. I’m a good listener if anyone needed someone to talk to. Thanks"
655,"Helping somebody that do not want to be helped. Or, therapy without he knowing it, it's possible?","My brother is doing hard time in his life.

He's 30 yo and has no job, neither is gratuated. He tryed several university without success, leaving after few or no exams. Few male friends, no gf, home all day (even before the lockdown), no clear passions or hobbies.

He read a lot of psychology and psychotherapy books and he says that, thanks to Wells books and his theories, last few months he woke up from his ""world of daydreams"" that made him ""paralyzed"", prefering big daydreams than little reality. He blames himself as having found this truth at 30 and not at 20.

Even so, he cannot move on, looking for a job, barely smiles, etc. He's always irritated. He thinks he now missed his opportunities in life because of his avoidant personality and because he's not done right experiences as most of people do in the years of school and college. He now is comparing himself to friends that anyway leaved their life and feel he couldn't measure up. In addition, he's blaming my mother for her constant sense of guilt and my father for his egocentrism and because they didn't notice his problems when he was younger.

I'd help him, but I'm not sure how. I gave him a few advices (read self-help books that promote action and not thinking, look for a less qualified job, try yo find what you like to do, don't blame yourself neither others for the past, accept the life you had until now, the future is not written, you can change it, etc.), but he is not accepting anything that is caming from me or anyone. He went to a psycologist for 8 times, but he leaved saying he could not do anything useful.

Do you have any advice for helping him?

Also, I was wondering if there is any therapy on him I can do or ask someone to do without his knowledge. So I thought the question could be posted here.

Thank you. All love."

658,I Was Happier When I Wasn't With Friends...And It Makes No Sense...,"I have nowhere else to ask this. I can't figure it out...

I left an online group of friends on discord for a week, and I've done this a few times. I've known some of these people for over half a year, and I'm close to them. But, for some reason, when I was away from them, I was *happier.*

I've got some issues with attachment, and have been known to follow through with the mentality of, ""I'll abandon you before you ultimately abandon me"" when it comes to friends. But, I tried not to do that. I tried to stay as positive as possible, and say that I enjoyed their friendship.

And when I came back online today, and they all said, ""we missed you"" and started bringing me back up to speed...I just wanted to fucking delete the app and disappear. I just wanted to wipe myself off the face of the fucking planet.

Shouldn't it be the opposite? Shouldn't I like being missed, and knowing that they missed me? Because even just...typing that out and I wanted to fucking cut my thumbs off. I don't want anyone to miss me. I...*hate* the attention.

And it makes no sense..."

661,I want to drop out of highschool because my mental health has gone to shit. My mom is also just.. Not the best. Advice?,"**TW: Self harm mention, suggested mental illnesses.**

I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I'm new. Hi! I'm 16, and an FtM trans male. This is relevant.

I'm a sophomore in high-school. I've been going to therapy for years to get help because I'm s\*icidal and constantly in a state of depression. My current therapist has suggested I have Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Nothing has been actually diagnosed because my mom hasn't taken me to a psychiatrist. Money is tight sometimes, but it's been a year or more that my mom has been told I need to see someone. Back then we had enough and she constantly forgot to take me, and one time I reminded her more than twice, she snapped at me, telling me I had white privilege and all my things were paid for, and I had no reason to be depressed. Asked me why I was so excited to be seen because they'd just put me on medication. I haven't even been taken to start HRT after two years of promising it.

Now I can't even see my therapist because of this pandemic and it's all gotten so much worse. I've relapsed into s\*lf h\*rm twice or more, and I've been more s\*icidal than before. I don't talk to my mom because she yells at me for little things and in the past was physically abusive, still is somewhat mentally (confirmed by therapist). I can't ask her to not shit talk me to her boyfriends about the work I do at home because she uses me talking to her like an adult as argument material later, saying I can't talk to her like that if I don't step up and do more, but it's hard to do more, the stress from failing grades, being constantly sad and tired, not being able to focus- I do clean when I feel okay enough, but she bases her respect on what I do around the house. I'm practically an adult where I live, and she has said so herself.

I feel so alone and I know if I fail, and I will, my phone will get taken. Which is what she thinks is the issue. My phone is the only way I get to interact with anyone and talk, especially through this pandemic, and things won't get better if I lose my online friends, some of my only friends, but she doesn't care for that. She herself is on social media about the same time I am, and she claims to understand she knows how important people are, but she constantly threatens to take my only way of communicating to friends away from me, and make me feel more alone.

I want to drop out of school anyways until my mental health gets taken care of because school and even general life is so hard to get through and focus on when I feel so down all the time, and others think this is a good idea. The job I want to work at, Starbucks, doesn't really need a highschool diploma to work there, and they provide insurance from what I've heard. I just want to get my shit together enough to be able to properly finish school without so much weighing me down.

**TL;DR - My mom doesn't treat me too well is postponing getting me the help I really need, and have been told I need, to get through school and life in general. I want to drop out until I get help.**

Advice, help, kind words, etc? Please don't bash me for things I've said. I'm genuinely in need of help."
662,I think my diagnosis is incorrect...,"A couple months back I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 

I got this diagnosis the day I was released from a 72 hour hold at a psych ward. I was placed in the ward for a suicide attempt, because I thought my boyfriend was going to break up with me. Obviously that’s an overreaction to a situation, but I’m obviously not right in the head. Also no... he wasn’t really planning to break up with me... Im just really paranoid. 

Anyway, like I said I was diagnosed the DAY I was released. No one spoke to me much about the diagnosis until 30 minutes before I went home, and it wasn’t even the doctor I had been speaking to. “My doctor” for the ward was out that day, because they needed extra help in the ED unit. The doctor who diagnosed me was some random doctor I had never even spoken to, and basically was just given some notes on me and diagnosed me.

I don’t think I’m bipolar. I sometimes have “manic” moments, but I’m never manic for more than like a day EVER. What he said was my “mania” was when I got a whole bunch of tattoos, dyed my hair, and almost got a piercing within a week, right before my attempt. 

Now I get where he’s coming from but I feel like I align closer to BPD. I have severe abandonment issues, I feel like I have no real identity, and my impulse control is virtually non-existent tbh. 

The meds I was given did absolutely nothing to help (lamictal). In fact they just made me feel like a different person that I didn’t recognize, so I stopped taking them. 

Have any of you guys ever felt like your diagnosis was completely wrong?"
663,I think I need help but my parents are ignoring the signs,"I genuinely need advice .
Even though I am a child I am showing symptoms of mental illness. I am losing interest in my hobbies ,I can’t concentrate and always feel worthless. I am trying to get better with the help of my friends but It doesn’t work and after that I feel even worse because I wasted my friends time. I think I need professional help but my parents just ignore all signs and every time I try to bring up my mental health and how I am always feeling down they switch topics.
Idk what to do anymore."
664,"I completely lack all ambition, is that normal?","This is my first time posting on this sub so sorry in advance lol
I (F16) always hear about people wanting to “go places” and “change the world”, but I don’t really get it. I’ve never had the urge to change the world or go anywhere in life. I don’t have much of a dream job, I’m not interested in getting amazing grades in school, I don’t have a specific college in mind. In fact, I can hardly imagine myself as an adult at all. I don’t have any goals.
All I really want in life is to be happy, be around the people I love and experience new things. I often feel shamed when I tell people I’m not interested in college and don’t really care much about my future. I’m starting to get extremely stressed out because it seems like the only important thing in any of my friends’ lives right now is school and I just... don’t care. Is it normal for me to have no ambition?"
665,Is there any easy way to tell if your fatigue is just from your depression or if it has a physical cause?,
666,What I'm I even supposed to do?,"So I'm 16 yo female and I haven't actually posted to reddit ever before. I don't have an actual background of mental health issues, but these past two or more years I have felt depressed, last month or two have probably been the worst I've been, possibly due to having to stay home. I would love to get over this and talk about my problems to someone who would know how to help. I feel like there is no future for me. School feels like a waste of time and all projects and homework for this month are late and I'm failing classes. In a way I don't care at all how my school is going right now, but at the same time in the back of my head I keep thinking about if and when I get over this slump all this not caring is going to stab me in the back. I feel like future holds nothing for me. I can't think of a job or a career that would interest me. I have never have interest in romance and building a family feels just stupid with my mindset like this. I've lost the jpy of making art during the last year and I don't feel like doing anything at all anymore. Studies are making me feel anxious and I haven't been able to think about anything else, but school and the fact that I need to talk to someone. I have a great family and talking to my parents has crossed my mind a couple of times. But my father doesn't believe in mental health and doesn't understand this kind of thing at all. And my mother even if she understood, she would probably just deny the fact that I'm not okay and force me to go outside for a walk. She would probably also blame herself and make me feel bad for making her look like a bad mother. Recently I've been thinking a lot about taking my own life. I wouldn't have the guts to do anything and leaving my family with that kind of grief would make me feel absolutely terrible, so there is no way I'm doing it. But at the same time I can't help but look down from our balcony and think what it would feel like to fall. During this korona virus I've seen my friends once, and to my family I haven't spoken much. I feel like I'm growing roots to my bed and waking up in the mornings is harder and harder every day. The rest of my family is good looking and successful. I feel like such a failure to everyone. Some days I catch my little sister and my mom talking about me and how I don't do chores around the house anymore, or how I'm lazy and unfriendly all-around. My sister is such a favorite child and perfect in my mothers eyes, it feels bad being in the same room as them. I also feel like such burden to my one friend who I have opened up about my problems. It just feels bad seeing her trying to cheer me up while I know that she is struggling at home with her own problems. I'm so thankful that she listens, I wouldn't have anyone to talk to if it wasn't for her. I just feel like a bad friend these days. This post became such a ramble I'm sorry. I just feel like I need to write my thoughts somewhere."
667,I hate myself....,"Probably a lot of misspellings and bad grammar......

I was bullied my whole life, since probably the age of 5. I was constantly told that I was fat, ugly and just worthless. When I was really young I would constantly ask my parents if I looked cute or pretty and after awhile they would just say ""were not going to answer that because you'll just argue"" (I would always get upset and just say no I'm not anytime they said yes). The only voices I had from the literal age of five were the ones telling me I was worthless, anytime I had any ounce of confidence my mom would just tear down and tell me that I was being prideful or vain and that no one would ever want to be around me if I acted like that. I developed a really bad anxiety disorder around 3rd grade that I've dealt with ever since. I am so angry with my parents for never doing anything to help me I remember being 7 or 8 sobbing to my mom asking her why I was so ugly and fat, I even tried to figure out how to diet when I was 7 and they still did nothing, I once told my dad how much I hated how I looked and how I felt fat and his response was ""youre not fat but you could use to lose 10lb."" (I could go on and on with more stories) Some stupid thing we believed in elementary school was that if you held you're breath for a minute you would die, I would lay in my room at night holding my breath and counting and hoping I would die. As I got older, nothing got better. 

I'm now 23 and I literally hate every part of myself and I have to deal with terrible anxiety. Every morning I weigh first thing because the number on the scale will determine the level of hate I have for myself that day, at times I have so much anxiety about gaining weight I get so nauseous I nearly throw up. I have to wear my hair in a pony tail because it's the only hairstyle I didn't get bullied for wearing. (Anything else causes anxiety attacks) 

I'm so sick and tired of feeling this way, my husband tried to get a picture with me and my daughter for our first mother's day and I burst into tears over it. I don't know what I hate more feeling like this or myself."
668,Impact of toxic behaviour,"I'm f19 and have toxic parents. They allways told me I'm stupid crazy egoist for any silly reason like whem I've forgot to do something because of my little deficit of attention or do something they don't like(They say much more, there are just few examples). They brought  me a lot of pain especially when I was 12-13. Then I started to self-harm but was insulted due to this.  Fortunately, my parents abuse me just mentally, but they hit me several times in the past.

I feel so bad and lonely, I have no friends (I started to cry while watching ASMR video with personal attention yesterday), I can't tell anyone about my condition so here I am.

I learned how to deal with almost everyday affronts. I  turn off the energy of my mind and ignore my family but it's not enough. My  attitude is already distorted.

The one solution for this problem is to leave my home. But I totally have no power for making money or for something else. I just have energy for stress due to my unproductivity. I'm stuck."
669,Proud of myself!,"Normally I don't like to talk about my depression &amp; anxiety, but I couldn't deny that I feel better after I do.

So, I finally decided to create a support group in VR for me and anyone else that struggles with either depression or anxiety!

It doesn't sound like much, but I was really proud of myself!

In case anyone wants to join, it's on an app called Grove. I think you need an Oculus VR headset though."
670,"I’m feeling guilt,shame, and depression from something I might like?",I was about to go for a ride on my motorcycle today and I got a thought in my head about liking well I don’t want to say it because it’s weird and it makes me feel awful about myself it’s nothing that involves hurting someone or anything like that. It’s something that kind of smells good to me and involves a family memeber that’s all I’ll say it’s making me feel like a weirdo and frankly it’s depressing me alot. I can’t stop thinking about it now. I want to just not care about it but I can’t. How do I stop caring? I obsess over thoughts btw and Ive also been diagnosed with GAD. I feel like if I tell someone ill feel somewhat better but I cant its fucking weird. At the same time im kind of thinking maybe I dont like it and Im just making myself believe I do but I kind of feel like thats an excuse to myself. It’s really making me feel not good enough for this girl im chasing after because it’s so weird. Everytime I think about her I just feel even worse about myself and get a sinking feeling in my stomach. I’m not even exaggerating it’s making me feel like death today. Im on the verge of tears its bugging me so much and I never cry. I just dont want to be this type of person that likes stuff like that if I even do. Ive been depressed over this girl for the past couple days and finally yesterday I was feeling great because we hanged out for a while. Its really always something that is bugging me it seems like. How can I just not care about this thing I possibly like? I cant even look at this family member anymore because I just get reminded.
671,Is everyone like this?," Why is it sometimes it’s like I have no filter, I don’t think about what I’m saying and other times I’m overthinking everything?"
672,"My lack of friends and social life has been spiraling me into a deep state of depression during quarantine. I feel like a lonely, friendless, loser.","I'm someone who's an introvert and also suffers from social anxiety. Long story short, due to growing up in a strict family who made it difficult for me to have a proper social life and experiencing the childhood trauma of losing both of my parents by when I was 9 (father passed away when I was 7 and mom remarried and left me behind 2 years later), I became a friendless recluse who did nothing but stay in my room all day. I'm 26 now and have since finished college and I overall have a great job and career. But unfortunately, I never properly fully improved my social skills in college and I still suffer from social anxiety. Along with that, I was also often very asocial was well, I was too lazy or didn't want to be bothered with putting in the effort to be more social because I got too comfortable being alone. I'm always too scared and self conscious to talk. So many times I could have asked people out for plans and such, but I just couldn't do it. This is the reason why I'm a dateless and kissless 26 year old virgin to this day.

I'm originally from the East Coast and last year, I left my family and the very few friends I had behind for a job in the West Coast. Prior to quarantine, I was doing well. One of my 2 closest childhood friends was working near where I moved and he was my best friend during this this time. Unfortunately he lost his job and had to move. I started a new job in March right before the lockdown and I had so many plans to finally be social and improve my life. Instead of living out my plans, I've been stuck working from home for the past 2 months. I didn't make any friends while I was here and and I have no one else close to me who lives near me. I'm in my room close to 24 hours a day and my depression is severely kicking in now. I've lost all motivation to do anything. I only have 2 friends, I'm a loser, no else ever reaches out and talks to me, I'll never have new any friends, these thoughts race through my head 24/7. The worst part being is that I feel like a lot this could have been avoided if I actually put in the effort to be social and didn't turn people away. It's my fault why my life is like this. When I was in college, I was actually diagnosed with bipolar disorder which arose from a similar situation. For a while after I graduated, it seemed to have faded and I was doing ok. But now I feel like the disorder has come back and it really affecting my quality of life. I'm feel like a hopeless, pathetic excuse of a human."

674,Give Space to Depressed Romantic Interest? Help!,"Hello Reddit,

I've (24) been just briefly romantically involved with a woman (24) for a short time now. On a recent date she mentioned she struggles with depression, and being that I've experienced this myself, I sympathized and we moved on with our date. 

That being said, the date went really well and we agreed to continue to see each other. Here is where the problems started. When trying to schedule this next date, (5) she seemed the dates kept moving back, then we settled for a date ""on the phone."" We talked for almost 2 hours and there was such a clear connection. At this point she tells me she's taking time of work for mental health and going to be with loved ones (keeping the length private, but it isn't long), but offered to schedule another in-person date before she leaves. Then she says if she isn't feeling up to it, we can go out when she gets back.

So, she's not feeling up to it at the time before she goes, and gives me a big explanation, stating that she tends to isolate when she's in states like this. She says she's doing her best, but just can't see me that day. I express sympathy and understanding that. I tell her to please not hesitate in letting me know when she's feeling better and to please care for herself. I understand that mental health is very important! It's been a handful of days now with silence, and I am unsure of whether to leave her be or drop her a note that I am thinking of her. I think, if she *truly wasn't* interested, she wouldn't have bothered to explain what's going on with her during this time, nor continually suggest dates, even if they fall flat and are ""phone dates."" I feel that she wants to feel better so that she *can* see me, she just *can't* right now.

I don't want to pressure her if she's not ready, but at the same time I don't want to go completely silent and have her thinking she's ruined her chances. Perhaps those of you who have felt this way can advise me on this route. I'm not going to wait around, but I want her to know the door is open when/if she's better. I felt we really clicked.

Thank you!"

I am a lesbian, and that's okay. However for a while I wasn't okay with that so I tried being with guys.

685,Running a business mentally exhausts me. Should I keep going or try something else?,"I’m 23 years old and I started my baking business 3 years ago while in college. I’ve always baked for fun but I was in desperate need of money so I used my skills to make money. Long story short, my business was extremely mentally exhausting. I feel like I was not well equipped to begin with and it just became more stress than it was worth. I’d end up spending a lot of the money I earned on supplies and trying to juggle baking with my school and work schedule gave me extreme anxiety.

I took a break from my business and am working on other things like my career and YouTube channel. I have been slowly trying to start back up but in a more organized way. However, today while I was baking, the slightest inconvenience made me so anxious and now I’m just extremely stressed and ready to quit again. People are always telling me I’m so good at it and I feel like it could be the key to my success if I really kept at it but if that’s the case then why does it frustrate me so much!? I honestly don’t even like eating sweets like that so I feel like I’m living a lie. I’m a pretty healthy person who prefers fruit over sugary food.

Sometimes I feel like the frustration is stemming from depression or something -lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed- but I’m also starting a YouTube channel that’s completely unrelated from baking and it doesn’t frustrate me at all. Even when I don’t like the video I recorded I don’t really care and just plan for the next one. I feel like this is more of my calling now but it just sucks giving up on my baking business. It’s just not making me happy anymore but I don’t want to let people down either. What should I do?"
686,Are my (20F)coping mechanisms normal?,"When I'm not feeling well due to anxiety or depression, something I like to do is play old computer games. What worries me tho is these old games aren't very age appropriate. By that, I mean I'm a 20 year old woman playing Reader Rabbit **Preschool** for example. I have so many games that sometimes I like to pop in and click around. I think the reason why it helps me is because:

1. these games remind me of a happier time

2. they're nostalgic for me (the colors, sounds, atmosphere, etc evoke positivity for me)

3. it's distracting. it helps me to focus on one thing rather than my mind racing in countless directions.

Is there anything wrong with this? I know I'm not a child, I'm not taking the games seriously, I'm not on the autism spectrum, it's *not* a ""special interest"" that I **need** to have, I am aware it's not age appropriate. But these things bring me comfort. I feel embarrassed about this."
687,I need help please i dont know whats going on with me im 15 years old female btw. I need someone to talk to asap please,"I really need someone to talk to, anyone really.

689,Question About Imposter Syndrome,"(*For context*) I’m starting to make games in Unity and I was wondering. If when I use templates, assets, or anything like that I feel like it’s not mine and it doesn’t feel like I actually *made* anything because technically everything else is just what someone else made. 

Is me feeling this way a result of something to do with Imposter Syndrome? 

**Note:** This isn’t super serious aloe anything I was just genuinely wondering. I have not been diagnosed with Imposter Syndrome, nor have I had a past of it. Again, I am just wondering as I have heard of the sickness. Thanks! :)"

691,[TW] i think i need help,"i self harm and i’ve been getting really bad. i’m aware that i should reach out for help and a large part of me doesn’t want to, but i just can’t stand the thought of causing my family so much pain. they don’t know that i’m struggling because i do everything i can to show them that i’m fine. 

i’m not fine and it’s all i can do not to cry when i wake up early every day because all i want to do is sleep through everything. i haven’t spoken to any of my friends since the virus started. i just ignored everyone and didn’t respond until they finally all just stopped messaging. i haven’t been this bad since my attempt and sometimes the thoughts i have scare me. i look at my forearms and stomach and thighs and i hate what i’ve done to myself but i can’t stop. i can’t stop and i just want to let go but i know i can’t do that. 

i just don’t know what else to do. my therapist in the past wanted me to go to an inpatient facility but i refused and i’ve since switched therapists for when i went off to uni in another country and i’ve now stopped seeing one altogether. i’m technically an adult now and the idea of going to a facility is terrifying, and with the virus and everything it just seems like a horrible choice. 

i’m concerned that if i don’t do something to get help that i’ll do something bad. i’ve written this about a hundred times in the past month but i think i’m finally at my breaking point. i don’t know what to do or how to get help or how to reach out and i’m really struggling. i don’t have anyone i can reach out to and i feel like the world doesn’t need me and would be better off without me. i’m just really scared."

Hell, i haven’t talked to my own sister in months, but to be honest she’s also a whole different kind of fucked up. It’s probably because of our upbringing, which we could trace most of our problems back to, go figure. I was really upset in my last post but now I don’t feel anything, is that bad? Am I supposed to feel something? It’s like I only feel angry, sad, or nothing these days. I want to be happy again, but was I ever happy? I can’t remember the last time I felt genuine joy.

694,What’s the best way to talk to my parents about getting antidepressants?,"I’m 16(F) from the UK and since the beginning of lockdown I’ve struggled maintaining a good mood and not falling into depressive episodes especially with all the stress of teaching myself my a levels from home. I know that antidepressants are a last case senecio especially for someone my age but I have had 6 years of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with CAMHS (I was discharged from my second round September last year) for my eating disorder/depression and then my anxiety/depression again. I think this has helped but I still have weeks or months where I constantly feel weighed down. I really don’t want to do any more therapy and I understand that pills aren’t a quick fix but at this point I feel like it’s my last chance. Sorry for rambling but I wanted to give some context so it doesn’t seems like I’m an angsty teen who thinks it’s cool to take medication. I have thought about this for almost 2 years and I think this lockdown forcing me to be alone with my thoughts is much has pushed me too my limit. I don’t know how to approach the situation with my parents. Whilst I do love them I’m terrified of opening up to them because of past experiences. I’m 17 I’m about a month so maybe I can hold on till I’m 18 and able to get them by myself but I would have no idea how to go about it. Any advice on the subject would be appreciated, thank you."

700,Might be a silly question... Gamers can answer?,"Just wondering if there's anyone out there that can relate. I find when I play video games I get anxious when I don't min/max everything. Examples would be inefficient farm layouts in stardew valley or not using  optimal weapons or builds in dark souls. I know it might be a silly thing but I spend a lot of time worrying about doing it better or more efficiently. 

I only ask because I don't think I've seen anyone post about feeling anxious over it. I know people love to min max for their own reasons but I'll restart playthroughs almost compulsively for this reason.

For those non gamers sorry for the silly question."
701,I feel like I've lost myself,"Good evening reddit.

I\[18\] am going to try and get right into it. I am sorry if this just seems like a blob of text, but I really just need to get all of this out of me. This might be a vent, it might be seeking advice. I really don't have a clue yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I very often feel like I am just an empty shell traveling through life with no purpose. Pretty much like I've lost much of what made me a person, with the whole thing about feeling emotions that aren't sadness or my wonderful default void. My interest in many of the things I once loved with my whole heard is just swallowed up by the void, making many things just a chore. 

It hasn't always been like this. I used to be pretty aware of my emotions, pretty aware of who I was. I had goals with life, many activities I liked. Of course things were not always fine and dandy, and I had periods where things became less fun but that's how it goes. 

But that started changing around 2018, where I got a girlfriend for the first time, and also made a new friend (female, this is important). This person was suicidal as all hell, and to make one long story much shorter, I had to save her life twice. Traumatic for younger me, and the weight of trying to keep her alive every day ate away at me but I managed.

Things became worse when my gf at the time went into a downward spiral aswell, forcing me to deal with both of these people, and my gf did not like my friend. Jeolousy was rampant and I was the target for many months of pretty much feeling like I caused most of the mental problems of my gf. It was here that I started losing myself, got less of an interest in the things I loved because I had way bigger problems.

Then I hit a breaking point, an evening where police was involved to deal with gf's mother, but as gf didn't say anything or tell them to wait so that someone might've been able to tell them about everything the mother had done, the police telling the mother that ""it might've been the bf who called"", I was stuck on a buss just reading the words that ""they are leaving now"". From that moment onwards, I haven't felt really human. If I feel happy, it is very temporary and fades almost just as quickly as it came. Left is just the void.

I pretty much lost my feelings right then and there, but stayed around because *""i was needed. i had to help"" - me 2019*. the bad feelings from gf pretty much stayed a true constant in my life until I broke it off in autumn, because by then my help wasn't needed and I could walk away with a clear concious. 

My life right now feels like I am chasing the feeling of humaning again, only for it to never really come close. I hate myself for the fact that I can't seem to make new female friends without thinking that she might be the one to make me feel human again, and stress that too much. I hate myself for the fact that I can no longer actually have any sort of idea of how I feel. Do I really like that woman, or am I just looking for someone to fill the void?

&amp;#x200B;

I have been keeping this close to myself for a very long time. Many logs have been written for this, because I have no clue how to actually tell any one of my friends that ""Hey, I don't feel very human anymore"". I don't even know how I would explain what I just wrote...

If you read this long, thank you. I really needed someone to actually hear this..."
702,I had my first panic attack on my birthday,I believe I had my first panic attack today and I don’t know why. I just got back from a beach trip with my new girlfriend and when it was time for her to go home I started feeling a little off. When I got back in my house I felt this immense feeling of dread and that nothing mattered anymore. I got in the shower and bursted into tears and uncontrollable sobbing when I started hyperventilating and getting a strong tingling feeling all over my face. It took me about 45 minutes to calm myself down and convince myself that everything was okay. I think it might have something to do with spending two days straight with a girl who I had been waiting 3 months to see (due to quarantine). I feel depressed and anxious that I have to wait to see her again and I don’t know what to do about it. Its my birthday today and I really have no idea what brought up these feelings because I’ve never experienced something so scary and mind altering. Does anyone have any advice on what I might be experiencing or what to do?
703,"I ruined everything, didn't I?","I don't want to lose you, but sometimes I'm afraid there's no choice.

I have no idea who's toxic and who is not. Maybe it's the both of us, but I really want to fix it. But I don't know if we can. I don't know if we're drifting apart. I don't know what's wrong or right anymore. I'm losing grip. I'm not sure how to talk to you. You have no idea how to talk to me. What the fuck happened to us? Why the fuck did you have to bring back a traumatic experience and justify it? 

Something's missing. Something is wrong. I have no idea what to do anymore.

704,I feel like there's two of me,"Does anyone ever feel like there's 2 of you. Like personally one of them is normal and kind n all that shit but then the other is suicidal, depressed and angry. I feel like it switches between those 2 sides constantly like one minute I'll be fine and then the next I'm losing it at people or considering suicide or just being a horrible person that isn't considering the consequences to anything I say.. Its like some insane mood swings. I know this is an awful explanation it's just hard to get the way I feel into words I guess. I just want to know if anyone feels the same."
705,I don’t like my mom being affectionate,"Dear reddit,

My mom didn’t have a good relationship with her parents. She wanted to raise her kids differently, which she did and she’s a great mom.
But lately I feel a little different. Whenever she wants a hug or something, I hug her back, but I don’t feel like I sincerely want to. It has come to a point where she said that she ‘misses me’ and I knew it meant she missed me emotionally. I can feel myself distancing myself from her, but I don’t want to. I can see it breaks her heart. But I just feel uncomfortable even though nothing special has happened lately, it’s just a feeling. 
She now has to ask for a hug or kiss, which cringes me out even more. It’s like I want to give her affection but that’s purely so she feels good, not because I sincerely want to. I hate myself for feeling this way.

Someone comment please"
706,I've never felt this way before,"Hi, 

I used to really lack in empathy I think during my teen years I listened to alot of girls talk about anxiety , depression body issues lots of the people around me talked about suicide and self harm and struggle ing with eating disorders and I just didn't buy it. By the time I had finished school my parents had an awful seperation I was living with my dad who was a drug addict I had been date raped at a nightclub and i was still able to get out of bed and get my shit done cause that was just life and I never expected it to be easy  I always had this belief and these girls just weren't getting attention from their parents or something or weren't that bothered about class and lazy or whatever else It was wrong of me to think like this. I just always thought you have to fake it to make it if you're unhappy tell yourself to be happy act like your happy and it will follow and this worked for me I was very sure of myself and confident.

 Well I've just turned 20 and this shit had hit me like a ton of bricks I've never felt this way before in my life after finishing school I studied for about 6 months realised college was something I really didnt want to do and moved to a hippie commune in a different country (me being very sure in myself made this quite easy) since returning home again and being back in the mix of society I don't recognise myself, I'm no longer sure in myself I worry about absolutely everything I'm scared to leave my house I've no hope or reason to get out of bed I dont feel anything really its quite numb I've lost my passions it really is my first experience dealing with mental health issues and I've no idea where they came from. Since trying to figure this out I've studied mindfulness meditation, Yoga, my mothers a psychotherapist so I know a few things but FUCK ME man this shit is awful.

I'm just wondering will it be like this forever? Will I always have this awful depressive states I go through where I sleep 20 times a day for a month and I feel like this just awful little weak worm no matter what I do. If i had all the money in the world I'd do an MRI and figure out what the fuck is going on but I don't and mental health is such a huge issue now among my generation theres much more people than me that genuienly need help right now .

I'm sorry if this is incensitive to people that have been struggling with this for a very long time I really do regret the beliefs I had when I was younger best believe I'm paying for it now ."
707,Anxiety,"For most of my life ive dealt with an overwhelming amount of stress and fear for things that shouldn't give that emotion. I was bullied in school and after that I would panic leaving the house. I would beg my parents to leave me home and my body would get sick, my stomach would hurt so bad I'd vomit or be in and out of the bathroom all day. Recently it has returned when I started a new job in a field I studied for. I wake up with stomach pains and go to the bathroom and try to get all out but its not enough and i still get the pains. I know that anxiety can manifest itself in many ways but I just don't know what to do, and how to deal with this. I love working and learning but I have 0 confidence in myself and I panic at the littlest of things, beat myself to hard when I make mistakes and just fear messing up. If anyone deals with or knows ways to work through it I would appreciate it a lot."

This time she threw a vase at my head because I said that I would not go to the store to get more chocolate milk.
I want to have her admitted into a psychiatric hospital (we still live at the same house) but my mother said ""She is not crazy, she just got mad you know you can't make her mad"". So there is that. I said to my mother that I don't feel safe going back there and she said ""If she hits you just hit her back"". I don't intend on doing that.

711,Mental Health Misconceptions,"Firstly I am not dismissing metal health.

I just read a theory from someone that mental health is increasing and because of so much talk nowadays about it people begin to think they have a form of it and eventually do actually suffer from it.

But just thought it was an interesting idea and came to ask you guys have you ever seen any studies about it or hear anything like this?"
712,"""help"" does not exists.","psychological ""help"" does not exist. People need to stop saying ""get help"" to someone who is in a bad way. It is very similar to saying ""get money"" to someone who is broke. Ive been in 6 psych hospitals and I can honestly say that they do not ""help"" in any way, shape or form. Ive been sober for 6 months and its been six months too long. Suicide is probably inevitable, despite some enormous miracle of biblical proportions which will not happen. Any questions of any kind will be answered."
713,I hate my parents,My parents are toxic and whenever I try to communicate this with them they never try to understand. It’s draining to just deal with it everyday but trying to have any rhetoric just results in an argument
714,I Don’t Want To See A Psychiatrist,"Hi, I don’t know if this belongs here or what I’m looking for, wether it to be to vent or get advice.

I am 15, and my therapist suggested to my mother that I get referred to a psychiatrist, because therapy wasn’t really working for me, so my doctor is making a referral, and I’m getting blood works done for it on Tuesday.

I don’t like blood tests, but that’s not the reason I don’t want to see a psychiatrist. I don’t get along with my dad, and whenever he is home from work, those are my bad nights were I have to contact Childline so I stay in an okay place. 
I don’t really feel that me or my head is the problem to be fully honest, but instead, my surroundings. I live with my parents and grandparents and my grandmother is extremely lazy and I’m always doing stuff for her, my parents are always at me because I’m always not doing something right or up to their standards, especially in terms of school.

I feel like if I move out, my stress and anxiety would go down so much, and I really don’t see the point in getting chucked on meds just as a bandaid for a bigger picture? Like why should I have to be taking meds to change my state of mind instead of others trying to take a look at themselves to try help me.

I’m currently part of an ongoing case of child grooming, so they seem to try blame it on that and we’re shocked when I told them that I don’t even mention that to my therapist, instead, just go on rants about them constantly. 

They always compare themselves to other parents and try to paint a happy picture and just seem narcissistic, being like, “well, at least we aren’t down in the pub drinking every day like most other parents”, “at least we aren’t as strict as other parents”, etc, when in reality, they are some of the strictest people I know.

And talking just isn’t my thing, so if a psychiatrist gets told that, but also gets told that I get suicidal sometimes, then I’m sure they’ll just throw some meds my way?  Like I wish my parents would get a divorce or support me moving out in 3 months, but I doubt that would happen.

Is it possible for me to be suicidal only because of a situation that I’m in, without having any mental health issues, or would there need to be underlying mental health issues to be suicidal thoughts? Like when I say suicidal thoughts, it’s not because I went to be dead, I just don’t want to be in this home.

I’m sorry. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk"
715,I keep blowing up and hurting her,"I don't want to do that. I'm sick of doing that. I know I'm hurt. I don't know what's wrong. I want it all to stop. I want to stop hurting others. I want to be stronger, but I'm tired of being strong."
716,Is there any benefits in deleting your social media on your mental health?,"Hi, 
I’ve been feeling very overwhelmed with like everything in my life, and I know social media a big part of my life, and now especially thats the only way we can communicate with others. I feel like my anxiety/depression has been getting worst and I have no access to therapy (even at low cost I have no privacy at home).

But I’ve started feeling like something is off, like something just isn’t right in my head. Sort of surreal, I suppose. I feel like I’m walking on the edge of a cliff and I’m about to slip and fall back into a mental breakdown. Literally feels like I’m losing my mind. Does anyone have any idea what this might be?

722,Question about associating places with people of my past,"Hi guys 

My name is Maddy and I am new to this reddit community. I came here because I had a question about my tendency to associate certain places with certain people, I think especially when those people have hurt me deeply. I have 2 examples of my tendency to do this: 

1. My grandmother died when I was 7 and I spent like half of my life at her house. After she died my parents sold it but her house is only 30 minutes away so sometimes, a couple times a year, we would just drive by to look at the house and see what the new residents have done to spruce it up. I always got this sick feeling deep in the pit of my stomach whenever I entered her town, saw the cow farm she lived by, saw the old greenhouses and plant shops she lived by, and my mom would have to stop at CVS to get me a ginger ale to calm my stomach. Everything about it made me freaked out and kinda sad, I’m not sure how else to describe it. 
2. I went to college 3 years ago and ""fell in love"" with this idiot pothead who dropped out of school 2 months in. I was absolutely destroyed and I never remember feeling so helpless, full of regret and numb in my whole life, it is another complex feeling I can't describe. Anyways the rest of the year at school was not the same. It was not as happy, started and stopped Prozac, and I almost failed out in my second semester. The house that we all lived in was across from campus next to another house. They were a little separated from the rest of the community on campus. My best friend at school asked me if I would live in the house next door next year, as she was going to be an RA there. I wanted nothing more to room with her, but I turned her down because I didn't think I could deal with living next to our old house every day. Every time I walked outside I would see everyone playing in the huge yard together and remember all the times we hung out on the patio and cooked dinner together and I knew it would make me unbearably sad. I was right. Every time I visited my best friend the next year, I felt haunted, I can't think of a better word for what I was feeling. I was sad and felt alone when I saw that house. I remembered all of the people I didn't want to remember and the good times I didn't want to remember because it was done and it wouldn't be the same. And I re-lived the moment when the idiot pothead dropped out of school and I couldn't deal with it every day. 

Currently, I am at a different college. After my freshman year, I started my sophomore year at the same college, but dropped out 2 months in due to major depression and generalized anxiety. I went home, did yoga, got a job, started taking classes at community college. This past semester, I've started at a state school close to home. Here is my dilemma: 

When I was at community college, I tried Tinder and went on a date with this guy (Adam) to try to get over another guy who I actually liked (Leo). I didn't have feelings for Adam we just hooked up and I was still thinking about Leo all the time. A couple months later Leo and I started dating so I politely let Adam know and he was totally understanding. Flash forward a couple months...I broke up with Leo because I couldn't stop thinking about Adam. I hit Adam up and we hooked up a few times but he wasn't as interested as he was initially. Eventually he pretty much ghosted me. But, with the virus going around, I was worried about him because he is an RN in the hospital in our capital city. I texted him, he said he was fine and wanted to see me, I said no? You're an RN, when things calm down we can hang out. Then he literally moves across the country 2 weeks later with zero notice. He didn't have to tell me, I realize that, but it would have been really nice to get some goddamn closure. 

What does this BS have to do with this post? Adam went to the state school that I am currently attending. I know what frat he was in, there's pictures of him on campus in places I've been, he has clothes with the school's logo, I know what building he studied in, etc. It's a goddamn nightmare because I only lived on campus for 2 months this semester but everywhere I go I see him and every picture I see of the school in this quarantine makes me think of him. Now he's somewhere else, I won't see him again, I have 2 more years of school, and I have no idea how to disassociate Adam and this school because I can't keep avoiding places that remind me of shitty things because it makes me feel a shitty type of way. 

WHY do I do this? How can I stop doing this? Help? 

p.s.  I'm sorry this post is not concise but I hope somebody will be able to help me with this. If you have read all the way down to this point wow bless you that is the kindest thing a stranger has ever done for me."
723,Why don’t I ever do anything right?,"I’ve been trying to be a light to people around me as of late, but I feel like I’m failing to help. I just want to help people, that’s all. Why can’t I ever do enough? Am I that stupid? I can even help people correctly."
724,does anyone else feel like they’re not human,i dont think im human i dont really know how to explain but ill try my best i feel like im some weird being like an alien or an angel but those with a lot of eyes but just trapped in this human flesh prison. i sound so silly but i just genuinely dont think im human and the only way to go back to my true form would be to die. i was just sent here as an experiment or maybe to help people but i know deep down i dont belong here even my parents told me ive been different and afraid of everything since i was a child and i really have and i can never communicate with anyone or even feel close to my closest friends and i look weird too. i always have this vision of my just transforming into this being with a lot of eyes and wings and i just dont feel like i belong in this body or on this earth
725,what do i do?,"i’ve been struggling literally since i was a child. i had obsessions/compulsions but i didn’t know that’s what it was. the fact that OCD is portrayed as a cleaning or tidiness thing (it can be but not always) made me never look into it. i’ve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and clinical depression. i beat an eating disorder that really almost killed me. i take medicine for my anxiety. but i’ve recently realized that a lot of my behavior and thought patterns fall into the OCD category. most of my thoughts and compulsions are about religious things and i have found great comfort in r/scrupulosity because i feel seen and heard for the first time since i was about 8. i’m a 21 year old female, college student, and have had the same amazing boyfriend for five years. i have a wonderful home life, good friends and family, i’ve never gone without anything i genuinely needed. i feel so much guilt for the way i’ve felt most of my life because on paper i should be extremely happy. 

my boyfriend just told me he doesn’t know that he can marry me (i thought for sure we were getting engaged this year because he just got an incredible job and i am graduating college next year) because of my mental health struggles. he thinks it’s emotionally exhausting and he can’t imagine doing this his whole life. i’ve struggled throughout our entire relationship, he was the first person i told when i broke down and started counseling almost six years ago, he was there for me in the emergency room for 14 hours when i had a panic attack and thought i was dying, he’s held me while i cried about wanting to be normal, he had to force me to eat when i almost wasted away, but he has never complained. in fact he told me just last year that all these problems are minuscule compared to all the other great qualities i have. last summer all we talked about was marriage and grad school and future plans. i don’t know how to cope with the potential loss of the person who means the most to me in the entire world. 

how do i stop burdening him? what can i do to get better faster? i haven’t been very proactive or stayed ahead of my issues since being in college makes it hard to get home to my preferred counselor, but i have sought out help. he just thinks it isn’t enough. 

i have hope that someday i will get better but he says that since this isn’t a phase and something that will be present my whole life it’s hard to
imagine being married to me.

that absolutely broke me. it all feels very unfair. i feel like i have been through so much in my 21 years, carried so much pain through childhood, teenage years, and now as i’m emerging into adulthood, and this is just one more thing that is going to knock me down. why do i have to struggle? i don’t understand and it just sucks and i needed to tell someone and i guess reddit was the place. i can’t sleep. i can’t stop crying. he’s fine. he’s probably not going to miss me or care. he says he loves me but i just don’t know. i love him so much and have since i was 16. we have been through so much and i know it has to be hard being my boyfriend, i know it must be difficult watching me struggle and being there for me but i have always been there for him too. i try to be supportive and helpful and kind and loving and do many things for him to be encouraging or to show my love. 

what else can i do?"

727,I’m done.,"Messed up my alarm this morning for a family video call and my mom calls me fucking bitch cause I hung up on her quickly so I could get ready for our video chat. 

I’m done lmfao this is it. This was the edge. The tipping point. And she pushed WAY past that. 

It’s just not worth it anymore :)"
728,Is this ptsd?,"(TW: suicide) 

I have a long history of mental issues and nearly ended my life earlier this year...now I can’t see people talk about that topic without getting immediately tensed up or triggering anxiety attacks. I like to write music and I can’t even use any sort of mental health topics in that without getting screwed up for hours. When I last talked to my therapist I had an extremely hard time talking about when I was suicidal, I ended up lying to him. I also hate hearing people talk about health issues because I used to have horrible hypochondria and that can set me off too."
729,I feel fucking crazy,"I was just talking with my boyfriend when I was saying I have no interests or hobbies or aspirations so I will never get into a uni and life beyond a levels is gonna be crap coz I have no idea how I will find a career idk. And he said it annoyed him how I had such a negative outlook on it and I will find something and I will just need to work hard and I will get somewhere. I muted myself and started crying I don’t know why I just did. I started smacking myself in the head and saying shit to myself about how I was boring my life will suck, he will leave me, there’s nothing for me. These then proceeded into me screaming into my hands that I need to harm myself and then that my life will be so shit that maybe I should just hand my self than listing all the things I could use in my room. I’ve calmed down now from all the crying and screaming. All my boyfriend heard for 16 mins was silence. But. Now he probably thinks I’m fucking crazy and wtf I am crazy what was that one comment and I go apeshit. I think I need some help..."
730,A question about emotions and love mainly,"After the trauma of what I’ve been through, I’ve lost the ability to love and care. The problem is I only loved and cared when I was breastfeeding my youngest coz all my good energy went to him. But I just want to know, with therapy alone, will the feeling of love and care come back? Will I be able to show empathy towards others? I feel like I have a black energy around me and even if I wanted to I can’t help anyone (I’ve been a carer for years and I’m burnt out). If it did come back for some, how long did it take?"
731,Do i have daddy issues or just issues in general or am i just stupid?,"Growing up i was kind of daddys little girl, however i was also super scared of him when he got mad and to this day am. If he got mad he’d hit me or hit me with hangers or make me kneel on the wood floor for an extended amount of time however i still dont find any of that weird i think its just normal. Fast forward to 8th grade my parents found out i kissed a guy and i was definately hit and he asked me if i was a prostitute and he said he couldnt even look at me. That was a big deal i was taken out of school for a while i overdosed and was in this mental facility place for a few days. A little after all that my parents found out i was cutting and my mom was crying and asked “you dont think we love you?” And my dad immediately asked my mom “why are you using the word love?” And turned to me and said “we really like you” tht whole convo has stuck with me to this day, i mean as a family we dont really use the word love however my mom does tell me she loves me once in a while and it still takes me by surprise every time bc honestly its weird but i still appreciate it. Anyways now im 21 and im just questioning my life style choices and behavior and wondering why i do what i do, maybe im just stupid i dont really know. It could also be that my parents were incredibly strict growing up and i have just always lived in fear of my father to this day really. But now in college with my freedom i seem to engage in risky sex pretty often and like i dont even need the emotional factor at all and its not like i orgasm ever from casual sex i just DO IT for whatever reason, like if i think a guy is attractive im probably gonna sleep with him the next day. I just love sex i dont really know why, maybe i just like being close and naked with someone and pleasing someone? I dont catch feelings very often but when i do i am all in and would do anything for the person. I have a bad habit of being a people pleaser and do tend to let ppl walk all over me sometimes. I love all the male attention i get and literally go out of my way to to go crazy at the gym and take care of myself for myself mostly but also because i like the attention i get. Im way too into my looks i admit but im also smart i go to a great university and major in computer sci (my dads wish but i dont mind). Since ive been in college i racked up a body count of 20 and i have also contracted herpes and ive always dealt with depression but dealing with the news of herpes was horrible but i have come to terms with it. But if my dad is ever upset i take it personal and automatically assume it has to do with me and get all suicidal and i hate it like its so crazy to get suicidal just bc someone is mad at you but now tht im at home bc of all this coronavirus im not allowed to do anything or go anywhere and i just dread living everyday in fear of my dad. I wake up and just sit around with my laptop on my lap to make myself look like im studying so i dont get in trouble, school is over! But i prob should be studying anyways lol idrk what my question is i just find myself constantly rebelling or am i just a normal college kid? Does it sound like i have daddy issues or just issues in general or am i just stupid and immature? I have decided whenever i do go back to school i am not gonna engage in anymore meaningless sex and just focus on school but im scared i wont be able to."
732,"Mental health tip: When recalling a negative memory, picture yourself under cold water. Your breathing will change automatically and make you grounded. To disguise your changed breathing if around others, pretend that you're yawning.","This is a technique that I've developed over the years, and it has works surprisingly well. I don't think anyone's immune to painful memories from their past. Those who might deny it may not remember a time in their life where they've dealt with it, but we all make mistakes and have these moments at some point in our lives. Personally, there's been periods of my life where I would have these moments many times a day. I was at a very dark place for many years.

My process for coming up with the technique was that at one point I was curious about Eastern breathing techniques and started experimenting on my own. I found it affective without the yawn for a while, but I noticed that it was noticeable to people around me. Through some trial and error, I settled on yawning, and it has been foolproof so far.

I have as much reason to have painful memories as anyone — perhaps more than most. I really hope this small thing helps someone as much as it helped me. And I don't post super often here or anywhere, so any direction on whether this fits the spirit of this sub would be really helpful."
733,Depressed? Anxious? Both or neither? 28F,"I’ve been so down in the dumps grumpy over the top moody. I’ve been stressed as heck lately too and stress makes me underrested and even more grumpy. Laughing doesn’t interest me, I don’t even remember the last time I smiled. I feel like I don’t have positive emotions anymore, I feel flat, and just not myself. I workout regularly, eat my veggies, drink my water, what else can I do to get back to myself???😔 I lost interest in literally everything, baking is my only solace. But I don’t even like eating the baked goods anymore (!!!!). I’m moving in with my boyfriend soon and Im really trying to work on myself asap. I don’t want my negative mood to affect our relationship. Help me help myself please"
734,I cannot open up,"Lately I have been going through some problems in my relationship due to the fact that I cannot let my emotions take over me. My personality is both introverted and extroverted, I have no problem making conversation with random people and I have no fear of talking in public as long as I have something prepared. On the flipside, I am always in control of my emotions, perhaps too much control sometimes to the point where you cannot tell the way I feel. I also use a lot of sarcasm in my day to day life and I genuinely don't give a fuck what people think about me but it is starting to affect my love life which has barely just begun (I'm 19). I do not know how to talk about what I feel when tbh I don't really understand what I am feeling."

Today X came to me describing a feeling I've experienced, the feeling of being a million miles away, X feels like he just exists and nothing around him effects him and he effects nothing, I've experienced this too but only for a short amount of time. X has been experiencing this feeling for over a month now and doesn't know how to get out of it. Does anyone have any suggestions for him?

Any suggestion would be much appreciated, thank you in advance :)"
738,Is this seasonal affective disorder?,"I’m wondering if what i go through could possibly be seasonal affective disorder (i am in no way self diagnosing, i would just like input from others that are more informed).

Could this possibly be seasonal affective disorder? Thanks."
739,"I have, for as long as I can remember, always wanted to be miserable","Had no idea where to discuss this so I just came here.

For as long as I can remember, I have always been a miserable person. I'm in my teens currently, and have most of my memories of my childhood.

I was always a very miserable and somewhat sad. Whenever I was offered something or given an oppertunity (I still do this) I would always try to deliberately sabatage my own happiness.

Does anyone have any idea why this is? Why I get the unwarranted urge to be miserable and stop myself from enjoying things?

If it helps to know, I only have one parent and she is extremely emotionally distant, and i'm not an emotional person in even the slightest. In all the years i've looked into psychology i've found no cause for my weird misery."

I’m not sad about getting older, but I’m just sad at how over the years no one really ever acknowledges my birthday. I’ve had my parents forget my birthday, I’ve had friends and teachers who disregard it, and a bunch of other things that happened specifically on my birthday since middle school that have made me feel left out and unimportant. I feel as if I shouldn’t be crying over a birthday but at this point I’m so frustrated with myself and my life."
741,15 years and I still don't understand depression [cross post]," It's been 15 years and I still don't understand depression.

Sorry for the length, I have trouble expressing myself clearly. I still feel like a loser, I'm still ultra sensitive to my and other's emotions, I still lack energy, I still rely on others to temporarily help me through doubt, and I still don't believe in myself.

I've had psychologists and psychiatrists (the latter being useless for me, including medication which never affected me positively). I'm seeing a better psychologist now, though it's just moments that sort of help.

I've gone from: 10 years ago (almost 20 years old then) where I did nothing but play 1 video game and was not studying or working (depression &amp; anxiety out of control), to 5 years ago where all I did was play that 1 game as well as play music in a beginner band (quit a few years later from lack of enjoyment and general stress/anxiety), to 1 year ago where I had finished an advanced diploma in a commerce subject. Right now I'm finishing a commerce degree and managed (through family) to get 2 casual jobs (I work about 10 hours a week).

I can see the progression considering I never thought I could ever get a job with my mental state, but I genuinely don't ""feel"" any progression. I still feel the same. I think part of it is being almost 30 and I still live at home, hardly work, no savings, barely have friends, don't get along with my family that well (we kind of all have emotional problems and 1 of my parents can be quite demoralizing and/or nasty, whether it's about my mental state or they are just in a bad mood..that severely gets to me, even little comments..that makes me feel bad being almost 30 and still get upset by comments from your parent, especially ones that I'm told not to take personally). On top of that I have significant anxiety in regards to socializing and driving my car. Part of that relates to being ultra sensitive and having no self-belief. I also don't seem to be able to develop much interests (or if I do its only minor) which stops me having conversations with people. In general I feel no purpose for my life. Working is fine sure, but not when you don't see a point in anything in life and don't enjoy much.

So I don't know what to do. I don't understand how I feel the same.. Or maybe it's just not that big a deal what I've done in the big picture (considering my age and the fact I have not managed to develop friends or interests). I keep genuinely trying but I feel no progress and still get beat down into misery over so many things. Makes me think I'm one of the people that actually should get rid of of themselves given my weaknesses.

Last thing to say is I try mindfulness, have read a couple self help books, still see therapist... it's like fighting a bushfire with a little garden hose. How can I be so bad at this?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: hard to do, but - it's been 15 years, I've made ""some"" career-wise progression but nothing huge (I think), still struggle with being ultra sensitive, have a therapist and had many in the past. Almost no friends, no savings, live at home with parents who can be nasty (can't move out yet). I don't know how it can be this long and still feel the same in regards to self-belief, being sensitive, etc. "
742,How can i bypass myself?,"I have a test this tuesday in school. If i dont make this test, i will be failed for this year and have to redo the whole class. Im in the worst mechanic school, i didnt have enough points getting into a better school because my grades from elementry school was too low because i was a ""troubled kid"". I feel confident in the knowledge for the test but yet ""i know that im gonna fail"". I keep beating myself over this. People say that if you do a test with confidence, then there is a higher chance of you actually getting it right but i cant get that to work. I just crumble. Its hard because like i said, i feel confident enough that i know the answers so i cant be bothered to studie but i still know that im going to fuck it up. I think that C is the a ""passed"" grade and F is that you have failed in American grade system. Iv never gotten any grade higher than just ""just passed"". Even when i studie for a test everyday for like 4 months or just two days. I just cant see myself making this test and my motivation is lost for studying because if when i do study, i fail, if i dont, i fail. The fuck do i do then?"
743,I am a compulsive liar and I don't know how to stop.,"Redditors, I know this must all sound awfull, trust me I feel like a terrible person and I'm writing this with tears, but I could really use some advice. 

I'm a 21f and I have been lying to people ever since I was a child.
It started because I had a very abusive childhood, and I would make up happier stories to people around me as to not have to face my reality.

Eventually I stopped doing that and started being honest to people, but I guess the sympathy that that got made me feel a bit better somehow. And the lying continued. I started telling tall tales, little lies for no reason (could even be something like what I had for breakfast) and got deeper and deeper.

Over the years I've dealt with alot of the hurt from my childhood, and have dropped alot of the lies I told, I moved country a few times and managed to ""start over"" but for some reason I kept doing it, I keep doing it.
I want to stop, I really do. It makes no sense, there Is no point to it at all. But it just shoots out of my mouth (I have adhd and often find it hard to think before I speak in general) . Its not even a conscious thought, it's never been a ""I'm going to deceive this person now"", but it just comes out. I've been embarrassed to go to a therapist. 

In half a year I'm moving country again (alone) to the other side of the world. I do NOT want to tell any lies to anyone I meet, it can be a fresh start and I want it to be. But this has become such a subconscious habbit, I don't know how to stop. 

Please if anyone has any advice or tips."
744,"My entire family (mom, aunts, all their kids) suffer from traumatic childhood (and adulthood). Will I ever be normal?","I’m a 23 year old female and my family and I have all suffered from the emotional and sexual abuse of my grandmother. She’s never touched us sexually but she’s always called me a whore or other derogatory terms. I remember the first day she called me a whore was when I was 5 and she found out I had a crush on my classmate. Growing up she often made inappropriate sexual statements to me like accusing me of “inviting men to have sex with me” by the way I looked at them or having sex with boys behind dumpsters... I never did these things but I did start having sex at an early age, when I was 15. 

I feel like this upbringing had a significant impact on my adult life and it has definitely had a great impact on my mom and aunts a lot more than us (their kids). My aunt has gotten to a point where she NEVER leaves the house because she’s afraid of crowds. My mom is a pushover, doesn’t bathe, and wears diapers kind of for no reason...

749,Can't watch a single movie to the end,"Hi. I can't watch any movie from start to end without overwhelming myself with emotions. This is fucking ridiculous and goes to the point where I become visibly angry at Dwight in the office, even though it's a damn comedy series. I cried several times during Inside Out, got light headed being happy for italian folks in that movie with a small village in the mountains. Same goes for even remembering the scenes from films, as if I relive the same moments again. I also sometimes become light headed after telling a successful joke or argument to a group.

At the same time I'm completely desensitized and can watch bunnies being tied to dynamite or actual footage of people dying, with no passing thought. It's even interesting sometimes. I do feel bad for them, but at a different level, where I'm taking mental notes about what can be done to make sure the situation never happens again.

So where does that put me? Am I insincere to myself? Please tell, this is very tiresome and annoying, and I am glad for any advice on how to get my emotions under at least some control"

751,I just hate everything right now,"So with this whole quarantine everything has just gone to shit. I don’t really know how to describe it but I just feel as though there’s no hope anymore. For context I’m 14 and gay and I’m not out yet to my family, school was where I could be myself and have friends and love being me, but I can’t do that anymore since I’m always home. It’s like theirs somebody watching and judging me all the time and it’s not good.

I’ve been depressed for a year or two and thought about suicide more times then I’d prefer to say, but I just feel like nothing that made me happy is there anymore. 

Today has been one of the worse cause I told my aunt who was visiting about how I don’t like dirt biking with my dad (me and my dad dirt bike a lot but I get scared since I’ve hurt myself badly while doing it) since I got hurt and I told her about my mental issues with breakdowns. Sadly I couldn’t bring myself to tell her how I’m depressed and have thought about suicide.

I just feel like I’m doing it for attention, I know my mental health is serious but I can’t help myself from thinking some part of me wants attention from it. Like if I commit suicide it would just be to get people to think about me, luckily I’m to much of a coward to go through with anything and I can’t bring myself to cut but I feel like I can’t tell anybody cause it brings attention to myself.

Again with being stuck at home and acting like somebody who’s not me is killing me, I want to come out to my aunt now that I know she’s good with my mental stuff and is there for me but again another part of me thinks I’m doing it for attention.

I don’t know what to do cause I don’t want to burden my friends anymore even though they would jump off a roof to help me. 

I told my chorus teacher through the comments of a assignment how my home life isn’t that good right now and I’m struggling so let’s see how that goes I suppose.

I just don’t know what to do with all this shit, I don’t like reaching out for help cause I feel as though I’d be burdening people."
752,"Dear mom,","I'm not giving you the silent treatment because I hate you, I'm not talking to you because you left me at home to not know where you are, not know if you're safe, to be left alone with my suicidal thoughts, to be scared I was abandoned. What you were supposed to do should've taken only an hour and a half, you left me alone for four. I'm sorry if this comes off as an asshole move, but I don't have the stomach to talk to you right now."
753,“Grain of salt” antonym,"What’s the opposite of “taking it with a grain of salt”? I’m a mental health therapist and this idea is important for those whom mistrust everyone, but is healthier to listen to some pieces of advice/criticism."
754,Why I can't get over how my now ex-friend behaved so childish?,"Technically it wasn't even a big deal but he caused me a lot of psychological pain. He saw it and he didn't care but wanted to continue a friendship and I do not. This was not a one-time occasion and he was so exhausting. The childish stuff varied from asking the same question over and over or make me say something I did not want or did not agree with. 

I know silly of me to get angry over this but for some reason, I have low immunity/tolerability to this kind of stuff. And if someone starts to be like that I start to despise the person.

But what really bugs me is that it pisses me off after many years later but I do not know why.

I keep ruminate on him and the others every day and then I get pissed off.

Any help?"
755,Some thoughts,"My biggest fear is death and not having enough time in life, yet here I find myself in the midst of this virus with nothing to do. Forced to move back home because of the pandemic. I feel trapped in my high school bedroom. No motivation to do anything. Here I’m surrounded by those that don’t seem to understand my point of view on anything. Always told I’m wrong. As if I’m the kid that would be picked last during recess. An outcast. It’s like I’ve returned home a stranger. So I spend my days mindlessly scrolling through social media and that only makes the hole feel more hollow than ever."
756,I feel like I wanna stay away from people even more,"I know everyone is social distancing and staying inside as much as possible but I feel like I wanna be even more alone. I don't go out apart from work and at home I usually watch TV shows and anime. I'm pretty happy with this lifestyle but I just miss traveling. However, recently I started feeling like I wanna take a break from social media all together. I'm starting to lack the energy to text and reply to my friend's mesages. I wanna watch more stuff, possibly write about movies and shows I enjoy. Just wanna take this break till I'm ready to talk with people again. I would like to know why I feel this way though I've been by myself for a while now."
757,"Me (29M), opening up for the first time","Morning all, I hope you'll excuse me for what will probably be a rambling wall of text.

So this all started a few days ago when I got into an argument with someone, which is fine, this is life right? We all argue sometimes. However, in the middle of this, I broke down, uncontrollably. Hyperventilating, tears, etc.. etc. This had never happened to me before.

Usually throughout life I've been happy go lucky kind of guy, nothing ever bothers me, I brush of arguments in minutes, at least I thought so, this made me take stock of previous encounters, discussions, incidents, arguments and so on. 

It turns out I have real black out rage when I get into stuff, no violence, just shouting and stuff. 

But I've also noticed when thinking about the last couple of years that I am having periods of massive lethargy, even for the things I love, then periods of mass amounts of energy, I even sometimes avoid my good friends and family, just because I feel so ""anti-social""


The issue is, I've always seen myself as the shrug it off, move forward kind of guy. But now I'm seeing more and more problems that need addressing, and I don't know where to start, who to talk to, or if I'm even capable of doing so?

Tbh, I just wanted to open up for the first time, see if anyone has these symptoms, or if anyone can direct me as to where and how to get help. 

Thanks."

759,I think I might have depression. But I really don't know. It's confusing and,"I'm really just not sure tbh.

I'm sure _something_ is wrong. I know it.

I feel like the one thing that I used to love doing, coding up cool stuff, is something I can't bring myself to start now. I don't wash or clean my clothes, my apartment is in a state and I'm only cleaning it because I have an inspection. I have impending deadlines and I feel either apathetic, or panicked over them. And my sleep schedule is weird. I feel like I flash between alert and falling asleep. My diet is shit, I can't cook and I don't want to mess up so I don't try. I haven't cut my hair in a year since I find it hard to even speak to a new hairdresser in case things go wrong and I end up looking like an idiot.

I have weirdly down moments, but I can always seem to put on a friendly tone and even joke around on a discord call. I don't feel bad all the time, but it hits regularly. I don't try to speak to people. I've been in quarantine for a month or so, but I don't speak to people. I have no friends here, and my family live at home. Only a few things make me genuinely happy, and I often struggle to show a happy reaction. I don't find my hobbies fun anymore and I'd rather just stay in and do meaningless stuff.

I've had mental breakdowns, and I feel like I have a long laundry list of circumstances that would fuck me up. I was prescribed anti-depressants last year but didn't take them, I guess I just didn't like the idea of pills and having a cloudy mind or something. Or I thought that the only way is to find my own way to deal with it all. I regularly repress these dark rants around people and it feels natural to do so.

Even now. I don't know if I'm that bad off. Others have it worse, way worse. I'm not exactly writing this very emotively right now. It's more like a rambling I've come up with in a perfectly emotionless state. Like a question.

Something is wrong, but I don't know if I've found the right word. I can't even prove it really exists to others. Not without such a word. But I don't know if my case is typical enough to ever get a label."
760,How can I be nice to myself when I hate myself?,"Long post, possible trigger warning, very sorry in advance. 
Today my younger cousin graduated from a 4 year university and while I am so proud of her and all the hard work she put in to it, seeing family members younger than me being so successful in their lives makes me feel like a loser. 
I’m so proud of them and so happy they are doing amazing things. But it’s like, how are they able to complete 4 year degrees and I’m still working on a two year, for 5 years now. I know we all have different paces in life and I know I should be kind to myself and understand that the circumstances in my life are much different than theirs. It still makes me feel like crap seeing them move on to these advanced careers, these wonderful degrees while I’m over here working as a low end manager just struggling to pay my bills. I feel like I’m always going to be the loser, the charity case family member."
761,Feel like the world revolves around my perception,"Dunno wtf is going on but atleast I'm self aware, things keep happening in the real world that relate to what I say and think.

Might just need to get sober but 🤠"
762,I (28M) have deep anxiety and abandonment issues. How do I create and maintain relationships?," Hi reddit.

So growing up, I was abandoned by both parents one after the other and passed along through relatives who never really liked me. I spent most of my time alone when not in classes and being the loner has always made me a easy bullying target. Ever since high school I've kept my guard up with other people, especially the ones that act nice around me, because I believe they have a ulterior motive/hidden agenda for it. I can't remember the last time I got a a hug or even a complement. I've also been in therapy for over 5 consecutive years and right now I just spew everything out and the therapist listens without more than 2 or 3 sentences per session, so I think I've given it enough time to work it out and just isn't.

I don't want to be alone anymore. It is crushing me inside that I'm this old without ever having friends and any dating experience whatsoever.

* What is a good starting point?
* How do I stop being scared of other people?
* How do I get close to someone without showing them the complete trainwreck I am inside and not cause them to reject me, refueling my deepest fears?

I've been trying hard the past few years to put myself out there but I have the strongest impression that the world is going so fast that people just want to move on to the next wave asap or are very impatient to deal with any of it.

TLDR: 28M with lots of emotional baggage, never having friends or girlfriends or meaningful interaction with strangers wants to change his social life around but has no idea where or how to start."

766,i just need help. i don’t know how to ask for help.

I can’t be alone with my thoughts anymore,I just need someone in person to talk to but I’m too embarrassed to ask to see a therapist or something
767,How do I deal with my mother who has Borderline Personality Disorder,"I tried looking up articles about this but it wasn’t really helpful. My mother is undiagnosed, would never get help or admit fault to a therapist, but my therapist believes she might have BPD and after research I think that’s correct. I just recently became an adult and now it’s a very different dynamic, as she becomes more and more aggressive. She guilt trips me constantly saying she’s afraid now that I’m an adult I won’t see her anymore, while also becoming super angry any time I do something on my own volition. Her arguing skills are highly impressive, (and always have been according to my father, her ex-husband,) and I have a really hard time getting untangled from the world she creates, still wanting to help her understand my side, still wanting her validation. I’ve tried arguing techniques meant for de-escalation but she recognizes them and becomes more aggressive when I use them. For example, if I say “I understand that’s how you see it, but it makes me feel...” she will say “No, that’s not how I see it, that’s how it is. You just hate me, and don’t want to listen to me.” In typical BPD fashion she’s always the victim. If I try to just straight up end/exit the argument it becomes a tirade of insults, I’m a coward or I’m ignorant or I’m a bad child. Each time I know I should turn the other cheek and continue to leave but it always turns me around to defend myself. One of my best friends says I should leave and never come back, and honestly I’d agree except for my three little half-sisters (who she also has been using to guilt trip me) who I love and want to see. Is there any way to control this and stop her from playing me like a fiddle? How do I set up strong boundaries? I think she may be too far gone for therapy or help, I think the only path now is defense."
768,Is this anxiety? How can I go about fixing it?,"hi, i don't really know how to explain this so I'm going to take an example which happened recently.

i saw a comment on Youtube which i really disagreed with and decided to reply. when i got replies back and read them, my heart started beating super fast and i felt overwhelmed. it wasn't because i felt hurt by the comments but because i started thinking about all the ways which i disagreed with them and wanted to reply and construct a well-written message.

i notice this happens in other contexts like during a class or reading things online (discord, etc) which stimulate the part of my mind which wants to argue/debate. i don't really understand why i can't be calm as i read them/reply to them, it feels maladaptive as it makes me want to engage in ""controversial"" conversations less and it also feels harder to think critically as i'm feeling so intensely. a very similar feeling happens when someone makes me angry or insults me. i don't know if these different stimuli are connected to the same ""thing"" that creates the physical reaction. 

it reminds me of the feeling of social anxiety but i'm not sure it exactly fits as i'm alone in my room as it happens, so it's not like anyone can perceive me as being anxious or i become embarrassed. 

can anyone relate to this feeling? 

also, is there anything i can do to try and lessen the intensity of the experience?

thank you."
769,First full day at new apartment!,"We are almost 100% settled in now. All we need are bed frames for all the beds, a few dressers for our clothes, and a few other odds &amp; ends. Otherwise, we have everything put where we want it and we are having our X-Finity service installed tomorrow so I will have proper Internet.

I have fallen in love with the neighborhood (we lived in this general area from 2004-2014, just down a bit further, closer to downtown where we are on the upper end now, closer to the next small borough over) and I love the apartment. This feels like home to me now a little more than before.

I truly feel ok here.

My comfort didn't stop the strong urges I get though. One hit as we were going to get something from the store when I noticed there are Dumpsters everywhere. There are many businesses around, and the Dumpsters are empty (shit down) but still there. It wasn't funny...it really hurt me in ways I can't even describe-mentally, emotionally, and even physically as I had to hold myself back from jumping out of the car and lighting one up, and I don't think hubby understood how serious I was because I was trying to crack jokes the whole time too. Defense mechanism so he would not see that I was actually freaking the fuck out. Badly.

Ah it is nice to be home...I am doing ok despite the urges right now. :)"
770,How do I like myself after being bodyshamed?,"There’s this guy I’ve been talking to for awhile and we aren’t dating but we might as well be. I’m transgender and he knows that but still seems really interested in me. I really want to ask him to be my boyfriend but first I’m very insecure about my body and think I should get that sorted out first. I wouldn’t just classify the insecurities I have with my body dysphoria. I know I’m a woman, the things I feel bad about don’t necessarily make me feel like I’m a man but they make me feel masculine therefore less womanly. Not like I’m not a woman but I’m... bad at being one. Especially because I only feel this way because they’re things cis women have said to/about me assuming that I’m also a cis woman. I’ve been made fun of for my height and my broad shoulders and the size of my feet. The thing is, I like being tall, I wouldn’t have such nice proportions if it wasn’t for my height. I also like my shoulders too, I used to spread body lava on them to make them glittery before people started making comments on how masculine they make me look. I’ve since not only thrown out my body lava but also any of my clothes that aren’t long sleeved and all of my shoes with even the slightest of heels. I mean, I didn’t wear high heels to begin with but I got rid of my Doc Martens and bought some thin-sole converse online to replace my regular converse. Now, this guy I like, I know he’s attracted to me. He’s always saying how pretty I look and we’ve made out a few times, but I worry that he’ll be ashamed to be seen with me since everyone seems to find me so grotesque, especially cause he’s a few inches shorter than I am and I don’t want him to feel embarrassed. 

I know I shouldn’t let this get to me especially cause I already like my body (with the exception of what’s downstairs) but I just feel so uncomfortable in public because I feel like everybody is judging my body in my head and I want to pursue the guy I’m seeing but I’m scared he won’t be happy with people knowing we’re together. It’s stupid too because he’s said nothing to indicate anything like that, I just feel so damn traumatized because of the way people talk about me. I don’t know what to do to feel okay. I just want to stop caring what they think. I want everyone to like me as much as I like myself when I’m not being bullied."

I'm a teen and for most of my life I have been extremely suspicious of people that I've known forever. I also have a pretty bad fear of the dark that is pretty irrational for my age. And I feel that I've worsened over the years now to the point that I constantly feel that something is out to get me and can't even look at the window in my room without thinking there is something watching me.

773,I only feel loved in an emotionally abusive relationship.,"Hey there stranger, thanks for clicking my post! ;) Real kind of ya, hats off to you!

But on a more serious note, I've been dealing with this problem. It's not too serious, but sometimes I think it is and I'm not even sure it's worthy of putting on this subreddit or if anyone will respond.

To put it simply; I've been in a slightly dark place recently, and I've come to a realization. I only feel loved in an emotionally abusive relationship. I want to be in one with someone I know, although I haven't made any moves yet. I know it will damage me, as I'm a particularly sensitive person but that's why I want it?? Okay let me just explain when I found out:

I have a friend who has been pretty rough on themselves, but rough as well on others. Recently they've been very dysphoric in coming out with their gender, and it turns out they were transgender. During this time he got into a bunch of fights with my other friend... and for some reason I got jealous. I wanted to be the one being cursed at, I wanted to be the one called names.

The other friend has been suffering from depression, and writes very self depricating poems. They are beautifully  crafted, and in my opinion masterpieces. However- I notice that when these two hate themselves I get jealous. I've thought that I was just being a toxic person, not wanting for them to be sad and have the spotlight on me all the time- but that didn't feel right. (I mean maybe I'm toxic but I still don't know.. ;-;) 

I've just now realized what I want. It took some time, but I had started writing in my journals and during that time I've come to a realization.

If I was the one they screamed at, I'd feel loved. If I was the one they'd hit, I'd feel loved. Just anything that they would to to purpousefully inflict pain on me, I'd love. I've grown closer to them every single time they've hurt me and I don't know why. Sometimes I've found myself crying over them, but it wasn't the bad crying. I was sad, but also happy?? Happy that I was sad???

It's becoming a trend now. I've spent many nights crying, and I've even once thought doing a bit of self-harm again, but that wouldn't satisfy me. I need for THEM to cut me. I keep letting myself get hurt over and over- but I won't be happy without it. They make me feel like I belong. What do I do?? HELP?!?!"
774,Tips on taking all of my pills?,"I want to start by saying that if there’s been posts covering this- please let me know, but i searched around and couldn’t find much on it. 

I take 5 pills a day. 4 in the morning and one in the afternoon. I always remember i have to take them but i rarely ever get myself to take ALL of them. I will always take my birth control because i know that not taking it could result in a kid and that’s a horrifying concept for me. I’m pretty good about taking my adderall because i know that i will feel it within a few minutes and i need to take it to get work done during the day. 

The problem is getting myself to take my Wellbutrin and lamictal. My aversion has a couple facets to it; a year and a half ago i attempted suicide by overdose so taking more then 2 pills at a time gives me a tad bit of ptsd. lamictal has no coating, tastes terrible, and makes me gag when i force myself to swallow it. The Wellbutrin has a coating so it doesn’t taste bad it’s just ugh another pill. I don’t feel immediate “same day” effects by not taking either of these. The effects pop up after a few days of not taking them. 

How can i get myself to consistently take all of my pills? I have a days of the week pill container so they’re all there together i just wake up and go meh i don’t feel like taking all of them. I really need to stay on track and be consistent with taking everything but i haven’t been able to for more than a few weeks at a time."

776,I’m struggling in my current environment.,"i’m really struggling with staying positive and being happy with my current circumstances. i’ve got a long history of mental illnesses, and it’s decided to play around with me again a little bit recently. It’s not as bad as it’s previously been, but my mind space is of course not the best. Fortunately, i have managed to stay safe and keep myself out of trouble this time around. However, my family members (mainly my mother) have been stressing me out a lot. They are the main contribution to my horrible mind space. They aren’t at all abusive, just infuriating to deal with at times. I have come to the conclusion that it would most likely do me some good to stay out of the house for a little bit and take a breather. The issue is that I’m just a teenager, and i don’t have any friends. So, i have no clue where i could possibly stay. I wouldn’t dare run away, my parents would have to know about where i am so that they know i’m safe. Does anybody have any ideas as to generic places that would help me other than the psychiatric ward? Thank you.

777,How do you go about communicating to a parent you need therapy and no longer see your life the way they expected it?,"I’m a female, 17- I have a minimum wage job that pays be 175 a week. 

My grades have gone to shit recently, and seeing that makes me anxious- but not for myself. I’m anxious how my mom will react... you see, I have been placed on a podium for years, getting praised at maintaining a 4.0 GPS and as I’ve gotten older, my anxiety disorder has worsened and I do believe it’s developed into more symptoms- into something else. I haven’t diagnosed any of this for the fact that my mom doesn’t believe in it. I have had this since I was 4- the most recent I can remember. I was 6 when I realized no one else feels like me normally, always feeling scared and dreading it. Like I’m always watching a scary movie at the part of the build up and never seeing the climax. 

My point here- without this rambling continuing- is I’ve had suicidal thoughts concerning school, and my thoughts towards it for years, and barely recognized it during the pandemic. And with quarantine making my 4.0 go to a 1.5 from me having no motivation anymore, I feel that dread go away for a moment, before thinking about my mom again. 

I want to have that conversation that they aren’t going to go back up, it isn’t possible with the little days we have left in school, but that I’m finally feeling improvement in my mental health. And how to even talk to her about supporting me financially with getting a therapist- to have someone who can help me in the future, address the suicidal thoughts and manage the manic episodes I see being more prevalent and common.

How do I even get her to believe I need help when I lie everyday to her face, playing this comical facade that I’m happy and bubbly. It’s draining, and I’m scared how to talk to them without making it seem like it’s a “teenager” thing, and I’m not some sort of shameful, selfish girl who doesn’t want to work hard anymore on school. I worded it earlier, I was working towards “education” instead of “happiness”, and “education” was leading me towards suicide."
778,Feeling like I’m not important to the people I consider close...,"Hey I just joined but I was wondering if anyone’s felt this before...
My boyfriend was in a terrible mood on Friday because of work. I said I love you to him and he didn’t say it back which hasn’t really happened before. He drank a lot that night. He started to loosen up and Friday felt better. He had a bad hangover Saturday and I let/made him recover and sleep and feel better. I tried to get him to engage in sexual activities with me and after some convincing he finally did and then we went to bed. Well he didn’t sleep last night. He said his insomnia was bad. He was in a bad mood again and started working himself to the bone on some home projects we were working on. He really kind of ignored me all day.
My best friend recently found some new friends and has been spending time with them. I think it’s healthy to have other friends but since he found new friends he really has casted me aside and hardly spends time with me now. 
I don’t feel like I fit in my world right now. My depression has spiked from this and I just want to pack up my stuff and leave this life and find something else. 
I never truly feel like I fit in any group and this just feels like the one thing I had got ripped away.
Any tips on how to make this situation better/feel more in place with the important people in my life?

782,"I'm alone, and its my own fault","I've been in love with a girl for 5 years. We've dated on and off I started liking her and after a year we dated and she broke up with me,  but I never managed to get over her. A year later we become close  friends and begin to start falling for each other. Her and my best  friend were also close and I knew that he had made moves on her but we  ended up kissing and talked as though we both wanted it. My friend told  her to accuse me of rape because he wanted her and wanted her to push me  away so he could have her. She did it, she accused me of rape. I became  suicidal for a year and a half before we started talking and ended up  officially and seriously dating and it was wonderful, but she began  pushing me away in march from not being able to see me during corona 19  and i said we should take a break and she agreed. Now its months later,  we've seen each other slightly but shes been pushing me away and seems  to be choosing to talk to others over me. It hurts me so much that she  seems to not care about me and that she's moved on and been happy but I  have to be sad and she doesn't seem to give a fuck until I bring up that  I am sad .

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I don't seem to care about other people besides her. Idc about the attention or love from family or other friends except hers. I don't know how to deal with this constant feeling I get from her and its becoming too much to bare."
783,Very scary emotional sensation,"Hi - I'm a 50 year old woman, not a drug addict or major drinker, pretty healthy in every may. I've had major depression a few times and I have nightmare disorder, insomnia on and off, panic attacks from time to time...nothing that's really bothering me right now. 

I am a pretty quiet, very introspective and philosophical person. My problem is, I keep getting stuck in this sensation (not thought, SENSATION) that time is flattened out.  I am experiencing my whole life on one time plane at once. Yesterday is the same as today, is the same as the day as I was born and the day I die and...I have a high school paper due and I'm getting married and giving birth, and being abused my me father and graduating college and dying and being born.  Its not in a frenetic emergency sort of way, it just seems like time has all flattened to one moment, and it's all right now. 

It's very disconcerting,  I don't know what to call it, I don't know if I need help, I don't know if I am scared or what to do. I am not mentally ill..(or at least..I wasn't? ) but this feels very strange and overwhelming...and if everything is happening right now, I can't waste time. What do I do? I need help I think."
784,He’s watching me,"So I’ve been in a depressive state for most of my life, and I’ve been suicidal recently, i don’t know what I have but when I get a panic attack I feel like the man watching me is taking over, like he’s trying to control me which makes me want to hurt myself. I’m scared, does anyone else no what I mean?"
785,My brain reacts to any sort of romantic or physical affection like I’ve had sexual trauma but all of my trauma hasn’t been sexual related.,"For a few years now I haven’t been able to do things like flirt, hold hands, kiss, or even think about any sexual activity without getting sick, nervous, guilty, ashamed, or just terrified. Mostly I’ll feel guilty and nervous thinking about any affection, but I feel all of those things when considering sexual interaction with someone I love. I know I don’t need to make myself do anything since I’m young but I want to be able to in the future. I keep telling the people I date that I believe in waiting till marriage, and while I do believe in that, I don’t know if I’ll even be able to after words. When I think about things like kissing, sex, hand holding, hugging, cuddling, making out, or any other physical affections I just get nervous (and feel the other emotions i listed before) but when I think about sex I get terrified almost to the point of a panic attack, I feel vulnerable like I have no control and enter a fight or flight mode, like anyone who even touches me is going to try and take advantage of me in some way. I don’t know what to do because I want to be able to have kids, and I used to long for the day I’d be able to have a baby, but now I’m even considering adopting because I’m so scared of physical affection and contact. I want to be able to be affectionate with my boyfriend/husband because it’s supposed to be enjoyable, but if I even managed to get myself through it I’d probably cry or panic after words. I do know what to do."
786,I hate it here,"My mom and dad were play arguing I didn’t care I was just eating&amp;scrolling on my phone when my dad says “ am I a bad man for caring for his kids?” I paused , is yelling at me for not winning my last game in soccer a sport in which I repeatedly said i didn’t want to play, yelling at me an telling me to shut up  because I lost, making me learn to cry silently because you yell at me more when I cry , getting mad at me when I say I don’t want something some extra food?, touching my thighs , 

Yelling at my brother when he does the littlest things ,Smacking my ass, I can never be in the same room as him without being uncomfortable, when we were playing super man and putting your hands under my shirt to hold me up is that what being a good father is? I was eight, Calling anybody not straight a fag? I can’t even come out because of this ,I’m going to die without ever telling him I’m pan sexual ,I swear I’m one hair away from just gutting him like a fish. 


I need a coping mechanism I really do."
787,Please help scared to sleep after sleep paralysis,"its 7:30am. about 24 hours i experienced sleep paralysis for the first time ever. it happened after going on a 2 day bender doing alcohol and drugs and i fully blame myself for it. at first i thought i was just tripping but after reading up on it i know 100% what i experimented was sleep paralysis. and it was the most terrifying thing ive had to through 

like i say its a first time thing and i wasnt prepared at all. im 19. im really want to avoid this happening again and cannot bring myself to sleep. i need some reassurance because ive never felt this way before :( 

sorry for the long vent"
788,How do I get rid of an image stuck in my head?,"I have an OCD concerning statues of buddha,lately they got stuck in my head for the last 3 days and are extremely mentally draining,is there a possible way to remove these images from my mind or not get drained and anxious from them?"
789,Mental stress,Y can't I think of something that happened just happened and I feel hard to even think of a easy word to answer...I mean it's hard for me to make up words and even spell that out ....I feel uneasy and sometimes I can't answer stuff that a 5 year old could ...I feel way more dumb abt myself this happened after I turned 17 ..the beginning of my sophomore year...I don't know the reason for this kind of disorder
790,Trapped,I feel so trapped. I have to live with my grandparents which is bad enough since I feel as if I own nothing nor do I have a lock on my door. I legit just asked for some pads and this morning I found them on a table with a note that said I had to clean something in exchange and I just feel as if I’m trapped in someone else’s home and I feel so alone. I have so much school work and exercises to do but I can bring myself to do it. I watch tv and shit all day but I don’t enjoy it and I’m so fucking angry but I don’t have enough energy to do anything. What do I do?
791,I contemplate the thought of death often.,"Honestly. From day one my life has been a mess.
I was born to a single mom because my father was to scared to raise a child and ran. But that didn't stop him from coming back 5 years later to just knock up my mother again and leave. 

After my father was gone for good my mom married my step dad. This man became my worst night mare. Im not sure why he was so terrible to me and my brother, but he took everything out on us. It was rare that he physically abused us, but he would always say the most terrible things that just made a person feel completely degraded. He and my mother had 3 more children and me and my brother were essentially left to our own devices. We were shunned by our ""family"" and forced to stay in our rooms besides to eat and go to school. 

In my early teen years I attempted my first suicide attempt. Just the basic of cutting my wrists. But I ofcourse failed which lead to me being hospitalized for a week. My step ""dad"" made sure I felt like the biggest piece of shit on the planet for it. 

Due to this I became mad at the world. I hated life, and I hated everyone in it. I joined the wrong crowd at school started doing / thinking awful things that I regret to this day.

After my first attempt It was decided that I needed to move in with my grandparents. Now there is no words that can describe how much I love them. They have treated me like their own since the time I moved in. I really love them like they are my mom and dad. The next year with them was the best year of my life. 

After the year was over it was time for me to move back in with my parents. And the abuse began immediately again. My anger in the world just got worse. I deeply grew to resent human kind as a whole. After about 6 months of living with my parents again I could no longer take their beatings so I left for my fathers. 

I was with my father for a better part of a year and then joined the Army. I did good, completed basic training, and then got fucked over. Ofcourse problems with my job that I won't go into detail with stopped me from moving onto AIT and I was trapped in Benning for an addition 8 months. That was hell. 

After I finally left Benning for AIT thats when things got bad again. The army had me grow into a better person, I was able to ditch the horrible thoughts I had about humanity, and understand that the thought process i had was wrong. But it lead to my understanding that I was trans, and had been suppressing these feelings with hatred and fear due to my parents. 

This lead to 3 more suicide attempts all within about 6 weeks. After the 3rd attempt I was honorably released from the service. 

Now I live back at home with my grandparents. And every day I feel like a failure. I couldn't make it doing my dream in the military. I can't be who I am because of the looming shadow of my step father and overall anti-lgbtq feelings in my family. And I just want to die.

Am I really suppose to die at 20. I feel so young. But life feels like it doesn't have much time left. I dread waking up. I hate doing anything. I can barely eat. I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror. I get no enjoyment out of anything. And if anything could save my life it would be just genuine love from one person."
792,I have no friends left there is nothing left for me (vent about everything lol),"My last friend left me, about a month and a half ago but I finally realized today that he left me for good and it’s now finally starting to hit me hard. All I’ve done for the past month and a half is think, I daydream to cope, I imagine things. I always feel like I’m here for something more, I feel like I’m some supernatural god destined to save the world or some storybook bullshit, I guess I use that as a way of coping with the reality that there is nothing for me. I’m always sitting there looking for that “moment” that I’ll show everyone who I truly an but the truth is that I am nothing and pretty soon the only thing I’ll be is just a statistic. 

My parents also found out about my self harming a month ago and I’ve stopped since then but now its so hard to be near my parents, I can tell all they think about around me is the fact that I self harm, they hate me for it. It gives me constant anxiety and it makes me even more stressed. I guess this is more of a vent so many people probably won’t read all this. 

I wish I could converse, every conversation I’ve been completely detached from lately, I have to forcibly get myself to respond to my parents. My social anxiety has gotten worse and worse and it’s gotten so bad I’m scared to talk to people even online. I just can’t talk anymore. I want to go back to therapy but my parents think I fake everything despite the fact that I stare at a wall nearly most of the day. Sometimes I think people are too stupid to understand me but that doesn’t make any sense because I’m the one that’s actually stupid. 

Sorry for this jumbled mess I just wanted to put this all out there for maybe someone to read."
793,Texts,"Hello, what are some good science backed mental heath texts a college graduate should read? Thank you."
794,Where could I find a place that might have suggestions to respond to somebody who want to get you down?,For specific situations for instance.
795,Meditation,I suffer from depression and anxiety. It’s been something I’ve struggled with throughout my whole life. I am 28 years old. And just really feel like life is taking a toll on me. My therapist wants me to start meditating. I tried doing it a few times but it just felt weird. Also my thoughts kept racing. Despite trying to be at peace. Has anyone discovered if meditation has helped a bit at all? Should I keep trying and stick to it to see if it makes a difference in my mental health? I just want to feel better. If you have any success stories with meditation please let me know . Also if you have any tips please share!
796,I don’t know what this feeling is??,"I feel sad, like so sad that I can’t sleep but not crying sad?? (Sorry if the post is weird I just don’t use Reddit very often)"
797,Breaking down walls,"Alternate cause my gf knows my reddit and I dont want her to worry. I've been with my girl for over 2 years now and she's helped me immensely with a lot of my issues (insecure,  depression etc.) But she tells me that I never show any emotion other than jokes. I know I have trouble expressing myself and was wondering if their were any ways I could break those walls so to speak. Because I honestly don't know how. Sorry if this seems like a silly thing to ask, but I want to try and better myself."
798,I’m Never Happy,"I literally don’t know why, but I always feel depressed. I have nothing to be sad about anymore. I have a girlfriend, a solid plan for the future, and my social life is good. I just can’t help but feel empty. If I do feel happy, it only lasts a little bit and the crash is very bad."

800,How to help girlfriend with PTSD stemming from abuse by multiple personality mother,"Repost from PTSD. Seeking as much help as possible. Would be greatly appreciated :)

Witnessed my girlfriend having a PTSD episode for the first time

Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So I've been dating this girl for about two months, and I love everything about her. As cliche' as this sounds, she's been the greatest thing to ever happen in my life and I wouldn't trade her for anything. We're college aged lovebirds enjoying every moment together.

I've been staying at her place for about a week and tonight was the first time I've witnessed her PTSD episode come to fruition. Now, I already know about her condition and that she's had flashbacks and episodes before. This all stemmed from growing up with a mother who had multiple personality disorder to where during her mother's bad days she was abused heavily to the point of trauma. As of recent, my GF's episodes have been far less frequent and a lot better, and I personally have never seen it happen. 

Until tonight.

Earlier in the day, she mentioned about having hallucinations and seeing the wall turn from white to purple wavy colors. She mentioned it was really nothing and not bad at all. I put it in the back of my mind and paid no further heed, as the rest of the day was very much a happy one, albeit I did notice her seemingly tired a bit more. 

Tonight, we were laying in bed and after some merrymaking we were chilling and resting in silence. However, soon I started noticing tears form. She claimed it was nothing, but I knew better. I hugged her and held her close, then she started balling in my shoulder. As I have no experience, I did what I best thought I could do: I kept telling her everything is alright, I'm here, and I'll protect and be with her always no matter what, hugging her as tight as I could.

She continued for about thirty minutes in my arms, then seemed to have calmed down. She was less audible but she said she felt better. I turned on all the lights and currently have some of her favorite songs playing and get her comfortable enough to get some good sleep. 

I haven't had a deep conversation concerning the specifics of how her episodes manifest, what they're like, and how best to deal with them due to not wanting to instigate a possible episode. I've entered in this relationship knowing full well about her condition and I still love her anyways and want to be there even more and help her the best way possible. She's been seeing a therapist near our college since last year, until COVID-19 happened and we moved back to our respective homes from college. She said she dissociated a lot in the past and she's had a mental breakdown episode that lasted for two weeks last year that prompted her to start therapy. 

Anyhow, as someone who can say they don't have much experience with PTSD, how can I best help her as her boyfriend? As of now, I cannot physically be with her 24/7, so I'd love to know tips for long distance help as well. Just anything in general to help her through this condition and help her be as happy and feel as safe as possible."
801,I wanna kms,I would write some long thing about the reason and rhyme but I have nothing to say other than what's in the title.
802,I often have very dark thoughts about things I see,Sometimes I'll see a bird and all I can imagine is stomping on its fragile skull. Even humans sometimes.  It really scares me and sometimes it makes me feel inhuman. I know it sounds edgy and I just made a post about wanting to kms but I just feel like venting. I dunno.
803,It’s been rough lately,"There’s been a change in my family dynamic lately and it’s taken a toll on my mental health. I’m filled with worry and anxiety, my sibling who has always done a great job at protecting themselves now seems vulnerable and unpredictable and calls on me for help. I would go to any lengths to help my family but I’m trying really hard to stay calm through it all. It’s extremely stressful and because it’s not happening to me I feel I can’t vent to anyone irl. So I’m trying this out, to see what happens. I have anxiety and depression, I’ve tried meds and know I definitely need therapy. Sadly professional help isn’t much of an option at the moment bc I cant really afford it. Music always helps so I’m trying to relax maybe meditate. Any advice or kind words would be appreciated. Thank you :o)"
804,I ate three full meals today!,"I have always had a struggle with my weight, and have often resorted to unhealthy and toxic habits (such as only eating one meal a day). But today I had three full meals and didn’t even regret a bite! I was just super excited about this and wanted to share since this is something I’ve been dealing with for years."
805,Should I be worried for our safety,"My daughter's father has had some severe mental health decline since his physical  health started declining. He was never super mentally stable but I never felt scared that he may hurt me or my daughter or family. Lately  he has been acting as  if we are together although I  express clearly  that will never happen again. He has been talking about killing himself and how he is upset our daughters  life has been ruined by him. One example of weird things he says and does: Yesterday my sister  was visiting and he happened to  just pop up with some random person. He later said that the other person was someone he pays to hurt people because  he  didn't  recognize the  car. I asked him to no longer come to me house. I not normally a anxious or paranoid person but I  am getting a  freaked out feeling he may come to my house and shoot us all and then himself. He hasn't  said this specifically but has talked a lot about wanting to die and has a lot of anger at me and my daughter for no reason. His health issues stem from alcoholism and I feel like his mind just disappeared along the way. I am wondering if I should  seek help and if so, how do I do it?"
806,Therapy - fuck off covid,"I collected all my bravery this morning and called the local centre of mental health to make an appointment.
I was so nervous that my voice was shaking and i heard the heart pounding in my chest, I've never had therapy before and I'm scared, but also determined so i called anyway.

They informed me that they're only doing online/zoom therapy at the moment (even though everything it's slowly reopening). It's for safety, i get that and I agree - but this hit so hard to me, after years I finally called, i finally wanted to start and I don't think I'll be able to start with video therapy and others long distance tools. 
I'm still thinking about it, but hell I need a 'normal' sitting, it's already extremely difficult as it is.
I'm so mad, sorry for venting."
807,I'm in dire need of some advice,"I'm not really sure if this is the place for this post, but I might as well start here.

I'm a 20 year old guy. I dont have a job, license, or anything really other than an ID. When I was going through high school, my parents never made any real attempts at guiding me towards being an adult, they just let me sit in my room and play games all day. On top of that, for some years before whenever I would try to spend time with them I would get shut down, eventually I stopped trying.

After graduating, they expected me to start looking for a job and getting my license, and I I still havent been able to pull myself out of my room enough to get either. I think I might have depression, considering I cant look myself in the mirror without thinking something along the lines of ""you're worthless"" or ""you're so unattractive."" I have a very short temper which I've read is a possible sign of depression, and some days I find it hard to commit to anything, even things I enjoy alot. 

This probably seems scattered and disjointed, but I just dont know what to do, or how to go about actually being an adult."
808,It all hurts,"This will be kind of long but .
My life has , never really had any happy moments , with all I’m able to remember , I’ve been in a point of pain and hurt all my life , and last night made it all worse , I got in an argument with my mum over a matter of being put into a mental ward for a week without my willingness to comply and I looked over at my stepdad and he snickered , it set me off and I charged him , pushing him and slamming him into walls and tables , it eventually got to the point where I was pinned under him with his knees digging into my back whilst the cops were on there way , I’ve never gotten along with my stepdad and he has gotten away with a lot of stuff In the past and I was sick of getting treated by shit by him , he blames me for everything and complains when I blame him at all , I’m sore all over with it feeling like a knife is drilling into my ribs and my shoulder blades feeling like someone is hitting me with a baseball bat , my arms are sore and it hurts to move them , I keep feeling like I’m going to throw up and am continuously gagging like my body is trying to."
809,Giving up my meds without GP support,"Hiya x I (X42) have suffered clinical depression and GAD for many years (18 years) and have been on and off medication throughout. 
At the moment, I am on Fluoxetine and this bout of depression/anxiety has lasted about 1 year- but I think I’m ready to cut down on my meds to see how I feel. But with The Rona, I really don’t want to bother my GP so I’m thinking of doing it on my own. I do have support at home ( though it’s not that great). 
I have done this many times before in the past but always with the GPs guidance. 
Should I hold off and give myself anxiety because I’m waiting or do it and have anxiety because my GP didn’t ok it? I think I’m just looking for advice."
810,I nee,"English isn't my native language, so i have to say sorry.

I'm 20 years old and i been all my life sad, even when i was a child; i don't know why, i was a 1 parent kid, but that wasn't the reason of my feelings, i just felt like this all the time. When i started the high school i was diagnosed whit a degree of autism, depression and anxiety; i did not give importance, that wasn't mean that my life could change, but now i think i was wrong.

I've been taking my current medication since i was 17 and i really hate it; i can't cry, all my thinking are gone and i just feel nothing all the time. All my bad feelings and thinking makes me feel alive, human, but now i feel just like a robot with no emotions and i need to feel bad again, and i just don't know why. My family and friends says that is good to see me happy, but i don't feel happiness or sadness, i'm just a empty egg shell. Why i need to feel alive? I just want to cry again, i want to feel that things are bad, i want to thinking and overthinking the things, i want to sleep again, cus my medication only lets me sleep 3 hours maximum per day, I can't eat without wanting to throw up everything.

I think I'm desperate and it all started with those damn pills, or maybe they are just losing their effect and I drown in a glass of water. this is something that I can't even talk to my psychologist for some reason, anonymity makes me feel comfortable saying it."
811,"Uni deadlines, depression, Covid 19.","Hello all, this is my first post here today, and I'm not feeling great.   


A bit of background, I have Aspergers, and struggle to stick with things, as well as Cerebral Palsy, which I have read, somehow effects organisation skills.  


I'm from the UK so I've no clue what GPA means, or is, but anyhow, onto the point:  


I'm in my first year of uni, I somehow passed college with a distinction (A\*) and am now onto uni and....I'm struggling, mentally, especially in these times. I like to go out and go to museums as I'm into history. However, I've not been able to do anything obviously.   


I handed in three assignments in early may, 1-3rd. Then have three more due coming. It's too much for me to manage in such a short time frame. On top of this, I struggle with depression, so have missed some time due to mental health. I applied for an extension last week, as I had learned my grandparents had not been following guidelines and both are heavily at risk, they keep inviting people over. It's put a complete and utter slump in my mental health...I just can't focus, even on things I like. I've spoken to them but it's very clear to me they won't listen or respect my opinion. I've now applied for another week extension stating bereavement on my grandparents' health and lack of...sensibility. I just feel so shit and anxious...  


I'm sorry if this comes off as an incoherent rant...I mean it is. I just needed to clear my mind somehow, somewhere."
812,I need help.,"I, (14M), have been fighting with depression for at least 2 years now. It sounds weird that a teenager would have depression, but that stance is understandable without knowing the backstory.

Since kindergarten I have had a very good friend. Our moms were friends, so naturally, we began spending a lot of time together. We went to the park, each others houses and outside in general.

When we started going to school, I learned he had type 2 diabetes, so when one day he dissapeared from class for 1 year straight, I didint think much of it. I didint know what had happened.

A year later, he was allowed to go back home, so we decided to go to his house. Because of the amount of time that had passed, I saw him as a new person. Funny, caring amd happy. That was the last day I saw him.

A week or so passed. A normal school day had passed and I was back home. My dad came home at 6PM and I went to greet him. When he opened the door, I saw him crying for the first time in my life. I started asking what had happened and started crying aswell. 

He then told me, that my best friend had drowned it the ocean. They were out on holiday at the beach. He went into the watter and didint come out. When his mom started searching for him, she couldnt find him.  What followed was a 2 day search opperation, where they looked for him with helicopters and boats. After the 2 days had passed, they found his dead body washed up on the beach.

I cried. I cried a lot. I never really recovered from that. Of course, at the time I was younger and people didint think anything of a mental illness. I didint have anyone to talk to. If I told my classmates I had depression, they said I was lying and made fun of me. A teenager cant have depression, right?

Maybe 2 years later, a psychologist came to work in the school. I begged my mom to let me go there. She did, and I started going. It was only once a week though, so I cant really talk about everything that frequently. 

At that point I had developed strong/intense depression, and that led to self harm. I now started wearing long sleeve shirts and jackets to hide my cut marks. I had also told the psychologist that I had suicidal thoughts, because, well, I did. She figured out about my self harm. She told my parents, who were concerned. They tried cheering me up, always being there for me and handled me like a fragile vase, unlike before - as a child, whose only feelings were happy or sad. That didint work on me, but just seeing them panic and try so hard to make me happy, that alone made me stop.

Thats why I am here. I need someone to talk to. Because of quarantine I cant meet up with her. I cant handle it any more. I NEED help. But that all starts with talking to someone about it."
813,I just want to feel like I used to.,"So things have been getting rough again.. I haven't been sleeping well and work is stupid-unnecessarily stressful. Today I had a rough day at work and then I went on a quarantine date with my boyfriend, it was our first date, I think he wanted more than a hug at the end of the date but with my past experiences I want to take things slow.. it was talked about before the date, doing more than just get food and chat, but I said I wasn't sure if I was okay with that. He was respectful of my feelings, something I'm really not used to.. but I think he may ghost me because I didn't put out on the first date.. he may have just gone to sleep.. but my anxiety is hitting hard and I can't sleep and I have to be at work in two hours for a hell of an 8 hour shift where I may or may not have a break to catch my breath and get water.. I love the job some days but others I hate it with a passion and I want to die because I can't quit, its my only chance to get T.. 

Things used to be so much better.. I was happier.. I was doing things I shouldn't but at least I had an outlet.. it wasn't good but.. idk. I wanna be myself but I haven't been since ""the incident"".. 

I've been told that I'm living in the past and I need to move on.. it wasn't that bad.. but it was.. some days I can't get that awful day out of my head, I think of all the ways I could have prevented it.. and I could've been fine.. and I wouldn't have all this shit going on in my head.."

815,please help,im in a extremely rough state right not and dont see any option other than suicide
816,I'm here for anyone &lt;3,"
I've gone through some pretty hellish things myself. I've attempted (or at least gotten close) to suicide many times. It's incredibly draining to live with mental illness. There's a lot of guilt associated with feelings and thoughts of suicide and depression. It's a constant battle against your own brain waking up every day. I totally understand. 

Even if you consider your circumstances ""not that bad"" and feel guilty about your bad feelings. Even if you know there are people going through worse.. your experiences are just as valid!! No problem is too small to be listened to. 

No problem is too big to deal with, either. You are not a burden for having intense thoughts on your mind. You aren't ""too much to deal with."" If you fear opening up because you think that it's going to push others away- well, forget that thought entirely! I'm one of the many willing to listen. You are not too much. You are worthy.

If you have lashed out on others, pushed people away, or isolated because of depression/thoughts... know that I understand that, too. 

It can be harder to accept people into your space if you are surrounded by toxic people yourself, don't have learned coping skills, or have guilt making you feel like pushing others away is the only option. 

If you have been rejected by family, have your feelings/illness ignored, are afraid to open up, or don't have the resources readily available.. I understand how hurt that can make a person feel. I know some people's approaches to mental health are not always the most helpful- and that not everything works for the same person. 

There are so many suicidal people. From so many backgrounds. From so many circumstances. All with varying levels of support/reactions around them- as well as internal coping for themselves. 

Even if you DO get up every day, struggling with mental illness. It can be draining. It can feel hopeless. Even with help, sometimes it can be hard. And for you, too, I offer love and support. Your struggle is not unnoticed. If you struggle to function and focus every day, and still pull through. I am proud. 

And if you relapse, break down, or feel unloved above all else.. Know that your feelings are valid, and I am here for you, too. And despite the ache.. I am proud of *you*  too. 

Some of us live in complicated situations. Some of us have done things we're not proud of. Some of us have gone through immense trauma. And some of us are just.. Tired of life. 

But everyone deserves to break through barriers. Celebrate small things. Be in touch with your feelings. See your aspirations and reach for them with all your strength. Even if you have none. Even if your identity and sense of purpose are out of whack. Hell.. You deserve to be here anyway. Even if you see nothing to live for. Even if you're in an environment that makes it hard to heal. You are so fucking stellar and I am PROUD of you. 

To give up.. and being afraid.. to break down and scramble for reasons to stay here..is all just- part of the battle. And you have absolutely nothing to be fucking ashamed of. 

Whether someone has hurt you, or you have hurt someone. Whether you struggle with a terminal illness or you're having a hard day. Or week, or month, or life. I'm telling you, your feelings are valid. I getchu. Anyone can be depressed. But what matters to me is that you are heard, or at least find some solace in the fact that you are worthy of a good life.

Even if it takes a while to get there, and even if it still is a struggle now and then once things get better. Self improvement is always possible, and I swear to god, I'll respond to anyone who messages me.

(I'm lgbt+ friendly as well if you're someone who has homophobia surrounding you/or if you have gender dysphoria. Just an added thing.)

Don't be afraid to reach out to me. I'll listen. To your stories, to your worries. I'll give you advice; if you ask, if you'd like. If you want I can just listen. I can be a friend if you need one. I can keep things lighthearted- hell, I'll send you memes and listen to your interests and share mine. 

Anyway, sending good vibes your way mdudes. You aren't alone. &lt;3"
817,Hopeless... Lost... Scared. idk what to do,So I (22 f) have struggled with anxiety and some depression for my whole life. But lately something completely different has started happening. I will admit this whole pandemic has been really tough on my mental health but I’ve never felt anything like this before. Lately I’ll just get this feeling that comes and goes in waves. I’ll be feeling okay and fine then suddenly it feels like I’m completely disconnected to the world around me like I’m high or something and while I feel this disconnected feeling Ill go back and forth between feel such intense levels of despair that I feel like the only thing I can do is lay down and wait to die or feeling a rush absolute frantic energy of “no this is too bad this is too terrible I have to just go kill myself or do something about this right now because like is too awful” and its really scary because I’m still coherent enough to be thinking “what tf is going on what’s wrong with me right now” but I have absolutely no control of the emotions. I’ve never been suicidal or had any thoughts like this before. And like I said most of the time I’m normal and fine. Just every so often this happens and it leaves me absolutely floored. I’m really confused and really scared because I don’t know what’s going on or what’s going to happen. Does anybody have any ideas/ advice? (I will note I’m already going to a therapist and I’m going to tell them but my appointment isn’t for a while and I’m just looking for some help or advice in the meantime. )
818,Friend Hates Every Minor Thing,"Hi everyone this isn’t something i’m personally struggling with but rather an issue that my friend has opened up about, and i’m not sure how to approach it or what they might potentially have. They have admit to me multiple times that they hate EVERYTHING- they hate breathing, they hate feeling, they hate eating, they hate drinking, they hate thinking, they hate feeling their legs touch when they lay down. They just hate doing and feeling ANYTHING at all. I’ve asked if this is connected at all to their mental state a.k.a are they feeling this because they’re sad and the answer has been no. They tell me that they feel like a lie and a mistake because they have to pretend to like things or tolerate things. They constantly say there’s no point in existing if they will always feel this and that they feel guilty because they know i, among other friends, care about them. They do take anti-depressants but it seems like they have felt this way for as long as they can remember. Is this possibly some sort of serious mental illness? Because that’s what i have assumed it might be, and i come here seeking any advice or if anyone has encountered or experienced such a thing. Thank you so much"
819,Helping a Friend,"I've tried to post this on r/advice but I feel like this place could be a bit more fitting.

One of my friends had started self-harming herself all rooting from a sense of worthlessness and feeling as if she's undeserving. She's very stubborn and won't listen to any advice that I have tried to give her such as taking a stroll or even trying to talk to someone when she's having such thoughts. It's really hard to convince her otherwise because she literally won't listen to anyone when she's having a breakdown, but pushes people away. For context she and I are both teens and she's leaving for a new school after this semester ends. I really believe that these all came as a result of school but I want to assure her that everything will be okay at the end and that self-harming isn't the mere way out to stress and insecurity. Is there anything I can do or tell her so that she could accept some sort of help? It needs to be something quick in effect as well since she's leaving and this is so recent."

My little brother has pretty bad mental health issues and he hurt himself really badly yesterday. Every time I close my eyes the events of last night play back in my head. I cried a lot today and last night. I just lie in bed unable to close my eyes and fall asleep because I am so afraid of having another nightmare.

I couldn’t handle seeing him like that with cuts all over his body and hid in my room and listened to music to drown out the voices of the paramedics upstairs talking to him and my mother. I hate my mother for letting me know the details of what happened, I can’t get the images out of my head and I had a terrible nightmare when he left for the hospital. I don’t want to know these things and I hate that she tells me. I am an adult, but this is not something I can handle - I have mental heath issues too and god this has given me insane amounts of anxiety. I just shut down when everything was happening. The smell of his room, of liquor, lingers in my mind still. It felt like a dream when I woke up until I heard my mom telling our family what happened last night over the phone. I knew this was going to happen very soon, it was inevitable, but I was hoping it would not come to this. 

He is ok now, but I know people who try and kill themselves will probably try again. I don’t think he wanted to die, I know he wanted to get help, but it’s still so scary. I don’t think I will ever stop worrying about him now. I have always worried about him, that one day we would find him dead. Now I feel like that  fear is so much worse and I don’t know what to do about it. I can’t live with so much anxiety. He isn’t here, and I know he’s being taken care of at the hospital for the next couple weeks, but he’s going to come home and I am so worried. It’s just so overwhelming. It still feels like a dream. Just a bad dream."
823,"Parents with depression/anxiety, how do you it?","I (26f) have had depression for about 12 years and anxiety for about 8. 

My LO(1f) was born full term(38wks) but at 3lb8, she stayed in neonatal for 2 weeks. It affected me a lot, I blamed myself A LOT, I honestly still do, what did I do wrong? What could I have done better? She's now a very healthy 20mnth old. 

I've struggled mentally a lot since her birth, I've had so many times where I won't shower for 3 weeks or I won't eat or I'll do nothing but eat, I always make sure she's fed 3 times a day, nappies changed multiple times a day but when I'm really bad, I just about get that done.
Dishes pile up, floors become carpets from dog hair, washing piles up

Daughter has just gone down from a nap after having the mother of all meltdowns for half an hour (she's gotten 4 canines in 2 weeks), I proceeded to ball my eyes out, feeling something I've done so many times, that I can't do this. There's just that constant want to give up, that somebody else would do such a better job than I, even watching my SO with her, I realise how much better and more interactive he is with her 

Both mum and dads, any advice of coping or things that have helped you?"
824,Most chilling words said by psychopaths/serial killers/criminals/etc?,"Hey guys, I recently stumbled upon an article of real words said by several notorious people (serial killers, criminals, etc).  These quotes are not for the faint of heart. 😱 Just goes to show how deep and dark the human mind can get. I read the quotes which appear with a photo of the person who said them. idk...lately I have been learning more about the mental condition known as psychopathy (or, in more clinical terms, antisocial personality disorder) &amp; something about it is just intriguing to me. I'm nowhere near being considered a psychopath/sociopath (!!) But anyways, [here](https://allthatsinteresting.com/serial-killer-quotes#17) is my personal favorite, said by Peter Kürten. It is truly eerie, horrifying, and just plain evil.


So now I'm wondering, what is the most chilling thing ever said by a psychopath/maniac/murderer/convict in your opinion??"
825,What To Do?,"So...
I feel a bit awkward writing To reddit, but at the same time why not. ( sorry if my English is bit broke). 

So... I guess my Mental health is bullcrap and it has Been for a one year now. I am not sure what To Think or Do? But I want To get better. 

I have had some traumatic incidents in my past (abuse, unstable home life, bullying... ) but I have always been quite positive and working hard towards my dreams while still having depressive episodes and sometimes bad anxiety affecting my ability To function. But, I have done work In creative arts so, its quite common for People To be a bit ""crazy""... Uknow. 

BUT after Last spring/autumn my Mental health totally broke down... 
My father almost died, my Mother was quite abusive towards me and I finally got accepted To University (abroad) but long story short everything was  too much for me and after moving abroad my Mental health just finally broke. I Lost Weight, couldn't go outside and puked all Day because I was so anxious. So ofc, I had To dropp Out and move back home.
 It was devastating for me. I feel like such a failure. 

Everything went just More down hill from there, I tryed To work several Jobs but had To quit due To my anxiety. 
I was living with my parents but my father is dipolar alcoholic and my Mother is super anxious and anorecix... Not a good environment at all.
 ( allthoug I Think my parents try their Best... And they have good sides and are ""succesfull""  at least financially, our homelife is a mess). 
And I ended up contemplating ending it all.

Long story short my situation is lot better atm
; I live In a small town with my amazing partner, we both have a short term Job In our local theatre. My dream Job. ( I know its weird how can I act When my anxiety doesnt even allow me To go outside.. Oh well)
 but I am still sick. not able To really function alone, I don't know what would I Do without my partner. I just feel bad and anxious. I am terrified of future. 

I dont have any proffesional help right now. I am trying to seek some. And also I would like to start medication. I want To Heal, I want To have a life: able To go outside alone, dream, meet People etc...

Okay... I guess my question is:

Do you guys have similar experiences?
Is there someone who has survived severe depression and anxiety? 
( I have Been diagnosed with both) 

I am so scared that i Will never get better and I Will never be anything. 🐖"
826,Being in the military sucks now more than ever,"I joined the army two years ago after failing to find a college that would accept me with a history of being involved in shady business... for the first year it was good, basic training was difficult since I was more overweight than most people and had a low self esteem and confidence YET I made it through.... 

However when I got to my unit and went to my main company I got bullied for being the nerdy guy and failed to fit in and meet the airborne requirements that the infantry wanted, I messed up my back on a ruck march, failed land navigation, failed ranger school etc.... Then we went on deployment to a country to which on here I will not disclose, and I lost my two closest friends in an ambush that the local resistance there set up.... my team retreated and left me there injured in the field with my two dead friends for six hours until they swung back around and pulled me out of the mud..... after we got back home nine months later I couldn’t focus on work, the bullying by my co workers got worse and no matter how much I tried to prove I was a good soldier I was just called “a spotlight ranger” for going the extra mile.... after that they tried to medically discharge me for my back along with “failure to adapt” even though they left me to die... 

I fought that discharge with help from legal services and I’m now in a supply company working as a guard for their equipment and shit, a few months ago a buddy of mine committed suicide and I’ve been going down a spiral of fits of ptsd, lack of sleep and now that I’ve asked for help they put me on suicide watch for a few days about a week ago and also took away my right to ride a motorcycle until I can prove to them that I won’t crash into a car or something and motorcycles are my PASSION.... I feel so lost.... by asking for help I made my situation worse"

828,Anxiety and depression seem to dictate my every day life.,"I've had horrible anxiety my whole life and never recognized it for what it was until about 6 years ago. My anxiety is so bad that there are days where getting a phone call can trigger it, I can't bring myself to leave the house, hell I can't even drive (I am 33). I know what a lot of people might say ""go to a doctor"". Well I haven't been to a doctor in over a decade and now ecen the thought of going to one sets off my anxiety because (naturally) I am afraid to find out anything else that may be wrong with me and to make it worse, all of these things trigger chronic depression on a daily basis. Out of an entire month, I may have one or two days where I feel ""normal"". I am not really sure what I am expecting here, I guess I just needed to vent."
829,"feeling worthless, need to vent","I don't vent online but I needed somewhere to get my thoughts out, thought it might help this time. 

My mom knits, she has knitted me a cardigan in the past and I love it, wear it all the time. 5 years ago we were out and I found a wool I loved the color of, she said she'd knit me another cardigan with it. So I paid for enough balls for her to knit me a cardigan, using the same design as the previous one. 

She has only just finished the cardigan. Over the course of those 5 years she has knitted so many things for my sister. Each time I'd wonder when she'd knit my cardigan, I patiently and politely kept waiting. Each new project she churned out, sometimes in record time for my sister, some of which she knitted one that my sister didn't seem to like all too much. 

One stage I felt like I was being unappreciative, I understand and appreciate the amount of time and hardwork that goes into knitting. So it got to the point I wanted to commission her for her time, so my cardigan could be worked on next but she dismissed the idea. 

She finished my cardigan and is now working on yet another one for my sister. 

It has rubbed me the wrong way but left me feeling rather worthless, how I had to wait so long, with her knitting a constant stream of things for my sister. and now my cardigan has been done, yet another is being worked on for my sister straight after, she didn't have to wait 5 years. 



I think it's just sunk in, just how long I have waited, politely and patiently waiting for her to get to it. My mom does other things when she isn't knitting but whenever she did go"

We pride ourselves in helping those with mental ill-health, and many of our staff (myself included) have suffered from (or still do suffer from) these issues.

A year ago, I gave a lecture entitled How to Find Happiness. I never really thought about making it available more widely at the time, but some people recently from outside of our community have mentioned that it helped them, so I thought I may as well link it on here as well.

I wish you all the best and so much love; I was in the darkest, gloomiest pit of depression for so many years, so you have my total empathy. If this helps even one of you, it will have been worth the effort of giving it, and sharing it with you here. Never give up. &lt;3

836,How do I help my girlfriend manage her mental health?,"Hi all, my girlfriend (18) has been struggling with clinical depression for about 5 years now. The pandemic and being on lockdown has definitely taken a toll on her and it's likely it'll be a while before we can be together in person again. She isn't on antidepressants or seeing a therapist (has been in the past but parents didn't react well). We talked about ways she could try to manage it herself and I suggested sleeping more regularly and more often and establishing daily goals and some kind of routine to give her more of a sense of purpose but I'm not sure what else to suggest. What helps you when you are struggling and how could I support her properly (without crossing any boundaries)?"
837,Sensing a person who wants to kill me and who isn’t there,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I genuinely don’t know where to get information about this as everything I’ve looked up so far just makes me think I’m crazier than I already am. TLDR at the bottom of the post if you don’t want to read my rambling.

So pretty much I’ve been sensing a woman in my room who I know wants to kill me. I’ve named her because that kind of makes this less scary, but I’m also not sure if that’s a good thing. It first happened about two months ago, right around when covid really started to kick off. I’ll be laying in my dark room on my phone when I’ll suddenly be very aware of another person in my room, despite not being able to see anybody due to the darkness of the room and the bright light of my phone. Every time this happens I freeze up because I can tell that if I move too much, speak, or try to look at her even a little bit, then she will kill me.

Obviously this is in my head. I have spoken to friend on call once while this was happening, breaking the rule about not being able to speak. It made me very panicked and in the moment I was very concerned that I was going to be attacked and killed. Obviously, since I‘m writing this, nothing happened and I just got majorly anxious and had to leave the call early. So I’m pretty sure this isn’t like a demon or actual person in my room doing this. That leaves my brain.

I guess why I’m writing this is because I like to know what’s going on and I don’t right now? I don’t know if I’m schizophrenic, majorly paranoid, or just going stir crazy due to the stay at home order. Any insight into what I should do about this / what it might be would be very helpful. 

I’m a 20 yr old female if that changes anything.

TLDR : my brain makes me think that a woman I can’t see will kill me if I don’t follow her rules. I’ve broken them and I’m obviously still alive so I wanna know what gives."
838,I just need to talk before I go insane,"I'm so tired of everything. When I was in 7th grade, I had a huge depressive episode with self harm and suicide attempts which lead me to be hospitalized 2 days. I went in therapy but I stopped after a bit less than a year I think because I felt like a financial burden to my parents.

Now I suffer from untreated depression and anxiety and this lockdown is fucking awfull for me. I had a lot of difficulties to follow school properly before and now it's even worse. I can't work, I can't do any king of school work without feeling overwhelmed. I just spend my day doing nothing and I don't feel particulary guilty about it. What I hate is that my parents don't listen to me. They don't listen when I try to explain them that it's not I don't want to work, I can't work. I try really hard but all they do is calling me ""lazy"" or yelling on me when they see me doing nothing. And I don't like that, I don't think they understand how much it hurts me when they keep on remembering me everything I don't do. But they don't want to listen to me, each time I try to explain how they are wrong they start yelling and I don't support this.

The truth is that I'm tired. Tired of not being good enough. Tired of not being able to feel joy. Everyday I wake up and I'm tired of everything. I lost every hobby I had. I don't feel anything anymore. I'm empty and I don't knwo what to do. I feel alone, nobody is here to help me. All my friends abandonned me during lockdown. I can't sleep properly, and when I do, my dreams are so stressfull I wake up having an anxiety crisis.

I would really appreciate if anybody here could give me some tips to reduce me stress please. Or just any advices you would like to give. I'm sorry if what I wrote is a bit messy, I'm not feeling really well right now and it's hard to organize my thoughts"

I've had serious anxiety for 7 days in a row. I could not sleep. Could not process anything nor work remotely correctly. I was overwhelmed with my thoughts and felt like loosing it.

I would wake up in the middle of the night with my heart beating like it wanted to come out of my chest.

So I wrote to myself a love letter, hoping it would defuse my anguish. It did. Momentarily. However these self love notes needs to be renewed in order to feel strong again.

841,Insulting people I love in my head?,"Hello, I hope this is the right place to post this message. English is not my native language, so apologies for any potential mistakes. I would like to meet a professional and will do it when this situation is over, but for now, I'd like to know your opinion. I did a bit of research but didn't find anything. 

Background: 21M, no disorders I am aware of, I come from a healthy background. 

Problem: Whilst meditating this morning, I realised I needed to do something. 

I sometimes insult people I love,  always in my thoughts and for absolutely no reason. I can think of my mother, my ex-girfriend (broke up recently) or my grandmother for example.  These are rare events but they happen from time to time and it's been like that for a few years (I can't  exactly tell when it started). I felt guilty and weird but told myself there were no reasons to worry about it, since it couldn't harm them, being just thoughts. These thoughts never came in a context of arguing or anything similar. They were unjustified and out of place. The last one I can think of was a few days ago, after I met my girlfriend after two months of self isolation with my family. We were having sex and I qualified her of ""dumb bitch"" in my thoughts. I felt disgusting as I really cared about her and she was incredibly kind to me. If relevant, I must say I have delayed ejaculation and sometimes couldn't come. I think it's a psychological problem (difficulty to relax or maybe refusing to let myself enjoy it? I don't know). The insult came out whilst I was struggling to reach climax. I decided to break up with her because I realised I wasn't in love anymore (after two months of distance). It was difficult because she still was in love with me, but I couldn't do it anymore. Might be related, I don't know. This is just an example and it's not limited to my sex life, as these poisonous thoughts also popped up in normal and average discussions with other people, such as my mother. I can't remember them because that was a while ago.

I feel really messed up and can't understand why this sometimes happens to me. Any suggestion would be more than welcome. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I sometimes insult people  (in my head) I love for no reason. I'd like to understand why and find a cure to the problem."
842,Mental Limbo,"27M. I feel like my mind is in a horrible fight with itself everyday. Everything seems pointless at this moment, even the most simplest tasks are hard to do and has led to procrastination on important things. The things I loved to do like working out, taking a walk, doing some gardening, and even just talking to anyone makes me angry really quick. My diet and lifestyle has gone to shit and a complete 180 of what it used to be before this pandemic hit and it’s so hard to get out of this hole. I’m not suicidal or anything but damnit it’s wearing on me more and more. Even going to work is becoming a huge problem, I can’t stand getting up knowing I have to go to work but I also know staying home is not healthy either because I’ll just stress eat and play video games all day, even that becomes boring quickly. The things I used to love to do become meaningless and a chore to do. 

I tell myself I’m going to finally get things done when I get off work or on the weekend but nope my mind is like “yeah let’s not do that because that sucks.” I’m so tired when I come home because work gives me anxiety all day and it’s taking its toll on me. I can’t seems to convince myself to get out of this cycle of toxic habits and laziness. 

I just had to get this off my chest and get it out there so it’s not driving me nuts."
843,feel bad for no reason,"hi, so, I always have been really anxious and sad for no reason, I don't know how to explain, I do art and some other things to spend my time and not overthink, but it's really hard not to overthink and feel bad, I don't even know why I'm sad about, I have a really good life and nothing to complain, but I just get sad....
It's really confuse, but I feel like my friends doesn't understand, so yeah, just ignore this haha, just needed to get this out of my chest 
(sorry for my bad English)"
844,How do you move forward from your past?,"My entire life, I've struggled with mental illness. It started when I was younger (8), I had a lot of issues with OCD and anxiety. After 6 years of treatment, I was finally happy despite my struggles. High school was easily the best four years of my life. I was no longer being bullied, I had a good group of friends, and I was involved in a sport I loved. I was so happy and full of hope for the future. I guess as a naive teenager, I never thought it would end. Obviously it did, and I graduated. After graduation I moved out and became severely depressed. I ended up dropping out of college due to depression, so I spent all my time working and sleeping.Most of my old friends have moved on with their lives, so I only have one friend anymore. And then last year I was diagnosed with bipolar, and ever since then my life feels so downhill. I moved back in with my parents earlier this year and I cant help but feel so pathetic.

I'm stuck living in my past. I turned 21 a few days ago, and I don't feel like an adult at all. All I do is sit around and wish I was young again so I could be carefree. I miss the days where all I had to worry about was homework, practices, and friends. I feel like I can't move forward because I can't let go of what my life used to be.  I can't even look at old pictures of myself without crying because I can't stand to see how happy I used to be. I know that this isn't healthy, but I don't know how to get past this. I can't see my therapist for another month, so i'd love any advice I can get."
845,AA for mental illness?,"My therapist is asking me to start attending a group (over zoom, for now at least) that’s she describes as “AA for mental illness”. She told me the government just put a bunch of funding into these groups and I should join. I don’t really feel comfortable with the idea. She tells me it’ll keep me out of the hospital and I don’t really know how to argue with that. I’ve had bad experiences with group therapy especially when it’s forced or heavily pushed. Anyone have info on what she’s talking about?"
846,sudden personality change may be due to medication- or not,"i dont know what exactly is wrong with me, this is just be trying to find an answer by laying everything out for myself and trying to piece them all together.

either im trying to piece all the puzzle pieces together, or im actually psychologically going insane and not knowing it. which im fine with that? i just want to at least find a label so i can try to better myself. 

there was a time before where i was depressed, but nowhere near as complicated or sad or angry or lost or feeling-like-im-going-insane as right now. so im gonna skip to the beginning of right now instead.

i was probably the happiest ive been for awhile. usually i had little patches of sadness here and there but thats just my depression doing its thing. 

then one day a rash appeared on my neck and a little bit of my chest, i was prescribed prednisone, (around september) and around that time i also started to feel close to nothing with my feelings. some sadness and anger, lots of anger,- it changed my whole personality while i was on it. 

we got off of it as quickly as we could. but i dont really think i ever changed back since then. either that, or it triggered something worse in me because after that it felt like a fast descent into hell. 

i havent felt genuine happiness since then; and i dont love my family any more. i used to cry at every little thing but now the only thing i cry about is me. and i hate myself for it. 

now this could have caused psychosis or derealization/depersonalization, but when i asked my doctor about any of those possibilities, he shut me down and said its not likely whats happening. 

then as time went on i started eating more- binge eating. i was approached by a doctor and was told theres a possibility of binge eating disorder, but i refused to believed it and also as time went on i gained weight.

while that time was going on i started to experience a deep decline in my confidence. where i have to look in a mirror as often as possible to see if my flaws are there- and im triggered every time by it. every time i see a person who looks remotely like me i get triggered- spending nearly all day worrying about my looks.

one of my doctors is going to give me a test soon to see if anything else is going on. 

obviously i may sound way out of line thinking this could be anything more than just depression- and if it is i just need to ask a different doctor if its because of the prednisone. but it feels so much worse than that. ive experienced things ive never experienced before. 

not only what i put above, and all the other classic depression symptoms, but also just feeling out of touch with reality. my eyes dont seem right. blurry isnt the right word- more like soft? 

if anyone else has experienced anything remotely like this, or have any recommendations on what i should ask my doctor, i’d be grateful. i know i said i have little to no feelings anymore but i can still feel a little grateful."
847,Every time I do something wrong I hurt myself what did I do?,"Whenever I do anything bad i break down and start punching myself and sometimes want to kill myself
What should I do?"
848,I just don't know,"Recently Ive been getting into issues with everything. Before the pandemic, I just couldnt get myself to get up for work. I cant get myself to do schoolwork. Overall I just cant get myself to do much of anything asked of me. The simplest tasks seem too hard, and no matter how much i would like to, i just cant bring myself to do anything reasonably productive. simply bringing any of it up pisses me off to an extreme; which is only happening constantly. I cant find much of anything i want to do. games get boring just after a few minutes. my mind is just too active to sleep; and I just cant bring myself to go out, or do anything else. I keep setting goals, and making plans; but i just cant do it. beyond that, im not suicidal, but I cant help but stir the thought. I feel like Im being bullied by my own head, like were not even the same person. Im paranoid to an extreme; no longer feeling safe in my own house, like im living in a horror movie. every little thing makes me jump, and im on constant guard, my sleep schedule has been practically flipped because of it. the topic itself just hurts, sometimes physically and I just dont know what the problem is. I hate myself, I hate everything else, and I just want it to end"
849,Where do I begin? How?,"Good morning to all. I think I need help, scratch that, I know I need help. I'm an early 30s first generation American. My family came from another country and essentially lived the American dream - from looking for money in a couch to buy me a happy meal to moving to one of the most affluent towns outside of NYC. I cannot express how thankful I am to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a younger sibling who is a drug addict - started with cocaine and has now been heroin for 7-8 years. This has really torn my family apart. From the age of 19 to now, everything in my family life has revolved around my sibling and her addiction. We are not a family of talkers, just doers. As such, my family and I have supported her the best we can during this time of her life.  I would also like to add here that I smoke weed for recreational purposes. I have no tried any ""hard drugs"" but do indulge in the flower.  

&amp;#x200B;

But being a sibling to a heroin addict is hard. It is so hard. I have seen my sibling OD at least 6 times, I have had to pick her up from the most unsavory and disgusting places, dealt with the worst people, had my personal belongings stolen and pawned and re-bought my me (think laptop with years of professional work on it), been attacked by my high sibling with a firepoker, a knife, been told to sleep with one eye open, have seen my sister manipulate and abuse my older parents for close to half a decade now. I've been to the hospital to see her more times than I can remember. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story for a short drink of water: I have been through so much trauma with my parents when it comes to my sister. My parents who are my rocks have been through hell and back dealing with my sister's addiction. In my culture, we love unconditionally and my parents have truly shown to me what that is. I admire them for it. We try to help to my sister but she refuses to seek help or get help. I will also say, she has had a very very tough life due to her addiction. She has suffered serious trauma many times and it breaks my heart, truly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so many emotions tied to this. Guilt, sadness, anger, frustration, and finally numbness. Being happy to me or investing in myself always feels fleeting as I have to always be prepared for the inevitable ""your sister is in a hospital"" or ""We can't find your sister, please help us"" call from my parents. I always feel like my world can be shattered at any moment without my consent from no fault of my own. It is the worst feeling and it is hard, just so hard to be happy. When shit hits the proverbial fan, I isolate and numb myself in unhealthy ways with excessive weed usage, video games, and general piss poor behaviors that I am not proud of but help me sustain and not breakdown. To combat this, I have rules for myself where I do not smoke alone or play online competitive video games.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help and I don't know what to do or how to go about it. I am asking where to start, how to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading. Peace and love."

851,Mood Tracking App...,"Hi Guys.. 
Hope you're all keeping safe and well. I dont often post, so hopefully Im following the rules..

I did post this in r/BiPolarReddit too, but thought there might be different folks over here too...

Obviously, the pandemic has us all on edge at times and as a way to observe my ups and downs; my Psychiatrist suggested a Mood Tracking App...

I'd like to hear about all your experiences and advice... Which have you tried and then deleted and why, which can store information like times/durations, triggers, perhaps offer coping strategies... whatever you felt was useful or not..

Thanks in advance.."
852,How Entrepreneurs Can Maintain Their Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic," Many of you may be asking yourself that question,  especially if you currently own your own business. Fears of paying bills  on time, keeping employees employed once everything returns to normal,  to simply people being leery about public outings causing a business to  stay down are maybe just some of the worries crossing your mind."
853,Am I a narcissist?,"Made a new account because I don't want people being influenced by old posts, just want people to go off what comes across from this post, with me trying to be as honest as possible.

Reasons I think I may be a narcissist:

* Extreme Liar (I used to lie constantly, kinda fixed it now, but I am still wrapped in stupid things due to my stupidity, and still trying to resolve them)
* Constantly want validation (I keep posting everything I do online, really wanting attention, I always try and show off my programming and games and what I know, which is hella annoying)
* Lots of people, who don't necessarily know each other, often comment on how much I want attention
* I like to be in control (I always try to get *my* idea to be the thing that we do in groups)

&amp;#x200B;

There are more reasons, but they are quite trivial, but this stuff really seems to kinda add up. I am trying to solve it, but this is hard, and I thought I was getting better but a lot of people seem to have suddenly gotten fed up with me (again, my own fault, and not many of them know each other so they can't be influenced by the others opinions) and told me their opinion of me, mainly the stuff above.  


I'm happy as I am, but I want *other people* to be happy, not just me, and me being this way obviously doesn't make them happy, and making them cakes and helping them do things isn't going to change the fact that I am a really bad friend in terms of my personality.  


Yeah, advice would be welcome."
854,"Feels like I’m on a boat - plus more, pls help","Can anxiety/panic disorder cause you to feel like you’re constantly on a boat? Cause it’s been 8 long ass months of feeling like this and nobody can figure it out. It feels like I’m moving when I’m not, like I’m swaying/off balanced, woozy, almost a drunk like feeling, and at times it feels like the ground is moving from underneath me. It’s constantly there, at its worst when standing/sitting still, subsides when walking, and laying down and goes when I’m in a moving vehicle. 
I’ve always been a bit of an anxious person and I was really anxious when I was a kid. 
I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, but I honestly don’t think I’ve got it. It all started about 2 months after I quit smoking weed. Smoked weed for 5 years (17-22) I’m now 23. This symptom has caused severe anxiety/health anxiety and panic disorder, which has almost resulted in being admitted to the psych ward, I’m not only on antidepressants but also an antipsychotic and for a hot minute there benzodiazepines, however I’ve almost been panic free for about a month, and am tapering off the antipsychotic which is great but this physical symptom is still there. I’ve had heaps of tests including an MRI, vertigo testing, blood tests, eyes, ears and  heart checked also tried tablets that are supposed to help with balance but it didn’t help. I have a benign cyst in my left temporal lobe that’s been there since I was a kid but like I mentioned above I had an MRI and it hadn’t changed, so the doctors just keep saying it’s anxiety. If this is the case, how do I try and make it stop? It’s literally ruining my life. I’ve made so many lifestyle changes and nothing has helped, I haven’t quit smoking cigarettes so I suppose I could try that? I should also mention that this all started after a weekend away spent in a high rise building in which I had to use an elevator numerous times, so I don’t know if the elevator has anything to do with it? I have also developed other symptoms but am also unsure whether that’s due to anxiety/panic, such as, episodes that feel similar to a hypoglycaemic attack, consisting of weak/faint/shaky/sweaty sensations, this usually always occurs at the same time of day. 
The other symptoms are these tingly, pins and needle like sensations, hot and cold sensations and random patches of goosebumps. 
Anyway, sorry about the long post, any comments would be greatly appreciated."

857,Top Reasons Why Teenagers Go For Therapy,"School life, or early college life for that matter, is not as simple as many would have you believe. From group dynamics to image maintenance to early tryst with relationships, there are a ton of factors that they have to navigate through, pretty much on their own. With the popularity of social media and easy access to smartphones for today’s teens, the issues have magnified. Hence, the importance of a [therapist for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) in today’s society has increased a lot. Even today, the idea of therapy for young adults seems like an alien concept for many. In a world where even adults have to either hide that they are going for therapy or dismiss the concept altogether, this should not come as a shocker. But, circling back to teens and why teens need therapy, the fact of the matter is that in today’s world, there are so many issues that teens face but are not always emotionally equipped to handle them well. Add to that, some teens are not very close to their parents, so they turn to their friends for advice and that is never a good decision. So, what are these issues that teens face? Let us discuss a few.

**1.** **Substance abuse: -** More often than not, some sort of abuse is at the centre of all the issues. With urban teens having access to the internet so readily, it also makes accessing illegal substances extremely easy. Sometimes, a teen is the initiator while others follow suit because of peer pressure. Results of substance abuse are no longer a secret, and everyone knows what can happen to a person. It is extremely important to recognise signs of substance abuse and address them right away. If you are looking for a [therapist for teens in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/), you should not have any issues finding one. The city has some of the best therapists in India. It is important to maintain dialogue with a teen. Talk to them, ask them about their issues and make them feel safe. A hostile environment at home is the breeding ground of early life issues that can further lead to substance abuse. 

**2.** **Stress -** Yes, stress is an extremely broad factor, but it is also an extremely important one. As adults, with experience, we get used to the stress. We find ways to dissipate it or manage it. But teens, like we have mentioned above, are not emotionally equipped to handle stress very well. Now, stress can be cause by many factors, like studies, peer pressure, social media anxiety and more. It is important to continue having a conversation with them. As we have mentioned, if you are on the lookout for a [therapist for teens Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) has some of the best ones in India. It is never too late to seek help and above all, it is not a reason to feel shameful. But the only way you will know that you, teen needs therapy is if you just talk to them."
858,My brother has schizophrenia,"My brother (m/20)  for a while has gotten so bad he is unapproachable. I (m/18) cant really look at him anymore without being overcome by some type of selfish emotion of either anger or anxiety. For about 2 years now he's been walking in circles and laughing/talking to himself, sometimes he comes back into reality and talks to me and my mom but for most of the day he's in this kind of vegetative state where if you try to break him out of he will get very hostile. (He's had issues for many years but it slowly got worse and reached this point).

 Im not posting on this sub for him really, we have lost all hope of him recovering a long time ago and expect to take care of him like this for a long time. I was wondering if anyone has a similar problem as me and can help me with any coping mechanisms or any tips or lifestyle changes. I think my approach has made my brothers atmosphere worse to be honest because I moved to my dads a year ago, I feel like I abandoned my mom and brother but I couldn't stand being around him. I know that was very selfish of me but I feel sometimes im losing it when im around him and cant help but compare him to the person he used to be so i just tried to forget his existence so i didn't have to think about it. I recently noticed that was the real reason i moved away (I made the excuse of ""my dad agreed to pay for my college"" so i could convince my mom to let me move out). I want to be a part of his life and i am tired of being ashamed of him but i dont know how to even deal with being in the same house as him. 

(To be honest i dont even know if im on the right sub for this, if you know of another that can help let me know please)"
859,I feel like I'm dead inside,"I just feel so unmotivated and emotionless. Like half the time I just wanna cry. Plus my anxiety doesn't help. It's not like I don't have friends, but I just don't wanna seem like a burden to them, whining all the time. I'm completely disinterested in life rn and I've tried everything- meditation, yoga, exercise everyday, hobbies. And yet nothing."
860,I was cleaning and found my roommates bag of wound care and meds from the psych ER. Need advice.,"So the title is exactly what happened. In the bag was wound care, and an all too familiar little baggie of the same type of strong sleeping meds I used to take, stamped with the name of the same psych ER Ive ended up in countless times before. I have had my suspicions that he might not feel too well mentally for a while now, and today it was confirmed.

It is 3-4 hours until he comes home from work and I do not want to hide that I found the bag. It was in plain site in the hallway, and if he really didnt want me to know, I think he would have brought it to his room. Should I see this as a scream for help?

I do want to let him know that he can talk to me, or if he does not want that, I can at any time of day or night follow him to the hospital and wait with him in the waiting room.

How should I bring this up?"
861,How do I know if I should get help?,"I’m afraid of participating in the stigma of minimizing mental illness to “normal” emotions and behaviors (like how someone who’s sad for the time being says their depressed or stuff like that) and I generally stay away from self-diagnosing but this has made me reluctant to ask for help.
I’m afraid to ask for professional help because I don’t want to create a problem for my parents or my partner. What if I’m just sad? Lately, I’ve been having thoughts of just ending it for myself. I’ve been feeling cornered because of my problems in my relationship with my partner and family. It’s not fully their fault, though (if even at all), since I know I participate in creating the problem in some way. It’s just that I’ve been feeling more and more like I can’t handle these problems anymore. Like I don’t want to, and that it’s not worth it. I know I can be happy but it’s not really about that either. It’s just I feel like that’s not really giving me peace and I want to be peaceful.

I’m afraid that if I bring this up to my partner, he’ll feel this extra burden of having to deal with someone with these problems aside from his own problems. He’ll say he won’t mind and that he wants us to deal with it together, but that won’t mean it won’t be hard and heavy for him to do so.
With my family, I’m afraid they won’t understand. My parents aren’t firm believers of these kinds of problems.

If I go to a professional (assuming I have the resources), what would I even say? What if it really is just me and I’m just making a big deal out of small problems I have? I know mental illnesses are serious and deserve to be taken seriously, but a part of me believes that I’m just overreacting and suicidal thoughts doesn’t mean I’ll commit suicide therefore I’m not suicidal. And if I do have issues, I don’t know how they’ll ever be fixed because I’ve been feeling this way for so long."
862,Schizophrenic lady keeps showing up at my house.,"Hello, people this is my first time posting. I would like some advice. Recently I moved in with my father in law due to loosing my job to covid. The first week my wife and I saw a lady walking up our street. We thought nothing of it. Maybe it was just someone going for a walk and that was fine. Until it wasn't, we were in the house when my wife decided to go to the backyard. I was cooking at the time and she called me practically just after she walked out. She asked me if there was a woman standing at the end of the driveway. I checked and there was a woman standing in front of our driveway looking at the garage but spacing out at the same time. I informed her of this and then she started walking away. Not even 10 minutes later I hear the door open. My wife opened the door and said ""SHE'S HERE."" So, I went outside to see what she needed. At this point she is standing in the driveway 15 feet away from the side door. I asked her if she was lost. She told me she was looking for Frank. I informed her he didn't live here and that we had just moved here. Her dad has been living here for about a year. This resonated with her and she left. We were pretty freaked out at this point but we continued with our day. Two days later she showed up again. Only this time its 10 pm. My wife went to throw something in the trash and she was standing at the end of the driveway. It was pitch black. All you could see was her face. She stood there for 15 minutes without blinking till the cops showed up. I'm not sure what the officer told her but she headed back home. At this point we are loosing our shit thinking we were going to get killed or something. The cop informs us that she is schizophrenic. Apparently she used to take care of someone who had dementia in the house I now live in. This made us feel bad for her because hell nobody chooses to be like that. The officer informed us that she actually lives in one of the houses adjacent from ours. After this we talked to my wife's sister about it. She told us the cops have been called twice on this house saying a ""young couple"" keeps banging at her door. I think she might be able to see us in the backyard as we used to visit often. I don't know what her living situation is like but something about her maybe seeing us as the young couple concerns me. She showed up yet again yesterday except this time she was more ""put together?"" The first time she showed up she had a mask and talked to us. The second time she didn't even wear a coat or a mask and it was aqq cold day. Yesterday she came with a coat and her mask on and she didn't ask about Frank. She asked about a woman named Catherine. She said she keeps telling her to go to the backyard. Frank had also told her he was in the backyard. She apologized and left. I'm not sure if she remembers coming the other two times or not. I'm worried frank or Catherine are going to tell her to come inside. Or even think we want to hurt her. I'm worried for her as well I think maybe having to be cooped up inside during all this might be damaging her mental health. I know I'm starting to feel it so I can only imagine. So reddit what should I do? Part of me wants to maybe get to know her and talk to her. I don't know if that's wise or even how to go about it. She lives near to us so I don't see this going away any time soon.


TLDR: Schizophrenic woman thinks people are telling her to come to my backyard. What do I do?"
863,I hate myself for not having the courage to just end it,"It’s the rational thing to do- everyone I talk to thinks I’m a nuisance. I’m a narcissist who can’t think about anything but themselves. I never do things because I care for people, but because I’m afraid of them. I don’t even have the courage to cut myself. I can’t stop imagining killing myself and I can’t actually kill myself, it’s driving me insane.
I keep imagining that my suicide would show people that I’m not happy, and I know I would be dead anyway so it wouldn’t matter but I can’t talk to anybody because if I did they would think I was seeking attention. I haven’t talked to anybody real in a week. How do I just do it"
864,I am depressed without any reason. Am I mad ?,I have no idea what's wrong but since 2 weeks
865,I feel like I need to sort my shit out socially but my anxiety treatment has been postponed so I could do with some advice.,"I had a pretty abusive childhood, I was abused by my stepdad for 8 years (which I covered up to my mum) both physically and emotionally, so my self esteem my entire life has been bad, I’ve only told my story to a few people though.  

These are some of the things I notice (I’m a 21 year old man):

- I want every girl to fancy me (this probably isn’t abnormal but I feel jealous when I see girls hyping up other guys)
- I try too hard to be mates with popular people, even though I have quite a few friends myself. 
- I used to be a massive people pleaser
- I’m always looking for outside validation.
- I find my worth based on the number of girls who fancy me/the amount of friends I have. 
- I feel people don’t like me for me, but for their perspective of me. 
- I feel like I don’t deserve love
- I feel like I have to live up to what people like about me, so if they say I’m funny, I always have to be funny etc. 


This sounds very bad I know, but honestly it’s something that’s ruined my mental health for years. I’m glad I’ve started to get help for it, but is there any advice that could help me? I’d love to just be comfortable within myself but I know I’m a long way off this. Thanks"
866,Not Sure,"I feel like i have a mental disorder but i just don’t actually know. I want to go to the doctor about it but the one time i brought up mental health with my mom she blamed it on snapchat and my phone (classic, right?). And, on top of that, i don’t want to disrespect anyone who has it and try to talk to someone about it because i might be seen as glorifying or romanticizing it or something. But i really feel like i had ADHD. i bite at the inside of my lip constantly, my leg is always tapping, i’m super spacey and forgetful. i feel like my brain thinks too fast and i can’t keep up. there’s so much more, but you get the point. a common consequence of untreated ADHD is like... not being good at school and failing classes and stuff but i have a 4.0 so i feel conflicted. basically, i just feel like i might have it but i don’t want to be seen as glorifying it or faking it for attention but it’s starting to affect me more lately. i don’t want to self diagnose or anything but i don’t know what to do."
867,What does the suicide hotline do?,"I decided to make an appointment with a video psychiatrist. But the earliest the one I decided to try was next week. The questionnaire I took indicated that I should call the hotline if I feel like hurting myself.

This weekend I tried to strangle myself when I was really down. But as usual I failed at that point too. But what does the suicide hotline do? Talk you out of it somehow?"

Is this normal for only taking it for 3 days? I’m desperate. I don’t want to go to a doctor because I don’t want to expose myself to COVID. Please help."
870,Going back into therapy for anxiety/perfectionism,"Hello all. 

I’ve always had issues with social anxiety and perfectionism, especially when I inevitably do something wrong, often because of the anxiety. And then I think “well what if this person will have a bad opinion of me for the rest of my life?” (and it could affect my professional and personal opportunities) even if I don’t think I’ll see these people again or know they’d be judgemental people not worth my time. Got CBT towards the end of last year and it got better. 

Mental health nosedived when COVID-19 and lockdown started. Now instead of one thing or the future, I’ve started ruminating, fixating on, and remembering every single wrong, rude, or embarrassing things I’ve ever done. We’re talking going back nearly twenty years (I’m 23F) and things I’d already forgotten, so no one else is likely to remember but somehow they’ve come back, and with a vengeance like never before. 

Clearly I have some deep seated issues and childhood trauma that can’t be suppressed forever. 

Had a phone consult with a therapist today, and cried for the first time since COVID-19 started. Finally it all came out. I’ll be ok eventually. Just slightly devastated that I feel like I’ve failed in some way, and that I underestimated how bad my issues were. 

If anyone is going through similar problems, I just want to encourage you to seek help (whether professional or not). There’s nothing wrong with getting help, and it may feel better just to talk to a stranger. If anyone wants a friendly stranger without having to think about a therapist then I am also available :)"
871,Diagnosis Trouble,"Hi there. So I was officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder years ago. And then I was diagnosed with bipolar-2. But I also feel like I have anxiety, and my past psychiatrists have acknowledged it and said that I have anxiety. But is that the same thing as a diagnosis of GAD. Do I need to take a test? I just needed to fill out a sheet in front of my therapist for my depression diagnosis but my bipolar diagnosis required a full test. I don’t really know. Any assistance would be appreciated."
872,Ow ow,"I have begun self-harming again without realizing, I don’t think it’s necessarily cutting or something but like other things count as well yeah? Like a mixture of all"
873,Scared of a relapse,"I woke up depressed today right out of the blue. Im really more scared about the thought that this could last a while. I dont often have my good days during depression, and it has never lasted just one day. Usually when Im depressed, it lasts for weeks to months one end. Luckily I have a phone appt woth my psychiatrist today and will ask for a medication evaluation. Im just so scared of becoming suicidal again and having to go back to the behavioral health clinic again."
874,Bad thoughts,"When I get suicidal, Its not so much that I want to die, its more of a compulsion (I have severe OCD). All I can think about is ways to do it and even how it would physically feel. I know these thoughts are morbid but they dont stop once they get going. I dont actually want to hurt myself, but its all I can think about when I get depressed. Its almost like existential anxiety. Does anybody else experience this?"
875,What’s the best thing to do if you hate therapy?,"I’ve had therapy on multiple occasions, the first time was to do with social anxiety and the other times it has been about my sexual assault, each time I honestly think it left me feeling worse off. 

I’m extremely self conscious and self aware, I think the idea that my parents were the ones arranging it and knew I was going is what made it worse. 

The awkward silences made me so uncomfortable, I didn’t want to be there. It just meant that I was thinking about the topic constantly for weeks, as if it made it more present in my mind, it was a horrible time. 
The assault has made my social anxiety 10x worse as the boy got away charge free (despite doing similar things to other girls) and lives in the same town as me, I have nowhere else to go. 

How do I help myself get over this?"
876,How to deal with self-destruction tendencies during the lock-down?,"Recenlty I've been having strong urged to punish myself by either getting drunk or smoking cigarettes non-stop knowing it's ba for me and makes me feel only worse. I used to self-harm as a teen, so my psyche still probably remembers it and uses as a coping mechanism. Every time I feel ike a failure I resort to doing things that make me feel worse. 

Have any of you ever struggled the same issue? How do I deal with it?"
877,Fear of being alone,"Er ok not sure how to phrase this but yeah here goes. 
I've pretty much been single for 7 years now n ot never really bothered me to much. 
My mom has terminal cancer n she's getting really worried I'll be all alone once I die so it's kind of effecting me. 
While I had taken steps like cleaning myself up n hiring a dating coach all that obviously came for naught with Covid n the lock down. I'm really scared I'm going to end up alone n unloved. I know it's fairly ridiculous for a dude to feel like that but it really does"
878,Bitting myself because of Styrofoam,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit but even as a small kid I hated the sound of Styrofoam squicking ( making this weird high pitch sound ). It doesn't need to be Styrofoam. It can even be package tape (plastic) or new round bottles packed in these six packs. ( i tried to find smth similar https://www.schuewo.ch/img_artikel/large/55080-valser-still-15-l-pet-6-pack-silence-foto.jpg)

Sometimes I just scream or just swear at these people because it is a painful feeling. 

It isn't smth I just ""don't like"" or ""hate"". I can't grab objects strongly ( being very weak ) like some people from blood ( or me from getting blood out of my vains by the doctor ) 
And this lasts sometimes half a minute or very long like 5 minutes or so."
879,Stressed out lately,"I am currently majoring science and well it is harder than expected and i cope by playing online games with my friends. I still live with my parents and it is a living hell. My mom constantly pressures me for my studies and she has a tendency of making me stress she would ask me pointless questions and always intentionally find a way to piss me off. She is one greedy son of a bitch, she is exploiting my grandmother's money and all she does all day is drink fucking alcohol, get drunk and cause a ruckus. Apparently my dad does nothing but work and ignore all issues with the household. With lock down, we spend more time together and it is driving me crazy and i am unable to study properly.

Sorry this is just a rant, i needed to tell someone. Im not the type of guy to talk about this with my friends and honestly i doubt they give a fuck."
880,Ended a 6 year friendship,"Hey, everyone. This is my first time posting here. Or posting something like this in general. I just don't know where else to post this. I feel completely destroyed inside. My head is a mess and I don't know where to look.

I just ended a friendship with one of the most closest friends I've ever had. She was extremely important to me and I was the same to her. We'd talk to each other every single day, about our lives, our frustrations, our problems both personal and even family and we had some great memories together. I got to know her in college and we've been close friends ever since for 9 years. We make fun of each other, I make the bad jokes and she always laughed at them to make me feel better anyway. We've helped each other through several problems and we've been the better for it. I thought this was the kind of friendship that doesn't ever end. The kind that would go on even when we've both retired from our careers. The reason we ended is because I made a joke about one of her insecurities. She has anxiety and went through some horrible things because of her ex. Suffice to say it wasn't the kind of joke that's brushed off or forgivable. My intentions were never to hurt her feelings. It was the kind of mean-ish harmless joke I always make. But this time it just wasn't forgivable. It's happened before and we've fought and we've always made up. But this time she told me that we shouldn't be friends anymore. I know I shouldn't have said what I said. She said she doesn't feel safe with me anymore and that she doesn't want a repeat of what she went through emotionally with her ex. I thought this was going to be another fight where even though I'm in the wrong, I'd apologize sincerely and we'd move on like we always do. Was I wrong in thinking that we were as close as I thought we were? She ended it saying she didn't want to take any risks and that even thought she's not mad at me, that this is for the better. I don't know if I sound like a crazy person right now and that I probably deserved what I got but I just thought that 9 years of friendship would mean something and that we'd get through this. I don't hate her or resent her. I just feel completely broken inside. Funny thing is, I'd talk to her about problems like these but I guess that won't happen. I don't know how to feel. I hate myself for making her feel that being friends with me is a risk to her emotional health. I don't know how to feel or how to put it into words but I feel like I just lost a huge part of my life and it's completely my fault. I hate myself. I don't feel right."
881,"I Just want to sleep, eat, masturbate, and watch YouTube all day.","That’s it.

I also have three papers due."
882,I’m terrified of seeking help after the police was called on me for reaching out.,"I’ve been struggling with severe depression for as long as I can remember, and struggled with many dark thoughts. 

Due to severe trust issues I’ve been almost 100% closed off about these thoughts, because therapists/teachers/etc. are mandated reporters and I didn’t want to get sent to the psych ward.

Eventually I got sick of suffering alone and decided that maybe I could vent my thoughts on Reddit without risk of being reported.

For a while, it worked. People could understand me and relate without risk of being reported or exposed.

It felt great being able to open up.

Until, one day I made a particularly concerning post about my dark thoughts. Someone reported me to the police.

I was sleeping peacefully when the police came into my apartment, slammed me against the wall, and handcuffed me. They threw me into the car (with no leg room) and off to the psych ward I went.

I stayed for three weeks in literal living hell just for risking being honest about my suicidal thoughts.

Also, they permanently terminated my account when I got back.

Now I’m terrified about reaching out for help again on my new account.

I’m afraid the police are still watching my IP.

Now I can’t open up to anyone."
883,"Paranoia and dissociation, any advice would be appreciated.","Hey there, I’m a 19 year old who has generalized anxiety disorder. I’ve had mild-severe anxiety my whole life, and it’s always up and down depending on what’s going on in my life. I also have severe depression. A few years ago when I was 16 I was hospitalized multiple times for panic attacks and started developing very new anxiety symptoms, such as dissociation and depersonalization. I had no idea what was going on and was very terrified and miserable 24/7. 


I was also very paranoid about my health and always thought I had some kind of disease. I think it was brought on by a really terrible, traumatizing panic attack after smoking weed (although I smoked all the time) which led to me going to the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack and on the verge of dying. I don’t smoke anymore because every time now I have a panic attack. I did go to counseling but stopped and eventually got over it by myself somehow. 


That was 3 years ago, and I haven’t had terrible anxiety like that since then, only a few times. Ever since this pandemic started I can feel it creeping back up again and I’m terrified. I’m starting to feel like things aren’t real and I’m constantly paranoid about my health and about getting the virus. I’m convinced that because I smoke cigarettes (only have for a year) and I am a bit overweight (but not huge) that I will have no chance if I got the virus. I only smoke about 1-3 cigarettes a day now but I’m still terrified. I barely get sleep and if I do it’s during the day. I’m scared that I won’t be able to handle it and I’ll end up killing myself, although I’m terrified of death and I’m definitely not suicidal.


But dissociation is probably the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced, and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to deal with this again. Even talking about it gives me anxiety. I don’t know what to do, I’m really scared. I do have a therapist and I have talked about this with her before but that was before this wave started, but I am going to talk about it with her tomorrow.
Any advice would be appreciated, I feel very alone because I don’t know anyone who has anxiety this bad or has experienced dissociation like I have. I just need someone to talk to or someone who can relate. My boyfriend understands and is really nice and has experienced it too, but I feel like a burden on him because my anxiety gets so bad."
884,School is literally destroying my mind,It’s almost the end of my junior year and I’ve basically ruined all my chances in getting into s good university. This was my first year getting F‘s and D‘s and C’ ever in my life. Now I feel like no college will  want me. I’ve always been known in my family to have really good grades now I’m an embarrassed. Makes my life feel worthless. I feel like a failure and I’m tired of feeling that way
885,How to stop comparing yourself to others?,"I’ve always compared myself to others my whole life and have been really jealous/envious of others too (I know it’s a horrible trait and I don’t ever show it, I think I’ve showed it like once or twice but I keep my jealousy to myself lol) and it’s hard for me to be happy for others which makes me feel so bad because I want to support and be happy for my friends and stuff :( it’s also really destroying my self esteem and ability to do things because as soon as I see someone better than me I automatically think my chances of doing good are gone. I know it’s a really messed up POV but I’m really struggling with it, I keep checking on how others are doing to the point where I’m not focusing on myself and what *I* can do with my abilities. Thank you so much for any advice ❤️"
886,I've been crying myself to sleep lately,i just wanted to know if you guys think its healthy to be crying yourself to sleep i havent been able to sleep in the past few weeks without crying myself till i pass out or get extremely tired. what should i do?
887,I finally told someone!,"I already talked about it on another mental health subreddit but I am really proud of myself.

I was really scared of telling my mom (and everybody) I had been struggling with my mental health for the last year. 
Today I felt good and had enough energy to clean my room so I decided to open up to my mom. 
She was very supportive and encourages me to go to a psychologist. :)"
888,Always sick and sad but got one thing to live for now,"Figured out who my dad is , not who expected but it’s just the cherry on top of all of life’s many jokes. My plan is to wait for him to die and then take his money give it to my family members that have been screwed by his bullshit and then kill myself . Ive been done since 16 really. I grew up in foster care and have tried just about every mental health professional and drug known to man and I’ve just taken hit after hit. I got raped several times in foster care. I can’t eat a meal without it making so sick I either have to barf or shit bright orange. I feel weak and tired . I drop things super easily forget things. I also get severe panic attacks /seizures if I’m out to long. My happiest is when I’m asleep or watching tv now. I would kill myself except I have a goal. I have to prove to the US and Canada who my dad is, he owns several properties and lots of money that when he does (he’s 76 so luckily not too long from now) he’s going to croak in maybe 10-15 years I can start planning how to put his money in a trust or allocate it to my other family members. They’re not as sad as me / haven’t lived thru crazy trauma and a fucked up sense of reality / who they were their whole lives. They work full time barely making ends meet. I try to work.  I don’t know how I’ll do it but I’ll probably hire a hire man a couple months after my dad dies. and they won’t realize it was me that decided to die . Hopefully not anyways. And I can gift the world something. I mean it does help to have a goal . But I’m so tired my brain only functions 30 percent after my brain injury being hit by a car flying 15 miles into the god damn air across the street . I woke up to being in an ambulance and have worse problems ever since. Doctors have done every test to see why I feel like shit and I don’t quite care anymore."
889,My social anxiety is so bad I can't go downstairs,"I live with my fiance and his parents, and will do until we find a suitable place to rent and when our baby is here (I'm 6 months pregnant).
Since I've gotten pregnant I've been extremely unwell, I've been in bed most of the time because I'm constantly nauseous or vomiting. And in correlation with this, my social anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse. It's gotten to the point where my fiance has to make phone calls for me because I'm too scared to talk on the phone.

The main issue is I'm socially anxious around my parents-in-law. I have absolutely no reason to be, they are lovely people and very welcoming. But I'm just so nervous around them, and this is incredibly difficult considering I live with them. I'm too nervous to leave the bedroom and go downstairs without my fiance, so I'm literally restricted to the bedroom all day and it's driving me mad. My mother-in-law has brought up that they barely see me and I just blame it on being sick all the time, which is definitely part of the reason why, but my social anxiety has the most involvement. 

Any advice?"
890,I want to die,"It’s too hard to stay alive at this point, I don’t want to live anymore"
891,What do you do when a friend asks how they can help? Is it bad I never know what to say?,"Growing up I've never had that friend I could lean on. I was/have been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety by myself for all of 19 years of my life. 

This past year I found a friend who I felt comfortable talking to for the first time and it feels so good, but I'm so bad at talking. It always takes me a long time to say what I need to say because I haven't done it before.

She sits, listens, and is so patient and I am so grateful.

But she always asks how she can help, and in no way am I complaining, but I feel bad because I never know what to say.

I don't know what she can do to help because I've never asked for help before.

But then I feel bad because I'm complaining but doing anything to let her help me. So she sits gives me advice but idk how to let her help me more.

And I feel bad because of it"

893,I just wish I’d stop existing,"I wish I would just stop existing. It’s not normal to have suicidal thoughts every 10 minutes - I’ve been trying to sort my mental health out for the better part of three years and, despite countless hours spent with doctors, CBT, and numerous different types of medication, I feel like I’m in the worst place I’ve ever been in. I don’t know what to do. I just feel stuck. If I call a crisis hotline it’ll probably lead to me losing my job, and my mum doesn’t really understand MH so she’ll just think I’m being dramatic. But I’m not. I just don’t want to be alive anymore. I don’t want to take my own life but I’m not sure how much longer I can spend being this unhappy. It would ruin my friends and family, but I don’t know if I can keep pushing the suicidal thoughts back. I just don’t know if I can do this. This shitty life isn’t worth agonising over."
894,I mimic characters in movies without realising,"I’ve had this problem for quite some time now. I’ve never really had a true personality, but many weird ones depending on what I read, who I interact with, and what I watch. 

Every time I watch a movie/tv show that has aspects of depression, suicide, anxiety, etc. I become the exact same way. I somehow start mimicking the characters in the movie and what they do. 

Every time I watch a kid’s movie/tv show I become a child. I talk in a funny voice and I’m happy and cheerful for a few days. 

Every time I watch an action movie I end up working out a lot and start acting the same way the characters do. 

What’s wrong with me? I’ve mimicked people and movies/tv shows/ book characters my entire life and I don’t know who I am anymore."

896,I dont know to do and dont know how to care,"Hi.To preface: I'm a 20 y/o female that was diagnosed  with BPD, ptsd, anxiety and depression. Grew up religious and was molested from 12 to 18. I dont know what to do. I am dealing (not well)  with extreme existentialism and existential anxiety. I dont know how to deal with this. Currently so depressed that I cant even explain. Hope this belongs on r/depressed? Sorry if its not.

I've done therapy, and its complete bullshit. My therapists sucked so bad, and I cant afford good ones. I'm so unhappy, I break down all the time in a flip of a switch. I am not interested in anything, no hobbies or interests. Nothing matters anyway. Im only living bc of the love I have for my fiance. I have some friends but I could drop them and feel the exact same. Weed and alchohol are the only thing to give me feeling. And why are those things bad? When literally nothing matters, religion isnt real, we are cells living on a rock and literally are completely useless to this universe. We die, and that's it. That's fucking it. How am I supposed to be cured from my depression and problems when we dont matter. And I dont want to necessarily kill myself, but what 
""Depression is your body telling you that it doesnt want to play the character you have created anymore."" To quote Jim Carrey. I am a copy of everyone. Nothing is my own thoughts. I'm controlled in every way. If I dont go college, I cant get a job (i had to drop out bc of my mental health). I have to pay for shelter, work a miserable job (I hate every job i get and quit them in less than a year), i have to work or i will die. Bc money is the main thing controlling us. Our whole lives are to grow up and earn money to live.  My family controlled how I SHOULD think, and being a kid, I had no other choice. So their terrible choice fucked my whole life, forced religion on me, and their own beliefs (good and bad beliefs) and now I have no idea who I am. It really is like I am a character who's just pretending to live a life of boredom and pain. ""Do stuff that makes you happy or speaks something in you"" okay, well nothing does!!!I dont even know how to further explain how I feel. But I feel like this doesnt even do this justice. I'm sick of the pain and the crying and miserableness. I'm on meds now, but I still feel the exact same about life, except now I'm becoming a robot. 

I hate when people say it takes time, too. Yeah. But I'm miserable now. Why am I living miserablely for a possibility that I MAY be happy one day?

And no. This has nothing to do with Corona.

Thanks for reading. Maybe I sound like a complete idiot. But I really dont care."
897,Thinking of taking a semester off to focus on my physical and mental health. Thoughts and advice?,"I'm a gay university student in my 20s studying abroad. I've been a loner school and been feeling lonely ever since, both in my social and dating life.

In the last couple of years I've become very self-conscious on how other people perceive me based on my image, especially other fellow gays and it has damaged my mental health a lot to the point I've become addicted to Grindr (a gay dating app) and started developing some very toxic and unhealthy habits. **I can't stand watching myself being a mess anymore**, and since it feels like my life is depending on how I look, I think **it's time I lock myself out and make big drastic changes** (lose tons of weight, quit social media for that time, save money for my bucket list, focus on my personal projects etc.)  and so I thought of taking a semester off so I can make the transformation stress-free.

I think that changing myself **during my studies** will slow the process even more and I'm not sure if I will give up again just like I did multiple times in past trying to change myself because of the stress I get. It will also make me feel vulernable and exposed. I don't want to share my transformation process with anyone or even my family.

I thought taking a semester off is a good idea because I will focus completely on my physical and mental health transformation, go back home, get a job to save money so I can invest into my looks even more and make some savings for my bucket list.

**My parents (who financially support my studies) insist that it's better to keep going until I graduate** first (I have 5 semesters =2.5 years left if everything goes well).

Which is a better choice and why? Is it okay to take a semester off guaranteeing that I will start making some changes in my image?"
898,I created a bracelet that is a useful tool in managing various mental health issues and it benefits charity!,"Hey guys! New poster here, I'm trying to do something positive during quarantine so here it goes!

I've struggled with severe panic attacks and agoraphobia for years. One day talking to my therapist he recommend a simple technique of, snapping a rubber band on my wrist.

The thought is, it distracts and grounds the mind and over time actually helps to correct the negative thoughts or behaviors.

It can be used for depression, anxiety, OCD, stress, etc.

When I would feel a anxiety or panic attack come on I would just start snapping the band and focus on the sensation, it was a form of grounding and allowed me something to focus on and was a great tool in managing my anxiety.

So one day I got to thinking of creating a bracelet that would be more durable then a rubber band because they constantly break and also look better as I'd get questions about why I was wearing a rubber band.

So for the last few months I've been working it and am finally at a point where I wanna share it.

I named it the Snap-Out bracelet. As its intended to snap you out of whatever your feeling, anxiety, depression, compulsive thoughts etc.

I made these out of a mixed rubber compound so they can be elastic yet durable. They Come in a bunch of colors as well!

I really wanted to create something that was helpful and did some good so I also am donating $1 per every bracelet sold to NAMI ( National Alliance on Mental Illness)

This May never take off like I hope, but if I could help a few people even in a small way I think it be worth it.

899,Not remembering someone you were close with's face after not seeing them for a few months?,"Hi, I don't know if this is really the right sub to be posting this or anything but not sure what to put it. I don't mean this as a symptom or anything like that just seeing if it happened to other people at times.

 Just a question of if this happens to anyone else- was very very close to a person (partner?) and saw them basically every day for a little less than a year, then went about three months not seeing them, saw them in person and thought wow they look way different than remembered &amp; it was weird to associate as the same person?

Soon as this corona is over I think I’m out on my ear and wondering if it’s just for the best I fuck off now and end it quietly"
901,breaking down after abusive dad had dinner with us,"I am not sure if this is the right sub to post in, please inform me if there is a more suitable one. I'm using an alt account for privacy reasons.

To start off, my father has not been the best father he could be. Whenever I would not obey him or be 'disrespectful' to whatever dumb standard he had, he would get very angry and violent. Especially against me. And I'm not talking just spanking or anything, it was quite serious. This began at a young age until I was about thirteen or fourteen, when my mother finally divorced him. 

Now, my father frequently comes over to have supper with us and leaves shortly after. This is because my younger sister really loves him and would miss him if he were to stay away for a long period of time. I think my mother would, too. He was never violent against my younger sister, so I can understand that she would feel for him. I don't resent him at all by the way, my mom always told me I should love him with the explanation that, at the end of the day, he IS my father and he was trying the best he could. 

So since the divorce, we never really talked about the whole violence thing. We just kind of swept it under the carpet. I didn't have any problem with it, I just wanted to live my life normally. 

Today, my father came over, we had dinner, just the usual. After dinner I was sitting on the couch, playing on my phone. My dad walked over and asked me to search something for him on google. I did, but immediately after I felt very anxious. It wasn't a panic attack, but something close to it. I felt like I had to get out of there and be anywhere but in the same room as him. I couldn't even look at him. I went upstairs to my room and broke down crying and could not stop.

This had never happened before. Can anybody tell me why I reacted this way about him, when I was fine for like two years? Was this even about him? Do I need professional help? I really do not want this to occur again."

904,How am I supposed to do the school assignments when I can barely brush my teeth? How am I supposed to prepare for the tests when I used all my energy to convince myself not to end my life?,How do I tell people I do nothing everyday?
905,What is wrong with me???,"Hi , for these past few weeks I've been really tired. Tired of life , tired of my favourite things, too tired for studying ( which is a surprise as I'm hardworking- ishh) . Basically ...I don't feel like doing anything in general . 
I can feel myself shutting down and I can nap for hours right after waking up from a 6-15 hrs of sleep . 
I feel extremely emotionally drained and weak as well.(physically weak) 
I apologize for disturbing but what can I do to  stop this and has anybody went thru this as well?"
906,How can I learn to better cope without going to a therapist.,"When I was younger 10-14 I had no friends and didn't have any socialization, with anyone my age, I was homeschooled and rarely left my house.

At one point I had gotten so depressed and lonely I felt like I had no control of my life, I thought about suicide, but I didn't go through with it. 

Eventually I developed a fantasy world where I was the main character and I had lots of friends, and had absolute control of my life, it felt great I was no longer lonely. But then I had problems with believing the world I had dreamt up was real and that this world was the dream, and no one could tell me otherwise. 

I couldn't seek out therapy at the time for a number of reasons. So for a while it only got worse. Then a family friend died, and me and my mom had to take care of his wife who had Alzheimer's. So I was right at the center of a harsh reality and my fantasy world came crashing down.

I stopped believing in the fantasy world, I stopped believing in everything. And I fell back into the depression. And once again considered suicide.

But then I found some social groups and started socializing more, and I was doing well other than some anxiety for the last 6 years.

Lately though my social groups have broken up, and my girlfriend broke up with me. And the quarantine hasn't helped. 

I feel myself wanting to escape to the fantasy world again, but I know that wouldn't be a good idea.

How can I cope with the loneliness without escaping reality?"
907,Is pathological/compulsive lying considered a mental illness?,"I've been wondering ages whether it is a mental illness, as on one side: a compulsive/pathological liar knows what they're lying about and isn't dazed or confused about it, but on the other side, they might not be."
908,Can too much exercise worsen depression?,"I'm not very physically fit, but I wanted to change that and started exercising again for the first time in over a month. It's been a week and the first 5 days were good, a bit sore, but my anxiety was a little better. However, the past 2 days my depression has been so bad. I figured I might aswell do light exercises to keep up my routine, but enough to recover. 

I woke up today feeling so emotionally numb, my muscles are a kinda tired,but mentally i feel dead. I didnt want to wake up this morning and I cant bring myself to do anything. I just feel awful and I havent felt this bad in a while. Could my exercise routine be causing this?"
909,I need help but I can't afford it,"Hi, this is my very first post on reddit and I really hope I can find some answers because I can't by myself. 

Sorry for the long read.

If it's relevant I'm a 21m I'm not from the US and my first language isn't english, so, sorry in advance.

This last year has been very tough for me.

Starting with the fact that my girlfriend decided to end our relationship of two years on june last year (we were not okay at that point), but she keeps coming back every two months telling me she wants to try again and make it work. I'm still in love with her so I say yes, we try for a month and then she leaves again saying she doesn't feel comfortable and is scared of telling her parents and friends. She is very fickle minded and gets jnfluenced a lot by her friends thoughts and opinions. To add a little context we study the same major at the same college so we share a lot of classes and friends, we see each other a lot because of this. Two months ago (March) she told me she had been seeing a guy last year when we were on and off (she can't be alone for long periods of time, I started out as a ""rebound"" from her previous ex). It obviously hurt me because, despite I had sex one time with another girl, I didn't had feelings for that girl. When my ex told me about this we were trying to build something again. Next month (April) she told me she just wanted to be friends with me. I'm in quarantine because of coronavirus so all I do is think about her and worry about what she's doing, who she's talking to and all of that. It really is making me sick and I can't seem to control it. I can never fully heal because she keeps coming back, opening the wound and leaving.

I've lost a lot of hair and I feel super insecure about myself, I worry that no one's gonna like me ever again. I don't look good enough in the mirror. I've always thought my ex was more attractive than me, so she has 0 problems getting a rebound or another guy whereas I struggle more, because, as we know, it's expected for the man to make the first move to initiate something with a girl. I feel too insecure to do it. 

My father lost his job more than a year ago and my mom doesn't make enough to pay all the bills and stuff. This is also the reason why I won't graduate from college with all of my friends, I had to take less clases because of money. I do work, but the majority of it goes to helping in my house through this rough patch and paying for my stuff. My parents offered me to go to a psychologist but its too expensive (around 40$ an hour) and I don't want them to get more in to debt.

I've talked about this several times with my best friend, she's very supportive and does everything she can but I don't want her to put up with my shit so much. These things I've listed here are the most recent ones, but I have another one or two unresolved problems with myself. I know a lot of you guys are going through worse times, but I hope you can help me. I'm not doing well at all and I want to stop that.

I think what hurts me and upsets me the most is the fact that I've always been the funny/goofy guy and I don't feel like that anymore, I think I've lost my spark.

Thank you so much for reading. And for all your answers."

912,Looking for a therapist,"For some background, I am in my 20s. I saw a therapist as a kid for grief counseling after a close family member passed away. My parents sprung it on me out of nowhere and I *dreaded* that first visit. My therapist turned out to be an amazing woman and I saw her for about a year and a half. I was devastated when we lost our insurance and I had to stop seeing her. I've seen one therapist since and there's a whole bunch of drama around that I won't get into. The bottom line is I'm in need of a new therapist.

So today I called my hospital in search of a new therapist. I had done some research for a new therapist already but my mom prefers I find a therapist within our medical group to make sure our insurance covers it. I had to call and give some basic information to a nurse. She will give it to the mental health coordinator (that's not the right title but I already forgot what she said) who will call me to answer some more questions about my mental health. From there, the coordinator will match me with a therapist that may suit my needs.

I'm absolutely *terrified*. I feel like a kid again, not knowing who I might be paired with or what I'm getting into. I know this is what I need right now, but I still have so much anxiety around it. I am still extremely grateful to have these resources available to me, as I know lots of people struggling right now that are not as fortunate."
913,Finally,"Last night, everything got on top of me and I was finally going to do it. I genuinely was ready to commit suicide. 
I sought the help of my best friend. She was blunt, then ignored me and then blocked me. I was so ready to because if my best friend can just cut me off like that, then whats the point? 

Obviously I didn't as I've just written this. The point is, no matter how hard shit gets, I'm fine. The thing to do is to add ""for now"" at the end of it. I wanted to die, for now. I am angry, for now. I was sitting there, sobbing my heart out at the fact no one cares - No one needs to care. I care and that's it. 

I wanted an easy solution to a temporary problem, my goal in life is to be that person that I never had. It was so selfish of me to take away someone's friend, lifeline, smile perhaps. I'm happy writing this, because despite being that far off the edge, I still came back.

Thank you for reading, if you did. Have a blessed day."
914,Am I the problem in my family?,"
This is a long one.... 


My (F26) father recently lost his job after being dismissed for bullying and harassment. He’s having a really hard time and is severely depressed. I’m currently in therapy due to things I did and I have worked out with a therapist that my father emotionally abused and neglected me. The other day I was feeling very guilty and conflicted because although I don’t think my dad should have been sacked, I could sympathise with his accusers at work. I told my Mom this and told her I felt bad about it. After this, I noticed my Mom was being off with me, so I text her and asked her why she was being funny with me. She replied “It sounds like you think your Dad should have been sacked”. Her saying this triggered me big time and I lashed out a little over text saying that was not the case and reminding her of all the times he’d bullied us in the past and all the times she’d sat there and supported him. I only said this because what she said made me feel really bad, as if I wasn’t feeling guilty already. After this, my Mom and Dad say downstairs and my Mom told my Dad the texts I had sent her and that I thought he was a bully. What happened after was 12 hours of emotional and verbal abuse (directed at me, stating I was a failure and was basically tainted), at first I was arguing back with my father but in the end gave up and agreed with him. I told him I didn’t blame him for the bullying (I’m very big on childhood trauma and can also sympathise with him) but he wouldn’t accept it. One minute he was crying and hugging me, the next he was cursing at me. I followed him around for 12 hours because he said he was going to commit suicide and kept playing mind games. I had not touched any alcohol but I felt drunk. I felt like I was going crazy and I called an ambulance because I was terrified. Meanwhile, my Mom was very, VERY drunk and my brother just called me an idiot and went out. My Dad said I was evil because I kicked him when he was down and I was worse than the people accusing him at work. I told him I stay away from my family (I.e in my bedroom) a lot because I don’t want the confrontation. You can’t have an opinion in my house. I’m also terrified that I will turn in to my Dad. He said that I am what I am and he is what he is and we can never change. He also said I contributed to my Brother being a nasty kid. My brother is five years younger than me.

I know I shouldn’t have angrily text my Mom but I never, ever wanted to drag up things from the past. I was simply doing it to tell her how I was feeling. I also found out that everything i had told her about my mental illness (in confidence) she had told my Dad. Because we’re going through a hard time, I am willing to let it go for now, but I feel like I am a changed person. And I feel plagued with guilty. If my Dad kills himself it will be because of me. 

Can anyone give me any advice. I’ve spoken to friends but sometimes advice is better coming from an outsider, in my opinion."
915,Pain.,"It never ends. Everybody says ""it'll get better,"" but it never does. I don't know why I'm still here. Nobody will miss me. Nobody on this sub even knows me. It hurts. The thoughts don't go away. Is suicide a good option?"
916,"My dreams are too alluring, my mind is stuck.","Hello, this is my first post here.

So over the last month I've been experiencing similar extremely vivd dreams relevant to the same exact event that I'm struggling in real life with. Someone I was extremely close has left my life for their own reasons, and while I try to accept that and I don't reach out anymore, I'm still extremely dissatisfied with how things are and it's hard to move on. I thought time would be the solution but it seems that my own mind is against me, as every night in my dreams an extremely similar set of events happens: we meet, we talk and we become friends again. Sometimes it might be in different ways, different contexts, different situations, even while implementing elements from my days or events that happened in real life, so I wouldn't say it's a matter of having the same dream but coming up with the same pleasantry every night.

This repeating happy thought in my dreams haunts me once I wake up knowing I still cannot reach out to that person and I still cannot reconnect. It's haunting me how I live out my outmost desire every night to wake up in this world I don't like. I have had occasions where I'd sleep through my alarms and my classes until the dreams ended, even if I was well rested and such.

Today I woke up at 6pm after an 11 hour sleep and the happiest dream so far, and reality hit me like a truck, it's getting harder to study on my finals and focus on my responsibilities, as getting out of bed in the morning is getting harder and harder, as is accepting the situation I am currently in. I am at a loss on what to do, how to move on and how to discipline my mind into behaving correctly.

I'd really appreciate anything you can share with me."
917,Sometimes I don't see the point of doing anything anymore,"What's so fun about life really? Wake up, school, work, do all your duties and have a tiny bit of time left over. But you're so done for the day it's not really your time anymore.

Some days I get a wave of unhappiness. On other days I can remind myself that, hey, the outside is kinda pretty and food is nice, friends can make me happy and I'm doing something I have a bit of passion for. But in that wave it doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm just done with it.

I get so overwhelmed. I actually need to find a new job but I'm hesitant because I'm scared it'll become overwhelming. When I see other people I start overthinking, what would they think of me, is my speech normal, should I be walking different? I have a hard time getting into routines. I sleep at different hours each day and my personal hygiene is at irregular intervals too. 

Everytime I start a routine it breaks down on itself. I tried exercising but it didn't work out. I'm also too scared to go to the gym so I just did bodyweight exercises at home. I've never really exercised so I'm incredibly weak and do everything with wrong form.

And I have almost no friends. I almost never go outside except for when I need to get something done. I wouldn't even know where to start to find friends. There's always such a distance between me and another person. It never really clicks.

My face has become so gloomy. I used to be a happy, relatively optimistic person. Even my mother has told me: ""You look a lot more sad and tired these days. I guess it's because you've become an adult, with all the responsibilities you now have."" I wish I could return to the days where everything could make me laugh, but I think it's not possible anymore. It's been too long. I've become what I am now, I guess I will have to accept that.

I see other people and ask myself, how do they do it? What makes it so easy, why doesn't everything weigh them down?

And instead of doing something useful, I just stare away into a screen. For a minute, an hour, becoming days which turn into years. The world sometimes feels like a stranger to me. What makes life worth it? I wish I could solve the riddle, but I've never been clever.

I'm simply spewing my shit here and I'm sorry for that. But it would be nice to hear something. To know I'm not alone, share what you think or even to help me. Ok cya :^)"
918,"I’m making a playlist of songs that reference mental illness, any suggestions?","[here’s the playlist so far](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/142JjXc3D1LjrBLU27eezi?si=YC5X5R24SrCntX207oiCvQ)

The playlist has mostly alternative stuff but turned out pretty emo. Looking to expand it. Thanks!"
919,Lockdown and failed relationship set me back,"Over the last few years my mental health has been up and down. I believe I have been depressed for probably the last ten years. It found its way to self harm a couple of years ago. I realised what was happening and didn’t want to feel that way anymore. One thing that really provoked this was my then girlfriend breaking up with me because she couldn’t handle someone in that mental space. My mental health started to improve, I went cold turkey on my medication because I didn’t feel it was doing anything. I was getting myself to being ok, still a way from happy but improving. Then the lockdown in the uk hit. I really miss my friends and family, miss doing things I enjoyed and lost things I was looking forward to. Like festivals and gigs etc. I am a key worker so have continued to work throughout, blessing and a curse probably. It’s made me realise how much I need people around me for my health. As if things weren’t difficult enough, said ex told me she loved me again, I told her I love her. She then got with her best friend whilst leading me on thinking there was something between us. 

So ye, life really sucks right now. Not at the point of self harm thankfully but certainly am spiralling. I have referred myself for therapy and contemplating trying medication again. I want to be happy in myself and know my self worth but through past experiences I have been broken down. 

Not sure what I want from this post, mostly feel it was somewhere to share what I am feeling in a judgement free way."
920,Self sabotage because of fear of failure?,"I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone else has this same thing going on, or if anyone has any advice. 

I’m starting to realize lately, sometimes I don’t work as hard at something I should I should in order to have an “excuse” if I fail.

Currently I’m in law school, and there’s some “competitive” things to get into certain teams. Right now we’re doing an optional writing competition to get into the law review - which is basically an academic journal, students to editing and writing for it, it’s one of the most prestigious things you can do in law school even if you don’t actually get anything published. It looks good on resumes.

I’ve been procrastinating on it and going back and forth over whether I should even try. I don’t know. I guess I’m doing it because it’s easier to say I didn’t get it because I was just being lazy, but if I had tried I would have gotten it, rather than work really hard and not get it because my best wasn’t good enough.

This isn’t the first time I’ve done this, but it is making me realize it’s a problem. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I’m not sure if this is because of that or it’s a separate thing or maybe it’s just that I’m lazy and dumb. I don’t know."
921,Quarantine is actually improving my mental health,"I was pretty badly depressed for the past year. No meds were helping. I was skipping all my classes and failed 2 last semester, my social life really sucked and I had a terrible judge of character. 

Once quarantine started and school went online it made it a lot easier for me to obtain success. My grades skyrocketed to As, I feel like not being able to see people has given me more clarity as to who’s worth keeping in my life, and there’s less pressure to be everywhere and do everything. I’m finding my interest and passions in things I used to like is coming back. 
Has quarantine actually helped anyone else’s mental health also?"
922,I can’t do it.,"I feel like I can’t keep trying to live. What’s the point? All I wanted was the opportunity to be happy. I’m a failure. I’ve tried to help and be a keeper of peace. Instead I’m being ripped apart by people I care about. Maybe if I were gone, then it would all stop. I just want to die now. No more happiness or sadness, I just want to be gone."
923,Uncontrollable strange ticks when I’m alone,"I don’t really know how to explain my situation, but I’ve always found myself doing ridiculous things in private. I’m very quiet and reserved around others, but I act very strangely when I’m alone, and tend to have frequent outbursts. 

One moment I’m making food in the kitchen like anybody else, but then out of nowhere I’ll curl up my wrists into my chest like a T-Rex, jerking my head to the side with my eyes rolled back, silently cussing/screaming. Other times I’ll punch myself in the stomach as hard as I can or slap my palm against the side of my head, and I’ll blurt out very horrible things/slurs that I would never say normally. 

I don’t know why I act out like this when I’m alone. I understand how ridiculous these actions are, but I can’t seem to stop myself. I’ve done it my whole life and I’m just starting to grasp how odd it is. I don’t think I have Tourette’s because I can control it when others are around. Yet, I can’t control it when I’m alone. 

It’s never happened in public, but when I’ve smoked with friends, there have been times where those behaviorisms slipped out and everyone thought I was crazy. 

Are these just intrusive thoughts? Is it common to act like this when you’re alone?"
924,Can anyone of help this guy out? He seems deeply troubled.,
925,I think that covid-19 might be triggering an OCD response...?,"I guess that you must see a lot of people who self-diagnose. I know that OCD isn't just washing hands a lot. 

I've always been strange when it comes to meat. It was born from a childhood of frequent food poisoning. If I handle raw meat, I feel contaminated and I have to wash my hands lots of times. If I leave meat out of the fridge for more than fifteen minutes, it is no longer considered safe. I reduced meat intake when I realised that I was wasteful, and that seemed to make things better until I go to my parent's home and I have to eat meat. Same with rice, when they leave leftovers out &gt;15 minutes.

With Covid-19 floating around, I don't feel safe anymore. It started with washing hands a few times. Then, my flatmates decided to go out frequently with friends. I would be scared of contamination and I'd touch doorknobs and light switches with my elbow (like it granted immunity). Or I would have to wash my hands ten or eleven times when cooking a meal in the kitchen just in case. Touch a switch, wash hands. Touch a pan handle, wash hands. Touch a spoon, wash hands. I found myself washing my hands, then using my hands to turn off the faucet, then having to wash my hands again, because the faucet could be contaminated. I would wash them in counts of 4 x 4 in my head. It got so bad that my hands are cracked, bleeding and constantly in pain. Even with moisturizer. I don't know if they'll ever go back to normal. 

I thought that things would change when I moved into a new place where I live alone. But I fear that the inner front doorknob and light switch is contaminated from coming in and out, so every time I touch it, I have to wash my hands, even though I disinfect it each time I come home. I always feel like I didn't clean my hands properly, so I have to wash my hands again.

Maybe it's not OCD. I'm just tired and stressed from covid and I feel like I'll never be the same again."
926,How to deal with having no family to count on?,"TSIA. I was born and used by my parents as a punching bag and to get at eachothers throats. I've managed so far (23 now!) but the fact I will never have close family to celebrate holidays or achievements, to depend on or w/e is really getting to me. I don't wanna die estranged to my family, and I don't want them to die estranged from me either. I hate thinking about how things will go if I ever get a wife and kids and it makes me feel like there's absolutely no point in living.

How do I deal with this? How have you dealt with things like this?"

929,Do I need therapy?,"I just lay in bed all day. I don't have motivation to do literally anything. Every time I try to do something, I lose focus after 20 seconds. Even doing dishes takes me ages. Nothing seems fun anymore. I don't even desire food anymore. I just force myself to eat and drink for my health, and I'm not really succeeding. I feel like I'm losing all my friends in the process but I just don't know how to stop it.

I have no clue where to start. I told my mom I was feeling like shit and I needed help, but she just forgot about it. Do I visit my family doctor first? Do I make an appointment with a local psychologist directly? Is it even something I should get treated for?

I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit but it seemed the most appropriate from my perspective."
930,Does depression make your brain shrink?,"So lately I’ve been doing some research that’s terrifying me. Apparently depression causes the hippocampus (in charge of memory and emotion) to shrink, sometimes permanently. 

The reason I’m so scared of this is because I’m afraid of becoming dumber, especially since my intelligence is something I use to define my self worth and self esteem. 

I’ve worked my ass off my entire life in hopes of getting good test grades and scores for my parents and peers’ approval, and my high IQ has always been something that made me feel less like a worthless piece of shit. I don’t know if I could handle knowing that my severe depression is literally undoing years of sacrificing EVERYTHING in order to be considered smart and get into a top college. 

I know this post may sound like I’m bragging or something but I’ll have you know I consider myself a dumb piece of shit so please don’t judge me. Also ik this post is all over so I apologize for that too but I’m currently typing all of this during a depressive episode and I just really need someone to answer my question. 

Is this brain damage ever reversible, or am I permanently screwed? Please let me know. If it is in any way reversible, how can I reverse the brain damage?"

I just wanted to talk , i had no intention of getting back together . But she ignored me , it felt so cold.

933,I finally told someone,"I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years. When I was 10 my mom found one of  my sucide notes and basically told me that I couldn't be depressed and took the opportunity to instead, vent to me about all of her problems. So I didnt say a word about how I felt to anyone after that. Six years later and quarantine is pushing me my mental limits. My dad walked into my room and I just burst into tears and told him everything. How I wanted to die and that I thought I needed professional help. We talked for a while, which was a breakthrough because I barely talk to my dad and know almost nothing about him. I feel like a load has been lifted off my chest, even though I'm not ok, I feel like I have a chance to be one day."
934,Quite Great PR inspired by musicians attitudes in line with Mental Health Awareness Week 2020,"**18th-24th** **May sees this year’s Mental Health Awareness Week**, a time which allows people from all walks of life with mental health issues to have the opportunity to tell their story and for the world around them to listen and try to understand the complexity of the myriad of conditions which make day-to-day life so difficult for so many.

Quite Great has worked with many, many artists over the years with a range of [mental health issues](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/music-therapy-support-to-help-musicians-through-stressful-times/), from depression to anxiety to PTSD and PND, no two stories are the same and there is no magic cure. Musicians and artists find themselves under more scrutiny than many – what they look like; how they sound; what their opinions are – this can be challenging for anyone but for someone who may well be alone…possibly even on tour, thousands of miles from home, it can be life-changing and incredibly damaging to their health and well-being.

[Mental Health Awareness Week](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/blog/quite-great-pr-inspired-by-musicians-attitudes-in-line-with-mental-health-awareness-week-2020/) gives artists the chance to explain what life is like for them year-round – UNDERSTANDING is what is needed – not throwaway comments like “*cheer up*” or “*pull yourself together*”. By listening, we can begin to learn and empathise with what life is like not just for one week of the year but as part of who they are for all their lives. With this year’s theme being ‘***kindness***’, we welcome the chance to not only discuss the stories and issues of so many talented, wonderful people whom were are proud to work with but to celebrate their achievements and to show that with kindness, empathy and tolerance, it is possible to be anything you want to be, not despite your condition but with it simply being a part of the fabric of life. Here are three acts whose commitment to telling their story has given hope and inspiration to people around the world."

936,Prozac,"it’s been 6 days since i stopped talking Effexor ( 37.5mg ) and the only ‘ withdrawal ‘ symptoms that i’ve been experiencing is minor ‘ brain zaps ‘, i get annoyed easily?? and this weird feeling that i’m not hungry but i still force myself to eat ( weight and everything like that is completely normal !! )

my doctor wants me to start my 10mg of Prozac starting tomorrow but i honestly don’t know if i want to start a new medication or not, i feel somewhat normal now ( i’ve tried 8 other medications for my anxiety/depression , i was on Effexor for 2 years ) and i kind of want to be ‘ medication free ‘ for a few months, maybe even close to a year if i can. 

i’ve heard so many mixed stories about prozac, maybe can i hear some stories from real people to help me figure out if it’s something that will help me in ways Effexor didn’t."
937,Has everyone gone mad?,"My mother ( who I don’t get along with at all but has PTSD and Depression) and my downstairs neighbor ( I never seen her or know anything about her ) are currently at war right now. My mother has a sleeping disorder so she doesn’t sleep well at night and tends to walk around the house. This has been going on since for ever. My downstairs neighbor lives with her child and she claims that we make lots of noise upstairs throughout the middle of the night. We all know it’s my mother and of course my mother is in denial. My mom takes meds but can’t control her sleep disorder and has a urge to wonder around the house at night ( almost like sleep walking but she’s aware of it? ) anyways, this was never an issue before until 1 month of quarantine. My mom has history of fighting her neighbors and we move out a lot ( this is my 5th house throughout my 16 years of living ) my house is very abusive ( fights between step dad and mom, mom hitting my siblings.) yesterday my mom seemed to have a panic attack. She was screaming loudly at my stepdad and acting wild. I was in my room and didn’t witness anything. ( I stay in my room to avoid problems so I miss everything but I hear it. ) my downstairs neighbor sent more complaints to the landlord because of this. Now my mom is talking on the phone screaming at the landlord and blaming the downstairs neighbor. This isn’t the only problem. Anyways I just had to vent because I have no one else to tell this to."
938,what's wrong with me?,"hi, i have never posted before on reddit so bare with me if this is absolutely horrible. thanks.

ok so, recently I've had these feelings that are sort of hard to explain so i'll try my best to explain it. i feel angry and i feel the need to do something bad but at the same time i dont feel angry. so i am aware that i am angry, but im actively angry?? (does that make sense?)  these thoughts scare me and im scared that i'll do something dumb that i do not want (eg: start a fight with my friends for no reason, which happens a lot). i have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and i want to know if that has anything to do with this. if you have any ideas to what is wrong with me or steps i could take to get help please let me know. thank you !"
939,I spend more time in my imaginary life than in my real one,"Hi!

I'm just gonna cut right to the point. Since I was 7 or 8 years old (I am 19 now) I have had another life in my head. These lives have changed, like different names, different people. The life I am living now though, I haven't changed in maybe 4 years. Which is probably the longest time I haven't changed it actually! But that's not the point.

The point is that I spend more time in that life than in my real one. If I am alone, sometimes even if I'm not, all of my conversations, all of my activities, everything I'm doing, I treat it as if it's in that imaginary life. I rarely think as myself. Like actual true myself, not my imaginary identity.

And I'm scared that I will never be able to let go. Also I don't want to let go. I love that life, it gives me comfort, it makes me way happier than I would be without it and for the longest time I thought it was just something weird I did. But maybe a year ago I realized that it might be a bit deeper than that.

So I guess what I'm asking here is, is that a bad thing? Should I try to let go of that life, no matter how happy it makes me? Cause after all, I guess I should focus on my real life more..

Thank you!"
940,So this might not really be a mental health question but I’m not really sure where to post. I frequently find myself in this mood where I’m just apathetic and indifferent to basically everything.,"
I’m not upset, anxious, stressed, happy, motivated, angry, hungry, tired, in pain, bored, etc.

When I consider the various things I could do, for each one I decide “no I don’t want to do that” but I’m not thinking “that sounds hard”, “that doesn’t sound fun”, “I’m too tired” or anything like that.

It’s just very blank, that’s really the only way I can describe it.  There aren’t really any major thoughts going on in my head or measurably strong emotions, etc.

I’m not in any obviously weird headspace, I’m not meditative, hallucinating, being impulsive or sporadic, I’m not high, nothing like that.

I just pace and think “what’s some stuff I could do?”, but don’t actually move beyond that thought.

Does anyone know the feeling I’m talking about, experienced it themselves?"
941,One of the worst parts of mental illness is not realizing that you’re a find like an asshole until much later,"I’ve done so many socially inappropriate/shitty things that I never realized were wrong until much later. The mix of embarrassment and guilt makes you hate yourself for not keeping your actions in check.

Mental illness should never be used as a justification for poor behavior, but there are times where it slips out and you can’t seem to stop yourself in the moment. I still feel ashamed of my slip-ups/worst moments, because I know I could have controlled myself."
942,"Incessantly talking to myself and ""perfecting"" reality","I've been talking to myself for three years now. When doing this, I usually go to the bathroom (or, if any of the rooms are empty, I'll go in there too) and converse with myself in front of a mirror. Sometimes I stay in there for a few minutes, sometimes a few hours; I might even switch from bathroom to bathroom to continue my conversations.

At first, I solely used this as a coping mechanism where I would release pent up emotions and revisit some overwhelming events. However, now I talk to myself for more than cathartic reasons. I'll create scenarios or initiate ""debates"" where I imagine multiple people are arguing and expressing different emotions. I'll even take it a step further and pretend to be each individual in the conversation (which would look very odd to an outsider because I'm switching between different ""people""). I'll retell, exaggerate, and make up stories with myself for entertainment; I laugh to myself, argue with myself, etc. 

I'm obsessed with doing this. I've had such insightful discussions with myself that I simply could not replicate with other people. They don't get it, or even try to. Most people aren't that real to me. If I like some qualities of a person, I'll just go in front of a mirror (after interacting with them) and mimic/modify their desirable traits to create my own version of them (something akin to impersonation, but not really). I'm not entirely sure why I do this. Maybe forming several dramatic personas has really eroded my sense of self, maybe reality and its players are just disappointing, I don't really know. 

The worse part is when the conversations begin to die down and I feel myself gaining touch with reality. The lights get really bright and colors get sharper, like reality is taunting me. It's fucking upsetting. I know I'm alone and no one/nothing in my head really exists and there is nothing I can do to make it real because I lack control. I just sit there and stare at the wall because what fucking else am I supposed to do? I can't talk to people in real life about this because they all make that stupid face like ""What's wrong with her?"" so I just go back to the bathroom to correct their reaction in my head."
943,My family doesn’t think mental health is a real thing.,My family is very much attached to the stigma associated with mental health problems. They are always saying things like people with mental health issues need to “get over themselves.” I am disgusted with these comments as I struggle with extreme anxiety and depression. They don’t take me seriously. I’m not financially independent so I am not sure how to move forward without feeling like the biggest loser ever. Does anyone else have a family like this? How do you get through it?
944,I want to be depressed?,"I got out of an psychiatry about a year and a half ago. Ever since I missed it and everything around that time. I got over it mostly, but lately I've been feeling pretty down again. It's not as bad as back then, but I feel like I want to feel this way again. I listen to old music I listened to back then and try to feel even sadder. Sometimes I can't get into songs from then just becouse I'm not in this mindset anymore. I'd love to listen to some emo music and just cry myself out but I just don't feel depressed enough. It's like my Mind trys to reanact these times so badly but just can't. I don't know what to feel. I don't feel depressed or at least not as depressed as back then, but I definitely don't feel happy. Every time I get slightly sad I try to make it even worse. If someone offered me to either be happy for the rest of my life or depressed I'd probably chose to be depressed if asked while I'm in this cycle. I know that these times were nowhere near good or enjoyable but I just miss them so much. I'd probably even go in psychiatry again, not becouse I feel really suicidal but becouse I miss it. I even miss selfharming even though my condition isn't so bad that I'd really need it. Has anyone experienced something similar and has any tips and tricks how to cope this?

Just realized how long that got. I just don't know how to describe it without that many words. Thanks if you read through the whole thing."
945,Someday I'll develop anorexia,"I don't blame myself. When everyone around you only loves slim, unhealthy-looking people you have to do it. I'm not in a pathology, they are.

Only the slim, undeveloped, skinny, holocaust-esque looking guys get love. So that's what I'll do. I'd rather destroy my body and be loved than otherwise."
946,Toxic friends and family,"What do you guys do when your family and friends are unsupportive? They don’t share your excitement or happiness with you, they express doubt and concern and focus on every negative outcome for every scenario. Example: job offer in my dream city? The response I got was “oh. you’ll be so far away...” Moving in with my boyfriend- “oh cool, happy for you but sad for me”

It’s so draining.

I find myself withholding things that I’m happy or excited about because I don’t want it to be ruined with toxicity and negative thoughts of my family and friends. Is this normal??? I love these people and no family or friend is perfect, but it’s so draining."
947,am i developing some form of dementia or schizophrenia?,"in the past few months, i have been experiencing increasingly frequent auditory hallucinations and occasional visual hallucinations. my hallucinations have gone from about one a week to at least one every day or so. my rare visual hallucinations have included the fish from the spongebob intro hanging on a hook in my closet, reciting the theme song, and a bald man in a gray long sleeve shirt and jeans that crouches on my floor and grabs the edge of my bed, whispering in a low voice in a language i can’t understand. the auditory hallucinations are much more frequent, and range from auto mobile noises, to footsteps and a body shifting (often in my ceiling), to laughing and crying, to singing (no lyrics), to non sexual moaning, and sometimes whispering that is too quiet to understand. i often videotape these events and send them to friends, who can’t see or hear what i can. i also watch the videos the next day and can no longer see or hear it. aside from hallucinations, i have developed insomnia. my insomnia makes it impossible for me to fall asleep until at least two am, and regularly causes me to stay awake for days on end (often one to two, but at extremes it can be up to five). it’s become harder for me to focus and i need to write down what i am told to understand complicated things (such as math lessons). my great grandmother developed dementia after having a stroke, and her daughter (my grandmother who is a functioning and working adult) often tells me and other family about how she sees and talks to ghosts often (usually strangers but sometimes her mother and her and her husband’s “guardian angels”.) her daughter (my aunt) tells me she hears voices and can talk to dead people and deities. my grandmother and aunt have not been diagnosed with anything, but i wonder if any of that information could show that i have something hereditary that could be the source of what i’m experiencing. i know i should seek professional help, but i don’t feel comfortable doing that. not to mention how busy all of my local medical centers are with the pandemic."

949,"Mother thinks I have an eating disorder, I don't know how to stop her stressing about it.","So I'm 16, and I have always been quite overweight, and I used to basically binge eat every day. Recently I have decided to try and change things, so I have been going on long walks and trying to eat less. Now I'm at a point where I don't eat nearly as much as I did before. But anyway, my mother keeps trying to force me to eat because she doesn't think I'm eating enough and she says that this is related to my mental health. Any suggestions on how I can try and stop her being so worried about me, and help her understand that I'm not ""anorexic"" or whatever she thinks. I feel very guilty about this too and I've thought about just giving up and going back to eating loads of crap all the time, but I really don't want to do that just because of my mother's reactions to my choices. Thanks for any advice you can give :D"
950,How to tell my friend I don’t want to live with her?,"Hello, so, I’m looking  for roommates and an apartment to move out. One of my best friends is telling me to move out together and is being really persistent  about it. The thing is that she has BPD,  I try to be patient and help her any time she needs it, however I’m a person that can get depress (I was diagnosed with high functioning depression years ago) and one of the things that has helped is being alone sometimes, with my thoughts and own space. I love my friend and I want to support her but she sometimes can get really verbally aggressive, intense, and extremely angry in an instant. I’ve gone to the beach with her for 4 days and I’ve experienced it. Of course I try to help her, be compassionate but sometimes I feel emotionally drained, exhausted, and anxious. I don’t think I won’t be able to live with her, specially because we are extremely good friends and if I tell her that I want space she’ll get extremely sad which I don’t want her to. I would prefer a more impersonal roommate to be with and someone that I know will respect my privacy and alone time, without feeling sad or taking it personally. What can I do? How do I tell her?"
951,I feel like I'm manipulative.,"I don't understand myself very much anymore, throw me a bone someone. I find myself often feeling very manipulative, like somehow I feel like when I talk,I'm somewhat manipulating people into thinking I have good intentions or like I'm a good person.   


A good example of how I often feel manipulative when I speak sometimes would be,  
if I tell someone that ""I'm a bad person"", I'm essentially tricking them into telling me that I'm not a bad person,and by pointing this fact out to them, I have once again manipulated them into thinking that I'm not a bad person and that may become true to them because I've openly told them about my manipulative techniques therefore it is something that they inherently believe in.   


I feel like maybe deep down, I'm manipulative by nature and it is in my nature to twist my words and make the words work for me just so others can view me the way I want them to,making others feel bad, or making others feel pity  for me. I'm no longer sure if this is a thing I'm doing on purpose, or it's just something that I'm doing subconsciously, even as I'm writing this, I feel like I'm tricking my audience into taking pity on me."
952,How am I supposed to act around people who don't want to calm down?,"I don't mean *enraged*, just... when you're frustrated, maybe venting, or you're just... you know, when someone is mildly irritated at something. I get scared, even if it's something small. I don't know how to act. Should I... get angry in solidarity? Try to calm them down? I don't want to act like it doesn't *matter,* but it's not like something big that I actually have an opinion on and can discuss. When someone is struggling to make something work, or find something, or have had a bad day, and they're mad, I just want them to calm down... but if I ask them to, directly or indirectly, I'm afraid they'll direct that anger at me. That's what happened in the past...

What do you do? How do I not get scared of my loved ones over the smallest, most normal human behaviors? What am I supposed to do? I can't ask them *not* to occasionally be mildly frustrated around me. And I don't want to make my partner feel like they have to avoid me."
953,I cannot stop thinking about killing my 8 year old brother and I am 17.,"There’s so much to explain. I’m severely depressed so the slightest noise that bothers me will piss me off. Be it laughter, mouth chewing, clicking, shows, animals, videos, etc. I can’t watch certain shows due to certain noises that trigger my irritation. I then yell or lock myself in my room. This is my assumption based on what I know and what I’ve seen, I assume he has a case of ADHD or a learning disability and I can’t sit down with him for more than 5 minutes without calling him “dumb” or “stupid”. I walk away into my room to calm down and tell him to get it done without help cause I can’t do it. I can’t do it anymore with him. His presence in this house irritates me. His existence pisses me off. And I have no clue why I have all this hate for my flesh and blood (be it, he’s my half brother). I can’t tell my mother, sister, hell... I can’t even tell my fiancé how I feel about him. I feel like a monster and like I’m being driven into insanity. I’ve been in a psych ward 3 times due to self-harm, suicide attempts and constant anger/irritation to extremes. I’ve attempted suicide 2 times. Once when I was 13 and recently on February 16th. I’m a week clean of self-harm but I’m positive it’ll go back to being 0 days. My mom invalidates my feelings, I feel fucking worthless though I’ve graduated high-school. And I’m so fucking stressed out I’m going to probably die at 25 from it if I don’t get down to what the hell is wrong with me. I don’t want to kill people. I’ve never thrown a fist to anybody in my life, and everyday it’s more and more tempting to hurt people I see walking. I don’t know what to do and I just want to know what’s wrong with me. It’s not just depression, I’m so deeply convinced that there’s so so so so much worse in my mind. I don’t remember anything before I was 10/11 years old, all of it is repressed aside from events that’d happen everyday. My mother has told me that I’m faking my illnesses even though doctors, MULTIPLE DOCTORS, have told her, over and over and over again I am severely depressed. I believe that if this continues I might have to force myself into a residential home for the severely mentally ill. I have a diagnosis pending for Paranoid Schizophrenia and it gets worse and worse everyday of quarantine. I haven’t showered in a week, brushed my teeth or brushed my hair in the same time. I’ve been called a “fat barn house” by my Grandma who has choked me and kicked me for telling her I was transgender (FtM) and I knew the laws of anything was to happen to me. I just want to be told I need to go away, and go away for good. I feel like a monster in human flesh.. I need help but my mom makes me feel like shit for wanting it and twists my mind to make me turn against myself. I don’t want to black out and hurt people.. I don’t want it to reach that point. My memory is hell everyday, I can’t remember where I put stuff and will forget what I ate 15 minutes ago. I will forget to text people or call people for appointments and I won’t remember. I don’t remember saying or doing certain things and I just don’t know what’s going on.. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.."
954,My mental health is deteriorating.,"I’m a high school senior about to graduate. Unfortunately, I got denied from the instate school I applied to. I originally was supposed to go to Portland state university, found a roommate and payed for my enrollment deposit until my dad told me I can’t go anymore because he can’t afford it. It took me awhile to come to an agreement with it, and I agreed to apply to the University of Hawaii ( instate ) . I applied there back in Feb, just got my letter today saying they cant offer me admissions. Gonna be honest, I’m crushed. I met so much cool people who are gonna be going there only to be denied. I know y’all might be thinking “ Denied? How? The school has a high acceptance rate ! “ ... my SAT wasn’t too good. Now , I’ll be attending community college. One part of me is sad and upset i won’t get the college experience the first two years, another part of me is glad I can save money and not rush into a big 4 year. I will be planning to transfer after 2 years to NY, or Cali. My dad is giving me shit right now saying it’s my fault and he doesn’t feel bad, which why am I not surprised he always says stuff like that. I already have bad anxiety and depression and his words don’t make it any better. I feel like a loser, stuck."
955,How do I get mental health help?,"Hi guys. This post is going to be a bit odd probably for most of you but I'm genuinely seeking some answers. It's really difficult for me to get any sort of psychiatric help because I have two parents that are scientologists and absolutely refuse to let me see a psychoanalyst. They'd rather have me go to a church organization called CCHR and basically just dose me with a bunch of vitamins claiming that my anxiety/ depression is caused my vitamin deficiencies. I was very involved with the CoS and it did distract me from my feelings however I have no longer been participating in any church activites and dont know if my depression and anxiety is worse because I'm no longer participating in church activities or if I should really seek help. Which brings me to a question as to how I should go about doing that.. I'm watched practically 24/7 by my parents and it would be extremely difficult for me to just make an appointment with a therapist and or psychiatrist. I was able to do that when I was living with my aunt and uncle and got prescribed cymbalta and propranolol which really helped me out. However when I bring any mental health up with my parents they completely refuse to believe anything is wrong with me. They just like to make claims that ""i was born perfect and would never have anything like that affect me"" or that ""its just simply impossible because nothing is wrong with me and I have everything I need and more"". I was diagnosed awhile back with depression and anxiety. I just dont think they understand that my depression and anxiety is caused my something going on in my brain. I try to tell myself that I can push past negative thoughts and I do utilize a LOT of tech i learned at the church and can definitely confront a lot but I'm still bothered by negative and intrusive thoughts and feelings.  Not to mention the feeling like I'm just always being judged. It truly sucks. I cant really talk about any of this with friends because they all think scientology is completely bizarre and I feel would put the blame on me. I'm sorry if a lot of this is unnecessary.. I just am hitting a point of understanding that I will never get real medical attention to this matter with my parents or family members. How can I go about resolving this? Any help would really be appreciated and I understand that many of you will have negative comments towards the CoS which is completely fine, everybody is entitled to their own beliefs. I was just raised this way and have two parents, an entire family and circle of friends who are all directly associated with the church. I have no ""real"" friends.."

I wasn’t able to schedule a new appointment at my last visit, because I work in healthcare and my schedule wasn’t set in stone at the time. When I called to make an appointment 10 days ago, they didn’t answer and I left a voicemail. 5 days ago, I called again, and after being on hold for 10 minutes it sends me to voicemail, but the voicemail box is full. I’ve called everyday since, and same thing. I can’t physically visit the office either, because of the pandemic. 

I only have a week left of meds. I’ve called around to other practices and, considering everything going on right now, I can’t get a new patient appointment sooner than 5 or 6 weeks anywhere. I’ve been on the same medication and same dosage for the past four years. I’ve missed two doses in that time, and I’ve never, ever had to quit for any length of time. I take Seroquel 300.

Hey folks,

For the last few months I've noticed that I've been very unproductive whilst working from home and occasionally in the office too. I lack any motivation or drive at work, despite being very aware that I need the financial outcomes to achieve some of my goals... I spend most of the day procrastinating and find it very difficult to motivate myself to do any actual work.

I'm fairly senior at a software startup and before this I worked at a large tech company with what most people would think is an awesome job and a great setup, but I had the same procrastinating issue... It drove me to leave the company and I thought getting involved with a startup might reinvigorate me but it hasn't, perhaps it did for a few weeks but I'm slipping back into being very unproductive. I think lockdown makes it a little worse but that's just because I'm on my own so it's easier to slack off.

The strange thing is that as soon at 5PM hits, or as soon as the weekend comes around, I'm happy as larry - I'm working on woodworking projects, love spending time with my fiancé in lockdown, lots of awesome TV to watch, chatting with friends and family. Otherwise I'd slap a depression diagnosis on this super easily.

Is this a case of me just totally falling out of love with my career or something deeper and potentially more sinister? I really want to get ahead of this problem, make a positive change in my life and move on from it."
965,Guys I haven't been able to bring myself to eat for a few days,I cant find the strength to feed myself. I'm losing faith in good
966,Sometimes I just want to vent about my mental issues without being comforted? Just me?,"I’m 32 years old and have some deep-seeded mental illness issues that I’m just now trying to understand. The last fourteen years have been particularly hard (has gotten harder with every day that has passed in that time basically), but I’m still functioning, and I’m still here, and most importantly, I’m finally pretty open about it all with myself and my loved ones. 

Said loved ones (my family and friends) are the most amazing, supportive people I could have asked for... which I guess is what makes me feel extra awful for not alway appreciating their comfort.

Essentially, some days when I am in that very dark place, I will share how I’m feeling (useless, worthless, angry, distressingly empty, whatever the issue may be that day) just because I need to say it out loud. I DON’T want comfort. I don’t want to hear I’m not useless or that I have a purpose on Earth. Because in that moment it feels patronizing and no matter how earnest the sentiment is, I don’t believe it. It has never once made me feel better to hear words of encouragement when I’m at my lowest, and that makes me feel like a real asshole.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has these moments and how you reconcile those feelings within yourself? Mostly because once I’m feeling better, I circle back to feeling like garbage when I think about how little appreciation I had for those who care about me. It’s a vicious cycle. I hate it."
967,I don't want to turn 19,"Problem is I am turning 19 in 2 weeks, haven't properly eaten (and not purged afterwards) in quite some time now in the hope I die from complecations or shit like that if I keep it up for long enough. I already almost faint Everytime when standing up and it is scary af.

 I now can't look at food normal, myself harm has worsened and the 1 person I used to open up to has her own shit to worry about and I don't feel comfortable anymore opening up to here because she once told my parents that she was worried. And now the only place where I am honest with my feelings is fucking Reddit lmao

Just wanted to put this out here 

Love to all of you &lt;3"
968,WHY AM I LIKE THIS,"Whenever I think of summer (going to the beach, warm sunny days, etc) I get depressed. WHY? I literally just thought about the beach and I started shaking and my face felt feverish. Why am I like this? I've never had a traumatic experience at the beach?? this stuff normally makes me happy?? This all started when I had what felt like a week long anxious and depressive episode while and when I got back from vacation and ever since then I haven't felt true happiness or enjoyment about anything. I havent even listened to music cause it makes me depressed and nauseous no matter what it is. What am I doing wrong?? why??"
969,"It's a bit hard right now, could someone please tell me some general good reasons to live? Thank you.","Been crying for half an hour now about the state of my life, a lot harder to not think suicidally than usual. I still don't think I would ever do it, but I really wish I could."
970,I need help,"
My friend is wanting to commit suicide I don’t live near them and they want help the have tried the hospital / doctors and hotlines but all have turned them away. I am scared for them and I don’t know what to do."
971,I'm lost,"Sometimes I get scared of opening up, afraid that once I do those people will leave or after awhile they'll tell me I'm too overwhelming. I can currently feel my everything just breaking. I have a non-stop feeling of dread and panic. I'm scared that something will trigger a bad memory. I feel like I can't handle it much anymore but I'm not suicidal. I just don't know what to do."
972,Dealing with Impostor Syndrome Stemming from Guilt,"I am a college senior right now and soon to be college graduate from a rather prestigious university. Throughout my entire university career I have dealt with guilt about previous actions that has, at times, distracted me from being able to live life to the fullest and do good things for myself. I've felt this kind of guilt before on many occasions, and therapy has helped a lot with it. All of a sudden, maybe because of how the world is nowadays (or possibly because I'm graduating) these feelings are all starting to flood back, and I don't know what to do!

Right now, I am thinking back to multiple times in high school when a friend pressured me to tell him information about a quiz that he was about to take (which I had taken earlier that day). I tried to avoid answering the questions, but I'm pretty sure there was at least one time (possibly more) when I couldn't take it and just told my friend the info. Now all of a sudden I feel like I've cheated by giving him an unfair advantage on that test (The way I see it, I basically assisted in cheating.), so as a result I feel super guilty and kind of unable to function. My struggle comes from the possibility that were I to get caught, I **might** be punished in such a way that would ruin my academic standing, which would lead to me not getting to where I am today academically (i.e. being able to attend my current university).

If you feel like I should confess to my wrongdoings and that I really don't deserve the diploma I am on track to get from there, feel free to express those feelings here. I appreciate honest responses. No matter what, I'm sure I'll find a way to a good, happy life."
973,I can't get myself to be a productive or properly functioning person bc always in my head,"I'm always in my head thinking about anything to the point i dont get things done or am too slow. I am thinking about past mistakes, evaluating decisions, thinking about how to solve my problems, how to prevent future mistakes, or just plain daydreaming. but it happens so much i will just lose so much time randomly and I'm late to everything and miss things and am not as productive as i should be."
974,How do I stop obsessive thoughts?,"I quit smoking weed and cigarettes last summer, I was clearly self-medicating because after a few months I started to get stuck in obsessive thoughts. 

First one: Woah maybe I gave myself lung cancer!? Googling, googling, googling. It just kept repeating and repeating. Couldn't believe I ever smoked so was beating myself up and made myself extremely depressed.

Second one: Why did I stress so much about getting cancer!? Worrying for weeks that chronic stress can cause cancer and feeling stupid.

Third one: One day I was so miserable that I felt suicidal. I irrationally contacted my ex, I guess because I wanted to have a mature conversation (she's 8 years older). Thought we were cool, but we weren't. She would say something hurtful that isn't true and then block me. I made a new account to argue with that and explain why I'm acting so depressed only to get hit harder with meanest message I've ever read and blocked forever. After that I became so obsessive about that message.. Like it just kept repeating over and over again. I kept thinking constantly of what I wanted to reply. Would send it in instagram DM when I wanted to get it out of my system and instantly delete it again. It would give some relief for like a day, but then it would start to creep up again until I wrote everything down again, only to delete it again. Wasting hours on that shit.. Wtf. It just kept repeating for WEEKS. Pure torture. 

Fourth one: After that I was obviously like 'bruh...' why did you contact your ex? She's over you. You're the one who broke up with her.. Just leave her alone you idiot. I then felt embarrassed and how I'm a freak for doing that. Kept repeating for weeks too.

All these things eventually stopped after I became sooooo extremely bored of it, but it takes like weeks before that happens. That's why I NEVER want to have this happen again. It's ruining so much precious time. I never want to get stuck in a loop again. Lockdown obviously has to do with this. I'm working from home so I have less distractions.. But it keeps repeating even during excercise, eating, when I'm with my girlfriend, watching a movie, while I'm working.. Only when I have to be 100% focused I'll forget about everything for a brief moment."
975,Am I stupid for letting silly things bother me?,"I let the smallest things bother me and it’s now impacting my everyday life because it’s literally all I think about. I constantly look into tiny little things like why someone never “liked” my comment or when someone says something mean about someone and then the next minute they literally have their head up the persons ass. Why does things like this bother me? Am I the only one? Its driving me crazy because I know it’s stupid and petty to even care, but I don’t know why I care so bloody damn much."
976,What the fuck is wrong with me,"Ok so I’m ready to get laughed at, but fuck it I’m on the internet. 

Alright, so basically for like a year now I’ve had this reoccurring thought that I’m like a.. superhero? Or a god, or some supernatural being. It’s so stupid typing it out but it’s the truth. For the past year I’ve somewhat believed this, not completely but I’ve used it as something to fall back on. Like if something bad happened I’d think “Oh this is alright, because in reality I’m a supernatural god waiting to breakthrough.” 

I’ll usually come to my senses but it’s almost like my mind wants me to believe I’m some type of entity when I’m not, like as I’m typing this my head is like “No you are.” It’s stupid, it really is stupid lmao"
977,What is happening? What do I do now?,"I just had a breakdown out of nowhere, I'm on SSRI's and I've been feeling good for almost 5 months or so. But out of nowhere I just had this feeling of anxiety, panic and paranoia all at once that caused a manic breakdown. What is wrong with me? I thought I was getting better."
978,Do I need to be tested?,"Hi, I have been progressively developing symptoms and ticks that I can not control and are starting to hurt me physically. it started with being forgetful then complete memory loss of something that I did or said but it's gotten more frequent to where I have triple check myself before moving or write down where I put things that I deem important. my muscle spasms are very frequent now and I have started either saying "" F yea"" ""yes"" while looking up or just ""F\*\*\*\*"" repeatedly in rapid succession usually throwing my head back which starts to hurt. I also space out or disassociate if that is the correct term. these ticks usually happen if I hear a certain tune or say a certain word. it also happens if I talk and mess up on what I am saying or typing. My hand does this weird thing when I start focusing on something my thumb would rub against my pointer finger. I mostly hide my symptoms by either coming out when no one is around or strain against the spasms which also hurts. I just need to know if it's worth being tested over or not because I have no insurance and would like to start saving money now rather than later."
979,Why am I so insecure?,"Hi I am in a 3 1/2 year relationship with a wonderful person and my best friend. Even though I trust this person I’m still terribly insecure about porn, Instagram models, you name it. Background I’m a child of someone with BPD and narcissistic personality disorder and that’s caused a lot of damage. I was always compared to everyone my mom thought was cute growing up, my mom started measuring my body at 5 or 6 and telling me what measurement men want. This has caused me to assume this is all men want deep down. Once an insecure thought happens I get insecure that I’m insecure and it spirals into self hatred. Has anyone else dealt with this?"
980,"Despite being on meds for my mental health issues, because of the virus they aren't as effective.",I've lost interest in video games and reading.   I'm depressed but for a few shining moments. Last time I talked to my psychiatrist she says she can't treat me because I'm in a different state because of the virus. I'm unsure how to proceed.
981,Is this normal?,"I'm always scared to fall asleep because I'm afraid I'll hurt somebody while sleeping. Like, I hide knives and pointy objects and sometimes I even lock myself in the bathroom so I can't sleep walk and kill somebody. I'm so afraid of losing control that before I go to sleep next to my girlfriend I have to recite a whole speech in my head, convincing myself that I won't do anything bad while I'm sleeping because otherwise I can't close my eyes. I stay up till late because of this, and it's my only thought past 8 pm. Every morning I wake up feeling so relieved. I told my mother and she says it's nothing to worry about but I feel like nobody else feels like this. Am I exaggerating in thinking I need help?"
982,what kind of anxiety is this,"hello! so i have realize that i am so bad on making big decisions. especially when i am put on the spot. it really gives me a lot of pressure, and i just can’t say anything. when anyone ask me what’s wrong, what’s the problem, or what’s your decision, i just kept quiet. i couldn’t talk.
but inside me, i was dying to tell anyone. i was so scared that the decision i made will hurt feelings, or what if people see me as annoying?

i just want to know what’s going on with myself"
983,Are there any online psychiatrists who accept multiple insurances?,I’m searching for an online psychiatrist that I can see ASAP. The difficult part is that I have two insurances and I can’t afford to only use one. Are there any online psychiatrists who accept multiple insurances? I’m in Illinois if that matters.
984,How do I stop feeling like garbage in quarantine?,"I'm quarantining/social isolating with my family. They're fine usually, but having to be around them 24/7 is really bad for me. My relationship with my mom isn't the best, and my relationship with my brother is fragile. I resent my mom for...a lot of things...and she isn't good with communication at all, so I feel really powerless to make things better. My relationships with my sister and dad are pretty good. Overall, being stuck in one place with the same 4 people has been really bad for me. Lately, I've just been so annoyed with my family, and I just don't want to do anything except cry for no reason. Any advice on how to deal with this would be amazing."
985,How do I healthily express my hatred for my parents?,"I was raised in an abusive home with an alcoholic father who was mostly emotionally neglectful yet also incredibly strict.
My mother used to hit me for anything I did - such as forgetting to turn the lights in my room off.

I was always a really good kid, good grades, and quite musically talented, but they controlled me so much and put so much pressure on me to be perfect. I wasn’t allowed to have my hair the way I wanted it, or dress how I wanted - and I was hit with a broomstick for wanting to look differently than normal teenagers.

Now I’m 28, and despite having a bachelor’s degree and being very intelligent, I am not emotionally able to keep jobs. I’ve never had a sexual/romantic relationship. I have difficulty making friends and I’m generally speaking a pushover, and I have no one in the world I feel I can trust.

I really hate my parents and I feel anxiety when I’m near them. I have always hidden this. They always thought I was a good son because I did everything they said, but lately, the anger they have caused me is coming out. I can’t help but speak shortly and rudely to them. I had a dream a few months ago that I killed my dad, and quite frankly, I enjoyed it. When I woke up, however, I felt guilty.

I have been dying for years to tell them how much I hate them; I really want them to feel all the pain they made me feel, but at the same time, I care for them and don’t want to hurt their feelings.

What is the best way to express these emotions that are eating me up?"
986,I need some help,What is happening
987,Ready to give up,"Almost every day I wanna swallow every pill I have. Which I hord most of my prescriptions so I have literally easily over 1000 pills. I take clonidine, gabapentin, suboxone, and modafinil. I also microdose lsd to treat my depression which was a serious game changer but with everything going to hell I just dont see the point no matter how medicated I am. I've been in 8 psychiatric units and grew up in doctors offices for mental health. Main ones are agoraphobia, bipolar type 1, depression and anxiety. Several suicide attempts. One was successful. Was dead for about 3 minutes. No pulse and no breathing. Intentional overdose. Was brought back and I was never one for religion but there had to someone watching over me that day because there was no way I should have came back. I hit the ground outside and the neighbors dog wouldn't stop barking until someone came and found me and an off duty EMT found me and kept my heart going till the ambulance showed up and revived me. Those minutes I was gone. Was like taking a nap and waking up. Just blipped out of existence. I feel like I'd be okay with just not existing anymore. I've accomplished nothing with my life. I cant tell this to any doctors or family or friends or I'll be thrown back into a psych unit and I'd rather be dead then go back to one of those places. I feel like I can't hold on much longer. I'm sorry if this is depressing to read for some people."
988,A horrifying trend that was mocking those with disabilities such as Autism. I am a 24/m with a Mild form of ASD.,"The trend was rather sickening. 

Imagine making fun of Autistic People as a mature Adult. 

Millions and millions of people have mental disabilities. 

They may not realize they're own children or neice/nephews or grandchildren may have it someday they should know. 

This behaviour makes them look fucking 12 years old. 

I'm a 24/m, with mild Autism and I wonder what they would feel if they had a child one day with a severe form of it. 

People can be sickening. 

Fortunately, TikTok took action and removed the hashtag."
989,what is wrong with me,"i have severe depression, anxiety and ocd. also maybe mild misophonia. i haven’t been tested or diagnosed with any of these, but i have almost all of the symptoms and have done a lot of research. 

i am also suicidal and sometimes i dont see the point of life. i have nothing to live for. 

i think i need professional help. but my parents made me go to a therapist twice this year and i HATE it. my parents complain about me and i just sit there, unable to say or do anything.

i dont know what to do."
990,Here's my story and how I ended up here,"Hello, I've been dealing with some psychological issues recently and I've been going to therapy, currently taking medication (an antidepressant named paroxetine pescribed by my family's doctor \[I'm unsure how this is said in foreign countries, I'm from the Iberian Peninsula, this is basically the doctor that's assigned to the family\]) and I've been getting better in regards to my intrusive thoughts.

I want to share with you all my story, no filters whatsoever from the top, please respect my choice to remain ""anonymous"" as I'm sure that some actions I had were quite shitty, some of them I've come to terms with some others I haven't.

I'm 23 right now, about to turn 24 in a few weeks and recently left behind a toxic circle of ""friends"" who I smoked marijuana with, having ""quit"" marijuana and cigarettes cold turkey I started noticing some really good benefits of doing so (I'm able to breathe better, experience new smells, experience new tastes, just overall regained my senses) and it's all great, but here starts the trouble:

I've began to question everything that I liked and stood for... let's rewind back to my childhood so you can understand some other things I'll be mentioning further down:

I was born in 1996 and my father was an alcoholic, abusive of my mother (both psychologically and physically) and on top of that he cheated on her constantly, both with prostitutes and side chicks... During this childhood of mine my parents got divorced in the year 2000 and at the time this didn't affect me as I was only 4 years old and really had no idea what was going on, I just kept living my life, not realizing what was going on at all, just knowing that my family wasn't like the ""normal"" ones... My mother endured all this, even after divorcing my father she'd keep seeing him and having him here at our house, even though she knew he was cheating on her and drinking a lot... Now, let me just get things straight here: I didn't meet my paternal grandfather, however, my father didn't turn out like he did ""just because""... from what I heard he suffered a lot too and that shaped him into this ""man"" I describe.

During these hard times, I had a few close friends, one of them was my cousin who I would play with all the time as he was my next door neighbor, my mother and his mother had some sort of falling out in the past so I never spoke to her much, neither did she to me, but me and my cousin were really close. Going forward, my cousin moved out around 2001/2002 and we kept in touch cause we were both attending the same school. Going forward a bit, when I was about 9 years old I discovered internet pornography and started masturbating, at this time I didn't have a computer at home so I'd grab my MP4, download videos onto it and masturbate at home. A year after this, I was given a computer paid by my mother and started inviting my friends over to play video games on their PC (LAN Party style), in that circle of friends my cousin was present and we all were extremely curious to see porn (boys will be boys right?) and so we all started masturbating to porn together, some of us touched each others penises to see how they felt but never anything more than that, I touched no one's penises but mine and my cousin's. My friends left and me and my cousin were left alone and we took things to the next level of curiosity: experimenting ""sex"", we didn't actually consider it to be sex, in fact we had a nickname for the act (as I write this I find it extremely f\*cked up of me being the person I am right now to even consider doing this back then)... this act was repeated a few times until we realized what we were doing, stopped doing it, never talking about it anymore nor discussing it any further, before going any further let me just clear up that there was no penetration involved however he did suck me (which I can't remember if I enjoyed) however I didn't suck him off as that disgusted me. Let's say I was 10 or 11 when we started doing this and about 12 or 13 when we stopped doing it never to be talked again, I never considered this to be harmful to my sexuality/identity because I always liked girls and never was physically attracted to men, however my curiosity and lack of confidence in my physical appearance made it extremely difficult for me to talk or reach out to girls, even though I'd feel attracted to a girl I'd never make a move due to an intense fear of rejection which I eventually got over.

Over the next years until I turned 16 I met a few girls and had my first actual kiss from a girl which I enjoyed a lot, I dated this girl for about a month when I was 14 (a summer hookup basically, however I am a romantic and didn't realize this at the time), when we broke up I felt heartbroken but eventually got over it. Let's keep this in mind: I started watching porn when I was 9 and throughout this whole part of my life I kept watching and masturbating to porn over and over again, sometimes doing it almost 10x in a day.

Fast forward to my 16 years of age and I meet a girl, my first actual love... She took my virginity and at that time I had some extremely big complexes about having my first time with someone who was not a virgin... however I still liked this girl a lot and we stayed together for 2 years and a half... My first time was quite troublesome, I was extremely anxious and not feeling the moment at all, mostly thinking about other things that I had seen in porn and this moment wasn't living up to what I was used to consume in porn and I was freaking out at the fact that I wasn't getting an erection (I started thinking of all the possible things in the world, one of them was questioning my sexuality there and then due to my past ""homosexual"" experiences with my cousin).

This girl was very thoughtful and understood my difficulties: I tried to please her orally as I couldn't do anything else (there and then I realized that I love eating girls out) we tried over and over again until I managed to get an erection and achieve penetration, and this was heaven to me, this moment was extremely intimate and pleasurable for me but I came very fast: whatever, this was great and I enjoyed it and felt happy that I could finally achieve an erection. I managed to find that weed actually helped with my performance ""anxiety"" and she also smoked it too, we had sex high a lot of times and that was probably the best I've had so far, however I may have just experienced what regular people do when they're just enjoying the moment. 2 absolutely wonderful years pass and I start going to university, started drinking and going out with my colleagues, and after a few nights out I meet this girl who I felt intensely sexually attracted to... she reciprocated and one night I was coming back to the student dorms (where she lived too) and we stayed awake for a bit through the night talking and kisses started happening (no sex or anything else happened)... the day after I felt like shit and I couldn't stand myself, I had to confess to my girlfriend what I had done and we broke up... I obviously felt like shit and started comparing myself to my father and what he had done to my mother, making me feel even worse about what I had done. Two weeks later me and her get back together after numerous apologies from my side, she was actually the one to ask me back, which I accepted and we stayed together for another 6 months, these 6 months I did everything I could possibly do to reassure her of my love for her (My shitty drunken mistake was nothing more than that, a mistake on the heat of the moment which I deeply regretted and don't blame on anything or anyone else other than me)... yet after these 6 months she cheated on me, at first I thought it was just her kissing another guy but no she actually had sex with another guy... This broke me and talking about it today still stirs something up inside of me, a feeling of disgust that I felt then and still feel (although much much less) nowadays when remembering that.

After breaking up with this girl I completely lost my life: Started drinking day after day, smoking weed, lost my scholarship and eventually had to take on a job to save up some money to go back to college as my mother couldn't afford to put me through college. I started working at a call centre, an Apple call center here providing support for the UK and Ireland (and also a bit more countries around the world). During this period I met a girl that I tried to flirt with but didn't get far, we eventually became good friends and that was it, I stayed at the call center for 2 and a half years (2 of them working onsite, 6 months working from home), this was quite possibly the worst and best part of my life, why? Because looking back at it I recognize some things I'd do sober, however most of the things I did (abusing marijuana) was something I stood against, I would understand if someone smoked it every once in a while but would not understand if you smoked it everyday like cigarettes...

As I worked at that call center, a high level of empathy was required from me, a lot of soft skills had to be developed, hard skills were fine as I was quite a geek for all my life and my knowledge of operating systems was quite vast, however as you all probably know this is a high stress environment and 4 months in I started noticing it, consulting my doctor to get some medical downtime to rest my head as advised by a friend. This short break was quite useful and managed to get me back on track... for another 6 months until I relapsed back on that mindset of burnout, I kept this cycle going for another year and a half because I didn't save any money, I spent it all on marijuana, tobacco alcohol and food with that toxic circle of friends while living at my mom's house... this was my way of dealing with things as I never ever ever spoke to anyone about my sex issues, my abuse issues or any other things I was embarrassed of talking about. I was always a super closed person and never trusted anyone with any of my thoughts or personal issues. I'll give you an example: When developing in puberty I got these puffy nipples (around the age of 14) that I talked to my doctor about and she told me that they'd go away within a few years... well they never did and until quite recently I was super self conscious of them, thinking people would judge me over them, my overall hairy body and the size of my penis (which recently measured is 15cm long) so I know it's within the european average).

I stopped working at the call center and got a different job at an IT company and when I started working there I felt so many differences in the way I was treated, in the amount of trust deposited in me and everything that I never had thus far, let me give you an example:

When I used to work at the call center, I had exactly 10 minutes (counted down to the second as we had to change our AUX state when we went to the bathroom), 15 minutes in the morning and afternoon (15/15, both clocked down to the second and if you went over just one millisecond, you would not qualify to win the assiduity prize... even if it was the system's fault because sometimes it would take 15-20 seconds to change an aux state), comparing this to working at this ""new job"" I felt like a lord: I could take the time I actually needed at the bathroom, I could take breaks as often as I saw suited and I had free fruit and coffee in the lounge... this was heaven, however I didn't deal with it so well: I was used to being treated like crap and suddenly being treated like a human felt alien to me... I literally cried because I was confused about what my life had been for the years that passed and how crap of a situation I had put myself through. 2 months pass and I quit the job to pursue my goal: getting my degree in CSE, the company's boss was extremely understanding of this, paid me everything in full and I didn't have to work the mandatory (by law) days, I could just leave and the very next day start attending class once again as if nothing had ever happened, it was a truly magical moment and I was extremely grateful for this company, it's boss and all the great people I met there who made me feel human again.

It's not over yet... The second semester goes by and as I actually resumed my studies halfway through the 2nd semester I failed 2 classes, however this could've been because I kept on smoking weed throughout this period (however just not as much nor as regularly as I had been doing until getting this new job) or maybe not, who knows... Fast forward to September 2019, the month I decided to completely cease smoking weed and tobacco, removed the toxic people from my life and decided to make the best of it. On October I went on Tinder to try and meet new people and eventually found a girl I dated for a few months, we went on a few dates and later we got to her place (around January 2020), she had some issues herself with sex (her vaginal muscles would contract rather than dilate/relax when experiencing pleasure) and I didn't manage to have sex with her due to the same issues/thoughts I had with my first girlfriend, only this time the intrusive thoughts (in my head disgusting sexual images would play, I would constantly question my sexual orientation, performing these rituals of checking whether if I found guys that I would pass by on the street attractive, checking gay porn to see if I felt aroused, researching on the issue, etc...) I found out about OCD and NoFap) I tried the nofap challenge but couldn't do it, I could get hard to porn but not to real girls, which made me more and more frustrated. A couple of weeks pass, consumed by my thoughts crying a lot and just with no will to live, I head to my family doctor and tell her what's going on with me, she prescribes me paroxetine which I refused to take for a few weeks as I tried going to therapy (which helped for a bit but was extremely expensive and I couldn't afford it as often as needed for me to be well)... It was now exam season, stress was building up and I couldn't take my mind off of that, the only thing that kept me away from those thoughts was studying maths for hours on end, in one week I had 3 exams, everything was fine until I took the 2nd exam, after leaving that classroom I headed home and the thoughts consumed me, totally consumed me and as I was driving I only thought of shit over and over again, unwanted things in my head making me question every little action I would take, I felt tortured by my mind, completely unable to control it. I arrive home, go to bed and try to sleep it off: I couldn't, I just couldn't: My doctor prescribed lorazepam to me as well but I had not taken it until then, the relief after taking the pill was almost immediate, I started feeling sleepy and more relaxed, the thoughts were there, but I was able to push them back and not be bothered by them anymore.

It was at this moment that I realized I needed help and I looked for it in the cheapest way possible, I also talked about some of these things with a close relative of mine and they offered to help me in every possible way just so I could get better, I was still sort of hopeless at this moment not feeling human, I felt emotionless, completely stoic and that f\*cked with me, so I started taking the paroxetine everyday and I scheduled an appointment with the schools psychologist to have therapy weekly (my school offers therapy for free, something I only found out recently), she is fully aware of all of this that I confessed above and I feel like it's helping, the intrusive thoughts didn't magically go away.

At first the paroxetine took some time to get used to, it made me feel extremely sleepy and stomach sick, however after a couple months I got used to it and I can safely say that it helps, however I want to get rid of it as soon as I feel ""comfortable"" enough with myself, what I mean by this is: I am beginning to feel human again, having feelings and dealing with them and it's great! I feel more ""me"" again, but I'm also sure that if I let go of the medication too soon I might just go back to square one.

Getting down to the bottom of this: I've never been properly diagnosed with it, however I think I might have OCD, I tick all the boxes for it (there some things I didn't mention here as they would probably crash reddit or something lol) and thinking back on things from my teen years I identify a lot of things that I would do repeatedly because I would fear that not doing that would have some sort of bad consequence. I may consult a psychiatrist to get a proper diagnostic, I don't mean to need a ""label"" however I would like to know how I can get over this so I can live a proper life.

Anyway, this is all for now, it feels good to get it out into words... if you've read this far, thank you for your patience! I hope to help some people who (like me) have been keeping their demons inside for far too long: talk to someone! everyone has problems, I have mine and am still dealing with them.

If you have any questions go ahead, I'll be happy to answer them."
991,My best friend is in a depressive state again and I don't know what to do.,My (f13) best friend (m13) and I (not the same one from the previous posts) have been friends for over a year now.  Last time he felt like this we stopped being friends for 3 months because he had a panic attack and went off on me. I know he's been down recently and has been having constant anxiety and panic attacks. I'm trying my best to be there for him but I dont know how to help him. I'm crying while typing this out and I'm hyperventilating. he texted me saying he doesn't want to live anymore and I was trying to talk him out of it by saying his family would be heart broken and I would follow after him. i kept on trying. He said he was expendable and I said I couldn't just get rid of him and he said I won't have to cause he'll do it himself and I replied saying please no I can't live without you and he read it but didn't respond. I don't know what to do because he's probably either asleep or dead by now and can't even type that without crying harder please help me.
992,No contact with Abusive mom,"I went no contact with my mom who has BPD and NPD about 10 months ago. She was sometimes physically abusive but the emotional abuse was far worse. I’ve been the happiest in my entire life since I’ve gone no contact but today is her birthday. I’m so filled with guilt. I didn’t say anything for Mother’s Day either. This could be the codependency she drilled into my brain but I just really feel bad that I could be causing her emotional pain. I still lived at home while my older sister went no contact so I saw all of the emotion around it. I just picture those outbursts, freak outs, and meltdowns but it’s about me and I feel so terrible. At the same time i know she’s toxic and I want to protect myself. Has anyone dealt with this?"

How do I know I am really in love with someone or even care about them, why do I feel so numb and anxious without them?

When I ever I am around that person I think I love I am confident I do, but with out them I began to doubt and feel anxious, I really hope that it isnt that. I am so fucking scared it may be that. I am so comfortable around them and honest with them. I hate this, I feel like im am out of control and powerless of the things in my life. I am slowly just rotting away in my room for the this year I have been at least. Even before I met them I did feel anxious. Thank you for reading"
994,Lost my insurance - how do I get therapy?,"Hi! Title says it all. I’m in the tri-state area (northern nj) and my family lost our insurance plan this year. I’ve done some googling for online help but I’m super lost. 

Does anyone know anywhere I can turn to for low cost or free remote therapy/counseling?

Thanks so much!"
995,Help me,"I can't believe I have to write a post like this, but it needs to be said. 

I HATE WOMEN!!!!! THEY'RE SICK, TWISTED, EVIL CREATURES!!! THEY HAVE NO SENSE OF EMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO THEY DEEM CAN'T PROVIDE ANYTHING TO THEIR LIVES!!! IF IT'S NOT CONVENIENT FOR THEM, THEY DON'T CARE AND ARE NOT WILLING TO PUT ANY WORK TOWARDS IT!!!!! THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES!!! WHEN IT COMES TO RELATIONSHIPS, THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN TAKE FROM A RELATIONSHIP, NEVER WHAT THEY CAN GIVE!!! The only thing I've ever wanted was to be someone's first fucking choice, but no matter if I try to form relationships or not or whether I'm nice to people or the ""bad boy"" type women CLAIM THEY WANT, the result is always the same: I get put in LAST. FUCKING. PLACE!!!!! I'M TIRED OF IT!!!! Why the fuck does everyone else get to have meaningful relationships but I don't?! Why does everyone else get to be invited out to parties by their friends while I get ignored nearly every time I ask? Why does everyone seem to be hooking up but I can't even get a single person to agree to do that with me?! What the fuck!!!!! I'm just trying to live my fucking life with people who give a damn about me! I'm a good person! I've never done drugs, I've never committed a crime, I've never bullied anyone or done anything to anybody at least in recent memory to warrant being forcibly excluded from everything I try to become involved in. And to make things even worse, my parents don't believe any of this is happening, and when they are made aware of it they don't do nearly enough to stop it. They just tell me I'm in the wrong before they even know the full story and leave it at that. Once in a blue moon they'll sign me up for therapy, which I am already going to and honestly doesn't help that much. I feel like my only options at this point is to either move far away from here or just isolate myself even further. The latter is very tempting."
996,it feels like i can never forgive myself and can’t live with this pain,"
so basically i lost everything i had (gf,dog,home) because of a mistake i made and the situation gets worse since i got partly untruly indicted for something i can go to jail for
i have ok days where i just think about the future but even then i think about not finding a job or how i never find again a women like her because she was my first and true love and i ruined anything...
not to mention how i miss my dog and probably will never see him again for his sake too...
i actually just hoped that i would die by accident the last few weeks because i’m scared of death but also i’m scared for the future and especially for jail and even more the timer after that"
997,How do I get over someone joking about me wanting to kill myself?,"One day I was feeling really low, asked a friend if they wanted to hang out with me to get my mind off of things. their significant other got upset that they wanted to come hangout with me and told them ""well what are they going to do kill themselves in just a few hours?"" I can't get over this comment, more of the fact that my friend acted like what was said was okay .."
998,I don’t have anywhere else to talk about this,"I’ve been really struggling lately in my new relationship and trying to get my life on the move as a young adult. I’ve been struggling with feelings of uselessness, unproductive ness, and just frustration in general. I’ve been having obsessive thoughts about my significant other cheating on me, projecting my unhappiness into then without really meaning to. It’s not that I don’t want to be with him, more like I’m struggling with trust, and obsessing over my own insecurities from past traumas. I’m not sure where to start with dealing this... I don’t want to ruin my relationship on account of my own issues I’m having trouble dealing with, but I’m tired of talking to my significant other about these issues and I’m tired of talking to my friends, I feel they are sometimes too close to my relationship and significant other. I feel
I can’t express my unhappiness without being invalidated by friends and family. Some days I want to pack a book bag and leave everyone and never come back. I’m filled with feelings of anxiety from the moment I wake up. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with my circumstances and I don’t know how to create positive change. I’m lost."
999,I feel like asking for help is wrong,"So I've been seeing a therapist for a while, and I have a couple good friends I talk to. That's my entire support group. It's better to say I don't have a family. And I have c-ptsd. 

Talking to my friends helps me a lot, but I feel like I'm in the way, or that I'm specifically being too needy if I want to vent. Even if we were going to talk about something that isn't me related I feel like I'm overstepping almost. 

My therapist said that I probably am a burden because talking about mental health brings people down and that's ""unattractive."" So I should respond with giving my friends some space. 

I'm not entirely sure why I typed this out. I guess I'm lonely and miss my friends and miss the idea of them being there for me. This pandemic turned my life upsidedown. Does anyone have advice on feeling like a burden to people?"
1000,Splurges?,You know how they say splurge days are okay and maybe even beneficial for dieting? Or rest days when you're working out? A day to take a break from all of your hard efforts? Do you think that's okay with your negative thoughts? Sometimes I'm tired of coping and tired of trying to convince myself to think more positively and I just want to indulge in my negativity and had coping mechanisms. Just get it out of my system for a night
1001,(Venting?) It feels like my feelings of anxiety are my fault,"This past year has been quite different, where so many things have been making me more nervous than they used to. I think I experience feelings of anxiety, I find it hard to breathe and break out in full body sweats and get consumed in overthinking especially when I have to deal with networking and anything that has to do with the job hunt. But most of it stems from my lack of confidence in my field of study and just as a person. I don't have as much experience in my field because I started later than I should've after landing on something I think I wanna do, and I have always been kind of awkward, and was teased a lot by my friends (the sort of thing that was both them being kinda bad friends and a little racist and me being a bit too sensitive) making me question everything that I do and how it's perceived. I know there are so many things I can do to boost my confidence, like teach myself things in quarantine to make myself a better candidate or take classes, work on my portfolio and resume, and work on new projects, or just work out and take care of myself so I feel better about myself. But I can never get myself to do it, and when I start, I feel myself getting nervous that I'll fail or do something stupid that someone at my level should be able to do and then I stop and nothing gets done. But it's just ME that's stopping myself which keeps continuing this cycle and I acknowledge it so what is wrong with me why can't I solve my problems when the solutions are right in front of me?"
1002,Screams in my head,"For the past couple days, mainly in the later hours of the day, I’ve heard screaming in my own head, they aren’t screams to scare, or surprise, but screams of pain, suffering, and torment. It terrifies me to the point where I struggle to sleep. I’m confused as to what this means, and what it could be caused by. The closest thing I could find to what they sound like is this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KYxYOo2RnA at around 3:21, but it’s way more intense and a little more sad, sometimes I hear weeping in between the screams. I don’t know what this is, or how it started, some nights I go to bed crying because I’m so scared, I want this to stop, please help. Thank you."

1004,Don’t know what to do,"Hi guys I’m extremely bothered because after counting the total up today, ive been with over 60 women and I’m only 22. I’m extremely regretful of this and it’s weighing on me more and more every day. I feel like I’m not normal and somethings wrong with me, I’m not really ashamed of my sexuality - but i feel like I’ve ruined any chance i have of a serious relationship bc my partner would find out ive been w a lot of people. I definitely care about sex way too much, and i waste too much time on it. I’m a smart guy (or so i thought) with a lot going for me but this is the huge hidden darkness in my life. There’s no way to take what I’ve done back and i have no idea how to feel better about this. It might not seem like it but I do value a serious relationship."
1005,Everything making me angry (27M),"For some reason everything is making me angry. I am in a relationship with my girlfriend who is 28. Everything she does gets me annoyed and irritated. She constantly asks me questions all day long and demands that I give her an answer to something almost immediately. She looks at things on her phone, laughs at them loudly, and then proceeds to read them out loud or shove her phone in my face to read it. I am constantly guilted into going to ALL of her family gatherings and she almost never goes to mine. Her dad and his girlfriend make fun of me and take jabs at everything I say and how stupid it is. Her uncle is a millionaire lawyer who constantly is self-centered and talks about how he goes on these awesome trips and how awesome he and his wife are. He talked about how they went to Australia for their honeymoon and took another week in Hawaii again to decompress from the time change. He makes rude remarks to me and barely acknowledges that I even exist. He angers me greatly. I get annoyed with people for no reason. I am annoyed because I am forced and guilted to go to things I don’t want to go to by my girlfriend. I literally get angry and can’t hide how I feel. I am stressed out and constantly worry about work and things I have said to people. What is wrong with me?"
1006,What have you found helpful to get over self hatred?,I am having issues with hating myself. It almost pleases me when I’m having worse than usual moments of self hatred to self harm. I really hit myself. I feel even worse after I calm down at times. Is there anything you suggest?
1007,It gets better.,"(Doing this on my phone, so please forgive any shitty formatting errors)

It started when I was a child, the youngest I can remember first struggling with my mental health was when I was around 6. I had an amazing childhood, good friends, amazing family, an overall great life. There shouldn't have been anything wrong - but there was. Everyday, I struggled with incredibly violent, disgusting, and vile intrusive thoughts. It wasn't just thoughts that randomly popped in my head, they were constantly there, they kept me up at night and made my stomach churn in ways I will never be able to forget. I don't want to talk too much about what these thoughts were, but they absolutely DESTROYED me. I had thoughts of bringing harm to people I loved, pushing people infront of trains, and just doing outright violent things. It was something that never went away. Sure i had periods of time that were ""good"" but it always came back if there was even the smallest trigger, like a bad day or a small argument. 

It got so bad that everyday, I had to ritualistically moderate my own thoughts. I was too scared to ever really talk about this to anyone in detail, so most of my life I kept it to myself as I was scared of being called crazy. I would constantly count in my mind, I would constantly pray, just to distract my mind from these thoughts. I constantly thought of things like ""I would never do those things. I would never do those things. I would never do thoses things"" just so my mind wouldn't berate me with the thoughts. It got to the point (ages 11-16) that it started to interrupt my life in physical ways. I would be walking up the stairs and my mind would tell me ""if you dont stop and pray right now, you will do something bad tonight"". I would be conversating with somebody and my mind would make me do the randomest shit like ""if you dont get then to repeat the word flower, you will be violent tonight"" and so on and so forth. This was a constant thing I struggled with, and I constantly dissociated throughout the day. 

For years, I never talked to anyone. Never TRULY spoke up about it because of times I tried to but it didnt go as planned. I literally thought I was going crazy, as if was on the path to be a killer. It was the cruelest thing I have gone through, and it chipped away at me everyday. Eventually, it occupied my mind so much that the only way to push these thoughts away were to think of the line ""I would rather kill myself than do that"". I didnt actually want to kill myself, but I constantly thought about it - and it only got worse. 

I was in a spiral of thought that seemed almost never-ending, but one day, I chose to search up on my problem. After 10 years. I FINALLY chose to look it up. I never actually went to a therapist to get diagnosed as I have always been too scared, but my symptoms lined up with things that many other people struggle with (search up pure OCD). This did not undermine my experience in any way, but instead made me feel like I wasn't going completely insane, and it was one of the most empowering things I have ever done. Trying to UNDERSTAND what you're feeling is one of the best things you can do. It may not help right away, but it definitely helps. 

Soon, I began finding how to help myself. Then after finding a small number of people I truly trusted, I began to talk about it. I talked about it. In the first time in years, I didn't beat around the bush, because although beating around the bush can bring temporary release, it never stays. Find people who you can truly trust, and talk about it. And I know - sometimes its not that easy, sometimes people don't react the way you want to and you lose trust. But picking yourself back up and trying to find new friends to establish strong connections with is a worthwhile part of the struggle. I talked about it. I took plenty of time for myself to work on my own mental space. Read all about the ways to help reduce intrusive thoughts. Learned about my own mind, and when things became overwhelming, I rested. Learning new ways to moderate your thoughts isn't only emotionally tiring, but physically tiring. It really can take a toll on someone, so give yourself some credit. 

I still have my bad days, or weeks when these thoughts come back, but it is nowhere close to as bad as it used to be. I can control my mind better, I can speak about my problems slightly more, I don't have to ritualistically distract myself, I don't dissociate for days on end. Talk to people who love you. I know I myself didn't get a therapist, but I wish I did. I feel like it would've made the process a bit quicker. I truly understand how scary the thought of judgement from family and friends is. But if you need it, do it (or get a therapist anyways. You don't need to be ""struggling"" to get a therapist). Get help. There is so much on this world you have to try and experience. 

I know its hard. But it gets better. 

TLDR; struggled with mental health for about 10-11 years. I feel a lot better now."
1008,"How should i go about saying no to my family member, who is going through a schizophrenic episode, in this situation?","So my family member has schizophrenia and has been going through an episode lately. During this episode he is way more aggressive, out of it, hearing voices, not talking in coherent sentences, etc. 

Right now he's homeless and is asking to come over to my place to take a shower.

Right now with the state he is in my answer is no. I know I may sound terrible to some, but from things that have happened in the past and from factors that are happening now it is not a good idea to have this happen. 

I need input or advice on how I plan to go about this and if there is a better way to go about this. 
I was thinking of saying something along the lines of ""-name-, I would like to help, but from the last time we hung out together I feel a little bit uncomfortable with that. Sorry, my answer is no."". 

But then with that he may ask me why, may get kind of mad at me, 

That sounds, to me, like a good way to be honest and direct, but he's really going through an episode right now. Does anyone know if there is a better way to go about this? Or does this way sound good to you?"

1010,How can I de-stress in my situation?,"I hate my job so much and I feel like a failure in life. I live with my partners family and I’m now being pressured by not only my mom, but my partners mom to go to school and get a “real” job. 
I want to go to school but it’s so expensive, and I don’t even know what I’d go for. I just feel so stuck and I’m so stressed. I work so much, I just got done 7 days in a row and this is my first day off but then tomorrow is the start of 5 days. I don’t know how to get my life started and get into a career to not be stuck working a shit job at a grocery store, where you’re extremely taken advantage of. I’m so done with my job but I can’t quit. I try to put my head down and just work but the management is ass and they make it hard to just. work. 
I’m looking for another job but there’s nothing because of corna and anything and everything requires some sort of post secondary/experience, so I’m stuck. I’m always stuck. 

I see people my age already getting married and in careers or finishing school. Some are buying houses and even having kids. I’m going to be 20 in less than a month and I’m worried about my bike being rideable for the summer because I’ve had it for 8 years.. and how I’m going to afford another one if it isn’t gonna last another year. Most people drive but I’m terrified of driving. I just want to grow up. Why is growing up seemingly so easy for everybody around me, but me?"
1011,"How often, and when, do you and your counselor correspond on BetterHelp?","I joined BetterHelp a week ago and to say I’m frustrated is an understatement. 

I’ll preface this by saying that a couple years ago I used TalkSpace and had such a positive experience there. My counselor and I would correspond at least once a day and it always came happened during daytime. There were even times when it was more of text conversation back and forth then email exchange. Right from the get go she asked questions or offered prompts to begin working through the issue I had at the time. 

Based on recent reviews online, and cost, I decided to try BetterHelp this time round. 

With BetterHelp, the first counselor I matched with had a schedule that didn’t at all work with mine (based on her intro message). I had to contact customer service to switch and it took three days to eventually be rematched. I got the standard intro message. I responded to that right away saying it was nice to meet her. She responded almost 48 hours later, at 2 a.m. basically saying “same” and nothing else. No prompts, no questions. I sent another message with details on why I was seeking counseling and am once again waiting...

So I’m curious how often others who are using BetterHelp receive messages and when does that correspondence typically happen?"
1012,i feel nothing.,"i feel like i force my emotions constantly. a couple weeks ago i was sitting and sketching random shit when my head was just filled with the most self deprecating thoughts. i’m usually a pretty unbothered person but i have to force myself to cry constantly because if i don’t it’ll eat me up and i’ll end up attempting to self harm, which thankfully i haven’t succumbed to. but i’ve reached a point where i’ve held a knife up to wrist and applied pressure. 

i don’t want to self diagnose but i honestly think i’m incapable of having emotions. for example i love my friends like absolutely adore them and i know that but i don’t feel that sort of compulsion your “supposed” to feel with someone you care for. i’ve never been to therapy and i don’t think i can because i feel like whatever is going on with me i’m doing to myself. i’m in this state where tears falls but no emotion is present and can’t be identified. 

i think this sort of empty, lonely void thing feeling inside me stems from never actually showing emotion when i was younger because all emotion shared was invalidated by my parents. i don’t even know what i’m talking about anymore, i’ve completely lost track of the subject matter. 

ANYWHO.. 

i don’t feel and i don’t know how to explain it. hope you enjoy my little rant thingy :)"

1014,Food for spiritual thought I guess.,"(TW : MENTIONS OF A FAILED SUICIDE ATTEMPT) 

So, when I (20F) was 14, I was going through some shit at school. I would say bullying, but it had started as an argument that I was actively partaking in so idk how to class it. I was also struggling with my health, mental health and family life. On a random Friday I have the morning off school to have a biopsy on my lung (what fun) and I go to school in the afternoon because my parents wanted me to have good attendance. The girl I was arguing with approaches. A fight ensues. No one wins, we both kinda lost. I got a bust lip, she got a bust nose. Weekend rolls by, monday comes, and I go back to school. I wasnt allowed in my lessons, everything's gone to shit, and my friends would no longer look at me. Tuesday was the same. The school did nothing. The tuesday night my parents go to walk the dog, and my brothers out. I decided I didnt want to be here anymore. My nana used to give us these 100 tablet pack of paracetamol, and I stole one out the cupboard that night, and took 40 at 10pm. I fell asleep quickly, and woke up 4 hours later vomiting. Looking back I would say it felt like being black out drunk. My mum came to rub my back, and I told her I didnt want to go to school. She said okay, told my dad and he said I didnt have to go anymore, he would sort it out tomorrow and to have a lay in. I crawled back into bed, unaware that much longer without help and I'd be past saving, and silence fell over the house. 

Heres where it gets interesting. 

I'd placed the packets of the tablets under my other pillow (double bed). After 15 minutes, my dad got up. To this day he doesnt know why. He said he fell back to sleep, and woke up with the stern voice in his head saying ""go check on her"". He did. For the first time ever he laid came and laid on my bed beside me, heard the crinkles, saw the packs and the rest is history. To this very day my dad said hes never heard that voice in his head since. Now I just think it wasnt my time. So yeah. Food for thought."
1015,Life is empty,"I don’t enjoy being alive at all. This is the most boring existence ever. I’m not suicidal, but a part of me wants to just jump out the window and get it over with. I’m tired. I can’t take much more of this. It’s not as if I’m constantly crying... but I never seem to be happy either. It’s just empty. I hate this. Life is only going to get worse. It will be painful. I could be proactive.

All I do is SCUBA diving (which is the only thing that gives me a purpose) and read books. That’s all. I just want a normal life. I’ve asked for help, but no one seems to be able to help me. I really, really can’t stand this life. The older I get, the worse I feel. I’m 24 and this is awful. The older I get, the more I think of suicide as a viable option. I just can’t see any joy in my future."

1017,Small Things,"Almost a month ago I went to see my doctor and got prescribed some new meds.   I was in a really dark place.  Like constant thoughts about dying and hurting myself.  My wife, who has helped me get through all my struggles over the years, told me to look forward to the small things.  She told me to stop worrying about the future and just look at things a day at a time.  It’s a thought that really stuck with me over the past month as these new meds started to take effect.  I can honestly say that I have been a lot less anxious and haven’t really thought about hurting myself.  I want to enjoy this time I have with my wife and my cat Taco and just take it day by day.  I also want to try and support others who are struggling like I’m struggling.  Also, I’ve been sober for 9 months and I’m pretty happy about that as well!!!!"
1018,Losing control,"I feel like a ghost people don't notice me and when they do it's always negative like when I've lost my temper or something and then I get made out to be the bad guy or thought of as attention seeking.

Theres just no point to me like most people serve purpose in this world and I'm just a nobody just a blip on the map.

I sure as hell don't fit in anywhere I feel like a social outcast , I've always been nerdy but not enough to fit in with others who like the same stuff I do,  I love rock music but always got rejected by groups into what I was. You get the picture everything I like I dont fit in with.

I either get bullied or pwople think bad of me and I don't even have to say anything.

I don't know what to do anymore I feel cursed.

I take anti depressants every day and I have to let people know at work when it's time to take them so they know to cover my position while I'm not on the shop floor and I get the feeling they think I don't need them because I put a smile on at work but they smile is fake so customers don't see how crap I feel.

I'm just tired of it all, I want to stay alive so bad be happy but every time I get two steps a head the void pulls me back again. I don't want to die I'm grateful to be here but I'm sinking now I don't know how long it will be before I drown."
1019,Does this happen to anyone else and what causes it?,"I don't know why or what causes it, but every now and then I feel incredibly exhausted on an emotional level to the point where I kind of just turn them off and walk around like a robot zombie. My thinking processes work fine and I still have the energy to do the things that I need to get done and get hyper focused on those tasks, but I can't bring myself to do things I enjoy. My speech also quiets to a soft indoor voice and becomes muted and devoid of all emotion. What is this?"
1020,am i an asshole for not wanting to be friends with people i dont like,"my sister was arguing with me over something and she brought up that i dont have any friends and how noone likes me lol. i told her that i could have friends if i wanted to but i dont like being around them. she called me an asshole for that.

that was funny coming from someone who says the n word (hard r AND with an a...), various other slurs, bodyshames, and talks about how she doesnt want to be friends with ugly people, not to mention is mean to literally everyone for any reason ever but it certainly did stick with me.

now dont get me wrong, i wouldnt be mean to these people. but at the same time, i dont want to unnecessarily spend time around people i dont enjoy being around.

am i an asshole"
1021,I’m feeling lost,"I don’t really feel like my meds are working anymore

i feel so lifeless and horrible and depressed and suicidal

i’m constantly wanting to die and nothing is enjoyable

things should be good for me?
i’m living w my bf, i don’t have to work, and i’m working on doing the things i’ve dreamed about for years

but i hate everything, nothing brings me joy anymore

i hate reddit, i hate my tv shows, i hate the projects i’m working on, i’m not fun to be around right now.

The only thing that brings a little bit of? not even joy? like purpose maybe? is working out and that’s only because i’m super obsessive about my weight and calorie intake........ i essentially only do it bc in a way it’s a form of self harm i guess

i hate feeling like this. i don’t know what’s worse, the pain and agony or the feeling of this hopeless lifelessness..... i feel like such a shell of person. I feel like i will never amount to anything in life.

why was i born like this? why does it have to be me? why must i feel like this with *no way out*

i just want it all to end....

i don’t even have a therapist right now, and i don’t see my psychiatrist for another week. and it’s definitely impossible to see her any sooner bc of how hard it is to reach them.

i just want some sort of escape. some sort of anything that will make me feel any bit better."
1022,Bullied years ago and now (F16) and still pretty low self esteem,"Title really says it all really. Bullied when I was 10 years old , for a year (only verbally, but I’d still have moments where I’d snap and just throw a temper tantrum) and my self esteem pretty shit . I’d still question if I’m a burden to other people, or I’d I’m good enough for my boyfriend or if I’m too emotionally damaged for other people to deal with me (friendships and relationships). 

And kinda went through some other stuff too(doesn’t have anything to do with the bullying)
So yea i guess I’m just asking what I could do to help with my low self esteem."
1023,Delusions and hallucinations,"Sometimes when I have delusions of doing things I never did, even if they’re wildly out of character. Like sending people certain messages or doing something I said I would, only to find out I didn’t. It’s weird, even if I’m lying down and I haven’t gotten up, I’m convinces I went and did this thing I clearly didn’t.

I also talk to people that aren’t there a lot and I don’t realize until later when I can surmise that I definitely didn’t see them, as I’ve been in my room all day. I just have conversations with approximations of people I know. Sometimes I’m mad at them for something, sometimes I don’t care and am just happy to see them and sometimes we sit in silence and enjoy each other’s company. I hallucinate being followed a lot whenever I’m walking alone at night, I hallucinated someone breaking into my house recently. I just don’t know anymore, it’s getting really hard trying to figure out what did and didn’t happen. I don’t know what to do, but I can’t spend more time in a mental ward, if anyone knew about this I’d never get out"
1024,I have a reversed sleep cycle.,"My sleep cycle has reversed completely in the last month. I dont really have trouble sleeping but ive found myself staying up till noon then sleeping through till 6pm to 8pm.  This is massively fustrating and no matter how hard i try i havent been able to fix my cycle. Ive stayed up all day, which works to sleep early that day but then the next day i wont be able to sleep early at all. I also have tried sleeping less during the day but that doesnt work either. Before quarantine i was generally fine because of school, but now thats closed and i dont really have much of a reason to force myself awake. This does however take a toll on my productivity as i dont like working in the night. I am 17 if that changes anything.Im not sure where else to post this but if someone knows wtf is up with me that would be nice. I know its probably some kind of circadian rhythm disorder but idk what to do to fix it."
1025,why did my anxiety get worse after getting diagnosed?!,"guys i’m so confused . i got diagnosed with anxiety about two month ago and i had not been seeking a diagnosis but it made a lot of sense when i found out. but ever since it’s been way worse, as if the knowledge that i have it trigged it worse then ever. why is this?! what’s wrong with me"
1026,I think I may have a problem.,"I am 11 years old currently and not sure if I have a mental disorder or something.

Pretty much when I do something and it gets noticed(Like me wearing a hoodie as I currently am) for some reason I have the need to not stop doing it, Even if the people who noticed it tell me to stop.

I feel like everyone will make a even larger deal about it when I stop, Making me want to keep doing it more. I currently am wearing a hoodie almost 24/7. I don't really know why but I just feel like I have to keep it on.

If you have any questions Please comment it on this post."
1027,Long ass rant about being discontented when you otherwise have a great life.,"Posting this here just in case someone reading this may have had or is currently experiencing the same thing as me.
I feel restless, anxious and discontent a lot more than I want or should. I have a great husband who loves me and sincerely cares about me. He also tries to do nice things for me or get me thoughtful gifts from time to time. I have a good paying job that for the most part is low stress and not overly demanding of me. I have a Dad and grandmother that also love and care about me. They both live across the country from me but will call from time to time to catch up and see how I'm doing. Other than some mental health issues and PCOS, I am otherwise in great health. I drink on occasion but am able to walk away without it. I don't do drugs and my only true addiction is coffee. I am at an ideal weight for me at 36 years old. I am grateful for all of these things in my life. 
Now to the other part... I do not have any best friends other than my spouse. I have people that I like to talk to sometimes but generally the friendships I have with other people are very topical and don't really dive into anything too personal or exciting. I also have some social anxiety which also causes me problems with trying to build or maintain friendships. 
I am not able to talk much or relate to any of my co-workers. I am a neurotic. I work in a team environment but prefer to complete assignments by myself and I generally do not miss the company of other people. This causes some awkwardness at work and makes it difficult when I need their help on projects.
I have high expectations of myself. I am the kind of person who starts to feel unappreciated if left to having to do monotonous or uninspiring work. Which, being in-between projects at the moment, I am doing a lot of. I sulk and mope in such situations. I feel like I am a hard person to deal with, although I have been told by several different people that that is not true. A part of me wants to believe that but another part says they are just being nice and not exactly honest. 
Anyways, I've kinda let this get too long but I shouldn't feel disappointed and as discontent as I feel. There is a part of me that wants to strangle the discontented part and say that life isn't perfect but I've still got it better than some people in this world, so grow up and get over it. But I still find that I am fighting this battle with myself over and over again. It doesn't matter how many self-help books or articles I read online, I still feel at a loss as to how to fix myself. I wish I wasn't so neurotic, pathetic and feeling sorry for myself all the time. 
Truly I should not feel the way that I do."
1028,You can do it.,"Someone posted in another group (r/socialskills) and I thought my reply would be worth sharing here because it's provided a lot of good feelings in my life lately, even though it's been a rough few months/years/life.

""You don't find yourself, you create yourself.""

This is the best quote that has been getting me through that feeling of not knowing who I am, but also not really wanting to go back to exactly who I was before because to be honest, that person was still very sad, distressed, and had a lot of work to do. 

You can get there. Find affirmations that work for you and write them somewhere you'll see every day so you can verbally tell it to yourself- in front of a mirror is a good place. If you tell yourself something enough times, you will start to believe it. We do this often with negative thoughts, but it's a bit harder to do with positive ones. We need to stick with it and force ourselves to do it because it doesn't fall naturally yet. The good news is, it takes 21 days to form a habit. Slowly but surely, it will become second nature to love yourself. 

""Love what is."" - an incredibly deep quote that I have found is powerful for expressing gratitude, which has proven to be one of the most important things to leading a healthy life.
""I love myself.""
""You're doing amazing.""
""Please remember to eat today, your body loves you.""
""I am healthy.""
""I am healing.""
""I am strong.""
""I can do this.""

You can do this."
1029,All it would take is some dedication,"I got a new knife today. It's pretty thin and narrow. Sharp as a razor and can even shave. I sit here with it in my hand and so many thoughts accompany me. I could stab myself, the leg, arm, stomach, neck, so many places. My dads asleep on the couch, i hate him I could get him in the throat. My fiancée sleeps next to me and I love her so so much I don't want her to hurt anymore I could end all of her pain. I don't want to do anything but so many thoughts are pulsing through my head it hurts. All it would take is some dedication to change my life. I cant take thoughts sometimes."
1030,Where’s the balance between wanting their attention and support and also understanding they’re not your therapist?,"i just want to be held and loved for hours but i know that’s not fair.... but he doesn’t even give me affection for more than a few minutes at a time and i usually have to ask for it even when i’m crying.... but i also cry a lot?

is it manipulative to wish that he would be more supportive physically?"
1031,How to deal with not being able to go to therapy during quarantine?,"I have serious anxiety issues and this quarentine took me off guard.

I have been going to therapy since I was four years old and I never stopped to think about how necessary it was for me. 

People who used to go to therapy, how are you doing this?

I think anxiety is ruining my life and ruining it causes me more anxiety. Help."
1032,What advice would you give to someone planning a mass shooting to tell him that life is worth living?,"Adam Lanza. Elliot Rodger. Nikolas Cruz. Seung-Hui Cho. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.

Sandy Hook. Isla Vista. Parkland School. Virginia Tech. Columbine.

We  hear about all these mass shootings in the media. The media always end  up plastering the life stories of these murderers on the front pages and  emphasizing how weird they are. Troubled childhoods. Divorced parents.  Refrigerator moms. Loners. Autistic. Socially inept. Incels.

I  don't like it. It absolves them and society of responsibility. If mass  killers  were such weirdos, weren't they fated to be mass shooters? If  they were  destined to be outcasts and loners, shunned and abused by  humanity for  their entire lives, can they really be blamed for doing  what they did?

Could any of these mass killers have been helped? Or was it written in the stars ... their pathology made it impossible.

What  advice would you have given to one of these mass killers, e.g. Adam  Lanza to not kill himself and all those kids at Sandy Hook, and lead a  happy and fulfilled life instead?

It's scary to to think that a single hug might have prevented a mass shooting.

I'm  asking this because I've learned my nephew has high-functioning autism.  This is what the first four killers I listed (Adam Lanza. Elliot  Rodger. Nikolas Cruz. Seung-Hui Cho), and many mass shooters, murderers  and serial killers have.  I would like to avoid him growing up to be a  mass shooter by giving him the right advice and guidance."
1033,How do I quit a job because of my mental health?,"Does anyone have experience quitting a job for mental health reasons? What did you say? How did it go? My instinct is to make up some excuse for why I haven't been getting my work done and can't take on anymore, but I want to try to be honest."
1034,I think I have extreme separation anxiety. Anyone have any advice ?,"Been with my girl for 5 years, someone close to her passed away recently in another state (where shes from) and I was able to go out there to support her and her family for about 4 days but had to come back home. She was supposed to come back on Thursday but extended her stay for another week(I'm totally supportive) so about a week and 3 days left 

I have this constant pain in my chest {and I can't breef} and a constant worry about anything and everything. I don't show it just mostly wait patient Until she hits me up but will call her here an there. I can't stop thinking about these worse case scenarios. I feel like something is wrong with me. I've had trust issues before and some stuff did bother me but didn't show it cause of the situation she's in. So I know that's part of it but it's not just that. The person that passed aways bf is around the family which I never thought twice about. But after everything happened and I left she's constantly with him. Gets super bummed out if he didn't say by and gets super bummed out when he leaves. She also did this a few times when I was there ( I feel like I'm just being stupid but need to get this out)"
1035,Triggered to HELL and back tonight...,"Stupid STUPID me...

Watched a video of a fire--my weakness, a Dumpster fire.

Fuck. I am LITERALLY holding myself on this bed typing this so I don't go out and burn something in this new neighborhood. There are SO many Dumpsters within walking distance.

We moved to a lovely, gorgeous neighborhood where there are tons of trees and nice houses...

But fuck me. I walked into a Pyromaniac's paradise. Dumpsters for closed businesses...woods...temptation EVERYWHERE.

I am feeling every bit of the Pyromaniac I am right now. I feel it so deep in my soul that if I even tried to say I am NOT a fire-obsessed nut, I would literally choke on the words. Even typing it...I took about 15 tries to type that out without any typos. I can't...

I had the job of lighting our youngest son's birthday candles today. He turned 10, and of course, the family all turned to the firebug who has at least 30 lighters (I am not even exaggerating) to light up his cake. An Ice Cream Cake. It was good. It didn't help...

I can't sleep. I ate creamed spinach and now I have energy (it gave me a lot of iron to spare, and somehow it is absorbed better than red meat iron) which doesn't help either. I am not manic, but I am barely controlling myself. BARELY. I might flick my lighter a few more times. That helps. Sometimes.

There was a fatal structure fire very near where we used to live and I knew the lady who had died. I can't believe it. I am in shock. The fire started about 6 am on the day we were moving (Saturday), but I was still asleep after being online until like 2 am or so. The rest of the morning we were moving stuff out of the apartment. I am not worried, for once.

I need to sleep (we are getting our proper internet/phone/tv hooked up tomorrow so I don't have to use my phone as a hotspot anymore) but I can't. I want fire...I need fire...my mind, body and soul are longing for it--literally craving it like you would crave a cigarette or alcohol...or even chocolate.

Sigh."
1036,mental health day,decided to take a mental health day from work last week.  Was told if I needed a sick day that would be fine but there would be consequences.  Let it fester for a week and still no better so I talked to my boss's boss instead.  Taking a mental health day. Its ridiculous I can be prescribed medicine for an illness but its actually not an illness for corporate America
1037,Can someone please describe what dissociation feels like?,"I may have experienced dissociation after being in a pretty stressful situation today, and I was just wondering what the common feelings of dissociation are. For me, it felt like my sight zoomed out to the back of my head and I felt pretty weird although it only lasted a few seconds so idk if this is dissociation or something else."
1038,"OCD has made me obssesed with order, politics and power, any has this?"," Ever since I was a kid I suffer from this and I'm getting help. I'm addicted to politics, its the only thing that pops up on my head and repeats in loops that I myself can't break even if I try.

I study criminal research, and I want to go after a career in that area. But my problem is that my obsession with justice and order will do things to me that I don't want. My obsession with order first hand makes me very controlling of people and since I live in a third world country I see how irrational and unordered people are, and I have an obsession with killing those who can't be order, productive and clean.

I wrote a paper on my support for eugenics to clean out unwanted imperfections, gave it in, later that night I got a bit drunk and felt guilt, but then when it was done my obsessions came back. I honestly can't stop thinking about it and it feels exhausting. This has halted me from even finding a partner because I'm very open about my obsessions and even though some girls would consider me attractive and even initiated the conversation in a obvious way which shows interest I always scare them away with my obsessions. I have tried to keep them to myself but they always come out.

I try to be aware that most things are not under my control, but this thought itself makes me anxious. To know that under my rule a rapist would be killed, a robber hanged and corruption treated with full capital punishment for government offcials is the only fantasy in my mind that makes me free thus I study the societies in which these things did happen and I try to imagine a place of order"
1039,Need some clarification,"A few years ago now, I was diagnosed with ADHD.  I've been taking adderall for about a year by now, and before I was taking concerta.  I did a little research, and I also think I might have imposter syndrome as well.  I haven't really asked my therapist about it yet, but I want to since I've been trying to get better mentally (self esteem, accepting myself as I am, that kind of stuff).  From what I've read, imposter syndrome is essentially where you think that you don't deserve the things that you have.  This definitely describes me, and I've stayed up crying multiple times because I was thinking about everything that people around me do for me and thinking that I don't deserve it.  I really just want clarification as to whether I should ask my therapist or not.  Thanks"
1040,my mom said i have nothing to be stressed about,i've been isolating myself at home a lot and yesterday she basically forced me to tell her what's going on with me. i said i'm stressed and feeling low but i dont know why i'm feeling this way. she said that that's not possible and there must be something causing it. but the truth is i don't know what exactly is causing it. she couldn't comprehend how a teenager can have anything to be stressed about.
1041,Toxic friend?,"Hi guys, I need some advice and need to know if this person is toxic or a burden to my mental health, so I’ve known this friend for around 2 years and I’ve always told them my mental health problems with depression and suicide and they’ve been pretty much the only person I’d tell. However, whenever I tend to talk about my mental health I get very slow responses (up to days) if not ever, and recently I told them about my suicidal thoughts and they took up to days to respond to me, and when I told them I had the intention of committing suicide and told them that we would most likely never see each other again or talk and that I would commit suicide in the up coming days, the response I got was ‘I hope you’re okay my replies have been shit I will respond from now on’ , this was her response to my goodbye, I then processed to explain how it wasn’t her replies which were the problem but my life as a whole and the abuse I’d faced and my hate for my physical and mental attributes, I must have sent around 2/3 paragraphs and the response I got was ‘none of your friends messaged you that’s so wrong’ after I told them the reason I was feeling the way. We texted for a tiny bit after they promised to reply to me and boom they stopped replying to my messages and didn’t even bother to open it at all or anything just leave me on delivered, should I unfriend this person???"
1042,Feeling lost and hopeless,"TW: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, ANXIETY, OCD COMPULSIONS

I fucking give up. I've been sent to hospital once, phoned camhs, childline, SHOUT, tried several self help techniques and distractions and NOTHING WORKS. WHY WON'T 'MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS' ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE FOR ONCE RATHER THAN FOBBING PEOPLE OFF. I'M SO PISSED OFF. I've come so close to just killing myself before and all I get is dumb distractions.

Prescribed sertraline but can't take it because I'm so anxious about side effects or allergic reaction. 

My health anxiety is out of this world. What illness do I have today? Sepsis, stroke, severe dehydration, pneumonia, coronavirus, cancer? am i dying today? Will I die today? What happens if i burn my hands under the water? Nothing don't worry. No you'll die of sepsis if you don't burn your hands. Remember the infection you had around a month ago, yep. That's gonna turn into sepsis. Better start saying goodbye.

'are you gonna kill yourself?' i don't fucking know. What can I do next? I feel like I've ran out of options"
1043,Advice on talking to a therapist about suicidal thoughts without getting admitted to the psych ward,"I finally took the step of getting help for my mental health issues. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was about 11 (in my mid twenties now) and seriously planned/contemplated taking my life twice. I want to get better for the sake of my family and I feel I can't do that w/out being honest with my therapist but I am scared I will get involuntarily committed into the psych ward . This is the worst I have felt mentally since my last suicidal episode. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
1044,Am I overthinking or could I actually be developing some type of paranoid schizophrenia?,"I don’t know if I’m overthinking things or if I’m actually developing schizophrenia.

To start: I’ve always been huge into mental health- my moms’ side of the  family is just full of disorders. In particular, my grandma has schizophrenia, as well as my half sister- though her other grandmother also has it as well. Our mom has bipolar disorder. I have anxiety, ADD, and depression, and also had PTSD issues from my mom’s now ex boyfriend, though I’m pretty much past all that now. I’m planning on going into social work because I want to help others in situations like mine and worse. 

I lived with my half sister when she was developing schizophrenia, around the age of 19. I won’t go into details as it doesn’t feel necessary, but I want to mention that I did experience witnessing the development specifically of paranoid schizophrenia. This was around the time that I was getting past the worst of my suicidal thoughts and PTSD-related hallucinations- mostly auditory (for me it was like a mumbling, or like I was in a room full of people but couldn’t make out individual words) and olfactory (smelling smoke when there was none), and occasionally minor visual ones where it was just like colored blond blocking my vision. 

Recently, I’ve noticed that I’m having many instances of not remembering situations that most definitely happened, I’ve had moments of impulse where I can’t stop what I’m doing even though I know it’s wrong, and I keep having deluded thoughts which I know have no basis and are likely wrong, however the thoughts keep persisting.

For example, I woke up this morning and found that I’d texted my boyfriend about something I’d been reading online- that part I remember. However I apparently texted him more and talked about the “multiple me’s” in my brain:

“My brain is all of the mes, not necessarily the one that is usually there. I’m me then there’s the super insecure voice that’s there and sometimes the one that’s just like FUCK THE WORLD GO YELL AT PEOPLE and then there’s the one that tells me to go kill myself and I’m just like y’all need to shut up. Like I understand what y’all are saying and I agree but some of these are bad ideas and also you’re a fucking idiot and I don’t know why you’re in my brain and then we all get into an argument and I go to sleep.”

He texted back something that included “we can”, but mistyped it as one word- “wecan”. I said that that sounded like pecan, then apparently went and texted a different friend that pecan reminded me of pecan pie and easy peasy pumpkin peasy pumpkin pie motherf*cker.

I don’t remember any of that happening. 

Plus, I completely flipped out on a good friend and was very rude and insulting- I apologized, but she’s understandably upset, and I think I’ve lost a friend. She said I hadn’t talked to her much even before quarantine, and that is true, however the reasons bother me. I had some strange idea in my head that she wanted to make me think I was second to her in everything. She is a very talented and smart girl, an amazing instrumentalist- she got first chair and I second in our schools band, and during marching season she got section leader and I didn’t even though we usually have two. Even though I know she wouldn’t have tried to rig it against me, something in my brain kept nagging and telling me that she convinced the band director to not put two section leaders. She never brags about things like that, so I don’t know why I kept thinking she was rigging it against me. 

I live with my grandma (on dads side) due to feeling uncomfortable at my moms due to lingering associations of the place with her ex. She is a very high strung woman with the stereotypical neat-freak OCD, something that clashes strongly with my scatterbrain. For some reason, I can’t shake the feeling that she’s spying on me somehow; as a kid I always thought she had cameras in my room, a belief that was completely unfounded and that I knew was delusional. I have thoughts often that she’s bugged my phone, though I know she doesn’t understand technology enough to do so. 

Basically, I have constant deluded thoughts of being persecuted. This is a definite sign of schizophrenia. However I wonder if the fact that I know these are delusional thought means I’m not truly schizophrenic. The I overthink more and remember that being well-informed about the disorder as well as others helps me to recognize the fallacies in my own thinking. But then again I could be acting hypochondriac-esque; my half sister, for example, is and always has been a complete germaphobe, and always thought she had some disease- these thoughts have become more tame now that she’s on medication. 

I’m overthinking about overthinking about overthinking. And I don’t know if that’s a sign of anxiety or if I’m actually developing schizophrenia. 

What should I do? I don’t feel comfortable talking to my counselor about this over the phone, and we won’t be in-office until June at the earliest. My moms side of the family all have their own issues. My dads side (mainly my grandma, who I live with) still have issues with a mindset of ‘mental illnesses aren’t real’ and I think they don’t want to believe that there’s anything else malfunctioning in my brain."
1045,"I have been on a downward spiral for weeks, need help.","Hi, I am a 19-year-old male and have been struggling with depression since December 2019, and I have been struggling with depression off and on since I was 16. Recently it has gotten very bad to the point where I have been self-harming nearly every week for around 3 months and have been considering suicide. I feel as if I am in a pickle because my mom suffers from bipolar depression and I am afraid to go to my parents. I do not want my mom to feel like it is her fault for the depression. I really want to get help, as I am afraid if I do not get help soon, I might do something I'll regret. I really don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to get help, I just don't know how."
1046,Im..... nothing. I want to escape this Hell. Please help me. Pls. Anything,"Hi
To preface: I'm a 20 y/o female that was diagnosed with BPD, ptsd, anxiety and depression. Grew up religious and was molested from 12 to 18.

I dont know what to do. I am dealing (not well) with extreme existentialism and existential anxiety.
I dont know how to deal with this.
I've done therapy, and its complete bullshit. My therapists sucked so bad, and I cant afford good ones. I'm so unhappy, I break down all the time in a flip of a switch. I am not interested in anything, no hobbies or interests. Nothing matters anyway. Im only living bc of the love I have dor my fiance. I have some friends but I could drop them and feel the exact same. weed and alchohol are the only thing to give me feeling. And why are those things bad? When literally nothing matters, religion isnt real, we are cells living on a rock and literally are completely useless to this universe. We die, and that's it. That's fucking it. How am I supposed to be cured from my depression and problems when we dont matter. And I dont want to necessarily kill myself, but what 
""Depression is your body telling you that it doesnt want to play the character you have created anymore."" To quote Jim Carrey.
I am a copy of everyone. Nothing is my own thoughts. I'm controlled in every way. If I dont go college, I cant get a job (i had to drop out bc of my mental health). I have to pay for shelter, work a miserable job (I hate every job i get and quit them in less than a year), i have to work or i will die. Bc money is the main thing controlling us. Our whole lives are to grow up and earn money to live. My family controlled how I SHOULD think, and being a kid, I had no other choice. So their terrible choice fucked my whole life, forced religion on me, and their own beliefs (good and bad beliefs) and now I have no idea who I am. I didnt even have control over my own body or sex life. It really is like I am a character who's just pretending to live a life of boredom and pain. ""Do stuff that makes you happy or speaks something in you"" okay, well my fiance makes me happy, and drugs (not like the hardcore shit ) and alcohol. So I cant constantly be with my fiance bc that's too much for a person, and I cant drink or do drug because it's bad for me???? But you said do what makes you happy? And if nothing fucking matters anyway, why is it such a big deal? 

I dont even know how to further explain how I feel. But I feel like this doesnt even do this justice. I'm sick of the pain and the crying and miserableness. I'm on meds now, but I still feel the exact same about life, except now I'm becoming a robot. 

I hate when people say it takes time, too. Yeah. But I'm miserable now. Why am I living miserablely for a possibility that I MAY be happy one day?

And no. This has nothing to do with Corona.

Thanks for reading. Maybe I sound like a complete idiot. But I really dont care."
1047,How do you ladies deal with PMS?,"Until a couple of months ago, I couldn't recognize why my mood dropped steeply for a couple of days every month. Since I've realized that it's just about a week to a few days before my period, I came to the conclusion that it's PMS symptoms. But it's been getting much worse in the 2 months. It's gotten as bad as having recurrent suicidal thoughts for those few days. I'm currently in the middle of a spell, and it's lasted 3 days now. I've been crying a lot about everything, been feeling very irritable. I haven't had a proper conversation with anyone for the last 3-4 days. I work out regularly and it's pretty intense. I feel better every day after my workout but that's not been helping either.   
I want to be able to do something about this, now that I've recognized why it's happening. Do you guys have any suggestions?"
1048,Dealing with a toxic Fanbase,"Hey, first time poster here. I’m an animation professional using my throwaway account looking for some advice/input. Maybe this isn’t the place for it? It’s definitely been a problem for a long time now. 

I’ve been working in animation for the past several years, and was lucky to work on an a tv show that was pretty popular. It’s over now, been I’ve still been dealing with all the anxiety and resentment that has come with it. Not because of the working conditions, but the fandom that came along with the show. I was really excited and happy to be working on something that was popular with so many kids and teens, but things quickly escalated faster than I ever expected.

It started out innocently enough, a lot of emails with questions about the show, career advice, etc. But slowly things started to become more and more negative. Hate mail, death threats, and in some cases long-form essays were sent my way over things I basically had no control over. I’ve had revenge porn drawn of me, and have been featured in a few 4chan threads making gross comments about me and my coworkers.

It culminated at an event at comic con where we had a hangout with some fans of the show, and I learned from one of them that a friend of theirs was considering bringing a gun and shooting all the crew members present if they didn’t make his ships within the show canon. This didn’t end up happening, but the fact that no one spoke up or warned people ahead of time was terrifying to me. They were reported to HR and blacklisted from our building and that was it. There are many other, smaller things that happened while I was still on the show, but these were some of the biggest things that stuck with me.

Now that the show is over, I have all this pain I don’t know what to do with. I’ve been diagnosed with clinical anxiety disorder, and I haven’t been able to use the internet/interact with most of my previous interests the same way. I’m very close with my old coworkers, and sometimes we vent about things, but nobody went through as bad an experience as I did. 

In my head I try to justify how a lot of this stuff came from overexcited teens or people that just didn’t know better. I’d like to put this aside and move on. I actually was a fan of my show before I started working on it, but now any joy I had for it is replaced with fear and anger. Part of me wants to write all of this stuff on my blog where all these people can see it, so they know how this has made me feel. But logically I know engaging or sharing any of this publicly isn’t a great idea. But since I can’t access a therapist during quarantine, I’m left with anonymously posting this in front of thousands of strangers. Oops.

I guess my question is, how can I move on? I still work in animation, but I don’t want to hold onto all these negative emotions for the rest of my career. I wish I didn’t feel like panicking or crying whenever I have to draw certain things. I wish I didn’t have trouble sleeping at night because I’m afraid people are going to find me and kill me. I don’t know what else I can do besides vent every so often and hope I feel better eventually. Do any of you know ways I can cope or deal with these lasting feelings?"
1049,Just hurting while trying to not hurt myself,"I keep wanting to hit my head on a wall. I can't help but feel like I fucked up so badly that I don't deserve to just heal and move on.

Long story short, I’m 25 and this traumatic experience happened to me from the ages of 15-17 ish. I’ve been in therapy for the last year and finally mustered up the courage to talk about what happened to me which lead to my diagnosis. I knew this traumatic experience still affected me but I didn’t know why. I didn’t know why certain things made me react so much when this happened to me so long ago. 

Right now I’m in the process of learning all I can about PTSD and how it affects me personally.

1062,Please HELP! Signed upped for gym membership during manic episode (bipolar 2),"Hello, I signed up for a gym membership when I was in a manic episode. I signed up for 2 years and really want to cancel it. The people there are displeased when I don’t go as it is an MMA facility, and I am pressured to tell them. So I avoid going and don’t use it.

I also needed to take medication for my bipolar that kept me from doing certain physical activities, as I was being prescribed new meds all the time.

I really want to know if there is some way to cancel this membership and if I can recoup the money I lost. Like is there legally some way to void a gym contract because of that?

1064,Ways to get over a fear of intimate physical contact?,"So first off I want to state that I have never been abused in any way shape or form or had any sort of negative experiences that would cause this. Anyways, for quite a while whenever someone touches me I get very anxious, panicky, and slightly angry. I’m not an angry person at all by nature but this is the one thing that will cause me to get a bit angry, not even at the person or myself, just in general I guess. I first noticed this when I was about thirteen, I was just wrestling with a bud of mine and he went to sweep my leg and in the process grabbed my thigh and that caused me to start sobbing and become very anxious and just sort of sit there and cry for about 5 or so minutes then I was fine. I have no idea why I had this reaction or what causes this issue for me in general. Since then I’ve just avoided touching people as much as I can, anytime someone even puts their hand on my shoulder or leg or touches me in a comforting way, even if it’s family, I have a very strong negative reaction to it. I have noticed that it’s more to do with intimacy than it is just physical contact though. I’m struggling to put it into words but for example my dad made me play football when I was about 14 and while I hated everything about it and it made me extremely uncomfortable (to the point where I was overjoyed when I broke my arm and couldn’t play anymore) I didn’t quite have the same reaction to being tackled or hit that I do when someone just gently puts their hands on me. It’s really fucking weird and has caused a lot of problems for me, it’s been a big part of why I’ve avoided anything sexual or any emotionally charged situation that puts me in any sort of physically vulnerable position. 


Anyways, I’ve talked this out with a few psychiatrists and it’s never amounted to much growth in this area. I admit I’d like to understand what causes this for me but at this point I don’t think it’s really been caused by anything so I’d like to just get past it. Is this a common thing? And is there a way to just get over it? I’ve worked on myself quite a bit in the past 8 months and I feel like I’ve really made some strides in my mental and emotional health but this is the one thing I feel like is holding me back from a lot of things I’d like to experience."
1065,How to help friend get help,"Warning, I talk about abuse which might trigger you.

So my friend recently has been texting a lot on our group chat about her mental health. Although she doesn't like to admit, she was a victim of an abusive and toxic relationship with her former best friend-turned-lover and it seems to have really scarred her.
Me and my other friends thought she was coping well but it seems the quarantine made her think about it again. She told us all about things that person did to her that she hadn't told us before because of her fear of being shamed, and how she often cries herself to sleep. She told us about how she was angry at herself and the person who hurt her, and all the other emotions that came with it, including the guilt, embarassment and regret.

I know these things are pretty normal to be experienced by abuse victims, and I am a abuse victim myself so I simply tried my best to support her and encourage her.
I tried to encourage her to contact a therapist, a school counselor or even a helpline but she wouldn't. She seems to have a fear of therapy and anything related to mental health?

Like many people who have been and still are told that mental help is only for deranged lunatics (which it is not, and I tried to explain to her), she is heavily stigmatized towards mental help and keeps saying she is fine, even immediately after telling us about how she cries to sleep every night.

Furthermore, even though people say it isn't, mental health in my country is heavily stigmatized and most people won't be concerned unless they hear a person is suicidal. Even then, people who are suicidal are often shamed (for example my mom who, even though I begged her to contact a therapist multiple times, said she'd only be legitimately worried and do so if I was suicidal, which I was, but I didn't tell her cause of stigma. I do have a therapist now though cause my friend called the cops on me).

I was really worried about my friend and her way of thinking but didn't want to pressure her so I let it go. She seemed to be doing well until she texted us recently saying she was having hallucinations. Apparently she can hear and see voices and people that aren't there? She saw a young man in her house and a young girl and can hear people whispering things in her ears, such as ""don't be friends with ___"".

If I wasn't already really concerned for her, I am now for she's obviously hallucinating, which is not good.

She keeps on saying she's fine though, and refuses getting a therapist or talking with her parents about it. I want to respect her choices but am getting really worried and don't what to do. It's stressing me out so much I can't sleep. I really want to help her but don't know how. If someone could give me advice that'd be great"
1066,Animate Corpse,"I want to crawl into a hole. People can be so cruel and selfish. I have been used up and thrown out so many times. I am the common denominator.

1067,Recovering from Anxiety induced Eating Disorders,"The entire lockdown situation has had an immaculate impact on my mental health, most of it I like to believe is good.
The bad part is that as a child who was fairly on the lighter side of the weight, I started gaining weight as a teen and due to a poor self image and my body dysmorphia, i stopped eating (during the lockdown).
All i did was sleep all day, wake up and weigh myself, drank water, smoked cigarettes and slept again.
I knew this is unhealthy but some part of me was actually liking the fact that I wasn’t guilty of eating.
On the days, i felt extremely sick due to not eating, i ate a few bites of food and felt sicker.
I hate that now i can’t eat properly. Recently, i started working out so i can trick myself into eating without feeling as guilty, i eat a portion smaller than what a toddler eats and i am unable to breathe.
I have dropped 18 lbs in 2 weeks and I feel nauseous throughout the day, I need help.
I feel sick and week all the time."
1068,Do you think it's okay to quit your job to help your mental health?,"I'm lucky enough to be employed during this Covid-19 situation. I have only been with the Company a few months so, once again, I was lucky that I was employed just before all this happened and could work from home and earn a living wage.

With all that said, I have found that my mental health has really been impacted not just by some of the pressures of the new job but also personal situations too with a family member being unwell and also just my own level of anxiety about life as it is in these recent times.

I spend a lot of time recently worrying, not sleeping well, running to the toilet with an anxious tummy (sorry if that TMI) and generally unable to 'switch off'.

So, I have considered if quitting my job is one solution. Well, perhaps not a solution but removing that factor would obviously take away the stress of the job I've been feeling recently. However I know then I'll be unemployed and I suppose from the outside - quitting my job when so many are unemployed seems crazy.

Is it crazy? Is it okay to quite your job to help your mental health? Is it okay to move away from something secure like that because you fear it's affecting you mentally... 

I don't necessarily want to be unemployed but I don't know if I can keep on feeling so rubbish all the time and work does feel like a large part of it to me. 

Rambling now... sorry. I suppose I'd like to know your thoughts and if anyone here has been in (or is in) a similar situation. I can't be alone in feeling this way I'm sure?"
1069,nightly daydream is getting out of hand,"I think i’m developing an unhealthy way to process my negative emotions. i’m on lexapro 20mg for depression so during the day i don’t feel much as far as negative emotions. at night they come back but in the form of regrets, embarrassing moments, times i’ve made other people feel bad, things i feel guilty about, etc. i have no way to get past these thoughts other than to literally picture myself floating away from the earth and everyone involved in those memories forgetting about my existence. i do this every night habitually whenever the memories come back. i feel like there must be a healthier way to get past all these thoughts for good instead of delaying them nightly with a daydream."
1070,Lack of interest in anything.,"Hi everyone. 

I’m wondering if anyone else is experiencing what I’m currently going through and if anyone has any advice. 

I’m thinking the quarantine (US) is finally getting to me as I have officially lost interest in almost everything. This ranges from not caring about work, my hobbies, and even sex. 

I’m fortunately still working and I have a girlfriend I love very much. However, I’m not interested in almost anything and I can’t shake it."
1071,Let me make you a playlist.,"
Howdy y’all, i have been feeling really shit recently and thought I should do another one of these. Here’s the shpiel:

I’ve had depression/anxiety for a long time and after several years of self harm and a suicide attempt, I know the struggle intimately. Music is basically what helps me stay alive from one day to the next. If you’ll let me, I want to make you a spotify playlist so you have something to listen to on the especially hard days, or maybe just days that you need a reminder that somebody cares.  Drop a descriptor for your music taste/what you’d want and maybe a few of your favorite songs and I’ll give you a link to the playlist I make for you :)


Please note: this post will never be closed! Please keep leaving requests! I love fulfilling them. I have crippling depression so if I don’t respond immediately I’m probably sleeping, eating, or taking a 2-hour shower while sobbing :)"
1072,Friendship,"I met my best friend in college. So we've known each other for 4 years now. We have our own circle of friends but we also hang out with just us a lot, almost every day. We are like brothers. My favorite part of our friendship is when he calls me every day on his commute to school, and just talk about random stuffs. We are different majors so we don't have classes in common. Even when school closed because of COVID, he still called me every day. Initially, we went out a lot with the school closure - hiking trails, beaches, etc. But as they start closing, we limit our outdoor activities to jogging in local parks and also start meeting less often - from almost every day to 3-4x/week to once a week.

We also started playing online RPGs together for longer periods of time. like 3-4 hours a day. I am not someone who can sit still for more than an hour or so or else I start having back pain. I need to stand up and stretch a little. My friend doesn't like taking breaks like that. He's a more hardcore gamer than me. So one evening about 3 weeks ago, I told him I'm done for today, that I'll play again tomorrow, and quit the game. He said I could have waited for his response and got upset. We got into an argument. Since then, our friendship has been weird. He has barely called me since then. I feel like there's a distance between me and him now for some reason. Last week, he told me he is going on a road trip and will be MIA for 3 weeks. I didn't believe it and later found out it was a lie. He beat around the bush when I confronted him about this lie. He called me ""disrespectful"" because I confronted him while he is trying to help me with my depression. I have a history of depression and this past weekend, I was in a state of crisis. I texted him that I need him and that I want to talk to him on the phone. He told me I can text him but he is ""not interested"" in talking on the phone. He's aware of my depression and my prior suicide plans (no attempts) in the past. So today, we got into some argument again. I don't know what to do or how to feel. He made it sound like he's texting with me because he's doing me a favor and not from his goodwill, and refused to speak on the phone. I told him soon we both will be in different states and away from family because of job and asked him if our friendship is done. He didn't answer that question. He said I can come to a conclusion of whether or not our friendship is done on my own. This is not our first argument. We've had similar arguments in the past and last year there was a major one (where I did something that could sabotage his career but didn't fortunately). We stopped talking for a few months. We got over it and started hanging out again. So the current situation is nowhere near that level but I am terrified of losing that friendship.

PS: Just wanted to give some background info: I don't have a happy family. I don't live with my family and can't call my family. I am stuck in a shitty studio on my own during the quarantine. The only human for me to interact with on a regular basis is him. I've told him he kept me sane during quarantine and that I'm grateful. It is now made more apparent since we barely talked for 3 weeks. He explained to me that it's because I'm lonely and bored that I'm feeling depressed and that I am going to start working soon and will be occupied and happy again. Maybe true. He has been patient with me and has helped me so many times in the past with my depression, when I'm having episodes, etc. But this weekend, he told me that he would prefer me to be stable and my episodes are something that he doesn't want to deal with. I understand that sometimes in my depressive episodes, I am difficult to deal with. he says that sometimes, I just throw around ""suicidal ideations"" after an argument just to ""blackmail"" him into talking with me right away without giving him space, which is sometimes true. I also have borderline personality disorder so I have intense fear of abandonment and loneliness. For what it's worth, my PCP restarted me on my meds and counseling sessions today. I've been off both for nearly"
1073,"Depression, nightmares, sleep paralysis, bodydismorphia and so much more...","I'm having bad nightmares, I just don't know how to deal with them since they're reoccurring. 
I continue to dream about loosing consciousness and falling in a vigilant state in which I have to fake sleeping, or sometimes I simply succumb to sleep and the moments of clarity becomes fewer and farther inbetween where keeping vigilant just takes up too much energy.
Sometimes I feel like it's actually sleep paralysis and sometimes I can realise it's just a dream within a dream, and these times are actually scarier because I can deduct that this is just my fear of losing my mind coming to the surface. 
This kind of fear could be easily shaken and rationalised if I hadn't a relative with Alzheimer's, for me it's just a depiction of what's probably to come.
I know I wouldn't be like them, I know I would just be a burden to everyone because I'm already, in my ""prime"", completely useless.
So that's why I just assumed that if the time would come there would be more merciful options for me.
But living with what essentially is an expiration date over my head just frankly hasn't been working out too great for me, expecially since a couple of years ago I had a pretty bad health scare.
I ended up being completely fine, but for a moment there I sincerely thought that it would have been it for me, and I don't know if I comoletely recovered mentally from that.
It just made everything else much more clear, so i just ened up cutting all relationships that could possibly being cut in order to just being less.
But in the end I just think that'll make it harder for those that will inevitably continue to be close to me.
Man these are really tough water to navigate you know?
And believe me I know i'm being just extra dramatic, but it always end up being these way in this time of the month... and yes I'm aware of how gross that sounds but man if hormones aren't a bit*h.
Every time all of my mental breakdowns unfolds just in the same ironical way, when my body discover that's once again barren my mind unconsciously goes trough all the crucial steps of why that might be.
Obviously the first one it's always a healthy dose of autocritical body and face shaming, I'm ugly so obviously everyone will won't to stay just as far away from me as it's physically possible.
But then again even base level treats like this evolve in my head to a point where I HAVE to take pictures of my face and compare them to past ones to BE sure I'm not actually devolving into a goblin. 
And once I've worked trough that then there's just an other wave of self scrutiny, why am I so alone? Is it because I really don't want it or is it my way of rationalise the feeling of responsibility and ""self restaint"" the kind that won't let you get a puppy if you work long hours and know you wouldn't have the time to properly take care of them?
And them... i realize for how long I've been thinking things over and over analysing everything questioning even harder my sanity...
Am I just as crazy as I think I am?
I sincery don't know anymore, I just wish it'll all blow over to a point where I can squish this anguish down enough in order to function on a day to day basis like I usual.
But i simply dread the notion that this won't be the end of it, just as things subside they'll flare up again, and is it actually OK to be thinking these even on a regular basis even if way less intensely? Isn't that kinda bad too?"
1074,I Carry A Torch,"Since reducing my dose of Citalopram I've been doing really well. My CBT has helped me deal with issues before they become too big. Yesterday, the feelings of fear and inadequacy came back. I addressed them and today, I'm much better.

I am recovering.

CBT taught me is that my anxiety isn't without cause. I thought I was just wired wrong but actually I was refusing to acknowledge the things I was anxious about and address them. 

My worries would stare at me in the night from dark corners. 

Now I carry a torch.

Do the thing you're scared of and it loses its power over you. It took me 41 years and therapy to work that out.

I am absolutely determined to get my mind working in a way that is helpful to me and I'm prepared to put in the work.

1075,Grieving,"Today’s my mother’s birthday and she passed away two years ago. It’s been hard losing someone you love and even harder during this pandemic without the support of your friends. I feel like I’m just wanting to talk to people but they are too busy or can’t talk at the moment. 

I’ve been feeling alone, and just sadden by these events. I’m also just thinking about how I perhaps shouldn’t depend on people too much. 

I know my mother was a strong woman and gave me so much love and kindness and I give that off to everyone I meet. I think though that being too kind and nice let’s people take advantage of you and for granted.

I really don't understand, I get its not a mental illness or anything but this was the only community I could reach out to, sorry it was so long x"
1079,Am I just going crazy?,"tl;dr - Life is becoming increasingly stressful, nothing ever goes as planned, feels like life is under control by another force, am I just going crazy?  


A friend recommended I go to Reddit for this, so here I go.  A lot of this is rambling but I hope it's legible enough. Back then, I'd be living a semi decent life, no complaints. I was happy. But for some reason, when something good would happen, something terrible would happen later to take its spot. This would continue every day, an example would be me doing good in school, and right out of the jump something dumb would I happen, I'd get in trouble, like I was even in control of my actions, this was a regular occurrence growing up. Everything would be going well, then I'd make a dumb decision out of the blue to ruin it. This has happened as many times as I can count, even onto the present. A recent example is that I had a friend group, I was always seen as the one everyone looks up to, they'd come to me for advice, I'd help them, I was positive and friendly and level headed all the time. I was happy, the happiest I've ever been. Until randomly I started having mental breakdowns, they made me destructive and of course like before, I'd make terrible decisions. Those terrible decisions made me lose them all, I wasn't in control of myself at all I felt. I've never really been someone who's popular or has had too many friends, so this is the first time I really ever had big connections with people, so I guess maybe the responsibility of being the one holding everything up led to the stress of the breakdowns? But I never had problems like this in the past, ever. I never felt in control even once when I  did such things. This led to me regretting those decisions, and what started my sprout of depression. I never got any attention from my family growing up, and like I said, no friends, I was always weird and dumb as a kid for some reason, something to keep in mind. Anyways, after this, I'd always try to amend for how destructive I was towards my friends, but to no avail, because I'd keep repeating the same mistakes. I became distant, and because of my depression I would leave without saying anything, I felt like a nuisance, but because of my loneliness, I would return, this has become a cycle. Nothing ever feels like it's meant to go right for me. So, this has led to me becoming extremely paranoid. I've been wondering if something happened to me to make me this way. Since anytime I would be happy, something would go wrong to ruin that, it gave me some sort of complex. I've started blaming people. I've blamed my parents, I've blamed other people, anyone but myself. I've even started to come to the conclusion that I'm under some sort of government mind control or something, anything that can explain why nothing goes right for me. It feels like my life is under control, like I'm bound to never be happy or successful, like I'm being watched and laughed at as I suffer every day. I genuinely feel like someone has done something to me that controls my decisions to be the worst possible. Anytime I try to make friends, I make enemies, anytime I try to cope, it becomes useless. I used to love and enjoy things like video games, but now I can't bring myself to play them for more than an hour, like I've completely lost interest. I don't read books like I used to,  I just sit in my room all day stressing and overthinking. And I can't get therapy, my mom is against it. This has led me to think my mom is responsible for this, it's made me want to kill her before. I've had the mindset of, ""whoever is doing this to me, I'll kill them, whatever it takes to have control of my life."" I genuinely feel I have lost all control of my life, all control of my decisions. I feel like I'm doomed to fall into the pit that was made for me inside my mind. I feel the only escape is death, but I'm far too afraid to kill myself, my life is a living hell already, I'm not ready to go to Hell. So this leads me to my question. Am I just going crazy? Or is it possible I'm under some sort of control? Is this some sort of mental diagnosis anyone can interpret? Because if so, I would really like help. I'm desperate. Asking strangers on the internet for help desperate."
1080,Any tips or advice on getting your mind to just stop?,"My mind does not shush up, stirs up some overthinking, and just typically focuses on the negative. I literally cannot focus on a whole lot else because I’m just in my horrid thoughts. It gets worse when I try going to sleep, and would just really like it if it could give me some peace.

Any sort of help would be greatly appreciated!"
1081,I have issues with personal connections and a hard time finding a purpose or a meaning on doing something,"It hard for me to become close to someone. It difficult to understand other even if they share the same personality and ideological traits. I barely feel empathy when encountering someone’s negative emotions or difficult situations. I currently going to therapy but I just don’t know the root of why I am this way. I am diagnosed with ADHD, in the Bipolar spectrum, severe anxiety and depression. I feel lost in this reality. I sometimes want a sign or some help finding my true path in life but I can never find the clues or the guides. I struggle getting pass the knowing that I am wasting time doing nothing but being emotional and thinking. I genuinely feel like giving up my life. As much as I find some wonders in our universe/reality, I feel as if I shouldn’t have existed. I have never attempted severe self-harm because I’m afraid of hurting myself badly. I stop worrying about my health and hygiene that whatever bad situation happens, I have simply will accept it even if it’s fatal. My mind in slowly slipping into madness as I wither away in my bed doing nothing and feeling disadvantaged, hopeless, worthless, and emotionless. My therapist is trying their best to help me out and is being very patient with me however I am not letting myself accept the advice and task she gave that can benefit or alleviate some of my issues. It difficult to find that motivation or a meaning behind doing something beneficial or required. I don’t know what to do"
1082,how to deal with no having no family to count on?,"TSIA. I was born and used by my parents as a punching bag and to get at eachothers throats. I've managed so far (23 now!) but the fact I will never have close family to celebrate holidays or achievements, to depend on or w/e is really getting to me. I don't wanna die estranged to my family, and I don't want them to die estranged from me either. I hate thinking about how things will go if I ever get a wife and kids and it makes me feel like there's absolutely no point in living.

How do I deal with this? How have you dealt with things like this?"
1083,gaslighting mother?,"every now and then my mom will have these episodes. (keep in mind, i’m 16 and was removed from her care over a year ago because we moved around too much). she wanted me to come for a sleepover, so i told her to ask my uncle (who i live with now) if i could. she did and he said no, because of the whole virus. she got extremely mad and blew up his phone with angry messages threatening lawyers and stuff. i then called her and she got really mad at me for taking his side. in these episodes she’ll get mad for a bit, then calm down and say she loves me. after this she’ll softly try to get me to go against our family and get mad again if i don’t. i feel terrible. she makes me feel like i lie to her and my family, i genuinely can’t tell if i’m in the wrong or not sometimes. i feel like the bad guy. she will always say things like ‘you never want to see me’ ‘have fun with you new family’ ‘you’re happier without me’ etc. when i really do love her. she’s shown many times that she really cares about me and loves me (it was just me and her up until i was almost 16) but in these instances i feel like complete garbage. i hate feeling stuck in the middle.

TLDR: my mom has extreme up&amp;down episodes and i have no idea how to handle them. it always makes me feel gross. i’m not sure if it could be bpd, manic depression, bipolar, or something. any insight or tips would be appreciated."
1084,Why are therapists like this?,"What's with the constant silence, indifference they always show? Why do they never ask questions or prod or confront you? If I told them something important in one session, why don't they bring it up? Why don't they explain my diagnosis to me?

It's like they're not there. It's so hard to make them react."
1085,Is it depression or am I just lazy?,"I want to start this post off by making it clear that I have actually been diagnosed with depression. 

Anyway. My last post here seven months ago was about a job I had quit. The job was terrible, the constant noise, being cramped in a small space, everything was horrible and I left within a week. 
But that's how most of my recent jobs have been. I stay for no more than two weeks, and then leave because something triggers my mental health to go crazy and I can't handle it anymore. 

I recently got a new job about a month ago. This has been my longest job since I quit a security job about two years ago. I had that job for about two year, but there at the end a bunch of small thins started piling up and I left. 
In the six or so months I was without a job I wasn't doing terrible mentally, I had my moments sure, but things I could easily get through. In fact I would even say I was happy at times because I was looking for a job. I wanted a job because I need money to get my own place so just the thought of ""the future"" had me kind of happy because I have a lot of plans. 
That leads me to getting this new job, I got it and it wasn't bad, I was happy with it up until last night. 
Nothing happened at the job, I don't know what in particular happened, but just seemingly out of nowhere my mental health took a major decline again. I started having suicidal thoughts again, thoughts of wanting to not want to come into work, hoping to get fired. I honestly don't want to be here and kind of want to be fired as stupid as that sounds. 

The job is easy, but suddenly it's started to make my mental health decline. 

I don't want to quit, I need a job, I need money for insurance, but at the same time I really don't know anymore. It seems like every job I get no matter what it is will just make me feel this way."
1086,Experience with psych wards,"I've struggled with bipolar disorder last year and an attempted suicide, so I was admitted ""voluntarily"" to a ward. It wasn't really that bad - I recovered well, felt great after it all ended and overall everything was fine. Recently (since the quarantine) tho, I've been experiencing a horrible sensation of being back at the hospital, bc of the routine of staying all day in pjs inside somewhere I can't leave, and that's been eating me SO much. It also bothers me that I can barely remember the day I was admitted and I don't know how to deal with it. Has anyone had any similar experiences with psych wards? How have you dealt with it?"
1087,The Only Way To End The Pain,"I made a previous post talking about being in love with a girl thats used me and hurts me, but was wanting to get back together. When talking about getting back together, she says that she doesn't want to. I feel like she's mostly giving me a canned ""I don't think I can do a relationship rn"" because I've heard her say that to other people before soon dating others.

At first I was torn, but after about 30 minutes of bawling I calmed myself down and had the ""fuck that bitch, I'm not letting her get me down"" attitude. But I slept for a bit and I feel awful now. I have a handful of Hydrocodone and I think if I washed down all of them it might be enough to kill me, but I am having second thoughts. I just want to feel something again, something other than awful. I wish I could make her understand how fucking bad I feel, but I don't think she'll ever understand."
1088,The phenomenon of parents dismissing mental problems,"I'd like this post to start a discussion and give you some food for thought. 
I have read a lot of posts here and also came in contact with many young people struggling with mental health issues during my education. What I've noticed is that in many cases, such issues come underdiagnosed and untreated because whenever a child opens up to the closest person in their life, they hear ""you're overreacting, get a hold of yourself"", ""you're looking for problems where there are none, get back to work and stop looking for excuses"", ""you've always been moody"", ""no, you're not, depression looks much worse"", "" it's because you're not going to church!!!!!111"" etc. etc.
Why does this happens? Is this denial, fear that they failed as a parent and them trying to assure themselves that everything's allright? In some cases, it's literally shaming a kid into thinking them feeling bad is egotistical. The worst case I've encountered is a girl who most likely had depression with psychosis and instead of being taken to a doctor, was told it's a God's punishment for her sins."
1089,"New intrusive thought, never experienced this before","So in my past I've struggled with depression, self loathing and self harm but after an extensive bout of counselling all three dampened significantly.

I'm currently in a situation with absolutely no control - I'm living with my fiancé's parents and the place is filthy, the food is terrible and I have no privacy. I can feel myself slipping backwards. I've been out of work for 8 weeks now thanks to coronavirus and I can't visit friends or family. I've put on a significant amount of weight leading to new stretch marks and I can feel my attitude showing up in my words which is undeserved. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I'm being kept here, safe and fed, but as the stress mounts up the lack of control and privacy is building up.I've also been procrastinating my MSc dissertation which isn't great. 

However, for the past few days I've been plagued with a continuous single intrusive thought - namely, taking a pair of nail clippers to my teeth and cutting them. I've never had intrusive thoughts before and its driving me insane. I keep sitting down to finish my dissertation and these thoughts keep pinging into my head disturbing my train of thought.

What could this be? Is this a new symptom of depression or something else? Its stopping me from switching off and its very upsetting."
1090,Do you think talking about mental health problems when it comes to anxiety and depression is still stigmatized in the Western World particularly in the United States?,"In my early teens around middle school time, I did have a severe case of depression and I actually needed medication for it. I was actually dismissed from school because of my depression and borderline suicidal tendencies. Now that I am older and I will continue to face different issues ahead, I always felt that I was the only person back in middle school that went through such a period of depression.

 I have noticed especially in more recent years that people are becoming more vocal about discussing anxiety and depression where it doesn't seem to be as looked down as negatively compared to when I was in middle school. I feel as if just ten to fifteen years ago, talking about anxiety and depression was super taboo and should be hidden from everyone. Nowadays when I see people in their mid to late 20's talking about taking antidepressants, I don't feel like the issue I had when I was in middle school are stigmatized anymore. I don't actively take antidepressants but I do seek therapy every now and then. It's not like I don't feel anxiety or depression anymore, I still do go through that today and I will probably continue to do so but ways to cope with it are going to evolve when I continue to face different situations in life. Looking at today, do you think Americans and the Western society as a whole still stigmatizes and looks down on people who are going through anxiety and depression? in the context of different cultures, some cultures (South Asian in particular) actively discourage talking about mental health issues. Our challenges may be more different because of sensitive issues like racism or xenophobia that many of us have faced. As a whole, mental health issues in the context of minorities is a different ball game in and of itself because as minorities, we do face slightly different experiences growing up."
1091,I am stuck truly,"It’s very very early, so I’m so sorry if this doesn’t come off as coherent. 

Right now I am 17 F, Ever since I was 12 I’ve “had” depression as in I went to the mental hospital and they told me I was depressed, I swear I caused this all, like I used to have friends and they were actually depressed and I told myself I needed to fit in, and so it started being sad all the time, c*tting, now I still don’t feel like I have depression because I only get really down when I’m on my period, but that’s when Im the most down, I have an awful problem with c*tting myself, like everytime something happens to me my mind just tells me to cut, it’s all it wants to do, I talk myself out of it but there are some times where I do, my mom knows about this all. She blames my dad, and I don’t wanna seem like I’m telling my life story or anything but like he is a accused child molester and so my mom kicked him out. My dad left when I was 12 because hes been accused of being a child molester(not by law), I feel like I’m so desensitized to topics like this, I know this is serious, but my mind doesn’t think it is. I have had s*icidal thoughts, recently and all. I don’t want to feel like people are out to get me, or I’m annoying, or people think I say certain things for attention. I’m not, I need help, I want it, I would love to have a therapist but my mom doesn’t believe in depression and all of that she says it’s an excuse, she knows about my c*tting too, she yells at me whenever she finds out because she doesn’t understand. I just want to feel like I just as important as everyone else is. Ik im preaching to the choir idk I’m sorry"
1092,becoming more and more paranoid and negative about everything.,"hello, i hope everyone is having a nice day!!
so i don't know if it's because of quarantine, trauma, family problems or so but i'm literally going crazy. i have been very worried and doubting everything in a negative way lately and i wasn't like this at all before. i am living with my mom and alcoholic stepdad (my mom stopped drinking because of weight stuff) and whenever my stepdad is drunk, which is quite often, they always fight badly and he even gets physically abusive to my mom, this has been happening for 5 years but i am getting paranoid now. like whenever they fight, i am like, ""what if he comes to my room??"" and i lock myself in my room. but he has never come my room before. (but of course this is a possibiliy and this is just an example)
i have a very important exam for entering uni next month, even though i am doing well now i always think ""but what if i can't do it???"", ""what if the exam is so difficult this year???"" and it's like im forcing myself to fail...
even when there is nothing wrong with people around me, i keep thinking they hate me or something just because they have been silent for a while or so. like with my partner, i often think he is cold when he isn't and i always ask him what's wrong and he is like nothing and i'm like ""but you're cold and you're not telling me why!! i'm sorry if i did something"" and he gets super annoyed lol
and a lot more things similar to this. i am becoming very tired mentally, i just want to cry all the time but i can't stop those thoughts. at the same time i am relapsing from my eating disorder for the 100th time and also at the same time i have to study like crazy and i'm SO. TIRED. 
just wanted this off my chest i guess, thank you for reading ❤️"
1093,I asked for help instead of cutting myself,"I was having a really bad day yesterday and by the evening I really wanted to harm myself. But instead, I called the staff where I live and told them that I have razors and wanted to cut. So she came out to me and took the razors and we sat and talked for an hour. So now I still haven’t harmed myself since middle of April"

1096,I could only identify with extreme versions of myself (Cross-post),"Hi, all. The following entry is a somewhat lengthy product of self-assessment.

I once internally reveled at the assessment of a former therapist years ago of me being an extremist. I used that label to help justify my binge drinking, obsessive gambling, all-or-nothing mentality and my workaholic tendencies, etc. 

I could not tolerate the moderate self-assessment. I either had to feel depressed or zombified -- which was a vast majority of the time as I identify more so as "" someone with vulnerable narcissism -- or elated in my internalized grandiose self. That feeling of being a mostly unrecognized highly artistic and likely ""super-genius"" that hasn't had his moment of glory; which perhaps compounded my and/or contributed top my ongoing dysthymia. All of these extreme notions of self affirmed my grandiose visions of myself. Either I was the best -- who often was treated unfairly, yet, otherwise deserved excessive praise and admiration -- or the worst out of gross negligence or capitulation due to not trying hard enough or disinterests or frankly from actually, likely, having concentration deficits (which I couldn't bothered have been tested for ADHD - inattentive as it would be too much of an inconvenience for the preced exceptional life that I have been living). I would always manipulate my interpretation of any circumstance with the narrative of extremism. Intellectualizing everything served to remove me from living an active lifestyle; however, it provided a rich internal storyline for me to adhere to and identify with. Ironically, I am quite sub-par in many cases and performances, be it work history, relationships, or self-care, etc. As long as I could intellectually account for being on either end of the extreme -- preferably the best, often with the use of tortured logic -- than that's all that mattered; I had to compensate a rationale to justify my being and affirm my self-worth; otherwise, I would be a near nothing, a less than mediocre person, which is less than being abysmally worthless. For, at least being ""abysmally worthless"" was an extreme in an of itself; a stark contrasting position versus being in the grayness of the mediocre range. 

This framework is quite delusional on my part and effectively debilitating, bringing about the worst and most pathetic versions of myself. I have only recently realized the devastating appraisal of how being an extremist truly is and how it has positioned me to being essentially destitute, which sadly is an extreme field to be in, anyhow.

I reflect on the countless fruitful and gainful opportunities that I have encountered in my life from schooling, to career opportunities, to possibly rich and wonderful personal relationships. But, I couldn't be bothered with actually embracing these potentialities as there might develop a challenge with the possibility of failure, which might compromise my self-appraisal as the best and greatest; and why challenge my status as the exceptional extremist anyhow. It would be devastating to my ego and make it nearly impossible to approach life from a seemingly grounded stance. No, I thought, ""it iss much better"" to delusionally go through life's encounters with an extreme assessment of self and life's encounters; to revel at the assessments of others as being an enigma, or intellectual, or ""extremist"". This provided a background and opportunity to perceive myself as special and unique and lofty, above all others. Such a sad existence - afraid and deluded to self-explore and discover to live a thoroughly fulfilling life. 

I feel as though I have wasted and squandered the potentially best moments and opportunities of my life.

I lived through the early praises of my mother and other family members; perhaps, the promise of redemption to their, respectively, mediocre lives. I received praise early on in life for my academic prowess, athletic abilities and intellectualization, etc. I essentially gave up when I felt the challenges become too great and difficult and resigned myself to self-delusions and rationalizations of greatness rather than frankly trying my hardest and giving my best efforts and making transparent assessments and self-improving. The praises from family went away and essentially, I was left with nothing but the superficiality of my looks and external materialism to affirm my self-worth - most of which have faded over time, anyhow. I suppose I never felt inherently unworthy of love and acceptance for 'just being myself' and always had to cover around external things such as athletic performance or my looks or workmanship to receive validation and stabilize my sense of self. I grew up around others with more grandiose narcissistic traits and often based my self-esteem on how I assessed their appraisal of me. I desired their validation; which often led to a push-and-pull dynamic of being deemed worthy and worthless. I grew to look for this validation in others as an extension of the relationship dynamics that I recognized in my childhood. I could never be deemed fully inadequate and, perhaps, I internalized this and even applied it to others when ""evaluating"" them. I realize this is a disturbingly gross way to embrace another human being and can lead to bigotry and inferiority and superiority complexes. This validation became incessant and constantly necessary, by my internal evaluation or external ""supply"", to continue in life with an albeit unstable sense of self. 

I, too, assess others as being good or bad, black and white and try to attach myself to them to enhance and improve my sense of self. These appraisals are inconsistent and are subject to change, in relation to my evaluation of them relative to myself. 

From here, I'll strive to be my authentic self and relate to people and simply be true to myself based on what I value and what I think is right and worthwhile. For most of my life I have hidden and essentially rejected myself - whether it be my perceived state of mediocrity or my weight or my baldness or my lack of adequate resources. I am not certain as to how to go about 'living'. My past strategy of the extremist versions of myself are unsustainable and unfortunate. I feel immensely inadequate and shameful and remorse essentially for my life up to now. Most people seem to have a stable sense of self which leads to self-acceptance; this notion seems utterly foreign to me. I feel like a generic human being with a blank canvas, having experienced nothing significant over my rather extensive lifetime. I missed the enlightening and profound moments and experiences which make life wonderful. Instead, I thrived on living in the extreme encounters of life through alcohol which simulated my encounters and experiences as deep and emotionally penetrating and to actually feel comforted like a feeling being. 

I have and will seek out therapy. I have looked extensively online for self-help resources on dealing with narcissism, especially vulnerable narcissism, and there doesn't seem to be much to meet me where I'm at. However, I am equipped with this self-knowledge and will strive to be my preferred version of myself. I recognize that a part of me wants this process to be easy and seamless, however, that is unlikely to be my ongoing reality which up to this point has been filled with self-loathing and self-marginalization and a mindset of superiority. There is a lot of processing to evaluate and comprehend how I got to this point and to chart a path of progression. 

Thanks. Any insights are appreciated. Have a wonderful day and wonderful life."
1097,How do you tell the difference between a mental illness and someone just having a weak/poor attitude and mindset towards life,"For example depression, I'm not here to say depression isnt a thing. But I know some people who claim to be in depression when they say failed a test and then refuse to do any work to improve because they are depressed"
1098,Emptiness,"hi guys, I'm a 18 years old guy and like a half year ago I went through a break up that really destroyed me. I moved on her and now I see how happy she is with her new one.. I don't want her back, I'll never want this. But I feel really empty sometimes. In our relationship, I was the one crying, being treated like a girl just because I didn't want her to leave me. I could endure anything just for her to not leave. (sorry if my english is bad).  
And after some time she left me, because ""I say that i love her too often, I'm suffocating, I'm jealous"".. The thing is we had an one year relationship in which she told me every day ""Don't worry I love you so much I'll never give up on us.""  
After the first break up I started ignoring her and she judged me so hard for that. Like I was doing it just for her to suffer. But I did that for me to heal.. I couldn't see her anymore.  
and after that, we went back together for a couple of days, then she cheated on me at a party after saying ""Don't worry, I couldn't do something bad for us.""  
Like I said, I moved on all of these, but I still feel something. Not for her, but for the fact that she made so much bad things to me. She put me in my first depression and now I see her on social media being happy..?  
I started making music and this was something that helped me a lot. But after some time everything I want to do becomes boring. Why?.. every single thing I try in my life becomes boring. I really want to make music again, but it's something that holds me back. Every thing I used to do became boring. I don't know how can I change my perspective, my  mentality.. anything.."
1099,"I'm 16, everyday I tell myself like 25 times a day ""One more time, I'm gonna kill myself"" ""One more time, Suicide"" ""I will never do it again"" ""last one and that's it"" ""hanging"" or ""hanging hanging"" or as much times I say it until I have right thoughts and images READ BELOW","(imagening how hanging would feel on my neck with closed eyes, then with open eyes) it's very good imagening ecpesially after I attemped Suicide by hanging, I don't have just this obsessions and compulsions, I have a lot of different, I have OCD since 12 and other mental disorders, I have noone, I feel very bad, I wants friends...... I'm going to USA next year, but in 1 and a half years Suicide is likely because everything goes worse

1101,Tired of feeling like there's something wrong with me,"I keep having these catastrophic thoughts that I can't get rid of, but it seems like because I'm not putting myself or anyone else in danger, and can identify that these thoughts are my brain blowing things out of proportion, the mental health services in my country (UK) aren't taking me seriously. Each day is getting harder and it's putting strain on my friendships/relationship. I just want to feel normal again."
1102,I’m afraid to go back into society,"Since I’ve been in isolation I’ve gotten used to being alone more than before and I met someone the other day for a few minutes and I started shaking from anxiety. Now we are going back to school bit by bit and I’m terrified. Tomorrow is my first day back and even before all of this I had trouble going out. 
I need to find a psychiatrist and go on meds... but I get scared and stop looking for one. Anyone feel this way?"
1103,Is this a concerning level of self-consciousness?,"I've pretty much dealt with this since the end of time but I've been really noticing it the past week. I'm self-conscious to a point where sometimes I can't even show my face to other people, the thought of imagining them looking at me freaks me out so I end up ignoring them. This happens moreso in the evenings where my meds crash, and I don't feel comfortable talking to my family anymore. Everything I do makes me worry to an excessive degree, thinking 'am I doing this right' and always doubting or having no faith in my work. Not only that, but I'm riddled with these thoughts of cringy events in the past, but whenever the memory appears, my body does some sort of reaction. Like a tic, I'll blurt out something or my body will spasm. My mood itself fluctuates, there are moments where I feel not just happy, but euphoric - it sucks because I end up chasing the feeling afterwards and often fall back into depressive moments. Basically head full, too many thoughts, it prevents me from doing work and socialising. What's up? Is this normal? Particularly the tic thing, I don't understand that at all."
1104,I got out of bed today...,"When this lock-down first started, I was one of many people preaching about how structure was important,  how establishing a routine would be the best way to pass the time, and maybe even look to better ourselves in some way? 

However, it soon became abundantly clear to me that the only thing that was important was one thing; **survival**. Not in a dramatic end of the world post-apocalyptic manner, just simply appreciating that whatever it takes to get through each day is all that really matters. 

I am someone who has an ever-evolving love-hate relationship with social media. I welcome and take joy in its positivity, but only when it's genuine. I love that it can be a tool to allow us to connect and share, especially in times like these when actual contact seems like a distant memory. However, when you strip away all the celebrity attention seeking, the latest 'nomination' videos, and ‘Daily Mail’ propaganda, you are left with very little of any substance. It is all to easy for us to try and compare ourselves to the fake version of other people’s lives. Social media is not real life.

So, here is my take... EVERYONE has 'something' in their life that they wish was better. Everyone is a little jealous of someone else, in some form. No one's life is as good as they make out. We all have challenges of some nature. Yes, some people's challenges are bigger than others, many are able to manage and balance those challenges, whilst others might need some additional support. Some people are able to reach out and ask for help, whilst many will suffer in silence. Some challenges will be fleeting, or circumstantial, some will have grown over time.

Please don’t get me wrong, we can’t always be selfish in every decision we make, and do have to consider others, but there is something to be said for the inability to love others, until we truly love ourselves. Sometimes we do need to be selfish, to make sure we are the best versions of ourselves that we can be, and then build from this, if possible. Although it might be a life-long path to fulfilment. But the ability to see that path is what is important?

The solidarity that the country has shown in recent months is one to be proud of. We are all keen to donate to the worthy causes, to clap our front-line workers, or even pop to the shop to pick up some groceries for an elderly neighbour. However, maybe let’s all take a step back and acknowledge that we are in unprecedented times, and should not be afraid to ask for help if needed. Obviously, it goes without saying that once lock-down finishes, our ability to ask for help for stops, I’m just saying that with everything that is going, there is less distraction in our day to day lives, less ability to ‘escape’, but also a greater sense of solidarity that should not be underestimated.

Alternatively, if you feel in control of where you are (mentally rather than physically), maybe take a second to have a think about those people on your friends list who may have gone a bit quiet lately? Drop them a message, just to see if they are 'okay'? No harm can come of a simple ‘How’s it going?’, and I for one can testify how important this can be.

Mental Health awareness is something that periodically makes the headlines when a celebrity loses their fight against the dark, but let's not let people get into these situations in the first place. 

As I said, I started this lock-down full of ambition, full of naivety. Unaware that I had a few things going on in my mind that I had ignored for too long. I exercised daily, I started my online course, I played music... Fast forward a few weeks and I was struggling. I was anxious constantly, unable to sleep, lost in my own mind. I felt terrible for not achieving my 'list' of daily goals. It felt like a spiral that I was very quickly losing control against. 

Then, slowly, with the support of some good people, it began to dawn on me that I can't control everything. That not achieving my goal list each day is not a failure. That the only goal of each day was simple: get through it in whichever way I can. I start with the little things, and hope that the rest follows. Some days it works, some it doesn't. But the target is not to focus on the days it didn’t, knowing that tomorrow is another chance for me to succeed.

Goal one for each day was, and still is to get out of bed, have a shower and make my bed. Sounds easy; but there have been days in the not so distant past that I felt incapable of this. I found that by starting my day, feeling clean, and making my bed detracts from the temptation to get back into that bed. This is my foundation. One that I build upon, each and every day. Then I re-focus on other small goals, eat three proper meals a day, use my allotted exercise quota to seek some fresh air... I could go on, but I won't, as there is no solution that fits all. 

I don't have all the answers, and I know that I am fighting an ongoing personal challenge, one that has been with me longer than I like to admit, but somewhat highlighted during this period. I simply wanted to illustrate that **it's okay not to be okay**. We are not infallible, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this.

Please reach out if you feel unable to take on these challenges alone, if not to me, then to someone, anyone. You will be surprised who is there for you. Or if you feel strong enough, you can be the one to check on that person you suspect might appreciate your help, despite what it say's on their Facebook page...

1105,Anyone else always nauseated?,"I’m sure this isn’t the best place to post it. 

However, I have bipolar, anxiety/panic disorder. Anyone with mental health issues knows the feeling of unexplained nausea. But what about daily?

I have been having daily nausea for years now. Meds have changed so it’s most likely not that. My nausea ruins my life a lot too. Also, nothing helps. Any/everything over the counter is a no. Ive talked to doctors before and they always seem to shrug it off or recommend OTC.

Literally the only thing that helps is weed. Usually kicks it right out. But i don’t like to drive or go to work high. I just don’t like it, for me. So days like today, i spent a 12 hour shift miserable. 

I didnt smoke for like 8 months when i moved back home bc my bf always got our stuff. And in that time i lost like 35-40 pounds and i think it was a combo of things, but a big part was me being nauseated all the time, affecting my ability to eat. 

My question, does anyone also deal with severe nausea? If so do you have a prescribed medicine? What helps? 

I can’t deal anymore."
1106,Mimicking personalities and quirks.,"I am not sure where else to post this. 

It feels like I don't have my own personality. The concept of self is a blur. And what I did for my future is only what society intended. 

My interests and hobbies copied from my peers only because those were what is acceptable and 'normal.'

I am called smart by my family because of my 'vast' knowledge of things. Even though all I know are surface level stuff, the basic of basics. Random and trivial knowledge from books popularized by being a source of entertainment. 

I had just realized these things because of this pandemic and having more time with myself. I could only recall doing what I remember what others do in social activities. And it is outside of my 'established self' - the character I portray as in public.

Anyone else have a problem with the concept of 'self?'

I am diagnosed with persistent depression and general anxiety, if it helps."
1107,Everything I want to say but can’t,"I tried to cut myself again last night. It took a weight off my heart, but I feel guilty. I promised close friends I’d never do it again, and though my pocket knife is so blunt I might as well have attempted to give myself papercuts with a wet newspaper, it still feels bad I tried, and that it felt good. 

I did a pretty good job tucking away all my bad feelings the past while, but I can feel it slipping out and it worries me. 

Last year, I attempted therapy. I went to see my doctor, cried in the office, and got sent away to see some guy a few months later. It ended after a few weeks when he told me to tell people I didn’t want to tell, because it was important. I felt uncomfortable with it and didn’t really want to, but I agreed to try. I couldn’t do it, and the week after, I tried again. After a while of this, he told me to tell and email him before the weekend, or I wouldn’t have to contact him again. So, I emailed him something that was technically true, had another session, but it felt bad and I called off the next session and never spoke to him again. 
I’m still not sure if it my fault or his, if me disobeying him was a bad thing and showed I wasn’t really invested in getting better and not worth the effort, or if I was in the right for not doing something that felt bad and wrong. I explained it to him, but he didn’t seem to think it was a good enough excuse. 
This was in a period of my life when I opened up about issues I was having, and after having a terrible time after quitting therapy, I put everything back in its tightly locked box in my brain and left it there and tried to get on with my life. 

So then, ending up at last night. I feel miserable, unmotivated, sad, it gets worse every day, and I don’t know what to do. Sorry for the messy writing. 

My therapist thought I had depression for sure, but he wasn’t willing to keep me around long enough to get a real diagnosis. He put me on antidepressants, but those were canceled when he kicked me out. I was suicidal last year and planning suicide, which he knew about. Feels bad. 

So yeah. Thanks for reading, if you managed to get through all that."
1108,Insecure to the core,"Hey, I suffer from severe anxiety and I feel deeply insecure when talking to women.
Parents and friends cant help me so Im asking for help.

I have to explain the causes first.
I was insecure my whole life, never knew why but I think its because the relation to my parents is bad and Ive always been an akward bystander.
I met a cute girl in college, we spent some time together and I had a huge crush on her. She gave me insane hints and she liked me for sure.
When I asked her out for a date, she didnt said no but that she goes on vacation for a week.
After that week she uploaded a new picture on her profile. With a well trained latino with a sixpack.
This broke me and I didnt knew how to handle it.
Two weeks later I met her in a bar and she acted like shes waiting for me to do sth.
I was so confused and changed my subject in class.
Because I didnt knew how to handle my feelings and being deeply insecure my social life went down.
I even became sociophobic, I had the worst year of my life.

November last year, I finally put my self together and started to change.
I started nofap, exercising on regular basis, changed my diet and tried to socialise more.
It went upwards.

In december I came across that girl again.
She acted like she waited for me all the time and I fell for it. I never really got over her.
Early this year I decided to go for it and surprise her after an exam. She had a tinder date sitting right next to me. At 11am. This might be even funny for some.
But this broke me to the core, even worse than last time.

My friends told me to just keep my head up and move forward.
Dont get me wrong, I got over her immediately.
But now Im incredibly insecure talking to any girl, altough I look quite good and have average social skills in general. Too insecure to start sth at all. 
Its ridiculous and I dont know how to help myself.
There is girl from highschool I really like and Im 100percent sure she is interested. But Im just too insecure to ask her out now. Im likely to fail because I cant open up and unable to explain what happend to me outta nowhere. I will lose her. And I dont see what I can do about it. Im even more insecure in texting because I dont have immediate reaction or eye contact. But I dont know where she is so texting seems to be the onyl way and she is waiting for me to do sth.

Im doing great on nofap and will continue for the rest of my life, well trained but insecure to the core.
It might get better over time when I just socialise.
But losing this girl just because of this is so sad, it will make me even more emotionally crippled than I already am. Do you guys have any advice?"
1109,Is it possible to have paranoid schizophrenia worries within your OCD,Thanks
1110,I Carry A Torch,"Since reducing my dose of Citalopram I've been doing really well. My CBT has helped me deal with issues before they become too big. Yesterday, the feelings of fear and inadequacy came back. I addressed them and today, I'm much better.

I am recovering.

CBT taught me is that my anxiety isn't without cause. I thought I was just wired wrong but actually I was refusing to acknowledge the things I was anxious about and address them. 

My worries would stare at me in the night from dark corners. 

Now I carry a torch.

Do the thing you're scared of and it loses its power over you. It took me 41 years and therapy to work that out.

I am absolutely determined to get my mind working in a way that is helpful to me and I'm prepared to put in the work.

#MentalHealthAwarenessWeek"
1111,Annoyed by everyone,"This isn't about my own mental health, it is about my girlfriend who I'm trying to help.

She has recently opened up about aspects of her personality beyond her control that she finds makes her unhappy. These all have to do with social interaction. 

The main thing she said is that when alone, she feels fine, but if she has someone over she is constantly worrying about where they are and what they are doing and it prevents her from relaxing and enjoying their company.

She says that very minute things that people do differently will annoy her, such as putting something back in it's place the wrong way.

She also said that when she has to move things because of company, for example unplugging her charger to bring to the other room to watch a movie with someone, also really irritates her internally.

These things lead to a constant back and forth in her head of being annoyed, and thinking she's a bad person for being annoyed at such small things.

I'm trying to help her find some kind of solution or path to go down to work to fix or soothe this. My thoughts are that it could be a form of mild OCD or perhaps something to do with her anxiety. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I'd like to know where we should be heading."
1112,i don’t know what to do.,"
i’m really struggling with staying positive and being happy with my current circumstances. i’ve got a long history of mental illnesses, and it’s decided to play around with me again a little bit recently. It’s not as bad as it’s previously been, but my mind space is of course not the best. Fortunately, i have managed to stay safe and keep myself out of trouble this time around. However, my family members (mainly my mother) have been stressing me out a lot. They are the main contribution to my horrible mind space. They aren’t at all abusive, just infuriating to deal with at times. I have come to the conclusion that it would most likely do me some good to stay out of the house for a little bit and take a breather. The issue is that I’m just a teenager, and i don’t have any friends. So, i have no clue where i could possibly stay. I wouldn’t dare run away, my parents would have to know about where i am so that they know i’m safe. Does anybody have any ideas as to generic places that would help me other than the psychiatric ward? Thank you. 

(also i live in Queensland, Australia if that helps)"
1113,Back to work,"Tomorrow my store reopens after 4 weeks due to the virus. I am shit scared. The last 4 weeks have been the best, stress free time of my life. I struggle with the ever changing targets and the fucked up micromanaging. I'm on the verge of a panic attack every damn day at work and I want to leave. When I try to talk to my family about it I always get the same response "" U just have to deal with it, it's part of being an adult.  Just push through"". I'm being treated like I'm just lazy and I don't want to work. I do want to work, just not for them. I feel like I'm going crazy."
1114,What do I tell my therapist.,"Hello, I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts and almost attempted it several times throughout these last weeks. My therapist calls me once a week but she has no clue what I’m going through. I really want to tell her but I fear that she will tell my parents. They are going through a hard time and also struggling with their relationship, physical and mental health and I really think this is the last thing they want to hear. I am very confused right now, please tell me what should I do. Is there any way to convince her not to tell them?"
1115,The power of the mind.,"Fair warning this will probably be a long post but I hope it can help someone dealing with self esteem or confidence issues in some way. 

I’ve always been a reserved person and never had a whole lot of confidence in myself, in fact to a degree I’ve always kind of disliked myself in some way. 
In high school at around age 16 or so I adopted the tactic of self deprecating humour in an attempt to protect myself from bullying. My mindset was “you can’t hurt me if I’ve already hurt myself”
I’d point out and joke about my insecurities and things I hated about myself as I know a lot of people do in this age of edgy and self deprecating humour that is so popular. 

Fast forward 5 or 6 years to now. I’m 21 and have the worst self esteem I’ve ever had and I find that there are days I genuinely hate myself. 
All these years of trying to protect myself from being hurt has tricked my brain into believing all that awful stuff I’ve said about myself, this has just caused more and more problems including the destruction of a 3 year relationship. 
The other day I fully lost myself and had a breakdown and this is where things start to turn around. 
Enter NF, a popular hip hop artist who I’ve listened to for years and felt a strong connection with his music but this one day a particular verse hit me differently and more powerfully than ever before. 
It goes 
“The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith”

I finally realised the reason I’m so miserable and down on myself all the time is because I taught my brain that’s how I need to feel
I wish I could sit here and say I’m perfect now but I can’t, it’s only been a few days but I think I’ve finally figured out how to better myself as a person. It seems so obvious to me now but I suppose when you’re in such a clouded mindset for so many years you just can’t see things clearly. 

I hope this can somehow help at least one person change the way they think about themselves for the better. 

TLDR; self deprecating jokes, while they can be hilarious, are also dangerous. Use them sparingly if at all."
1116,Is it possible to get depression from lockdown?,"I have never had any mental health issues before, so I have no idea what is going on and I could be way wrong, but I have just been overly emotional lately, and crying for no reasons and just overall getting upset over everything. My fiance works away from home every 2 weeks and I have just been feeling more alone than usual. 

I have no idea what is going on but at time point I am just tired of everything and have no energy for anything. I am not physically tired, just mentally drained from everything. 

I have hypothyroidism and have recently got my dosage increased. I know it is not that because my meds give me insomnia, not emotional. 

I just had my period so I don't know if it is from that but I've never been that emotional around my period before. I just don't know what going on and I am sick of feeling like this. It is causing strains in my relationship because I'm taking things the wrong way and getting upset."
1117,~ ugh ~,"I'm so, so tired. I have barely any motivation to do schoolwork. I need to improve in maths and it's not THAT bad bc the exam is next month and apparently it'll be online and multiple-choice but still... im sorry, this post is gonna be a bit of a mess prolly (just like all my other posts here ûwû)

Basically at this school ive been going to for like half a year now, i have seven subjects. my spanish teacher lets me not attend lessons bc im a fluent speaker so its basically just an easy pass for exams. PE, ok, sure, yay fitness and health. geography and biology are Just There. those two can be a drag but... sure, whatever. I have to meet the minimum amount of subjects. German, no offence to speakers of said language, ranges from mild enjoyment to pain. Idk ive been doing some research about The School System and apparently, the way languages are taught in school isn't appropraite bc they're taught as subjects and not skills. But whatever, englisch ist mein lieblingsfach am i right?? anyway, then we have English, which is my favourite subject... i want to be an actor and a writer so this may be a Somewhat Useful Subject. I like it more when it's ""write this story"" than ""answer questions about this text"" but it can also feel restricting for my creativity when it's ""write a story with a maximum of 350 words"" but i usually just write 500 and my teacher doesn't care. yay. then we have maths... the subject renowned for being painful to the mind (and literally no adult does anything about it)... like i said, maths isn't that great. we were doing geometry, just angles and stuff, and it was kind of easy. As a result, i mildly started to enjoy maths. As a result, we started doing a different topic in class. 

The fact that maths and several other subjects won't help us in the future REALLY takes a lot of motivation out of it for me. Why should I feel motivated in these subjects when I just know it'll cause me mental pain and no benefits in my future? I'm literally writing a book series about a talking taxi and her friends, a socially anxious police car, a concrete mixer with abandonment trauma etc. (please don't ask. i mean, if you want...). why do i need to know about tourism in Ecuador or how to plug in random numbers to graph an equation. it just makes me sad. For some reason, lately I've come up with things to do that are anything but doing work. Like, I do it in the end for the most part but... yeah. It also annoys me how two of my teachers BARELY used to give us any work but have used online school as an excuse to give us work for every lesson. Not that bad but it's kind of questionable in my opinion. I've talked about my writing, now acting: i have an interest in it for sure. I've never done anything professional but if I were to, you don't even need any qualifications,,, you get cast in a role because you're a good actor, not because you have whatever diploma. Like, I do want to go to university to study acting but I also DON'T want to go through two more years of school to get to that stage (i'm 16 next month). Just this morning I was thinking about how I've still got SO much more work to get through and it depresses me. I don't like saying stuff like this when I don't have an official diagnosis, but I really feel depressed.  


And another thing, I've mentioned before on this subreddit about life at home here with my parents. I wouldn't call them Awful and Toxic™ but idk... being around them kind of makes me sad. Here's a story from last month:

I won't go too much into detail but basically, my dad had to go do the shopping, then he came back and said he had to go back to the supermarket because he had to leave a bag behind bc it was all too heavy. Idk how things escalated so quickly and i honestly feel like i was being irrational, but next thing i know im sitting breathing heavily sort of and crying out ""no pls dont go"" or whatever yeah, and my mum comes and hugs me and my dad is shouting and my mum is defending me and then he hit her on the back like twice, literally reaching over me with his arm to reach her (the next day: ""oh i was just pushing her""). so yeah, then i ran to my room and tried to slam the door but he got there too soon and i was forced to keep it open. my mum went into their room. so i was in my room and i wanted to get away from my dad so like, my bed is in the corner of the room so i moved it, so i was in the corner and my dad tried to get to me but i didnt want him to so i pushed my bed to him and he literally flipped it completely upside down, i dont really remember if it made, like, a big noise but idk. if i was closer it prolly wouldve landed on me lol. so then  my dad was going back and forth and i was really anxious about the virus and stuff and at one point i was just sobbing my heart out and despite Dad calling me ridiculous or whatever, i was just praying to God that we would be fine and everything. My faith helps me a lot in stuff like that (or like, in general, nothing like this situation happened after that). so anyway, at one point i was in another corner, now on the floor (forgot to add, my dad sort of manhandled me like i was facing the wall and he grabbed me and i feel like he literally wanted to hug me after that, idk remember but that would be weird. This was an inappropriate place to mention this; i will add, i sat down on the floor voluntarily lol). so my dad was going back and forth between his and mum's room and mine yelling at us both. so when he was out of mine i locked my door (Mum had already done the same) but my dad from what i heard was acting like he was unwell, idk if this was true. so i opened the door. but then when he left my room again i was v distressed, so i opened my window and yelled ""HELP!"" and to this day, my dad is so cross with me for having done that because he could have been arrested and lost his job (he said once that the fact i did this was worse than him having hit Mum but he says he didn't mean that or something). How did he not get arrested and lose his job, you ask? Let me tell you!

Well, when this stuff happens and we're shouting, my dad continually goes to the front door to look through the peephole thing to see if there's anyone outside and APPARENTLY, there were some police officers outside there at one point but idk if he said that just so i shut up. but after i yelled out of the window, they had to come for sure. i actually remember seeing a woman down there so maybe she called them, idk. So yeah some police officers came, not five, not ten, but four police officers came to our door and my dad had to answer them, and they probably would have thrown him on the floor and handcuffed him apparently if he didn't tell them he's a diplomat. SO i just prayed that everything would be ok and no one would get arrested so our futures aren't ruined. then, i sneaked past and fixed everything up in the living room bc i had knocked over some stuff when i got angry earlier. then i went back to my room and then attempted to sneak out again but this time one of them saw me (the entrance/exit to my room can be seen from the front door) so this really tall police officer asks me to come. and so we have to lie that i was putting a new bottle of soap in the shower area thing and slipped because i was Too Distracted™ by Deep, Health Anxiety-Related Thoughts™ and slipped, so i yelled and Mum got distressed so that was why we were shouting. I kind of just pretended to be sort of sassy like, ""ugh when are these people gonna leave theres nothing going on here sksksksksk"" and after that we pretty much went back to what we were doing, we had pasta for dinner yay. yum. and the next day was Easter Sunday so it was sad that that happened the day before but what can ya do. I said i wasn't gonna go into detail about this but i guess i just threw all that out the window. also, the police believed us so yeah.   


I've talked a lot about my dad, he gets angry sometimes, but most of the time he's fine, yeah, I guess. Now about my mum. So like, she tries to be nice to me and ask me what's wrong but sometimes, being around her is just depressing, not that she's a depressing or depressed person but she just asks me sometimes ""oh what am i doing wrong what am i doing wrong"" and it frustrates me somewhat that she's assuming it's on her. but yeah. what was i gonna talk about after this?    

oh yeah, i had some other random thoughts unrelated to depression or anxiety or whatever. Basically, I have this thing that ive had for a long time where i don't really like sharing my interests? Like, ""what do you do at home?"" and stuff. obvz it's not that what i do is bad but i just like keeping it to myself more?? And apparently, this is a symptom for autism, but idk.

Also, I really don't like loudness and at some point when the noise level gets too high i just can't function properly. And i shut my eyes tightly to try and get the bad feelings out. My dad says that only ""sick people"" do that but like,,,, ok. Also also also also also, I sometimes self-harm, not like, cutting myself (i only have a vague idea of what this means, i doubt i would want a full definition if mine is incorrect), i just sort of hit myself in the stomach or the legs or the arms, not the head, i try to but... mmm nah. I also also also also also to the power of 100 sometimes feel physical pain like in the head or chest, not sure if that's anxiety or maybe i should cut down on screentime, either is good to work on i suppose.

this post is way too long and no one will read this,,, unless??? 😳 i have to do homework now lol byee"
1118,How to talk to your partner without dismissing your responsibility for your behaviour,
1119,How do I support my boyfriend and help him setting boundaries with his awful mother?,"I need advice and stories from people who have an oppressive family who screwed them up, and managed to set healthy boundaries.
My BF is a grown man of 38yo, I love him fiercely and I can't just stay here watching his life ruined by his mother. 

His father is a good man but a very old style father, providing for his family but not getting involved or being there for his son, not father of the year but he's a good man. The real issue is his mother. She raised him to be extremely insecure and fragile, threatening him, beating him (the good ol' fashioned parenting) over the smallest issue and throwing him awful ""pranks"" (once she staged the whole thing of dropping him off to an orphanage because he broke something in the house. She dragged him to the car while he was screaming and sobbing. Poor kid had nightmares for years about being abandoned, and she tells the story laughing as if it was the most hilarious thing). Again, he's a wonderful man most of the time and I want to be with him no matter what, but when he is going through something you can see how traumatized he actually is. We've been together for almost 3 years now, we live together, we are saving to buy a house, it's a stable and wonderful relationship. But anytime we argue (as in every normal, healthy relationship confrontation which can become a little heated) he panics because he is convinced that I'm going to leave him on the spot because he forgot to do the dishes. 

On top of raising their son this way, they also put a lot of pressure on him, both his parents but especially his mother. They forced him into a career he totally hates because it was ""prestigious"". They always ask about his job before asking how he's doing. Every time that there is an issue they blame him, belittle him, saying that he didn't work hard enough, that his happiness does not count because if he lose his job he won't have anything left, his boss is always right, and all the jazz. 

Now, he's being let go because of you know what. He will work until the end of June, and then he will be terminated because the firm is at loss and they must layoff. He hates this job with every fiber of his being, so I am trying to push him to pursue something different. We have some savings and I earn decent money, it won't be a problem to spend some months off work while preparing for a different job. I'm relieved, confident and even happy for him, because I think it is a great opportunity and I know he wouldn't have left his job if they didn't fire him. 

But when he told his mother, god help us. She yelled at him for not working hard enough to keep his job (in the middle of a fucking pandemic, yeah), asked what he did wrong, and then bursted into tears like he said he was going to die, sobbing for a good 15 minutes. He was so positive about finding a new path, and now he's totally terrified because he doesn't want to disappoint them, and he says that there's no point in trying a new career because he's going to be a failure anyways, and he's already sending resumes for other jobs that he will hate and will make him miserable. 

I am so fucking mad. We had a talk (well, more than one over the years) about it and he said that he already set boundaries, she used to be way worse. In his late 20s he had depression, bad anxiety and panic attacks, went into therapy and then moved across the country, where we met, for a fresh start. But then they belittled every attempt he made to find a different job, telling him to grow up instead of pursuing random dreams, and he ended up finding a new job in the same field he hates. He's an only child and doesn't want to cut them off completely. 

I can't witness this anymore. I'm a supportive partner, I'm doing my best to help him being a little more confident and be on top of his life, but it feels like every time he manages to make a tiny step forward she calls and drags him one mile backwards. Of course I'll love him anyways, but I want him to be happy and she is standing in the way, belittling and putting him down, as if she didn't damage him enough with her horrific parenting. I don't like her at all and I'd be happy to cut her off, but it's up to him and I respect his decision to have them in his life. I just need him to understand that it's not fair, he's much more than this and he'd thrive if only he could stop talking to her on a daily basis. 

What can I do for him? How can I help him to realize how toxic she is and how much he is affected by her behavior? What does it take to realize that you deserve to be treated differently and stand up for yourself, when there's close family involved?"
1120,What is wrong with me?,"For months now, I [14F] have been self harming. It started not long before Christmas just on my thighs, and then I was clean for a couple months. In the last month I started it up again, first on my wrists and then on my thighs. They are covered in scars and self harming is now part of my nightly routine and I can’t sleep without it. Brush teeth, practise piano, self harm, do crossword, sleep.

The pain satisfies me, I like watching the drops of blood slip down my skin. 

I wouldn’t say I have depression: I’m happy most of the time and I don’t feel sad even when I’m cutting myself. But other than that I constantly find myself overthinking everything I’ve done in the past and am paranoid whenever people enter a room.

I think the paranoia comes from my brain subconsciously thinking “they’ll see your scars” even though I always wear long sleeves. To be honest, I’m losing the will to do school work as well because I just don’t care... for context I’ve always been a model student and have never had detention. 

Panic attacks are something I deal with quite a lot, which stems from the fact I’m on the autism spectrum. I can’t comprehend doing certain things, like, say I made plans with someone and a small detail changed, I’d struggle to tell anyone about that out of fear it would inconvenience them or this weird feeling they would patronise me.

I don’t want to tell my mum what’s happening because she doesn’t realise it, but she’s always incredibly patronising. My dad lives over an hour away and this is not something I want to talk about over the phone. Plus, he suffers from PTSD from a car crash (that wasn’t his fault) and a messy break up from my step mum so I wouldn’t want to burden him. My sister is too young to understand.

This isn’t me trying to self diagnose, I just want guidance on what to do since I’m trapped in a house with my mum and sister. They are both extroverted and generally quite worry-free people, I’m more like my dad in the sense I’m introverted and struggle to verbalise my thoughts and fears.

I also struggle to make decisions, and always prefer it when someone makes them for me.

Is this anxiety? Does this stem from my autism, and, if it does, does that devalidate it as actual anxiety?

(I’m seeing my dad on Friday, if that’s useful information in any way.)

Thanks for reading."
1121,haven't slept at all in the past four days,"Don't have anything to share this with and I know I need help. I just lay there on my bed all night, I try to close my eyes and really try to calm my mind and sleep but it's like I am not able to sleep at all. I've been in depression before, in 2016 but recovered and now it feels like it's coming back again. I think and think, there are millions of things going on in my head, I try all I can, to read a book and exhaust my mind so that I feel tired and can sleep. but nothing helps, I just find myself turning sides on the bed, no side is comfortable enough, hours pass and then it's morning and I'm still awake. I wake up at 10 am to join my morning Teams meeting call and then get freshen up, work all day and then it happens in repeat. My mind, body and soul, everything has gone numb, emotionally I'm done with everything and I don't want to feel anymore. My mind is numb, No matter how much I distract myself with working, learning and hobbies, I don't feel my own existence. When I go to bed, I realise I'd been staring on the ceiling for so long. I don't feel tired in my mind for the lack of sleep that I normally should, physically I can move and work just fine but the life in me is not there anymore. I live with family, I can't talk with them because mental health is not even real for them. And the fact that I've been this way all alone in my room, crying repeatedly, feeling that I don't have anyone to care for me in the world is enough to not want me to tell them anything. they've never cared. they love me but how I feel has never been a concern for anyone. Sharing this here because even if I feel tough, and think that I can deal with everything alone, And I've been dealing with things alone in years, there are moments when I too feel tired. I feel like it's enough, I'm only a human, I can't take it anymore but still able to survive it in some way. this time too, it feels like a loop from which there seem a no way out, I feel lost, broken and just done. there's a little bit hope that I've believed in not because of some God that come and guide me or send one of his angels but because I'm too stubborn to give up. I know this. I remind myself repeatedly. but yet, yesterday, I tried to bruise my vein in my right hand with a sharp pin. I didn't know what I was doing and no matter how much it hurt or how much I wanted to die, I've never caused physical harm to myself, but in that moment I wasn't me. All I saw was a vein, green and blue, inside my skin, that I wanted to cut."
1122,Sometimes I feel like I have no one to turn to.,"Like if I were about to jump off a bridge, no one would bother replying if I tried reaching out for help. 

Like I’m just a burden on the very few friends I have. 

Like I’m a burden on mental health services.

Like everyone else is slowly giving up on me so hey, maybe I should give up on me too."

1126,What is wrong with me?,"I know that I'm not ugly, but I constantly feel ugly as shit. It is almost as if I wanted to look ugly for some reason, but the thing is, I don't. I look in the mirror and I'm like ""Fuck you you ugly piece of shit"", but then I take another look at it, and I realise that I'm actually not ugly.. Maybe I'm just feeling bad about myself? This feeling is just so confusing and frustrating.. I used to be ugly in the past, but I lost quite a lot of weight, and now I have a pretty-ish, kinda feminine face, so maybe that depressed period of my life has somehow scarred me?"

1128,How my mother found out I was depressed.,"Recently, I have come into conflict with my mother about my mental health. I felt destroyed when she told me how she knew about my most precious secret that I was in no shape or form ready to confront her about. Apparently, my computer was unlocked where I left it and was opened to my personal google docs. (This is where I let out my frustrations when I have no one to talk to). She opened the first document which was primarily about having to lie to my mother. I created a story about the pressure of lying to family inspired by recent events and I over exaggerated the parental figure which came off offensive to my mother. In the early morning my mother came into my room and yelled at me about lying to her and making her out to be a horrible parent. Whenever I imagined telling my family about how I felt I always I liked to imagine them being understanding, but this was everything but that. She brought up her problems and put me in one of the most uncomfortable situations I have ever to endure. I remember just sitting In my bed too ashamed to look in her in the eye and accepting everything she said to me whether it was good or bad. I couldn't even muster the courage to talk; it felt like my tongue was holstered to the roof of my mouth. I still feel bad, horrible, and disgusting. I have never been more ashamed of who I was as a person in that moment. She even took my citalopram medication and put it on my desk, saying **""Take it, oh, but make sure not to over dose""** 

That will forever stick with me and I don't think I can even imagine telling her how I feel on my own terms anymore."
1129,Woke up at 3AM with a delusion that made my head burn,"So I’ve never had any history of OCD or psychosis, although I have had symptoms of depersonalization-derealization before. Last night I woke up at 3am with a burning headache and nausea but I was fixated on the idea that I have to solve this odd non-existent math problem in order to feel better and I couldn’t stop thinking about the problem. I just thought about it for an hour as my migraine got worse, convinced that it was the secret to feeling better. In between I would get up to blow my nose even though I didn’t have to at all, I just felt I had to do it. Finally I sat up and kept telling myself the math problem wasn’t real. The delusion was surprisingly hard to shake to the point where I saw numbers flashing as I was convincing myself it wasn’t real. After about a half hour of that I settled down and as soon as the delusion left so did my headache and nausea and I was able to get to sleep. I’ve never had anything like this before and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with something similar."
1130,I'm struggling and I don't know what to do.,"I have been battling bad mental health for over a year now and it has affected my life so much. My boyfriend of 2 years is unsure how much more he can take.

My mother had a long term affair, following which I have had no further contact with her. This is by my own choice due to an incredibly strained relationship with her anyway. (she isn't a nice person). My biological father has not been in my  life since I was a small child and although I love my stepfather, he appears to be moving on with his new family (Inc my 2 younger sisters) and I feel very left behind. We had a recent argument where I mentioned these feelings and he refused to acknowledge them. 

I don't have many friends and those that I do, live far away. I feel isolated and lonely all the time and the thought of giving up sounds appealing. I'm just stuck in this loop of not feeling worthy and thinking I'm an awful person because nobody sticks around.

I cry everyday and I feel like there is a hole inside me that I just can't fill. If anyone has any advice, please share."
1131,24 y/o depressed and stuck in a funk for a while.,"I have been stuck in this weird funk for a few years. In thw early years of college i felt good, confident, and was studying like crazy and just paranoid about getting any low grades. These past few years for me at least feel like a train wreck in my brain. I have one more year of undergrad. I have been a little addicted to weed and I gained a lot of weight, plus im just very lonely and cant get a gf. I still dont even really know what to do with my life. Im a good person just dont know what the hell im doing wrong to not be lonley and all this. I look at youtube and what everyone tells me to do but it doesnt make sense. I dont want to be lonley anymore and have no idea how to find someone. I feel like i will never find myself and what i will do for a living nor have a family."
1132,I’m scared to make the decision,"I’ve been extremely insecure about my nose (especially my nostrils) because it’s big and I’ve been bullied for it and it just hurts to look at myself. I’m worried though, if I get a nose job will  I just start to focus on another part of my body and get surgery for that? How do I know if a nose job will satisfy me? Is there even an answer I just need some advice I’m really anxious"
1133,At my emotional wit's end with friend who talks to me about suicide,"Since we were 24, so seven years now, my friend has entrusted me with his secret that he feels suicidal and has talked to me about it steadily, but not constantly, over these years. I've always tried to help him by talking to him without ever really knowing what the ""right"" thing to say was, despite trying to research it online, and in general just letting him know that I'm there for him. I have constantly encouraged him to seek help from someone who is more professionally qualified to help him with these thoughts, yet he never has due to a combination of financial and emotional reasons. I don't believe that he is an urgent risk for taking his own life, as he usually refers to a vague date in the future when he's older for when he will end his life, and he has not to my knowledge attempted suicide in the past seven years. Him telling me things like ""so you've never wanted to stab yourself"" has always taken an emotional toll on me, but I've tried to look past that for the sake of helping him. But, after last night where he came to me with this again, I feel like I'm emotionally past my breaking point. I'm about to start my own family now, and of course have my own life crises to deal with due to the fallout from the pandemic, and I just don't know what to do! I want to help, but I don't know how, and when I do it takes its toll on me to the point where I cannot think of anything else and neglect my own mental health. Please, how do I help my friend and help myself?

tl;dr friend has suicidal thoughts and I feel unequipped emotionally and professionally to deal with them"
1134,My friend is suicidal and I don’t know how else to help him,"I’m not really close with this one friend, thus I don’t really know his background, likes, dislikes or really anything. So I was very much shocked when he talked to me about this. Our whole conversation started by me wishing him happy birthday, then it lead to him ranting about being friend-zoned and asking me what to do just about it. 

Then the suicide talk started. It always happens at midnight which ticked me off a bit because I was just about to sleep and I couldn’t think straight. But nevertheless, I tried to talk to him and try to make him I guess look at life in a more positive way, to look at his talents and ended up writing him essay long messages while texting him back and forth.

Thankfully at that time I’m pretty sure he didn’t have a laid out plan about the suicide or did self harm. And after 3 days things seemed to get better and he stopped talking about being suicidal. I told him that I’ll always be there for him and he could talk to me about anything.

Well I was wrong when I thought that it stopped.

He started sending me his online depression test results: moderate to severely depressed. He also started to send me his drawings of people committing suicide and said “I’m drawing these because you told me I’m good at drawing and because I’m good at drawing shit like this”. I kept on still talking to him but I was getting tired because at this point it seemed as if everything I told him went nowhere. I even told him about my past experience and how I “dealt” with it.

I did tell him I would always be there but I now feel restricted to do anything because I always have to be there to help him and respond to every text or he would spam me with messages. 

Then he started to poke his mosquito bite with needles and I told him to stop it and it won’t do anything. He told me to try it, that it feels good and satisfying.

I’m just so confused and tired of this any help would be appreciated.

-He’s been going through this for more than a year
-he saw a therapist before but felt as if they didn’t understand him so he stopped going"
1135,One day...,"One day I'll be happy.

That day definitely isn't today and doesn't seem like it will be any time soon.

But it'll happen.

One day I'll be happy."
1136,Need help faster,"I'm homeless and grieving, I lost my daughter, then my wife left me, and I'm spiraling. I've done my best to work and keep pushing on thinking it'll pass but it isn't, its getting worse. Its crippling and I finally decided to get help, but I guess a lot of people have over run psychologists and it looks like I won't get much for help for about a month.

In the mean time, does anyone know a way to get immediate help? I have been diagnosed in the past with clinical depression and anxiety but no longer have prescriptions. If I could just get something to help pull me out of it quickly until I see someone and they can figure out a better solution for me I might be able to pull myself out of this spiral and not end up even closer to absolute rock bottom.

I've thought about drugs, but I don't know anyone, and alcohol works but I'm an expensive drunk (high tolerance) so thats not really helping. I don't know where to go for immediate help and could really use some direction before I lose even more."
1137,I don't know how to ask for help,"I need help, anyone who knows anything about my life will know that I'm struggling. I can't cope with anything and need help, but I don't know how to get help.

When I speak to my friends, I feel like a burden. My family just thinks I'm crazy.

I'm terrified, some days I want to end it all, other days I sit for hours on end dreaming about a fantasy life where I'm better. Most of the time those thoughts are the only things getting me through the days.

I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. I just know that I'm not okay."
1138,Something's wrong and I don't feel like myself,"I  struggle with anxiety and depression. But I experience a lot of  symptoms of bipolar( II?). This last month I discovered I still had $1,000  in an old bank account, and since it wasn't my main bank account, I  convinced myself it was fine to blow it all on clothes and shit for my  new apartment. Even though its just as much my money. This last week I  was in such a good mood and felt so ambitious and goal oriented and  good. Then on sunday I snapped.

I  was fine and had plans to accomplish 3 tasks that day, and was dead set on it, one of which  was laundry and my apartment's machine took my quarters and didn't work. I lost my mind and got so mad, and punched it a few times. Started  crying. It just ruined my morning. I am rarely ever angry and almost  never get upset. Very go with flow. I never yell.  I'm having unfounded doubts about a new relationship I  was previously excited about. Like I don't know what I'm upset about, I  just am. They've done nothing wrong.They recently expressed a desire to be official, which I wanted and do still want, but the idea doesn't excite me anymore and instantly made me feel unhappy and IDK why. Last week I was considering asking her myself, now IDK.

Yesterday  I went for a run in town a half hour from mine. Forgot that I  wasn't in my own town for a second but remembered. Then used a snap filter and got  confused a second time because I saw a filter for the KC Royals and was like  ""weird there'd be a KC filter in south dakota"" which is where I moved  from last year. I live in Kansas city now and for a moment forgot,  apparently. IDK if dissociating a is a symptom of BP. Everything  just feels weird. I feel off. I'm irritable and unhappy, and having  doubts about everything. Idk what happened.Maybe its just depression but  the change was just so drastic. I've had the highs and lows before but the irritability is newish. Everything annoys me. Last week was so good for me.  Now verything feels pointless. And idk what to do about it."
1139,"I’m just, so, tired......","Every day feels like it’s never ending, I feel hopeless and worthless every single day, I have no motivation to do anything at all, I don’t feel hungry anymore, and no one even knows...

1140,"Erectile dysfunction cause by large prozac dose for OCD, anyone have experience being prescribed a viagara-like drug by their doctor? How was your experience?",Just curious.
1141,Am I fine?,"Even after cutting, purging and feeling anxious, stressed and lazy for months now. I still tell people. So do I really have problems? Most people I see don't tell anyone until years or months later but I never had that problem? I talked about them very insignificantly and smiled or left out details or talk about them in past tense but it's not like I kept these things to myself for too long. I guess that's why others don't think I have a problem cause I'm constantly trying to solve it myself and analysing/observing myself. I've become my own therapist while still telling others bit by bit. That's majorly why I feel like a fraud. Just talking about it makes me feel so dramatic. Am I?"
1142,i need help and have no one to go to,"TW: mention of self harm &amp; suicide 
hey, ive never posted here before so im kinda scared but, desperate measures. im 17 and my academics are really important right now. i have huge aspirations and goals that i cant achieve if i dont work hard. but for some reason, theres comes days and even weeks or months where i just cant bring myself to do anything. absolutely anything. ill just sit in bed and sleep all day or binge some show all day. i lose interest in all my hobbies, in talking to my friends or family and i start hating everything about myself. and then magically after a while ill become okay again and ill be productive and stuff but it still lasts max a week before it goes back to the slump. ive never been diagnosed with any mental illness. i used to self harm and have had suicide attempts. i dont self harm anymore, but the suicidal thoughts still creep by now and then though not as strong. im losing hope in everything and in myself. i dont know if what im facing is a real mental health issue or im just a lazy couch potato. how do i get myself out of this funk? sorry if none of this makes sense."
1143,what is considered a suicidal thought,[deleted]
1144,I can't focus anymore,"Since March, I have developed some kind of disorder. It doesn't allow me to focus on what I want and feels very intrusive in my mind. It started with occasional small worries, regrets, and generally dapper thoughts but evolved into two major states of mind.

Nowadays I have three modes of thinking:

* I am clear-headed and can focus on a task
* I have a constant static of thoughts in the back of my head and find it hard to focus on a task
* I have one major thought that only allows me to focus on that thought

This has become a major problem with final exams coming up in the following weeks. I am seventeen years old and have never sought professional help for anything related to the mind.

As of now, I don't know what to do; Should I wait it out and see what happens (even if that means getting worse grades)? Is this a viable problem that one can seek help for? Could this be a sign of depression or anxiety?

I'm at a loss, and have no clue what to do."
1145,"Depression, anxiety, and quarantine","We have a long one here so strap in. So I used to be abused by my dad and he and mom split so that may have kickstarted my depression, well I was starting to get happy in this old farmhouse but it started falling apart, so we had to move in with my stepdad in Lakewood, a small city near Cleveland. The problem is that his parents live with him, and they came from Egypt so they speak heavily in Arabic and listen to Arabic tv. They do nothing but argue and yell and get in our way. So my morale was already down but luckily I discovered my new favorite video game so that helped me a lot in my mental battle, then there was middle school. Most of the teachers were nice except a certain few. Now to give context I have classes out so after some classes I return to my home room. And before you ask, I have adhd, aspergers, anger issues, and I’m on the spectrum. Now instead of being, you know... different. I actually had straight As for a semester in 6th grade and I have 12th grade reading level. (as I’m writing this I’m in 8th grade) Anyways, I got bullied by a few kids and one of them took a swing at me. At some weird moment I had a flashback as if it were my dad hitting me and I lashed out and messed up the other kid, I didn’t break anything but of course I got in trouble. There were other kids who saw this went down and they actually rooted for me and I became the talk of the school almost immediately. Now this boosted my confidence quite a bit and helped with my battle against depression. I’m quite shy but I enjoyed talking to people and got new friends. Now came the other struggle that I had to deal with. You know how I said a certain few teachers gave me trouble. Well imagine an old teacher, who drinks 4 diet cokes a period,  (40 minutes) didn’t let you make up work even if you were in the hospital, and was rude and disrespectful. To give you an idea of how bad she was, when she let videos play on the promethium board, she went on Facebook and we knew because when the video ended it showed her screen. She also called a kids parents because his tongue was blue when he was giving a presentation when the previous period was lunch. So I don’t know why but she made my life and other special ed kids life hell. I tried to ask for a pencil I would get sent out in the hall, I ask to use the restroom she said go to isa, She put me in the corner of the room near where the kids would get the textbooks when she knew about my social anxiety and I couldn’t see the board for instructions because she wouldn’t let us turn our seats. So in a nutshell that heavily worsened my depression and anger. I eventually got out of that class by deliberately getting in trouble so I could get work done in isa. At first the isa teacher was like “make better choices op” but she eventually turned out to be really nice, she would even let me play games on my school assigned computer if all my work was done. So then came 8th grade (current year) the other teacher that gave me trouble was kinda similar but more understanding. So he was bearable but I was getting bullied again by new special ed kids. The first one actually tried to stab me in the heart with a pencil to try and steal extra snickers and milky ways from Halloween. He eventually was caught by me stealing the basketball players shoes. So I told the school, school called cops and he said that he was gonna kill me when he got out of juvenile detention. The other one who was in 7th grade would constantly make fun of me. Ruin my treats made for the class when we had a great week. He even ruined Pi day by throwing a pie I was gonna bring home for my mom in my face. He would punch me constantly and even ruined my favorite hoodie by cutting the hood off. I reported everything to the school each time but he would always be right back to square one being a little shit. Eventually I told him that if he would stop running each time he did something to me he wouldn’t be a coward. I told him to meet me at ***** at a certain time after school. This spread through the school like wild fire. The little sh*t didn’t know that I actually used to do boxing a few years back. So when the time came, he wasn’t ready. After that he used a box cutter to cut my arm. After that he ran and I didn’t see him after that. So overall 7th grade was a crazy year. Unfortunately the little sh*t came back in 8th but he only insulted me and knew not to mess with me which did boost my confidence. Now the fighting between my step grandparents was just getting worse to the point you could hear it outside the house when you are walking by.Eventually New Years came around and my step dad, my mom, and I confronted them about it and they said they would stop. It returned later in February. So other than my motivation to get out of bed each morning everything was great. Then here comes that stupid virus and we are in quarantine. I have only been able to get in contact with one of my friends and my family over the phone with zoom, FaceTime and other means. However my anxiety of what if I get infected was getting the best of me because I have asthma. Now I haven’t had an asthma attack since I was 8 but I knew if I got infected I would be screwed since it messes with your lungs. So that is going on, I haven’t seen my other family or friends in 2 months, my video games which were an escape for me weren’t helping anymore, and I gained 15 pounds. So I was losing more and more motivation each day and wasn’t concerned at first until recently. On our online class we had to do a project based off the book Stargirl. It’s a good book but in the book they have a interview thing called hotseat. Now I answered the questions and did all that. But when I viewed the video I realized I sound like I am emotionless and I have no soul even though to me my voice sounds higher pitched. So ever since that I have been conflicting with myself. Should I keep quiet and not drop this burden on my mom who is starting online nursing school and has a job at a nursing home, or should I let it out. Over time I’ve explained to mom how I have been feeling and she says it will be over eventually but it isn’t helping at all. So I battled with myself yet again whether to seek help online or keep letting small bits go at a time. Today when I am writing this I don’t even want to get out of bed anymore. What should I do to find some happiness in this hell hole of an environment I’m in. I mean I am spoiled with things like video games and such but I am more used to a quiet country town, where I don’t need to listen to Arabic tv all day or step grandparents fighting. At the same time we are going to try and move out this summer but I don’t want to leave all my friends again like I did at the farm house.I have tried everything to cheer me up. I have tried drinking my favorite soda, playing with my dog, playing old games for nostalgia but nothing works. Lately I have been trying to let my mom give in and let me stay at my grandmas for a few days but I can’t get her to budge. At my grandmas house I don’t worry about what’s going on, I just enjoy myself even if we both are quiet watch tv together or play on our phones. I always find happiness there even when I am sad. She is one of the greatest people I could ever have in my family as much as I love my mom and know she is also the greatest mother I could ever get. But ever since this year started I haven’t been able to visit her house where I can be free. I won’t lie though, I even thought about the rope pillow at one point briefly if you catch my drift,  but I immediately snapped out of it. I can stop myself from going that far. I just don’t know how long until I snap and I pack essentials and try to make a 16 hour journey from where I live now to my grandmas. As much as I try for my mom and my step dad I don’t know how much longer until I crack. And if you are reading this I am sorry for this burden you need to read even if some of it is kinda unrelated. My sanity lately has been more unstable than reactor number 4 in Chernobyl. I’m thankful that you everything that has happened leading up to the problems. I know that I’m just another person that quarantine is taking it’s toll on, but I’d like to thank you for anybody who takes the time out of their day to read this and possibly help me as best you can."
1146,Tw - How do I know if I threw up all the paracetamol?,"I took an od (just 8) and basically decided it was stupid and made myself sick.  Wouldn’t be more than half an hour after I took it.  I’m not going to a&amp;e and I’ve damaged my liver in the past doing it so how do I know I got it all out as much as I can? Thanks

Edit: grim, I know but there’s some crumbs of them at least in the puke so I’ve probably not digested it all"
1147,"I’m scared of my own birthday, &amp; don’t know why.","I feel ashamed to admitting that I need help &amp; probably feel like I can only say something here because I know people in my life will never come across this. You don’t know me &amp; I don’t know you.

My birthday is coming up in mid June and I don’t like celebrating it. I’m not sure why, &amp; I always end up crying by myself. I also am scared of getting older and am petrified as I’m getting closer to 30. I forget my own age &amp; it’s not intentional, I just answer “oh, umm I can’t remember” i honestly do try to remember but can’t. It shouldn’t feel like this right.

Not looking for pitty, I need something to help curb the ball on my fears."
1148,Can you have a quiet panic attack?,"I know the usual signs and symptoms of what’s called a panic attack. I’ve worked in the healthcare field for 5 years in an emergency setting and see something similar quite often.

I recently got out of what could probably be called an abusive relationship. My friends of 2/3 years are now friends with my so called abuser and whenever I see/hear her I just immediately feel lightheaded, my heart starts to race, and I feel disconnected. I just want to leave.

I’d ask google but I like having discussions with real people who may have had similar experiences. Yes. I am currently freaking out in the middle of class as said abuser just texted me. 

Anyways. Are quiet panic attacks a thing?"
1149,I’m strange,"I have PTSD and social anxiety. I observed that i have weird things that i do. I got social anxiety from school, i was bullied. So it resulted hating school really much. I also have anxiety on military, war stuff. Whenever i see a military man i feel like I can’t breath. Im even keeping my breath and eyes shut to not breathe the same air as them. It’s crazy. I can’t touch what they touched and I’m literally dying when i go to police station or others places that reminds me of them. I don’t know why but there a fear in me of police, military men’s faces. Somehow they have similar faces and whenever i walk beside them i feel like they are touching me and its killing me. I end up going home taking long showers as if like they touched me. This problem i have with school too. I can’t touch what they touched if so i have to take a shower. I also have strange thing that it always happen someone i hate and get anxiety from appearing in my mind and im struggling with to not thinking but its just pops in my head and i start thinking about someone i love and start repeating their name in my head until i calm down. It’s strange for me and feel really weird and crazy. Also the places where they was and was sitting I literally avoid them. And school i avoid everything and its causing me problems. Please help... i really need some help and im really sorry about my english. Not a native."

1152,i think I'm getting help,"I've experienced symptoms of mental health problems for years now, but nothing has ever happened. But yesterday I reached out to my school counselor (who is also my cross country coach) and told him whats going on. I have a zoom meeting with him in about ten minutes where we're going to talk in detail about what can happen. I'm absolutely terrified but I'm also kind of hopeful for the first time in a long time. I'll update y'all when its over"
1153,TOXIC FRIENDS &amp; toxic me,"Whenever I am friends with someone, no matter how close we are, i always feel like I’m in a competition with them. My current friend also has harsh standards for herself and whenever she talks about improving herself, which i also do, i always feel the need to improve even more. For example, if she talks about going on a diet, i get triggered (i have AN) and need to lose weight right then and there. If she ever did do better than me on a test (i always do, because i’m the one who studies meanwhile she acts like shes lazy and stupid), i think i would lose my shit. I really like her but i don’t know why im like this. This has happened in past relationships too where I unconsciously need to be better than the other person. I think it’s almost like I’m fighting with another version of myself because we are so similar in our ideals and values. I just think it’s better for me to not have friends so i dont have such ugly and disgusting thoughts like these."
1154,No one I know knows what I’m going through,"Just had my first proper panic attack ever because I glimpsed my ex-girlfriend and now I’m back at my desk trying to study for upcoming exams. 

I’m isolating completely alone and now it’s starting to get to me as I have no proper distractions or ways to let off steam.  

I’m so miserable and unhappy. Literally (and I mean literally) nothing is going right for me in life. 

And yet instead of staying in bed after my panic attack and being depressed, I’m still standing because giving up isn’t an option even as fucking much as I despise life right now and wish it would stop."

1156,I have an aunt that's schizophrenic...what are the chances that I am too?,"I don't want to go into too much detail. But I'm at just the right age in which the disorder usually develops. I've always had troubles with mental health but these past few months have been different. Something's wrong. And it's terrifying me. I stumbled upon a post on schizophrenia a few weeks ago and I realized that I check out on a lot of the items mentioned on it. And then I remembered – my father's twin sister is schizophrenic. What are the chances that I am too?

FYI, I used to be afraid at the thought of seeking therapy, but god things have just been really, really difficult and disturbing lately that I'm planning to see a shrink soon."

1158,Tips for dealing with thanatophobia,"I've struggled with thoughts about myself and my family dying since I was young due to a couple of family deaths in rapid succession. 

I've thought about it by myself and some times during the day and accept the fact that I'll die one day. But at night, I struggle with the idea that one day I'll simply stop existing. I tend to think the idea that when I die I'll be in a dark empty void by myself for eternity. Or that I'll be stuck at the point of me dying as time warps to feel like an eternity. Thinking about it logically I understand that most likely I won't care that I die once I'm dead, but that's not really the issue for me. It's how I feel now and how it affects me mentally that gives me issues."
1159,Mood swings but it's not bipolar?,"I've been experiencing mood swings for over a year now but only lately have they really got severe. After keeping an eye on my mood for some time now I've noticed that I go from ""normal"" - somewhat motivated, energetic and happy to downright wanting to die around every two days. 


I know I don't have bipolar because I don't experience mania, just going from normal to lethargic and completely unmotivated for apparently no reason. Does anyone have any idea what this might be a sign of?"

1161,I finally revealed my narcissistic feelings to my friends and that turned out to be the best thing I've ever done,"I went camping with three friends of mine this weekend and would never have guessed that doing so would lead to such a profound conversation.

I'm 20 years old, and they are aged 21, 20, and 19.

The 21 year old is a great guy who leads our group and makes most of the decisions. He's the person who gathered us all together in the first place, and he's by no means a shallow leader. Great listener with an excellent memory.

The 20 year old is quite shy but lots of fun. I wish I talked to him more...he's a great guy. He's not shy in the sense that he doesn't talk - he talks a lot and is a main part of all of our conversations. He's just a bit reserved and is admittedly insecure. His shyness becomes more obvious when things are quiet, and he has quite a story to tell.

The 19 year old is a girl I thought I'd never get along with. She has all the traits of people who never liked me in school. I never managed to befriend someone like her. I had no idea why I felt so drawn to her, until this weekend when I realized she represents my unresolved feelings with the people who never cared about me and who I just wished would like me when I was younger. Good part of our conversation was just us two understanding one another better.

I love her honesty and it felt good in some way when she told me she didn't like me at first. She thought I was self-absorbed and preoccupied with shallow things. I cared more about her opinions of me than what the guys said because I felt she was hitting the nail on the head (even though I loved hearing their opinions as well). She saw me for who I am, and that's why she didn't like me at first. She didn't feel the need to nurse me when she met me and she didn't like me because I obviously have to get my stuff together. I initially thought she was selfish, but that's actually quite fair. People don't have to take care of me. The beauty of it lies in when they simply choose to do it anyway, like she did when she paid attention to my feelings.

We only scraped the surface, though. There's a lot more I want to discuss with them, so I don't feel ""whole"" yet.

I want to discuss things further with the guys as well. But right now, I'm so amazed that I was able to have a real conversation with someone so honest. I feel like I can learn so much from her. I was able to get a glimpse of what caring for someone selflessly feels like, and I honestly want more of it. There was a moment after that conversation when we discussed suicide and she was just listening while quietly staring at the fire, and I noticed she shed a tear. I cared about her in some vague way, but I still did care, and that felt good. I wanted to talk to her about that, but that didn't happen. I guess we need to take our time. We're building the most honest friendship I've ever had, and you can't rush those things.

Hearing about my good qualities from them was also really refreshing. The first time we met was at this party and I couldn't drink back then due to the medication I was taking, and they were slightly wary of me possibly being a party pooper. Turns out they thought I acted drunk and enjoyed me following their rhythm instead of being judgemental. I think this is a nice contrast to how controlling my parents are. I still have a party pooper mentality, though, but that's something I think I'm doing good progress on.

**TLDR:** I've finally opened up to the people I like the most about my innermost feelings and I feel like I'm finally on my way to understanding real friendship and being able to form strong bonds with people."
1162,Mental health is difficult to get,"Hi everyone,
Im new here and I’m not a native English speaker, sorry if some words are wrong. But I can’t say these following things in German because I’m scared that it’s just serious for me and for everyone else it’s just a joke.

I don’t really think that I want to kill myself, but sometimes I have thoughts like „I’m not good enough“ or „nobody needs me“. I think I don’t have the right to say that I’m depressed because there are people who really wants to kill themselves. I don’t have anyone who understands me and I really need help.
Does anybody know that feeling?

Thank you for answering"
1163,Feeling helpless right now... don’t know what to do. Need relationship advice. Situation is destroying my mental health. (18F),"First, a bit of background. I (18F) have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and panic disorder for many years, and right now with everything going on, I’m having a really hard time. I take Citalopram, but my depressive state is so high lately that it doesn’t seem to be helping. I used to harm myself for a short period of time a few years ago, and hadn’t done it since. But today, I broke that streak.

Now, for what’s been going on. I started dating someone (22M) back in February and it has been wonderful. We met while I was there for university. I truly love him so much and we see a future with each other. He has been my biggest source of happiness, but I’ve been 4 hours away from him since late March. We both hate the long distance, and it’s simply heartbreaking to be forced away from the person you love.

I’m living with my family right now, and he’s far away and out of reach. He recently graduated and he is wanting to work where he currently lives next year. Myself on the other hand, I won’t be going back for at least 4 years because I was just accepted into nursing school here in my hometown. I offered to go visit once every month, but even then it would be for a day maximum. One day each month. Neither of us want that, but we also want to stay together. Additionally, he is from India, so he’s trying to get his work permit to stay in Canada. So I have no idea what’s going to happen. It’s just one big mess.

I’ve been crying myself to sleep every night lately, and today returned to self-harm. It’s one big messy situation (especially with Coronavirus piled on top) and really need some advice. What should I do? What should we do? Any advice is greatly appreciated."
1164,Im mediocre at life,"Im an extreme perfectionist. I've been to a therapist and have been prescribed medication before, but none of it seems to quell my anxiety and self loathing. I was taken out of public and private school because I would stress endlessly over every piece of work and would frequently have anxiety attacks at my desk. I was in a very dark state of mind even though I achieved straight A's. 

I am now homeschooled, but my stress has followed me and seems to latch itself to anything I try. 

I enjoy playing videogames, though beat myself up whenever I can't perform at the skill level of a professional.

I can't tell you how many D&amp;D campaigns I've restarted because I DM'ed one session poorly.

Recently Ive gotten into Warhammer model painting. I enjoy it, but I can't shake the feeling that all the models that I paint are absolute garbage, and that I should quit it all together. I've been thinking of getting them professionally painted as to not deal with the constant self-loathing, but my mind tells me that if I quit, it will be another thing that I failed at. 

I'm beginning to think that I'm good at nothing, and that I simply take up space. Quarantine is taking it's toll on my mental health, and I don't want to send myself down that dark spiral again."
1165,"Hey all. With a close friend, I just started a podcast called ""I'm Anxious About,"" where we look at one thing we're anxious about each week, laughing and musing on it. It's not a self-help podcast, more an honest conversation about what it's like to live with anxiety (and how to laugh at it).","Mods, if this doesn't fit here, feel free to take it down, but I thought it be a legit pick me up for people, or at least a kind reminder that they're not alone. 

Anyway, if you've got a second, feel free to check us out on your favourite podcast provider. 

Here are links if you just want to jump straight to it. Obviously, I'm anxious about even posting this, but I'm tired of privately struggling. It feels like it's high time I just publicly talk about all this stuff, and hope that others can relate, largely through humour.

1166,My parent has PTSD. I dont know how to live with it.,"I know I know, it sounds selfish. Her PTSD isnt really mine to complain about. But still I feel like I have to vent..

Dont get me wrong, I love my mum. She is amazing, and very good at coping with her many mental illnesses. But it's hard. 

Maybe I'm just pissy becuase I actually have to see it, but I cant cope with living with her. I'm tired of hearing her scream at 3am. Im tired of spending an hour trying to calm her down after a violent outburst. I'm tired of letting her vent about everything to me, even though I usually initiate becuase it makes her feel better. My only childhood memories of her, is probably her in the middle of a PTSD episode. When I was younger I just thought she was a bit of a psycho who didnt really care how her actions impacted others, because she only ever flipped out at me, but now I just feel kind of guilty. 

It's hard too, seeing her miserable all the time. I have to constantly monitor everything I say or do in the house so I dont set someone off- if it's my brother, or my mum. But I feel like I cant have problems of my own. They seem so insignificant to theirs.

It also sounds bad, but living with them has put my off therapy. Nearly every experience they've had has been a bad one, especially for my brother. Living where I do- getting help at this point seems counterproductive.

I dont feel like I can talk to anyone about anything. My parents always try to shove some label on me whenever I come to them with how I feel- depression, anxiety, some kind of developmental disorder. It feels as though they want to find out exactly what's wrong with me- they want a diagnosis so they can cure what makes me myself, if that makes sense. No, I dont think I have any diagnosable conditions. I think all my issues, my trust issues, social awkwardness, anxious tendencies, I think it all stems from living in a shitty neighbourhood and living with my family. How can I tell them I think all my shit is their fault, when they have so much going on?

I know my mum can't help her PTSD, or her hyper vigilance, or her anorexia or her OCD. I dont really have any buisness blaming my issues on that and it feels selfish to think that way but it's what I feel. 

I have a lot going on right now, between college and my home life, but I'm 16. I dont think I've ever had the maturity to be able to deal with living here and then make it out ok. I love my mum, but most of the time being around her just makes me think back to when I was younger, and scared shitless of her. That or her latest episode.

But unfortunately I'm not in a position where I can move out right now. At all. I'm stuck here, when I KNOW being here is actively making my mental health worse.

I KNOW I'm not going to be able to magically find a way to cope. But I dont know how to come to terms with the fact that in order to live safely, I have to actively let my mental health deteriorate.

 I dont know what to do."
1167,How do I convince myself to eat?,I can't convince myself to eat because someone once told me when I wanted to eat while I was hungry that I needed to control myself and that if I continued on the path of eating that way then people would be happy af first but later they would call me fat. Was eating almost 3 times a day but nowadays I just eat twice or once a day and my stomach hurts but why eat if I'm gonna be admonished for it later on?
1168,Advice on how to find a therapist?,"Those of you who go to therapy and are in college, how do you do it because you are living in two different places throughout the year? Also, all of the therapists in my college town are fully booked. Do you see someone from your hometown and talk on the phone when you’re at school? Do you do online therapy?"
1169,I believe I have anxiety (14 years old),"I’m pretty anxious all day because when I play a game with my IRL friends and someone or all of them says “Gotta go” some thoughts pops up in my head. “What if your friends go and play with other friends”, “what if they are hiding something” and “what if they don’t actually like you”. I have also suffered from low self esteem (seen myself bad at everything). I have always have a thought in my head that “Ur ugly” and “nobody really likes you”. The cause of this is from bullying back when I was 9. I’m tired of this can someone help?"
1170,I don't know if I need help,"I'm a 20M this year and I don't know if I need help.
My whole life I've always been failing and have always been at rock bottom in everything I do. This led to a lack of confidence and belief in myself. I have no motivation to do anything and have no goals or ambitions as I often think that it isn't achievable. There are also times where I really feel worthless and I start tearing and crying out of nowhere, regardless of where I am. However I tend to hide it as much as possible as I don't want to be seen or demmed as weak. After trying for counselling, I can't bring myself to share how I truly feel when my counsellor asks me to share. I feel really trapped all the time as I'm not sure if I should seek help or if whatever emotions im feeling are what everybody goes through. Is this depression? Sometimes when im down I really feel like killing myself but in happy moments I don't."
1171,Seeking advice... or something...,"So, i want to start this post by saying that there is no way i can afford therapy at this time. With that said. I am struggling with my anxiety and phobia(s) a great deal as of late. If anyone is willing to talk to me about this i would very much appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read my post."
1172,"Existential Dread, Psychosis, and Identity","Here we go. I'm Jesus Christ again. My childhood was a government experiment. My parents are the abandoned husks of ultra-dimensional entities who've given up on my plane of existence. I'm Harry Potter. This carrot ginger soup is a potion. Beelzebub is at my doorstep. I shut off the circuit breaker and perform ritual magic. The shadow people are back. I have telepathy and can hear your thoughts. My brain is corrosive. I'm a virus, every word that comes out of my mouth spreads a hyper-linguistic pathogen. Armageddon is here. Are others beginning to see it? We are in the mental ward again. They know. They see it too. A heavy dose of Ativan or Haldol... the meals are no longer rearranged on the food trays and offered to the sun-god anymore. I ascend the levels of heaven. I am dead. My grandfather is Jigsaw, and the psychological torment implanted in my mind is part of a plan to replace him as a Grand Master Freemason... becomes more and more confusing.     
  

I'm out of the hospital again. I'm transplanted into another place. I don't know where I am. Until it starts happening again.     
 

These are only a small sample of thoughts and memories. This does not include the volumes of cringe moments of social interaction in various states of mental confusion.     


I try to find my identity again, and fail, and fail to get it quite right. Was I ever myself? Or has my illness always promoted a false self-perception? I was never quite right. Now I'm just embarrassed a lot of the time. I recoil everyday.

How do you build a sense of normal? How deep can you go into psychosis and come back completely?"
1173,I don’t know what to do,"I don’t know where to post this if it is a issue i will take it down.

I have to talk to someone about this because i don’t know what to do. I am still living at my mothers house with my younger brother. He is not much younger than me and we hate each other. He is vary homophobic, transphobic and ect. And i just recently came out as agender. I was afraid to tell him so i had my therapist tell him. He told the therapist that she made me this way and basically had a fit about it. A few months after that when ever he would get mad at me I would try to defend myself from teasing and nothing bad would happen. But now when ever he gets too mad with me, he starts breaking my stuff. I have had to replace my screen protecter on my phone twice. He has broken some stuff in my room and has thrown my ipad. My mom also won’t punish him because he could easily overpower her if he wanted to. I don’t know what to do. He almost dumped sauce onto my bed once. He also threw some of my Pokémon cards in the trash last week.

Is there anything i can do about this? I bought my iPad and phone myself so if he brakes it can I make him pay for it legally? He is a minor though so I don’t know what i can do.

I think i do annoy him sometimes because I have ADHD and a developmental delay that is vary minor. I also am trying to overcome ocd. My ocd has gotten better than it was in the past i don’t even know i even have the disorder anymore because you can get over ocd with a lot of work. I just have what is left of it and it really annoys him when i do ocd rituals. He thinks i’m crazy when i repeat things or clean things that he thinks aren’t dirty. But i don’t think I shouldn’t be punished by him for having issues he doesn’t understand."
1174,"I have chronic social anxiety, i don’t know what to do.","19f I’ve been struggling with depression and heavy anxiety. I had an encounter yesterday I really hold myself accountable for. A person I was taking to for work said he wasn’t going to take this deal forward because the numbers didn’t work. Luckily my fiancée was there to keep the conversation going. I was really upset, confused, and just shocked. I couldn’t speak the thoughts that i had. Any sort of encounter where it goes off the rails throws me off entirely and I just stay silent and my needs are unmet. I really want to change. I want to be able to speak my mind. Any books, resources, help, can help."
1175,One of those days....,"Today's one of those days that I'd rather be dead. I'm not about to kill myself or anything ,but damn, today is shit. I've been between sobbing while hyperventilating and self harming. It fucking sucks, nothing makes the mental pain go away. I just want to be fucking numb again. I hate the instability of my emotions. I either feel everything at once or nothing at all."
1176,What are the most interesting moonshot ideas for policy and practice changes for behavioral health in the US?,"I work in strategy at a large insurance company and have the ability to directly influence change to our policies on behavioral health (mental health, disease management, wellness). I am not, however, a behavioral health specialist or policy-maker. I’m particularly inspired by ideas like [Zero Suicide Initiative](https://zerosuicide.edc.org/), which focuses on the goal of completely eliminating suicide. 

My ideal outcome is that our company changes our policies in a way that provides substantially better coverage, support, and variety of behavioral health services, which then would force our competitors to do the same. This would create an overall better landscape for behavioral health for several million people in the US."
1177,is it possible i'm autistic?,"[this is going to be long, but i would really appreciate any amount you can read and any help you can provide]

i'm trying to figure out if, in my next attempt to get therapeutic help, i should bring up the possibility of autism. i usually don't, because i have a cousin who's definitely autistic, and i feel like we're very different.

i am stubborn, but he is on a whole other level, and just comes of as very undisciplined and clingy to most people. he enjoys hugging and touching people, and this sometimes gets him in trouble. he frequently talks over and interrupts people. he is also extremely, alarmingly social, with very few boundaries, but this means he makes new friends seemingly every week. he has no musical abilities, and though he has played piano for 10 years, there seems to be limited progress. he is fairly uncoordinated and has not done well in any sport except cross-country. he is very fast. he lives alone, and during this quarantine, has been playing fucktons of video games. he went in to a therapist when he was 16 years old, after a girl at school wanted to file a restraining order against him, and within a week they diagnosed him with autism.

i have many, many boundaries and an almost crippling inability to speak up. i suppose i am clingy in my own way, in that i find myself very attached to anyone willing to speak first. i hate hugs and being touched though, and one time my dad called me an ""asshole"" because of it. i do not interrupt and usually only speak when spoken to. i don't think i've made a friend in close to 10 years. i have a seemingly innate sense of rhythm and musical abilities, and have picked up many instruments over the years. it is probably the only thing i'm proud of. i am pretty well-coordinated, with i would say exceptional hand-eye coordination, but have not stayed on any teams because they make me nervous. i am not fast. i live at home right now, and during the quarantine i've been writing a lot of stories/songs, and making some social media accounts for the characters, with terrible drawings as avatars. i have never had any romantic interests at all. i've been to several therapists, usually spurred by deep bouts of depression, and have been told i have varying degrees of ocd, add, social anxiety and schizoid personality disorder, but i always declined to do ""official testing"".

i mention all this because my experience with autism has pretty much only been my cousin, and i feel we're nothing alike.

but living at home with my now adult brothers during quarantine, since they no longer let me call the shots, they have been constantly pointing out things and ways i think that they find weird. most notably, when we have tried to record music videos for songs we record, they say i have a ""flat affect"". i just play bass, i'm not supposed to sing or make pained expressions, but they say i make their videos ""unwatchable"".

they've also pointed out my eyes lose focus and i ""blank out"" during conversation, i cannot hold eye contact for more than a few seconds, i don't understand song lyrics very well, i can't debate for shit, my inflection and/or pronunciation of words is wrong, i repeat stuff too much, like sometimes i say a word or phrase or noise over and over for damn near an hour, i rewind shows a lot because i miss things, i spend too long writing emails that ought to take only a few minutes, i could go on.

in my head, i've begun noticing things about myself. 

* at some point growing up, i began counting steps to make sure i stepped in prime numbers. all the time. at like 14 or 15 i decided to put a stop to it, so i began running places and made counting impossible. i eventually stopped counting steps, but am still obsessed with prime numbers. i cannot enjoy a show or music if the volume is at say 25. 

* i have to read street signs forwards and backwards before really comprehending them. often when reading a book, i will read a couple pages and then realize i have no idea what i read so i have to go back.

* i get audio loops stuck in my head, sometimes to the point where they're detrimental to my life. i could barely study for a recent final because the chorus of audioslave's ""show me how to live"" was raging through my head for literally days, like any time i wasn't talking or listening to something else. it was painful.

* there are a lot of people i can't stand to listen to simply because of the tone of their voice. 

* similarly, i am easily influenced by music. the lyrics make no difference to me though. a weird example is that octopus's garden by the beatles almost brings me to tears. when i was little i swore that certain birds sounded happy some days and sad other days, even if they were singing the same song. i am continually delighted by the fact that no one can hear the music i hear in my head or when i have headphones in.

* i write scripts for interviews or the rare occasions in which i have to talk to a coworker or professor. 

* certain smells and combinations of smells give me a headache, or are very painful to me, like olives. i enjoy the smells of cleaning fluids and chlorine.

so am i autistic or just a persnickety, misanthropic asshole? thank you for reading my novel."
1178,How do I let loose (Do I have anxiety),I feel as though I'm too hyper conscious about my thoughts and actions a lot of the time as though I don't want to make the wrong choices. I tend to over think things and I'm the quiet person in the group. I found that alcohol does help me a bit in some social situations but I don't want to become reliant on it. I want to find a way to actually be myself but not sure what to do.
1179,What do you do daily to help maintain good mental health?,"I struggle with negativity all of the time. It's so hard to get out of when stress seems constant. What do you do to help with your own negativity? Let's just say the negativity feels engraved. I am aware if I want to change it's up to me. But I'm having troubles on how to change. I try thinking positivity when things start going bad but it's usually not long before I'm in my negativity again. 

Any advice, links, tips would be really helpful. At this point I'm thinking I need posters hung everywhere. 

TIA, a really really negative person trying to do something about it"
1180,Quarter life crisis ?,"I had a video pop up on my Twitter timeline talking about something called a quarter life crisis, it’s a state in your life where you feel lost in the shuffle not knowing where to go and what to do in your life, I just graduated college and I feel the exact same way, my question is, is there such a thing ? Is it real ? And how do I get over it ?"
1181,I just want to feel loved,I’ve never been in a relationship or been able to feel “loved” in a sense. I just wish I had someone who would hold me when times got hard and talk to me like I deserved the time of day. I just feel lonely and afraid of myself. I feel worthless.
1182,Is it unethical to have someone psychologically evaluated without their knowledge?,I have a 16 year old foster child that has been through quite a lot. He's a good kid but very withdrawn and has the maturity of maybe a 12 year old. Social services wants him to speak with a counselor but he refuses. I have a close relative that is a psychiatrist and was thinking about just taking him with me to hang out with her for a day to get her opinion. He doesn't know what she does. I don't want to approach her about this if it is not something that should be done. Thoughts?
1183,Online therapy/ resources?,"I've been on a waiting list for a therapist for 2, nearly 3 years now. I'm tired my mental crap, and the cycles I keep putting myself in. I need help, and I can't get myself through this stuff. I simply don't know how. 

Are there any ways to have a therapist online, or any sort of resources I can use?"
1184,my therapist refuses to give me a diagnosis,"hi. ive been having suicidal thoughts for almost a year now consistently, my anxiety is really bad, as in I have panic attacks for the dumbest things like not being able to find a shirt that I want to wear. I will start shaking and I suddenly can't breathe and my fingers and toes start numbing and I basically feel like im dying - yes, that dramatic. 

ive been going to therapy on and off for 8 years now and at first it helped but lately I come back from it and I feel even worse or I snap at my loved ones and im more closed off than ever. I have no motivation, ive even told my therapist I dont want to continue seeing her - even though she strongly advised me against it. I feel as if im in withdrawal from everything and everyone. I can't do anything without my anxiety being over the roof and thinking that its better to just end it all. I honestly can't do it anymore. 

I also have this need of validation for my feelings that my parents have caused because every time I try to talk to them about it they then use it against me when I do something wrong and tell me nothing is wrong with me and that i'm just a lazy cow, which leads me to my ultimate point:

When I did therapy I asked my therapist multiple times if she could give me a diagnosis -- as she said that she thought it would be better for me to get admitted to a mental health clinic or prescribe me antidepressants. However my mom went ballistic when the therapist ringed her to advice her into admitting me, and told her that I don't need it so I never ended up doing it -- and she refuses every time and I just don't understand why. I feel like I might have an anxiety disorder bt then again I dont want to be insensitive to people actually suffering from this and self - diagnose. the only diagnosis she has ever given me was after I self - harmed she told me I had mild PTSD, when I was trying to be clean as I had a lot of triggers. for example, if I ever saw lines or someone drawing a literal straight line or if someone ever mentioned self harming I would break down and have a flashback.

So yes, this is my question -- I don't understand why she can't just give me a diagnosis, cause its not like she's told me I have nothing, she just refuses to tell me what I have and its really destructive for me for some reason. (I apologise if any of this offends anyone, please don't be mean)"
1185,My weight makes me want not want to live anymore.,"Im not the type of person who cares about what others weight at all. I think everybody is beautiful in their own shape! But for me, i dont even want to live anymore. I am so thoroughly disgusted with myself. Im only 5'2"" and im almost 200lbs now. I never even weighed this much when i was pregnant. Im fairly obese now. I know alot of people struggle with their weight but do others wish they werent even living anymore because of it? I feel like i cant live this way much longer and if I gain anymore i wont be able to handle it. Ive tried dieting but really cannot live past my cravings. I used to be a heroin addict and i have approximately 5 years clean. I used to weigh 100lbs. Ive always struggled with body dismorphia. When i got clean i started picking up bad eating habits. This is harder to do than quitting drugs i swear. 

Two of my bigger problems are: I have this weird OCD that i cannot drink anything unless im eatng. So everytime i get a drink i have to get a snack with it. I have no idea why but i just cant. It mentally bothers me to drink something without food. This leaves me feeling shitty because i end up dehydrated when dieting because im not drinking enough. 

The other thing is my breasts are HUGE. They were huge even before i gained a ton of weight. They have always caused me neck and back problems. I have huge indentations in my shoulders and working out sucks. Sports bras do not work for me at all and it makes my neck hurt worse with the weight of trying to keep them in place. I have seriously considered breast reduction surgery but im not sure if my doctor will allow it or I can afford it. 

I can barely breathe when i do try to work out. If anything i like running the best but thats hard on the breast aspect of what i explained. I just dont even know where to start or what to do. I do know i cant live like this much longer. Any advice or tips are so much appreciated."
1186,I need some guidance and help please (anxiety),"I just don’t understand where I’m at. I’ve been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while I’ve made progress, I’m not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn’t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I’m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help? I have so many good things going on in my life, I hate this. I feel so close to breaking through as well, but then so far."
1187,Mental Health help book,"So during this quarantine I have decided to make a book/scrapbook about mental health with positive quotes and some personal stories/reflections. I really hope I can use it to help others and give them something to pick up and read in dark times when they are struggling... because you really are not alone. I have had a whole range of difficulties, including a bipolar mother, an absent father, eating disorders, suicide attempts. And yet, at this point in my life, I can sit here and say I am truly happy. I wouldn’t have been able to feel this contentment if I had given up all those years ago, at 15, at 20, at 24... I really hope my experience can help people reach out if you need somebody to talk to. I don’t have all the answers but I can certainly listen. Also if you’d like to see some pages from my project, let me know :)

Take care of yourselves and be kind to each other Cx"
1188,I think I’m falling into another depression,"   Hey I’m 18F. If you have seen my past post you (if not that’s ok) would notice I have lived a rough life. I grew up in a very toxic family dynamic. When I was 12 was when I feel into my first depression. It felt worst than what I am feeling now to the point where I contemplated suicide at one point. This was triggered by me witnessing my dad domestically abuse my mom by beating her with a tv remote. Also, by the relentless bullying I got from school. I had no friends and no family that was close by. Lucky I pulled myself out of that depression through learning what my feeling meant and how to take care of myself emotionally by distancing myself from my parents. 
  Now the feelings are coming back because due to college closing I had to move back to my parents place and it’s just as toxic. They are divorcing and it’s an ugly one. My mom uses me as an emotional crux while my dad is trying to gaslight me to forget about what he did to my mom, me, and brother (abuse). It doesn’t help that I’m isolated from my friends and other family members because of COVID-19. Can anyone give me some advice or just be a friend."
1189,Mental regression due to stress?,"I've always been a big kid, even during my later teens and 20's when I tried to act like an adult, but over the last year or two I have been under immense stress, and my life is a roller coaster. I find myself turning to stuffed animals for comfort and speaking to them, and moving more and more into toys I have from my childhood, but those don't bring me the same interest or joy I once had.

Is there a reason for this, is my mind becoming overwhelmed and turning to things I once had to help?"
1190,Urgent: Talking to myself out loud need quick answers please,"I will save you the war and peace version and give you the quick and short issues;

Noticed a couple of people turn and face me when walking down a street (20 meters ahead, approx) This has occurred on several occasions.

Is it possible that i could have yelled without being aware of this?

Can i be talking what im thinking without knowledge of this?

I have been heard grunting to myself and have cottoned onto this.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this something serious or can i fix this?

1192,"I am not sure if this is a rant, cry for help, or simply a request for advice. I am young, confused, and for the first time, unable to rely on my own judgement. Any type of response will be met with gratitude.","Hello Everyone,

I (20M) should probably preface this by mentioning that I am a sufferer of Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, OCD, and addiction. I am also a gay man of color—two identities that will be relevant later in this message. 

SIDE NOTE: In order to reach out to as many cohorts as possible, I will be cross posting to different subreddits that possess an audience that I believe may be of some help. 

My life has comprised of battling the illnesses and personal identities listed above. I have been a sufferer of depressive symptoms since the age of five; my suicidal ideations can be traced back to the age of nine. I am not sure why, but in spite of these sicknesses that have hindered my mental health, I’ve also been rational, witty, and intuitive—character traits that have allowed me to always pass as a healthy, stable individual. 

I have always been responsible with strategizing, adjusting, adapting, problem-solving, acting bold, never wavering, being resilient, adopting a sly, elusive persona, and playing this game of secrets and lies. Whenever one problem is dealt with, another surfaces, yet for some reason, my soul never, ever wants to give up. I want to keep living, but I’m so, so tired with dealing the cards I’ve been presented.

A lot has happened throughout the years, but after graduating high school, I enrolled at a top Catholic University. I would say this was probably the worst year of my life, and that is _saying_ something. My OCD reached its peak—I’d say this is one of the worst mental illnesses to deal with—and I had to finally acknowledge my sexual orientation. 

After my freshman year I transferred to my local CC and worked two semesters to make up for my general education requirements. This year was also hell for different reasons, but I suppose I’ll omit the experience as I’ve already written a lot.

For the 2019-2020 academic year, I haven’t been enrolled in school, and I have basically spent all of my days sleeping/in bed. A few months ago I was able to muster up the energy to apply as a transfer to some universities, and was accepted to both Washington University in St. Louis and Emory University. 

Right now I am stressed as hell. I am not sure if I should go back to school yet. I am still depressed, twenty pounds overweight, and physically just look like a zombie. I will acknowledge that my physical state won’t be much of an issue; all I need is 1-2 months and gatorade to deal with the weight loss, withdrawals, etc. I only hesitate because more free time would be a good way to seek out therapy.

On the other hand, my education is the only thing that gives me life. Without it, I am nothing, but I am not sure if I’m mentally ready to move from New England to St.Louis/Atlanta and start my next chapter. I will have to deal with my Illnesses and the fact that I no longer have my family as a safe haven (I only feel like I can be myself with my parents and siblings, as they don’t judge me for my sexual orientation, etc. At many of the US private universities there is a lack of diversity so I always have to deal with being the only minority, being spoken about behind my back, going through imposter syndrome, etc.) I also feel major FOMO because my high school friends are already a year ahead. I feel like an incompetent, worthless fuckup, and I’m wasting my life. I know worrying about being two years ‘behind’ is irrational, but I can’t stop myself from obsessing over it. 

I have to make a decision by the end of Friday. My parents are completely supportive of any choice I make and say I’m still young, and don’t need to rush through things. The funny thing is, they don’t know about my illnesses or the discrimination. Again, I am the master of the game of _secrets and lies_ , so I’ve portrayed my predicament as one where I have to choose between acquiring more work experience to boost my resume or going back to university.

Please help."
1193,How much can mental illness effect your cognitive abilities?,"My depression and anxiety have become much worse in the last three years, and in that time, it has been hard to do almost anything that requires brain power.

I think my mental illnesses are gonna or have already started causing problems between my fiance and i. He's all I have, if I lose him I'm done with life.

I've been having this type of crisis a whole lot at an  increasing frequency, but I'm still unable to explain what it feels like. It just hurts



Update: as I'm writing the post I'm also starting to really heavily dislike myself, mainly for spamming so much, and for ""asking for help"" but then never actively doing anything to help myself. Such an asshole move, and then I wonder why people hate me"

It’s been almost 6 years trying to find a medicine that works and when I find one I have to change it because for some reason going up on the dose is too much for my insurance to handle.  I don’t really understand why the price went up that much for a dosage change, so if anyone can help me understand I’d appreciate it.

1199,I can’t take loud noises anymore? Is this a normal side effect,"I’ve dealt with severe depression and anxiety and other mental illnesses for a while now but have been slowly doing what I need to do to get better. I’ve noticed recently that I can’t handle ANY loud noises. 

My past trauma isn’t related to any type of combat, natural disaster, or anything that would have a ptsd type noise trigger. But even now things like the  microwave fan vent are painful to even turn on. I watch tv on volume 9 and I used to love thunderstorms but now can’t bear to hear it. I saw my doctor just to make sure nothing was wrong with my ears and everything seems fine. My friends are starting to get annoyed with me because I bail on going our to clubs and parties now too. 

Now I’m thinking I’ve just hit a new side effect like when my hair started thinning and I had stomach problems. Idk does anyone else have this issue? 

Haven’t been able to see my therapist yet with everything going on. Hopefully she’ll say this is temporary because I live in DC and the usual city noises are becoming unbearable."

Recently, my parents keep nagging to be about how I need to go outside and it’s not healthy for me to stay in the house.

Here’s the problem. I love outside, but I’m terrified of seeing people. It’s not even because this virus is going around, but I’m afraid I’ll see someone I know when I’m outside and I often get embarrassed and I’ll feel like they’re judging me. I’ve told my parents this before and they don’t listen. But this ‘fear’ has been with me for a while now, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m coming on here because there might be someone who shares the same issue, any suggestions? Something I can do to get over this? Thanks"
1202,Help with my (20F) OCD and eating disorder,"For the past 7 years I have struggled with eating disorders and OCD. When I went into intensive treatment for my anorexia in 2015, I fell into severe OCD. I withdrew socially for many years out of fear of disturbing my routine, ate the same foods every day at the same time and suffered emotional bursts of crying whenever my daily routine was broken. When I went to college, this continued and sparked up again last year with daily intrusive thoughts which forced me to not attend classes or social events. I was able to fix this by moving into an apartment where I could control my lifestyle more. I'm currently a college student whose education has been impacted by COVID-19. My day-to-day has been dramatically altered and I once again find myself struggling with behaviors. I have severe anxiety on a daily basis which has forced me to drop courses and reduce work hours. I cannot sleep and have a decreased apatite. I also have been withdrawing socially and I feel like I cannot be intimate with my boyfriend of 2 years the same way I have been because I am too caught in my anxiety. I convince myself I have medical ailments (COVID-19, pregnancy, skin cancer) and have other dark thoughts. It has gotten to the point where I want to re-enter my eating disorder to handle the OCD and provide some control in my life. Are there any suggestions for helping with this behavior? I feel like I have gone 7 years without facing my real problem."

I can tell that right now I have gotten even worse than I was just a month ago, that now I am so much worse than the original person I used to be. Food isn't really enjoyable anymore, my gaming is just a way to spend time instead of actually having fun. I don't want my life honestly I just don't want it anymore. nothing I do anymore makes me happy, just everything is forced. why am I even here? why? I wish I can be dead honestly.

1206,Staying present,"I have a problem with staying present and paying attention to my surroundings. It's been a small problem in my life for as long as I can remember, and I'd like ideas to improve it.

A major manifestation of this problem is while driving. I pay attention to the road, but not well. I've gotten into a couple car accidents because of being too far in my head - both times, I was turning, and I know that I looked, but my mind didn't register anything even though there was a car right there. I'll either be lost in music or thinking about something - hypothetical scenarios, which lane is the ideal lane to be in, trying to memorize the street names and layout, analyzing some political issue, etc. I don't know how to turn it off.

I'll physically run into people because I don't notice them. I can't concentrate on movies, so I've stopped watching most of them. I can't concentrate on college lectures that aren't very engaging, so I just read the textbooks. That's been fine for me. I can read, since I can pick up where I left off if my mind wanders.

I know I don't have ADHD, since I haven't had many problems in actually getting things done. I've struggled with depression, so that might be some little known symptom - but I usually don't feel depressed when this is happening. Quite the opposite actually. Any ideas on how I can improve this problem?"

Just wondering how many other redditors have had this experience"
1208,I feel completely alone and helpless during quarantine,"So, while I’m not completely alone currently, I live with my family, I feel completely alone. To begin with, I am diagnosed with clinical depression and I’m a major introvert. 

I don’t actually have any friends, like, at all. I haven’t talked to anyone other than my family for months and I feel like I’m beginning to crack. I’ve clearly taken for granted the value of human interaction and it is having a major impact on me. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything at all. I haven’t played a video game in weeks. I’ve been incredibly inconsistent with playing guitar. Those are both my favorite activities. 

I really think that not talking to anyone who I can relate to is having the biggest impact on me. I can tell I’m going through a major depressive episode during quarantine. Fuck, the temporary excitement I got from impulse buying a $900 guitar has faded (I still love the thing, don’t get me wrong), and my glee for passing my calculus ii final exam with a perfect score was ephemeral. 

I’ve tried remedying my social situation by going on tinder of all things. Not getting matches at all is a serious brick to the head of my self esteem. 

Sorry if this post was haphazard and seemed to bounce from topic to topic, I can’t even seem to keep my thoughts straight anymore for fucks sake."
1209,my non existent inner voice.,"Since quarantine i’ve been on my phone more than usual (which is obvious given out situation) but that’s doesn’t really matter. Anyway, a couple days ago i was watching a video of a dude asking his friend in which voice does he read his text in, like what does his inner voice sound like, and as i watch the video i realize that i don’t even have an inner voice and i don’t think i’ve ever had an inner voice. just the other day i had to make one up out of nowhere because i don’t have one. the way i talk to my self is quick, even as i’m writing this i’m trying my hardest to figure out if i “hear” something , which i don’t, i mean i have realized i have some anti social behavior ( the one related to sociopathy, narcissism etc),band before you ask no i’m not a psychopathy as i have clear memory of genuine sadness and laughs, but lately my emotions have been sort of blank... i mean i do have genuine laughs like the other day i was crying from laughter, but any thing other than that it’s been blank. what’s your take on this?"
1210,I feel lost and feel as if i have no purpose,"I’m trying

but? I find nothing enjoyable.... I can’t play games like i used to, and i feel exhausted even thinking about working on my projects....

chores and responsibilities are daunting and exhausting

i have nothing to say to my friends 

i honestly don’t know if i even care about what i’m going to school for, but i already spent so much money on it i don’t want to quit 

every moment is painful bc i feel like i have no reason to be here, that i’ll never find one, and any of my passions i have or will have will eventually be burnt out by my depression

1211,Sometimes i feel like going to college/grad school was the biggest waste of my time,"28yo, unemployed. Completely lost and suicidal. Four years ago this month I graduated with straight As and a STEM degree. Two years later I was mastering out (dropping out) of my phd program. Had gone in with 100k+ in grants and all i have done with the last two years of my life is work for practically minimum wage in retail.

I cant get a job anywhere that pays even half ok. I have been told that my experience doesn't warrant even $15/hr. I never thought my labor was so worthless. That i was so worthless. People called me talented but now i realize that Im really not. Im Asexual and aromantic. I dont want kids or to marry. Most of my family is dead. I see no future. Nothing that could bring me joy. Nothing to live for. I dont know why i bother living day to day. Im just a burden on the world. 

I really want to work, i had always been a hard worker. To help. I used to volunteer a lot. I loved helping people and learning. But no one wants me. Living on 11/hr and doing my best but struggling to pay rent was so upsetting. I even ended up doing odd jobs, cleaning, babysitting, sleeping with some men for money. Now getting a job is even harder. 

I feel like im such an asshole thinking im ""above"" working as a grocery bagger because i went to school. But wtf where those 7 years of school and 30k of debt for? To make less than the other grocery baggers that started right out of hs"

If you have OCD but you think it's mild and then you start having hallucinations or ""symptoms"" of other illnesses it is NOT schytzofrenia it is the OCD. Ocd is a form of psychosis and can cause many many different types of symptoms that will mimic what you think you have and it will stress you out to the point of thinking you have something for years even if someone gives you proof of not having it."

I am trying so hard to help out around the house and just generally be better but right now I feel like I can’t do anything right. My moms recovering from surgery and I’m the one taking care of her and I feel like an idiot. She keeps yelling at me because I do everything wrong and even though I’m trying really really hard to do everything right  I feel like the worst caretaker ever. I have to ask so many questions about how to do things because when I try to figure them out on my own I always end up doing stuff wrong and she’s told me a million times to ask for help but I can tell she is so irritated with me when I ask her questions. Im trying to order her medicines and I did everything wrong. She’s probably had to yell at me 5 times today for messing something up that I was trying to help. I’m 23 but I feel incredibly incompetent. When I’m with my friends, at college, I feel the same age as them. I feel normal and not any less competent, maybe more competent in some areas even but then I get home in the real world and I can’t even comprehend what my mom is telling me to do half the time. I am so nervous and stressed that I annoy her more and when she yells at me I am extremely sensitive and have trouble shaking it off."
1215,Seeked out help,"I wanted to kill myself, I had the knife in the hand, and was ready to shove a knife through my eye. My best friend called me and calmed me down the best she could, unfortunately because she was at work, she couldn't do much, and had to go. But even so, she called me while she was at work, supposed to be working, (obviously). That moment made me realize how much she really cared about me. I've always had doubts due to previous friendships never working out, but in that moment, it sunk in how much she truly cared about me. I dropped the knife, and went to my mom. Without hesitation, I told her I wanted to kill myself. 2 days later, I admitted myself into a hospital to get help. That was the first ime I truly tried to get help myself. Sadly the institution was really, bad, and I had a terrible experience. But to me, the important part is a seeked help for myself.

But I also don't want to say anything to soon, in case I scare them off.. but then I don't want to say and they just think I'm ""weird"".

1218,Need help dealing with suicidal friend,"I’m at a dead end on the best way to help a very close friend. He is depressed, anxious, bipolar, and I believe he has told me his therapist (when he was going) was questioning schizophrenia. 

Brief summary of his childhood (26 years old) is that he had an abuses father and had to stand up to him quite often to protect his younger brother and mom. They finally separated and the father has tried to commit suicide twice. 

The situation over the last 6 years has been based around a girl who he loves. They have never dated, and have only consistently talked 4 or 5 times. She will come around every couple months or so and do very small things that makes him believe that if she would just realize it, they would be perfect together. So yes she has lead him on in the passed, but as someone who has seen and heard all the text and convos, she does not mentally play with him as much as it sounds.

This girl has drove him to believe she doesn’t like him because of his reckless past that was a result of his childhood and it tears him up. He will have episodes of severe suicidal thoughts over this situation. 

He has recently reached out to this girl to tel her everything that weighs on his mind: how much he loves here, how he is different now than the last, and how he just wants the best for her. Including feelings and things that she doesn’t know about him. She did not reply but messages a different friend and inquired if she should reply to him based on what state he is in.

Now he wants me (a closer friend) to talk to this girl and tell her everything. I am scared that she will hear it all and it won’t change anything and that result could drive him to a lower place than ever

Some one please help with any advice or knowledge you have on how to deal with someone who suffers from these conditions.

He has said that if she does not “come around” then he still could not start the process of getting over her."
1219,My story (strong subject matter),"Hey, I guess this is me trying to get this out of my own head and tell people my story, in case anything where to happen to me. My name is Liam. I'm 16 years old and I live in an average sized town. For as long as I could remember I've suffered with some kind of emotional or mental health irregularity. I've always has anger issues and sadness issues Aswell. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in third grade, that was the first of my many diagnoses. When I went into 4th grade we moved to a different part of the country. It was scary to me and I had lost everything. All my friends and family were now thousands of kilometres away. That's when I began to be depressed. I remember when I was in 4th grade I tried hanging myself, at only the age of 10 I wanted to end my life. Life has been grim and I've always been bullied, I saw teachers and attended therapy and it's never stopped, fast forward à few years to grade 7, I got my first girlfriend. We dated for 2 months and then she left me. I didn't take it like most people do, I had suicidal thoughts and attempted it and was consistently sad for so long, I didn't move on until 2 years had passed. I was then diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I dated this other girl and we split because it wasn't working out for either of us. Then I met this girl, we'll call her blue. Blue had opened my eyes, she supported me and I supported her, we clicked instantly and we were so happy together, we were always on call with eachother and we always texted. She was the light of my life and I couldn't imagine the world without her. We had fights and disagreements as any couple would have. Soon after we started dating I was diagnosed with BPD(Borderline Personality disorder), then I got diagnosed with OCD and PTSD. Fast-forward 6 months into our relationship. It's January and things get Rocky between us. I notice she's changed, she's madder, she's more ireatible and she's blaming more and more things on me when most of the time it wasn't my fault. Things were rough but we kept going. In February we went to this weekend event thing together, it was fun, we did activities and we laughed together. A few weeks later we took a small break because tensions were raising. Getting back they were only worse. I went and watched her taekwondo game where she got her black stripe. I was so proud of her, I hugged her and kissed her. They would be the last. We broke up a couple weeks later. After 8 months of the happiest times of my life, she wasn't the same person. Alot of her friends tell me what happened? Like we looked like we would get married one day and to tell you the truth I thought so to. Then they started telling me she's a complitely different person now. I wasn't the only one seeing the changes. I lost my girlfriend and my best friend and so many others lost her too. She doesn't care about anyone anymore and she hurts so many people. I thought it'd be the end of it but she stuck around and I was happy she did. But she hurt me over and over blaming me for things she can't blame anyone for. It hurt, I've tried to commit suicide 13 times because of her and how she has made me feel and she continues to find ways to make me feel guilty about myself. I got wuth this other girl, this amazing girl, well call her butterfly, she was kind and caring and everything I wanted. But then she learned I wasn't fully over blue yet. She broke up with me after 3 weeks and delete me off of litterally everything, she deleted every comment she made about me on insta every single trace of me gone. All I wanna do is help people and multiple times a day I'm out down my so many people. For those of you who don't know people with BPD don't do breakups too well. I'd do anything to get butterfly back but she's talking to another girl now and she doesn't want me in her life. On top of that no one will ever message me anymore. I just want friends to talk to and joke around with. But no one awnsers, no one stays in my life. I'm not exaggerating when I say only 1 person gives me any attention. I've lost all hope and honestly I just want my pain to end. I've been through so much that I didn't even mention for the sake of length and this is already very long. Although it's nice to get out of my head. If you're reading this and you made it to the end, thank you for giving me your time and I appreciate you listening to my story, I hope you're doing well. Thank you"
1220,Too attached to my fictional characters.,"Too attached to my fictional characters.

So, let me explain. I created a series with AJ, when I was a young child. We would turn off the light and narrate what happened with our particular characters, if that makes sense. And we did that every night, for seven years, until eventually she told me that she didn’t want to do that anymore, mainly because she loved it too much. And this destroyed me, I couldn’t do anything, for days. To others, it may have seemed silly, but to me, they were real people. Imagine your whole family dying, but no one held a funeral or acknowledged your pain, imagine how you would feel. Well, that is how I felt. You see, in my family, we were very isolated, meaning we didn’t even contact anyone outside the family, growing up. It left us all with poor social skills and just helped to further our obsession into a fictional world. And that world, well, it still seems so real. I know my characters like the back of my hand, heck, I despise even calling them characters, because they were more than that. I feel like they are in some kind of limbo, just stuck in my head. I haven’t been the same since I lost that world. The few people I know, even noticed it, they know I am not okay, but they just get bitter at me. I don’t have any emotional energy to deal with anyone. Half of the time I am exhausted from dealing with the pain William (one of the characters) is dealing with, I tell myself he isn’t real, but I can always feel his pain, in my head. I just want to help him, I can’t stand his pain. But AJ ending that series didn’t help me, I’ve tried everything to forget, but nothing helps. I’m done, I can’t take it anymore, I genuinely can’t see a reason for living if I can’t overcome this. I have isolated myself from everyone, and everything, just trying to ease the pain. That world never got a true ending, and even if it had, I wouldn’t have been able to bear it, because I would feel like they were dead. They are my bloody family, in my heart, and no one will ever understand that. AJ wants nothing to do with me, because I am such a horrible wreck. It’s been so long since she has stopped the series, but as time goes on, it only breaks me more, not less. My whole life, I was so immensely close with AJ, but since we stopped, she said so herself, I am a bitter old man that has nothing in common with her. She doesn’t think we are even close, anymore, and I have lost the sense of humor, she used to adore. I mean, I can be doing great, and the second I get up, William reminds me, he reminds me that he is all alone and there is nothing I can do to help him. I just want him to be okay, and I can not help him. It’s gotten to the point where I never have a moment where I am happy. And now everyone in my life has pushed me away, because I am so unpleasant, so unbearable. I can’t live like this, I can’t do anything. God used to give me hope, but as I force myself to read the Bible, it is starting to give me less and less hope. William and the rest of my characters consume my every thought. It’s not just a little fan-moment for a character. It’s so much more, it’s so unbearable. I grew into this attachment, through every nightmarish memory of my childhood, every time I cried, because I was all alone, I knew that when I turned off the light, AJ and I would be in a different world, one with people that actually meant something. I used that world to cope with every loss, in my life. I am not the person I used to be, its like getting a tiny cut and then over the course of a long time, it turns into a head-to-toe infection. Please, I need advice, I need anything, I am at the end of the rope and I can’t go on anymore. All of my pride is in the gutter, I have nothing to lose anymore."
1221,"Today I realised that I don't hate people, I hate myself","Hi all,

I've been feeling very down lately and as though everything is on the brink of falling apart. Right now, I think I'm at my lowest. I've been having intrusive thoughts again and I'm doing my best to combat them, first and foremost by refusing to act on them. I realised today that for the past year I've been using hatred for other people as an excuse for my own difficulties in communicating with people and being able to spend quality time with them. I'd get angry because I couldn't defend my strongest convictions in a topic that I'm supposed to be well-versed in (after all, it is what my degree is in) and displace that onto the other person. I've spent so long building up this narrative of everything external to me being deplorable that it makes maintaining satisfying relationships and spending quality time with people extremely difficult. Now that I'm alone and everything feels on the brink of collapse, I realise that the issue is not with what's external to me but rather because of what's internal instead.

I needed to vent this. Really badly. Thanks if you read it. I hope that I can take this new information and use it to better get myself some help."
1222,I did it,
1223,What’s wrong with me,I sometimes feel like I need to get help but I only get these feelings when I’m going through a really low time such as now. Majority of the time I’m really happy and have no worries even when there are things I should be worrying about and I can do anything like clean the whole house do all the dishes and laundry and cook 3 meals a day and still have energy. I mostly always feel great and happy with my life. Then every now and then like every few months I will go through this horrible time where I have no energy and no appetite and I need to do stuff like shower and clean but I just don’t feel like it and get mad at myself for not being able to. Then when I don’t eat I end up losing weight and feeling gross and getting headaches. I just feel like everything is crushing me and I worry about all my responsibilities and I don’t want to be around anyone and even people talking too loudly near me makes me feel so irritated and frustrated I want to cry. I feel bad about it but when I get like this I just want to be alone and in peace and quiet. I noticed this time the low period happened right after I went through a stressful time and I got so stressed I felt like I had a mental breakdown and couldn’t stop crying and I couldn’t breathe or control my breathing and it made me freak out more until I just tried to make myself go to sleep. I felt okay the next day but then I started feeling really low starting a few days ago. I’m not sure what to do because I know if I just wait a few weeks I will be back to normal and be happy and productive again.
1224,24 y/o depressed and have been stuck in a funk for a while.,"I have been stuck in this weird funk for a few years. In thw early years of college i felt good, confident, and was studying like crazy and just paranoid about getting any low grades. These past few years for me at least feel like a train wreck in my brain. I have one more year of undergrad. I have been a little addicted to weed and I gained a lot of weight, plus im just very lonely and cant get a gf. I still dont even really know what to do with my life. Im a good person just dont know what the hell im doing wrong to not be lonley and all this. I look at youtube and what everyone tells me to do but it doesnt make sense. I dont want to be lonley anymore and have no idea how to find someone. I feel like i will never find myself and what i will do for a living nor have a family."
1225,Looking for somewhere I can get some support? [Bipolar] [PTSD],Hope everyone is doing okay during these difficult times. I am a 23 year old female. I have a list of differential diagnoses and a handful of professionals who can’t quite figure me out. I experience a great deal of disassociation and psychosis but not enough delusion to be labeled schizoaffective. I had to move back in with my parents 5 hours away from my home. I just don’t feel like I’m human. And having to be in this reality gives me a lot of anxiety. Being so isolated and without purpose due to quarentine has heightened this anxiety significantly. I used to manage relatively well most of the time but now it is crippling. I spent most of my day focusing on breathing while staring at my phone screen trying to stay calm. I feel I have overwhelmed my friends and family in the past so I try not to weigh them down with my issues. I also know that if I tried to reach out to them for help they would just be confused and unable to comfort me. I was just wondering if there was a discoed or subreddit or something that could connect me with people like myself. I haven’t really found a mental health group I connect with. Thank you for reading my post.
1226,"It’s not that I want to die, it’s I wish I was never alive","I’ve been feeling really awful lately and I haven’t been sleeping properly for weeks now. I have a history of having suicidal thoughts but I never did anything about them because I didn’t have the guts to (but I did have a phase where I cut all the time). I think I realized that the reason I never did anything about my suicidal thoughts is because I don’t want to die but I always wish I was never alive. I don’t even know if I’m making sense I just wanna know does anyone else feel the same? What should I do to stop thinking this way? 

PS this is my first post sorry I don’t really know how to post yet."
1227,Should I just quit my job?,"I guess I'll give a little background. I'm a 21 year old woman. I live with my boyfriend of 5 years. Right now he is unemployed due to the pandemic, but he receives unemployment. I dropped out of high school and got both my GED and license last year, a little after turning 21. So I was a little behind in life. I guess I still am.

Anyway. For awhile I had been working basic customer service jobs. First job was at a DVD rental store, then a chicken wing joint, and an arcade. I stayed at the chicken wing joint for a good 2.5 years, then I got sick of it and left for the arcade. After working at the arcade for about 6 months l got a better job at a bank. I thought I was going to love this place. The training was awesome. Then I got into the branch. I dont know if it was just me. But I just hated it. I woke up dreading work everyday. I did not want to upsell different loans and accounts. I hated having to pry into the members lives. So after about 2 months of being in the branch I called out for like 2 days in a row. Then I quit. And I didnt leave a notice. I had always given notice before. I just felt miserable. I would spend my lunches crying. 

So after I quit, I spent 4 days looking for a job. Then I found this job I'm at now. At first I liked it a lot. I like the things I am doing. But I feel like they havent given me the proper training and it stresses me out. I also have to present a slide during a meeting which stresses me even more, which I know is ridiculous. I know that my fears are irrational but I just cant stop. 
I really do think that they havent trained me enough though. I am handling their new hire paperwork and enrolling people in benefits. And I havent had any training on it. There are notes in the computer that a previous person in my position wrote out, and that's what I use as a guide. I have never done these things before. I worry that I'm possibly missing forms or SOMETHING, because I simply don't know about it. And I know that I can do my own research of course, I guess I just thought I would be trained a little bit. So once again I've been back to feeling that dread. I dont know why but it's like the thought of presenting that slide set it off. So yesterday I called out. And today, I basically did a no call no show. I have never done this before. I feel like such an idiot. I was going to go in at 8 am today. I was pretty upset, so I stopped into a parking lot and decided to sit there for a bit and go in at 8:30 instead, which would have been fine. I was talking to my mom and she mentioned that you can get unemployment whether you're fired or you quit (I was worried about getting fired for calling out yesterday) so I decided to look that up. I didnt get far with the unemployment, but I decided to call my hospital and make an appointment with a behavioral health counselor. They told me they had an appointment at 9. I asked to call them back and called my mom to ask what I should to. I realize now that my mom probably doesnt gove the best advice. She wants me to be happy, so of course she will tell me to take that appointment and just not go into work. She doesnt want me to go in when I'm balling like that. So I called back and took the appointment. Well, apparently the lady who I spoke to was wrong, they arent able to schedule appointments with such little notice. So I had to reschedule for friday. So I basically didn't go in for nothing. My boss called me and at first I didnt answer. But I called her back and just kinda told her how I was feeling as best as i could. I didnt really mention the lack of training, which I should have. But I have before. I just told her that I've been feeling really upset and I'm not sure why. She asked if I was quitting, and I told her that I dont really know. She told me that they like me a lot and they see potential in me. And they dont want to waste the time and training (bullshit) that they have invested. So she told me to give her a call by 4 pm today and let her know what I have decided. She was so nice. 
I feel so terrible. I have held things up by calling in these past 2 days. I feel like ive fucked them over. I feel embarrassed. I feel crazy. Sometimes I feel like I will never be happy at a job. But I would enjoy this job so much if I were properly trained. 


I guess I dont really know why I'm posting. Maybe just to get someone else's opinion that isnt in my family. I don't know if I want to quit. I really dont want to make this a habit. I just dont know what I'm doing right now. I feel like I am a rollercoaster. Any input is appreciated.  You can ask any questions. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read through this"
1228,feeling depress as he**,"Hey reddit family, I am going to vent because I don't ever express myself to others but here I goes, last night my ex boyfriend from 7 years ago texted me and asked me if I wanted to hook up with him I told him NO, im ok. and then he starting talking about how I am not humble and im the least humblest girl he's ever been with and all my life nobody had told me this and I feel so down because my ex is throwing shots at me because I didn't want to see him or have s\*\* with him. But in a way it seems like he was playing mind tricks with me because he told me ""you always let your guard up, im just trying to be your friend, your mental health is really bogus"" .. and this hurts me because I don't even know him its been 7 years and why would a guy tell me these things? and then hits me with ""your mental health is bogus"".. all because I didn't want to talk to him or have se\*

I told him, in order to have a healthy mental health is to let things flow, not get caught up in the material world and nourish your soul.. he told me ""see you say those spiritual things to cover up your mental health.."" from there I just stop responding. This guy really came out of no where after 7 years and try to throw shots at me. This made me feel a bit sad that a guy who just say things like this to me.

Perfectionism for me means being emotionally attached to a very specific outcome/object/job/idea of how the future should be. Any sense that I might not get this thing causes me to feel super anxious. It causes me to think about the thing non-stop. It causes me to desperately attempt to control myself and the world around me in order to get this thing. 

But I’ve figured out a great strategy for loosening these emotional attachments to “perfectionist things”. Read on and let me know if you have any questions....
————

Attachments to a perfectionist ideal. This is an inflexible attachment. It is rigid. Anything other that perfectly getting/keeping the object is acceptable. This causes tons of stress. It causes tunnel vision, focused on the perfectionist ideal. It causes controlling behavior.

—————
This rigidity about what needs to happen, is caused by a fear of the consequences of it not happening

A rigid belief that everyone needs to be happy throughout your dinner party, is caused by a fear of what would happen if someone wasn’t 

To allow this rigid belief to flex a bit, imagine what would actually happen if one of your many guests temporarily wasn’t happy. Maybe they show up in a bad mood. Maybe they don’t love the meal, but the others still do.

Would this really cause the sky to fall?

Probably not. It’s probably not as bad as you feared. Not to say it wouldn’t be a minor annoyance. Not to say you wouldn’t prefer that everyone be happy. But if someone wasn’t happy that night, would it destroy you?

Hopefully After realizing this, you can relax a bit and enjoy the party you’re hosting. And people will like you more when you’re relaxed and living in the moment anyway



When have I been inflexible?

On the date with that British chick. I need her to like the meal. I need to go in for a hug when I first see her. I need to be at a small table not a big one. I need her to like my jokes. I need to be smooth. I need to have my breath be perfectly minty. I used mouthwash three fucking times. I need her to agree to grab a brew after dinner. I need her to like me. I need to seem confident

The fire pit needs to be out in the open. Doesn’t need to be I guess but that is the most dope spot, I’d prefer that.


I need to learn russian during this quarantine. I need to study every day. 

I need to wake up and run every day

These are examples of inflexibility, but what does it look like when I am flexible?

It’s like being in Europe at a hostel, going with the flow. Doing what I want to do. Not being too hard on myself. Standing in the berlin station, free to pick any train I want in any direction. It’s the best fucking feeling in the world.

———————————————-

perfectionism, rigidity. These are just strong attachments to a very specific outcomes. The outcome absolutely has to happen in its entirety. No room for error. I’m not ok with an alternative.

——————————

The very nature of strong Attachments is perfectionist. “I need to hold onto this object” “I need to make sure this outcome happens exactly” 

The more you acknowledge that it won’t actually be permanently catastrophic for you to lose the thing, the more flexible and loose you become.

Less mental power diverted to obsession, more left to use in the moment. Less extreme negative emotions. Less futile controlling behavior. 

More capacity to do what you want

—————————
Perfectionism is a pretty good way to explain attachments. Perfectionism is the nature of how you behave, because you believe you NEED the object/outcome/thing in its exact form.
————
Perfectionism sucks. Perfectionism leaves you in a state of perpetual suffering, always feeling that you’ve fallen short.

Perfectionism captivates your mind. You have trouble concentrating on anything except the object/outcome/thing that you seek. 

Perfectionism causes you to engage in behavior that others find annoying. Like constantly trying to make others happy. Micromanaging employees. Saying 15 times during dinner “baby are you ok? You seem upset”. 

Perfectionism about making others like you leads you to lie to others in order to avoid hurting their feelings, even if what you need to tell them is important.

Perfectionism causes you to engage in behavior that is unattractive. Like only being nice, and therefor being dishonest. Or the opposite, like bragging to get everyone to like you. Like trying to act tough. Like trying to act funny, not because you enjoy being funny, but because you think it will make other like you.


Perfectionism is caused by a very strong attachment to an object. Weaken this attachment, or make it more flexible, and you will live a better life. All the negative perfectionist shit listed above will lessen. You’ll be more effective in relationships, work, school. Because you’re able to concentrate on things beside the object. You’ll spend less energy controlling everything to get the object, Instead controlling what you can and letting go of what you can’t. So you’ll use your finite physical and mental energy more efficiently/effectively. Leading to more success.

You’ll feel better too! The constant suffering will fade, because you aren’t thinking you’re always behind where you need to be. You won’t always feel like there’s something you need to do. You’ll be able to mediate more easily, with a clear mind. No longer captivated by the urge to control, fix, figure out, work on, accomplish things related to your object.

You’ll be more content. And you can take up a hobby, maybe retire early if you’ve got enough saved. Take a vacation. Take a vacation from forcing yourself to make friends. Take a vacation from trying to “pick up” girls. On this vacation you can listen to music, watch movies, enjoy great food, explore yourself and your world. Learn more about what you love, what your interests are, what your preferences

Once you’ve loosened your perfectionist attachments, the world is your oyster."
1231,I'm seeking advice on what may be causing my symptoms.,"I understand that I should seek out professional help and that the opinions that I am requesting are not coming from a medical professional. I struggle with feeling judged. I'm here so that I can better understand what my symptoms may add up to so that I then can look for a professional specializing in what I have and avoid feeling judged by, and giving money to, multiple doctors. That said, here are the facts: 

I'm 24, female. 

I feel all over the place for no reason. For instance, one day, or for a couple of days, I'm over the moon, lots of laughs, wanting to be creative, feeling optimistic and like life is good, I'm reflecting and feeling thankful, thinking deeply, planning ahead, wanting to start all of these new things like healthy/exercise habits, journaling to stay organized, setting up a routine for simplicity, fun hobbies like rollerblading, etc. When I go out and run errands on these high days, I'm aware that I feel like people are watching me but I don’t care what they think because I feel good about myself, etc. I go to bed that night feeling accomplished and great and then BOOM. No leaving the bed let alone the house. Mildly paranoid that I'm not likable, overthink things I say, insecure. I feel like I'm running out of time and have screwed up my life and I have failed to find my true/career purpose or am failing to fulfill my overall purpose of helping others. Self-critical. All of my thoughts feel foggy or fragmented. Even my memories feel hazy like I'm missing details or whole events that I previously remembered. I wind up in this endless loop of beating myself up for not having done things, then feeling paralyzed by the idea of failing at those things and being judged for not doing it right (even though there is literally no one here to see me try?) so I do nothing and the cycle begins again, meaning numerous cycles of this throughout the day. If I try hard enough, I can tell what is valid from what is invalid. Example: X isn't mad at me, I haven't done anything to make them mad at me, they said they're having a bad day. Conclusion: Fear of them being upset with me is invalid. This is mentally exhausting though so when I'm not working against it, my brain just runs freely with fear and painful hypotheticals. I wish on these bad days that I could just sleep all day until the next good day but I feel like I have to be productive so I go through the cycle until its 2 a.m. and try to distract myself until I fall asleep, hoping that tomorrow will be a high day. These mood swings are a day-to-day thing. No high nor low lasts longer than a few days without switching. 

History:

Previously diagnosed with: ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD. 

Trauma at age 5 and at age 16, if it matters.  

I had an ex that was toxic, controlling, tried to kill me, and stalked me for roughly two years. Might have something to do with my feeling paranoid about people watching me but it's hard to tell when that went from a normal feeling of being aware and present to being unhealthy. 

From age 16 to 19 I had eating disorders. From age 21 to 23 I suffered from chronic skin-picking. I understand from therapy that these were ways of feeling in control post-trauma/ in times of high stress for me.

I don't last long seeing any therapist. I will start to feel judged or pitied and omit, leading to them not knowing everything in order to help me and me feeling guilty for having lied, so I stop going. I don't do well thinking that there may be something wrong with me, even though I know that there is something wrong with me. It feels like getting diagnosed with something means I've failed to manage it on my own, although I know I am failing to manage it on my own, or that those who caused me harm are somehow winning, even if my diagnosis is unrelated to those events. 

I remember having severe anxiety as a child and only within the last few years after being diagnosed put together that my 'quirky' childlike ways were in fact anxiety. Example: Couldn't attend a sleepover because I was overwhelmed with the fear that my mom would be sad without me. The poor woman probably would have loved a break. My b, mom. I once thought that there was a camera in my light fixture around age 12. 

I take 50mg of Vyvanse daily for ADHD. I used to take Lexapro years ago and was taken off of it because it left me still feeling anxious, but also nauseated and my skin feeling 'buzzy' for lack of better words. Up until about a year ago, I was taking 150mg of Sertraline AKA Zoloft daily but I tapered off of it because I wound up emotionally numb with the convenient exception of intrusive suicidal thoughts that I was no longer anxious about. I don't know if that is the best way to word what I was experiencing, so, for example, I would be working or doing homework, etc. and randomly I would think of the same dialog: Someone asking where I am, another individual replying saying 'oh, she's dead/she killed herself' and this would repeat over and over in my mind while performing tasks because I was not able to feel concerned and did not care to push out the thought. Prior to the Zoloft, I never had suicidal ideations. Being off of Zoloft, I no longer have suicidal ideations. Other than those, I take Montelukast and an antihistamine to control my asthma. 

I know that I already have diagnoses and they may very well be accurate. I'm just looking for insight from those that have been treated for similar symptoms. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for reading and for whatever insight you may offer."
1232,Acute manic episode,"My friend had an acute manic episode back in 2016 (symptomatic of bi-polar) and so as part of Mental Health Awareness Week 2020 I thought it would be good to share an insight into psychosis and my experience with a vlog each day discussing a different aspect of mental health. 

Would really appreciate anyone giving the time to watch a video about his journey, hope all have a good day and stay safe!

1235,"Hello, Redditors!","I just wanted to pop in and say that I had a fan-diddly-tastic day today! So many good things had happened! Our eldest daughter's friend had given our three boys (almost 18, 16, and 10) not only an X-Box with a bunch of games, but a PlayStation with a bunch of games also! The 18 year old is now sitting in front of the TV...obsessed with Assassin's Creed 3 (I think). * Eye roll * at that lol.

Our apartment is looking more like a home and feeling like it. I love the space we have... and coincidentally, the carpet in this apartment is the same color as the carpet we'd had in the house that we had just lost to condemnation and foreclosure in 2019 and earlier in 2020.

Our eldest daughter GOT A JOB AT MCDONALD'S for the summer! They were originally paying $10/hr. but because of Rona, it is now $12/hr!! They will start her off at 20 hrs. but they offered her overnights if she wants them (the place is open 24/7) so she's looking at some serious money.

As for me... I wish I can say that I didn't have any moments of impulsivity today...but I did. We drove past a Dumpster and I didn't even realize that I was flicking my lighter as we passed it. Grrrrrr. I really need to calm myself.

I feel really good today. We had Texas Weiners for supper and laughed and the eldest messed around with her little sister and her brothers. Then the two girls and the youngest boy went for a walk and brought back snacks galore. Ah, I am set now for the evening lol.

I feel happy tonight. I had a really nice day!

Hope everyone else out there is doing ok!"
1236,Anxiety attacks,"Panic attacks are one of the worst things I've ever experienced. It’s been a minute. Had one today after getting home from my first day back at work since the pandemic. It was a good day.
I’m feeling slowly better now just sad and exhausted.
I can never explain what I’m feeling while it’s happening but this is my best description of my mind during it today.
Every worry and insecurity I've ever had comes to the forefront of my mind at once. Overwhelming fear of death, fear of life, the violent thought of the planet exploding into millions of pieces and every other disaster won't stop slamming my brain. Painful regret of 20 things I've said out loud today, and a blur of everything I regret saying and being every day of my life starting from when my anxiety first began as a child.  My past addictions. Every choice I’ve made. My wife, her hate for me. My children, me a shitty parent, the world they have to inherit. Everything on the news. Everything that doesn’t make the news. All at fucking once with no filter while I'm trying to focus on taking breaths because I'm not breathing. Short gasps are all I can manage. Everything is spinning. I can't lay down, standing doesn't help.  I can't focus on one of these thoughts, it's all of them, I can't communicate to the person in the room with me. Tears come out. The person I love gets mad, I just wanted to be able to ask them to sit next to me. I calmed down eventually alone under a bath faucet with pajamas on. I think I’m losing it."
1237,I don't know what's wrong with me,"Aaaalrighty then...  


I'm a 19, soon to be 20-year old dude from Central Europe. For a better part of the last decade, I've been having suicidal thoughts. I went through a lot of family issues, dissappointments, failures, which certainly played a part in my current state of health, but for the biggest part, I just think this is who I always was.  


I am an extremely introverted person one day but the other, I need attention and need some sort of support. I am quite oversensitive and jealous. I've got very drastic and very fast mood swings, anything I hear or do can alter my mood in a matter of a seconds and no matter how much I want it, there's nothing I can do about it.   


Mainly lately, I've been feeling somewhere between motivated and absolutely done with everything in the world. I don't think I've ever felt like this, just hanging by a thread. I wanna get over the hump and make something of myself, but 5 second later, I find myself being extremely un-motivated and just giving up. Music and work served me as distraction from bad thoughts in the past, but nothing seems to work anymore... I wonder whether I am a coward for not pulling the plug in the past, this is my first time really asking myself this question. I know it's a super-stupid thing to think about, but I can't resist but think about it over and over.   


I was never diagnosed with anything, mainly due to the fact I never went to therapy and never let anyone diagnose me. I feel weak and I don't like the thought of letting that show too frequently. I have fully opened to maybe one or two people over all those years, not even my mom knows about the thoughts I've been having.  


I'm probably not gonna listen to anything I hear from you, because that's who I am, but I felt the need to vent... Sorry."

P.S. If this helps/is relevant/necessary, I am male (and also nearly 16 like I said)

P.P.S. I also want to mention this thing I do, it’s sort of a coping mechanism. When I feel mentally drained or something, I sort of run my hands through my hair, mainly just the front part and sort of rub my forehead just to try calm me down and I hold my head in my arms sort of with my arms going behind my head"
1239,How could this pain end,"I thought so long that if I would reach out, I would be better. But I realized something: It isn't possible. No matter how much I struggle, this reality only awards me with pain. The only way of relieve is getting into another world, but even there my happiness always brought matching pain. It's beyond my imagination how I could possibly accept this reality, when everything just hurts me. I am not in these worlds, I am not special and I won't find anyone to truly love. I am nothing, only mere fragments of what someone thought to be a human being once. I need only those fake worlds as drugs to keep the pain at bay for the time being. How could someone fix such a mess as of a human being?"
1240,Panic Disorder,So I used zoloft 50 mg for about 6 months and I started feeling way better until recently with the coronavirus stuff and personal issues I started having panic attacks and anxiety again. The doc told me to try the 100 mg which i did for 2 weeks but i still have anxiety and panic attacks every couple days. My therapist think I should stick with the 100 and try to mange my symptoms on my own to make myself stronger. But when I told my doctor that I still have panic attacks he told that maybe I’ll do better on the 150 mg. Honestly panic attacks are annoying af and I really want them to stop ASAP. what do you think I should do?
1241,Anxiety Diagnosis,"Hi all, 

LONG STORY NEED ADVICE

So I recently was just in the hospital for three days because I had an exceeded heart rate and chess pressure and thought something serious was going on... long story short they did every test in the book on my heart and blood and physically I was healthy. I went back for a follow-up appointment and I felt the same feeling again cause I knew I had to go back and didn’t want to be admitted to the hospital again if they were to find something. 
The doctor did a full check up and found nothing wrong again but proceeded to ask me questions....

1. Do you constantly overthink every situation you’re in: yes

2. Do you feel like you can’t focus unless you are in control in situations: yes

And so on and so fourth.

She determined I had an anxiety attack recommended I see a therapist for anxiety.

My entire life, I have always felt anxious especially in social situations, I never enjoyed parties or meeting new people. I constantly feel like I need to achieve or I fear I’m nothing and so on.

Should I follow-up and talk to a therapist or am I psyching myself out?"
1242,"Panic attack, mixing lsd and weed","Yesterday I decided to take a tab and smoke some weed with my boyfriend. Before we started to smoke my parents drove us to get some food and I noticed I was very paranoid and I had anxiety. We live in a basement because we can’t afford to live somewhere better. It started to rain and my backyard flooded a bit because of the rain. I was stressing over this and telling my parents our basement could flood and just sort of started to over react over it. When we got back home it was still flooded but the rain stopped. I felt much better so we decided to take the tab. About an hour later I started to notice the tab kicking in. My boyfriend then offered to go out and smoke and I agreed. Immediately after taking the first hit I was gone. We finished nearly the whole blunt and went inside. We chilled, played GTA and had fun. Then I noticed I was getting increasingly more and more high and it made me anxious my heart started to pound and my chest felt constricted almost like I couldn’t breath. I immediately told my boyfriend I was getting too high and I was getting scared. He tried his best to calm me down but I was just getting worse and worse. Eventually the rain started again and it was much worse than it was before. I noticed my parents freaking out so I went to go check what was going on. Water started to flood our whole kitchen. I panicked and went into my room and told my boyfriend and I started to cry because I was getting super anxious and I was still getting higher by the minute. I told him it was because they looked worried and I hated to see them struggle. The rain would not stop. Eventually it was all making its way down to the living room. This is where I lost my shit. I started sweating then my heart started to pound I felt nauseous and I started to yell and I felt trapped. I started to hyperventilate. I ran towards the door and yelled I wanted out. My parents didn’t understand why I was acting this way and started to yell at me to calm down and to not leave the house. I didn’t listen to my boyfriend grabbed me and put me in the room he told me I was acting like a crazy person. In my mind I thought the water was covering the windows and my parents were trying to find a way out and my boyfriend was trying to keep me calm until help arrived. I didn’t listen I pushed everyone out of my way and bolted towards the door. I opened it and the rain was pouring. I told him we needed to leave because I was extremely scared. He called his mom to pick us up and take us to his house. She took about 20 minutes to come and between that time I had a panic attack twice. Everybody that was outside was looking at us like we were nuts. I swear I thought the world was ending and I was gonna die and everybody that I loved was gonna die. She picked us up and she noticed how tense and paranoid I was. The whole ride to his house I had extremely high anxiety. Once we got there my anxiety started to go down. About 3 hours later my parents took me home and everything was fine but they were curious about why I was acting crazy. I didn’t sleep all night because of my anxiety and didn’t sleep till the next day around 1 in the afternoon. I haven’t ate well in about 2 days and struggle to even drink water. I struggled to take a shower today because of the water. I don’t feel safe in my own home or even when I go outside and I feel like im a burden to my boyfriend because I’m constantly telling him I’m anxious or scared or worried about next time it rains. I constantly check the weather, I’m just a mess overall. I don’t know what to do with myself."
1243,"Suffering from social anxiety, depression and extremely lonely, please help","I am a 21 year old male I will be 22 in November and my life is just constant suffering. It has been constant suffering all through my teens as I made no friends in high school due to my social anxiety and was bullied a lot. My family have never been supportive either and shown that they don't care about my suffering. I graduated school at 18 and went to college for two years, in the UK this is further not higher education. I then chose to go to a uni at the other side of the country instead of one in my home city for two reasons: to escape my toxic family and to be able to meet friends and get a girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first year at uni went horribly, I have been extremely lonely since the start of high school but these two years at uni have been the worst of my life. I made an effort to go out and meet people, my flat mates when I first started at uni but I never had any proper conversations with any of them I just kind of tagged along they weren't really my friends I was just with them. Due to this and the fact they all sodialised with each other had long conversations developed into proper personal friendships exchanged contact details etc I slowly faded out of the picture. I used to sit in my room on a Saturday night and wait for them to go out of theirs so I could join them. That lasted almost two months then I was out of the picture. After Christmas in first year I developed deep depression. I was so alone seeing all the friends together at uni all carefree and happy and especially all the couples. Hearing the girl above me and her boyfriend have really really loud sex which felt like my ceiling would collapse on me hurt me so so much because since I was a young teenager I have desired a relationship with a girl and being so so lonely all these years. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first year of uni was so so lonely and second year was even worse. The normal people who don't have social anxiety all make friends in first year and go and live with them in second year. I had to live with strangers in second year a bunch of girls who I didn't like, only one I found friendly the rest were very OCD and rude and stand offish. Had I had the confidence to go and make friends in first year I would have lived with them instead. I have missed out on so much joy it is killing me! Instead I have had two years straight from hell! 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of first year I decided that something needed to change so I contacted a therapy centre and seen a therapist every two weeks from October to March. During those five months and over ten sessions. I never once told him I had panic attacks only social anxiety and that I was very self conscious in public which is true. However, I never elaborated at any point. He just sat there and talked to me and I just said yeah, that aside I never said anything! I have wasted all that time and money and he gave me exposure therapy tasks to do which involved talking to people at uni but didn't bother to push myself and do them. He also asked me to do skype therapy but I was worried my flat mates would hear the conversation so I said no. I then a month later said I'm going home from uni and will contact you in September for therapy but he never replied even though I wasn't asking him anything but I still would have liked a reply and my anxiety is making me think he is angry at me for not wanting to do skype. Once this lockdown ends which in the UK should be in a few weeks hopefully I can do therapy in my home city, this time I will tell everything no matter how awkward it is that's the only way these thoughts that are ruining my life will be tackeld!

&amp;#x200B;

In first year despite being extremely lonely I still managed to look after myself. I slept early had full night sleep every night ate heatlhy meals three times a day although I often got too scared to go in the kitchen when my flat mates were there and went in after they left. I also attended every single lecture. In second year I was so depressed and miserable I stayed up till 5- 6am most nights slept till late afternoon, only ate microwave meals only showered once every 4-5 days and never attedned a single lecture and skipped out on a few seminar readings too. Thus I got nothing socially in both years and only gained academic knowledge fully in first year. 

Seeing friends kills me but couples is a lot worse. I just get so scared and self conscious in public I have a really bad stutter since i am really nervous when I talk. I said I was going to push myself to join societies in second year but kept postponing it and in November I said I'll just wait till January but then didn't do it. I also get really uptight don't know if it's my anxiety. The UK isn't exactly America it isn't known for its dramatically friendly people, people here keep to themselves aren't overly loud and never smile. They will move mountains for their friends and family but are very stand offish to strangers. This made me think or made my anxiety percieve everybody to hate me which made me very angry and bitter which itself is an emotional problem like anxiety and depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

What made me have my breaking point, something that for about a year has been building. The belief that girls hate me. I am an attractive guy and in the past have had a lot of girls get giddy and smile when looking my way, girls who just see me in public but since I've been depressed girls don't look at me like that. When girls look stern or serious at me I take it personally, think they hate me and get really sad and hurt. Then I see couples and my irrational anxious brain thinks those girls would rather be with their boyfriend than me because they hate me and I get really bitter and jealous and sad, even though that is bullshit. If I talked to any girl they'd be excited since I am attractive and they'd see the nice kind caring side of me. The one time I was at a nightclub with my one and only friend I made, only because he is extremely sociable and made the effort to talk to me first, seeing all those strangers makeout and then go home and fuck made me so so so sad. I had girls eyeing me up all night then other guys who they never even looked at would walk over and talk to them and they'd make out! I felt like crying. 

Since I fucked up two years of uni, although I borderline passed second year, I only have two left and feel cheated out of the full four everyone else gets. I thought about applying for another degree since I study history and really want to do sociology, instead of joining them as I planned I am thinking of doing sociology once I get my history degree as a separate degree but I heard UK govt doesn't fund second degrees and I can't afford to pay all that in a year, it would have to be a loan I pay back over many years. I really don't want two very brief years and only a potential one year living with friends I make if things go well when other people have three even four years at uni living with friends and have many friends back home, supportive family, tons of casual sex, several romantic relationships I have none, I'm 22 almost and have missed out on so so much time and still have two years left of my degree.

This post is really long and could have gone much longer but I really need help. Where do I go from here? I have nobody."
1244,Obsessive mess of a person,"Since I quit smoking weed/cigarettes after a decade I first had a mental breakdown for months on how stupid smoking is and I very likely cut my life short. After that I got worried about the stress. And after that I got into an argument with my ex and she said some things that kept repeating for weeks.

After you're done with worrying about something you're like: but why? While you're in it though.. It keeps repeating over and over again. The words of my ex still pop up a lot and it's so exhausting to hear insults repeat constantly. So extremely depressing."

It's not necessarily causing physical harm (shes not, as far as I'm aware, inflicting physical wounds) but its still harmful to her mental health and wellbeing and does cause her significant distress. Currently we are separated from each other, about an hour on public transport, due to the UK Covid restrictions, so I'm unable to physically be right there with her which makes things a tad more difficult.
So far she has had some success with soft toys, specifically squeezing them tight and hugging them against her body, but I'm not sure if this will always work for her. I've recommended music as well but I know some music can trigger negative emotions and make her cry.
Does anyone have any harmful behaviour alternatives that she could possibly explore? Thank you ever so much."
1246,"How to cope with rumination, racing thoughts, and over thinking?","Hi everyone, we’ll as the title says I have a hard time coping with these things.... I believe I 
have some type of depression and anxiety as I keep thinking and worrying about things that in reality don’t matter or are irrelevant. For example, I keep thinking about certain time periods in my life where I felt amazing and happy  and keep thinking about how life was good and now life isn’t as fun or exciting. Another example is thinking about a certain girl in the past that I still haven’t gotten over due to the fact that I didn’t want a relationship and she did so we stopped talking. Now she has a boyfriend she loves and I’m shit out of luck and I feel stupid for not dating her in that time period. I believe I keep thinking and reminiscing on these certain time periods, because it was a great time that I wish I could relive knowing damn well that time has passed. I have tried many things from doing activities I enjoy and trying new things which helps short term, but I always go back to the over thinking and worrying. I just want to not feel this way and be actually happy and not be depressed or upset about things that happened in the past. I smoke weed everyday and sometimes nicotine just to get a feeling of euphoria. I also exercise daily and eat decently healthy but it’s still not enough. I know therapy is great and I do have that option which I will use when quarantine is over. Please any thoughts or input would be amazing. I also am an introverted personality so I have some close friends but not many, I consider most people as just acquaintances."
1247,I was finally able to organize myself at work and it feels so much better,"Since I started at my new job a couple months ago I was struggling with organizing my tasks. I get paid by hour and don't have a strict schedule. I have one meeting every day that is always at the same time, other than that I can do my work whenever I want as long as I get everything done by the time they need me to. But because I was so bad at organizing myself, I would just do things straight after they requested something new from me, which resulted in working 10 hours on some days and 2 hours on other days (I am supposed to work around 5 hours each day at this job). 

Today I left a stressful end-of-day meeting with a long list of to-dos. But instead of doing what I usually do and start all of them right away, I wrote everything down first. I estimated how much time I would need to complete each thing, and how much of a priority each thing was. Then, I did everything that would take me less than 10 minutes, and put everything else on my schedule for tomorrow in order of priority.

I am feeling much lighter now as I am neither exhausted after a 10-hour long day, nor anxious thinking I didn't work enough after a 2-hour day. I really like what I do at work, but I am finding it difficult to remind myself of this and be at a good mental state at the end of each day. So I feel like today was a victory!"
1248,What do you wish you knew?,"I'm posting this because I think replies could help out other people in the sub. The question is mainly for people who have had a mental illness, regardless of how chronic, that they've now recovered from: if you could somehow, what would you tell your past self heading into the illness, and how would this information have benefited you?

For me, I would tell my past self to reach out to someone who I could trust as soon as possible, because suffering through depression alone only made me more depressed. I wanted to become happier myself without having to rely on anyone else because I felt like nobody else would be able to understand what I was going through, and so I didn't make any progress for a long time. But looking back on it now, I think a positive person who will sit with you and listen is really helpful, regardless of whether or not they have any advice that could help you. I think hearing this early on would have helped me give my mental health the priority and attention it needed, and I would have gotten better a lot quicker."
1249,Irritated easy,"Everytime my parents get within like 5 ft of me I get so irritated and just want them to leave and be by myself and then I feel like a terrible person. They won't even do anything wrong they're just standing close to me, maybe want to start a conversation because I never talk to them but if I do I start getting so uncomfortable. And I don't want to push them away because then I feel bad but I also don't want to be near them either."
1250,Can’t get over my breakup of 10 months ago,"Just like the title says, I broke up with someone who I still love dearly. I am currently in a relationship with someone else but I find myself still thinking of my ex daily. I am not purposely trying to think of him and I thought I was over him.

A few months ago I saw his social media and saw that he is now in a serious relationship with someone and ever since that day I can’t get him out of my head.

I had broken up with him and I had wronged him In so many ways that I felt guilty and afraid that I would continue to cheat on him if I stayed.

Regardless of my infidelity he loved me dearly and wanted me to stay but I left.

I regretted it immediately and cried and have tried to get him back at the beginning of our breakup.

I was seeing the person I had cheated on him with and he found a new girlfriend within 2 months of us breaking up.

We both moved on and I regret how I’ve treated him and I know that my ex doesn’t want to be with me.

I am trying to move on and forget about him or at stop wondering about what he’s doing or wishing he was in my life because I don’t think he wants to be.

How can I get him out of my head so I can just relax and focus on the person I am with now? 

I do love this person and want to be with him I am still not over my ex."
1251,Feeling pressure to be happy makes you depressed,"We all have emotions, and a lot of them, and about 50% of those are stereotypically seen as ""negative."" Feeling like we have to repress our feelings makes us feel guilty and stressed. We don't have healthy emotional outlets, and we don't know what to do with our feelings, and are shocked when we see someone else feeling anything but happiness. It's fake, it causes mental illness and pushes aside people who are actually trying to process their emotions like a regular human being does. I hate it.

No one is happy 100% of the time. I think it's time society stops pushing this harmful agenda."
1252,(Rant) I think my depression is resurfacing,"This post is gonna be long and ranty, sorry. I've just wanted to write my feelings out to hopefully make me feel better. 

Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression at around 13 or so. I felt like I had bested depression when I was 17 and it was genuinely a beautiful feeling for me to have done so. But the past months have been tough for me. I've grown a lot, but I feel like I'm not as happy anymore, partly due to some events I'll talk about soon. A lot of similar thoughts or things I did when I was depressed are starting to resurface, I've noticed as well. 

I work as a building caretaker and the job itself drains me so much, it's just that I feel so unacchomplished working doing the same thing repeatedly. I feel like even if I make one mistake I get called out big time for it and it stresses me out worrying everyday over things so pointless. My low mood has made my performance even worse that I struggle to do something I know is super important which makes things even worse for me. I don't want to work as a caretaker, but I don't know what else I can do. I don't have any major courses done and I don't have anything I'm passionate about that I could pursue a career in so I feel as though I'm stuck here at the moment and a part time job wouldn't be able to cover my rent unless it paid above average, but most of those require some experience or certificate. 

A month ago my grandfather passed of bone cancer. Him and my grandmother are the closest people to parental figures I have. They didn't raise me, but they love me like they did and I love them as parents. 
I feel guilty thinking back to before he passed because I only ever visited him twice during his illness. I kept pushing off the idea of travelling down to see them (they were about 4 hours away by train) because I knew I would become upset if I saw him in such a bad state. I called them often but I still regret not seeing him more frequently. It pains me even more to think that my last words to him over the phone might not have even been heard by him as he was heavily sedated. 
I miss him a lot. My grandmother misses him greatly too and now she's pretty much alone in her house. I know she's upset but she puts on a brave face for my sake whenever I call, I think. 
Sadly, 2 weeks after he passed, my grandparent's cat also passed away. My grandparents had their cat ever since I was 6. I loved her too and she got me through a lot of the dark times in my past. 

Honestly, I just want to go back to my grandmother. Get a part time job, help around the house and keep her company. I feel obligated to stay in the house I'm renting though because I have have a roommate who's an old friend. He's currently working part-time and studying at college. If I move out he's kinda screwed because I pay most of the rent.

I'm gonna end this here, it's almost 1am right now and I have work tomorrow. This was more of a post for myself to write out my feelings and rant, but if you read all the way through, thank you and have a great day."
1253,How to escape from abusive housing situation,Sorry this might not be the most appropriate forum (please direct me otherwise). Since lockdown I've been stuck with people who use any information about me they can to mock me and blackmail me. I'm a uni student just trying to finish my degree but it's taking a toll. My landlord and uni aren't helping much. Just need some advice as I can't live here much longer
1254,I feel like shit for not replying to ignored posts,"I frequent this sub alot and i always spend way more time on it than i intend, every time i see a post by someone who clearly needs help and isnt getting any replies i feel compulsed to reply with my own shitty advice, just anything really to let them know theres someone out there whos listening. I end up staying up way too late and feeling even worse not being able to give people adequate advice. The only reason im posting is because its related to this sub and its affecting me.

1256,Was I sexually assaulted? Depression,"!!SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIGGER WARNING!!

Long story..

In high school I had this friend who had a crush on me, he used to creep me out but as he was mates with everyone I hung out with I just put up with it. In the early years of high school he used to bully me a bit I was a goofy 11 year old with wonky teeth, non straightened hair and obv no makeup. Soon as I started to wear makeup and bother about my appearance around 13 he added me on an instant messenger (msn) and kept hinting at beautiful and great I looked today. It went on for ages he would put love hearts on his name with my name on it. I wasnt interested what so ever I mean yeah this bit is innocent cos we was kids. I used to shower and see 50 missed calls off on my mobile off his home phone. I used to have to appear offline as he used send me hundreds of messages even if I didn't reply. I was always kind to him and let him know I wasnt interested nicely. After about a month of this he finally got a girlfriend she was one of my friends.. I was so happy for them but also happy he was off my back. (They are actually still together now) well fast forward to 2007 I was out at our local park drinking with my friends being stupid care free teenagers. And he came up to me and told me that him and my friend had broken up. Next thing I know he stuck his tongue down my throat and I laughed it off and tried get away. I sat on a bench with my friends baring in mind I was drunk as hell (stupid I know) next thing I remember is him putting his arm firmly around my neck and saying please come talk to me up here, I've always been a people pleaser and felt sorry for him considering he just broken up with his gf (and I was drunk). He then took me into a forest I can't remember what exactly happened but I know I said no but I was too drunk to care or give consent. He lay me on the floor had sex with me shoved my head down there and did things to me... I cant remember if he finished or what happened all I can remember after is stumbling off home with no underwear on. I felt weird when I woke up the next day I had never been interested in this boy at all he used creep me out and surely if I wanted him I would of done it before. I wasnt the kind of person to sleep with someone like that randomly especially as I was only 14. I just felt sick and when I saw him in school it just made me feel so anxious and nervous. I never told anyone as I didnt want to be the person who split up our group. I didnt want him to get into trouble?! He told his best friend and bragged about sleeping with me but I just denied it as I was so ashamed. I really didnt want to. I've always put myself down repeatedly thinking I'm a horrible slut over this and its something that's affected me for YEARS. I see him now dropping my kids off at school and I get that same feeling. Was this rape? I have had very bad depression/ocd/anxiety and this is one thing that keeps me awake at night still. I find myself constantly questioning if it was assault or not as I didnt run or shout or noone would believe me because I seemed to act as normal as I could to him for the rest of my high school life. I've always thought that we was just kids and he didnt know what consent was?? Please help me. I just want to sleep."
1257,Seeing a psychologist tomorrow... I’m nervous.,"I’m finally going to be seeing someone for my mental health, but it’s scaring me since my mom is so controlling. I went to a counselor last year in school, but she ended up telling my parents about my whole fucking life + everything I had told her. Then I went inpatient for an ED. When I went outpatient I was “assigned” a contact person (I don’t really know), and he also ended up telling my parents everything about me. I don’t know who I can trust anymore, my mom is so fucking controlling."
1258,Totally disconnected from myself and others,"I don't know if I can find the words to describe how hellish what I'm going through is, but I will try.
So I've always been kind of shy, and socially anxious. In school I usually had a few close friends, and that's it. About 2 years ago, I noticed that I started feeling self aware around my friends, which didn't happen before. This started to get worse and worse, to the point where when I was around my friends I constantly felt self aware and didn't know what to talk about. I also started feeling very empty and depressed, which resulted in a suicide attempt a year ago. Now, another year later, the situation has worsened even more. Now, even around my family I feel strange, every second of the day I feel self aware. My family feels like strangers, like I have no connection to them at all. I can't have a conversation anymore, my memory is terrible, and I've lost all my friends. The feeling of loneliness is indescribable, i feel like i haven't talked to another human in years. I honestly wish I had succeeded in my attempt, because this is not living, this is pure hell, infinitely worse than any depression I've had. I've given myself till the end of 2020, if its not any better I'm ending the misery."
1259,It gets better ...,"So i spent a lot of time this quarantine reading post on here and ammm i felt like this can be a place to tell a part of my life story. So here goes nothing...


So i live in west europe and was born in a pretty big family (lots of aunts,uncles and cousins yeey) with high expectations and weird traditions ( but that are other stories for another time). 

Unlike everyone else in my family i was an only child and grew up surrounded more by adults rather than children. So i was mature at a young age and socialised easier with older people( but since i was a child nobody kinda listened to me).

Growing up i was considered super weird as i was different from the way a girl “should be“( you know playing with dolls and doing other stuff like that) but this stereotypes are the only way people think in my hometown.

I was always passionate about magic, mythology  and history and was considered not normal but my childhood friends. Also i was fat since I couldn’t exercise due to a leg and back problem and my love for food.

So trough out school i was bullied not only by my classmates but by teachers, especially my geography and history teacher ( that  told me i’m weird and miserable which idk in English exactly what it means but in my language means something that has a miserable soul and life)

But the worst was my “bff” who constantly reminded me that I’m ugly, fat, stupid, a mistake and a totally miserable person. After some time I started believing her and even was thankful that despite all my issues she was still my friend. Soon she told me that if she wanted her to be my friend i had to lose weight .

So I started to force myself to puke or i would refuse to eat which didn’t help me lose weight only made me weaker and sicker. 

During this time my mother was on a course abroad and dad worked a lot. The person who took care of me were my grandparents , especially my grandfather who taught me to write poetry, paint the world and forgive the people ( he would call them the three arts of life) .

So after having enough i told my friend I couldn’t lose weight. She then told me i had to move ( as i was her desk colleague) , started to spread rumours about me being a satanic person that those magical rituals and other stuff ( and they believed her bc apparently liking Harry Potter makes you part of a satanic cult). And the worst thing was she dated my crush. ( i mean not the worst but hurt the most).

So this resulted into an alone me bullied by everyone for having own ideas and standing out. So i entered a bad state of depression (which i’m still fighting but i’m much better). So i got some suicide  ideas even  tried it twice but failed and was caught by my grandparents. So they told my parents and they started worrying and had me checked my a psychologist. 

They asked me why i wanted to kill myself and i told them because the dreams said so. I always had dreams where i die or the people who i loved died and to escape my dream i had to die. Sooo basically I taught my life’s a nightmare maybe if kill myself i’ll wake back to the real world.

So with help from some people i got better and the got really bad again. All i can say is stress + fake friendships + falling in love= bad stuff. So i had what my grandmother called a death crisis where i tried to kill myself on my birthday ( that was my last try) and failed obviously. 

Let’s fast forward a few months into a nice night on February when my bed caught on fire because of an old electric pillow and nobody but me in the whole house realised there is smoke around ( we have very high quality fire alarms systems) but luckily I survived without any physical damage. 

Of course I remained with a little trauma and some phobias and nightmares but the experience woke me up.

I went in my room and looked at my bookshelf and said i almost died and i haven’t read all the books on my shelf or I haven’t visited the whole world. And that made me go in a better place. And from then each they i gave myself a reason to live from small things like learn french to major thing like full-fill your dream and become an anthropologist/ part time writer.

Soon my parents signed me up for a extracurricular activity centre. And they became my second family. They shared my passions and supported me. Soon i made a small group of friend ( not much just a couple kids my age) and they told me i can be whoever i want to be. 

So i swallowed the fear and started being myself. I died my hair crazy colours because i felt like it. I sang on the streets like i was in a musical. I spoke my mind. I finally commented on a post. I publishes some of my story in the school newspaper. 

Of course it was a long time till i gained confidence ( and i’m still working on it) to so so but they helped me trough it. My parents sat with me or slept with me even as a teenager in case of panic attacks or nightmares. All my friends were there when I needed them like the moment my grandpa passed away or the moment i came our as bi. And now i am one year away to entering university and full-filling my dream and  everyday it’s another day that i know
I survived.

What i want to say it’s that nothing is permanent, not even pain. And no matter what gender or race or sexuality or type of person you are, you matter to somebody even if you don’t feel like it now. And yes there are going to be some clouded and rainy days in the future maybe even some storms but the sun always shines trough.

It will get better and until it will give yourself a reason even if it’s watch the Percy jackson disney adaptation or learning to count to 10 in a new language. No matter what you’ll be fine and you’ll get trough everything, we’ll get trough it.

Thank you to anyone who read my life story :) !"

1261,I don't know what to do.,"Hello, I've been quite stressed in the past few months due to an exam coming up, covid, etc. It all seemed fine but now my heart started bothering me daily. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it feels weird. Sometimes it makes my left hand hurt. I don't know what to do and I'm quite scared since I found myself at the time of writing this message unable to sleep. I must mention that I don't have any cronic diseases or heart problems."
1262,Why does this happen? When I get really sad about something and start crying all my past trauma comes back?,I went through a lot from ages 7-12 sexual and physical abuse among other things that really affected me growing up and now I'm 20 and Ive worked through almost everything it's not affecting me everyday and I've forgiven those who wronged me im happy but whenever I get deeply sad or cry a lot all I can see is the things that happened back then even if I'm sad for a complete other reason that has nothing to do with any of it I don't like it it just sneaks up on me and makes me cry even more. I just need some insight or see if anyone else has this problem and if anyone has worked through this problem I'd like to hear how
1263,I need to ask a question,"I've spent so many nights trying to find any results on Google as to what I'm experiencing and come up with nothing, so I guess the only way forward would be to come to somewhere like here and ask instead. 

Earlier today, I had a friend mention in a group chat about his girlfriend and he really went for it; ""she's beautiful"", the whole 'love of my life' speech, the works.

Other people in there were saying how it was all so sweet and that they were happy for them on their behalf but I couldn't help but feel my stomach churn as I read through the blocks of text.

I felt disgust towards it, going even so far as to feel physically ill, like I was going to vomit and the worst part is that I've felt this feeling so many times before; hell even just describing it now I feel myself getting a weird taste in my mouth like I'm getting ready to lose the contents of my stomach.

Whenever someone expresses a legitimate, positive emotion, particularly if it's one that goes beyond the realm of just a material possession, I feel a strange combination of anger and disgust towards it and I don't know why.

It all makes me feel so disconnected from everyone else and that I'm almost responsible for my own feelings of social isolation because I can't have the right reaction.

I can't find any results for the description via the internet and I don't know what it is so I'm really hoping I can get some answers; I didn't really want to come to Reddit because I thought it might not really help all that much but I've really exhausted everything else at my disposal."

1265,Sometimes I get so overwhelmed with emotion that I(20F) laugh uncontrollably at random things and get extreme brain fog for a month straight.,"Basically the title. I don’t know how to continue in this cycle! I will get so overwhelmed with life, feel trapped or just plain overcome with so many emotions, and then get brain fog to the point where I can’t comprehend things I read or what people are saying to me. Usually I find that and other dumb things (like today, my boyfriend taking an eyelash out of his eye) hysterical and I’ll laugh until tears are streaming down my face and I’m on the ground just trying not to pass out. In my mind they’re not funny whatsoever but I can’t control the laughter! I’m constantly fighting off actual crying towards the end of laughing when I’m hyperventilating. The brain fog between laughing fits will hit hard, like today when I was literally paralyzed when my bf asked if I was okay. I just stared at him and tried to will my mouth to move and say ANYTHING at all but I couldn’t do anything but stand and stare at him. 

Has anyone experienced this? Something does not feel okay in my head!"

1267,"Feeling majorly depressed when positive life changes happen, what is wrong with me?","I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD, and with the help of medication I’ve completely turned my life around. I used to get off of work from a job I hated and just cry in bed in my uniform until I passed out and it was time for me to go back. I would stay up all night worried that COMPLETELY illogical things were going to happen to me (trees falling onto my house when I slept, worrying about being in a car accident everytime I had to leave my house, worrying that everyone I know secretly hates me) I finally went to a doctor and tried a few medications, found the ones that worked and I’ve been on a great track.

I left a toxic relationship and moved on into the greatest one I’ve ever had, I found a new job that I enjoy, I bought my own car, I’ve signed for my own apartment, and I just found out today that I got into the school I want to get into. 

Everytime something good happens to me, I just feel like I have farther to fall. I’m so terrified that something awful is just around the corner and everything I’ve worked for is going to be temporary and end in a nightmare. 

Does anyone else feel like this? How do you cope? I just feel like an ungrateful bitch because I’m so sad right now."
1268,Is it normal for a psychiatrist to say someone else is pure evil?,"My sis, my dad and I [M22] have had ups-and-downs for three years now and we're trying to improve our relationship but keep having every little victory crumbled after a few weeks. 

Today there was yet another massive fight. He blames us for abandoning him among other things after our parents' divorce.

In the middle of the fight he said his psychiatrist said that my sis and I were just being evil by doing this to him and ""abandoning"" him. Which is not really true but I'll spare you the details, too much of a backstory.

Is it normal that a psychiatrist would tell something so one-sided and aggressive to someone seeking mental help from them?
How does this even help solve our problems?

Would really appreciate if someone who has had consultations with a psychiatrist or shrink could give their 2 cents on this.

Thanks in advance, guys."

My mother is a narcissist and my dad is an enabler. My relationships with both of my parents are rough to say the least, and to get away from all the stress I’ve overcommitted at school so I’m never home. With the start of the Coronavirus, I’m stuck at home (I live in New York which is an epicenter). Our family dynamics have taken a turn for the worse and I’m not sure how long I can hold out. My mother is very controlling, and I don’t have a phone or a computer to do schoolwork on (im posting from my sisters phone). Any advice on how to mitigate my stress and make life more manageable?

But here's the problem. I'm 17. so I still live with my parents. My parents don't believe in getting professional help for stuff like anxiety, depression, and ADHD. They think that it isn't needed.

I'm trying my best, but this horrible illness keeps dragging me down at every turn. I'm going to counseling, taking meds, seeing a psychiatrist, taking supplements, and so on. As it is though, I can barely function through the day.

About two or three weeks ago, my moods started to really go downhill. I got even worse than my baseline terrible mood, and my wife noticed it. Not a whole lot of support from her, although she did ask what was wrong. It got bad enough that I had to go to the hospital last week. I couldn't function, and couldn't stop crying. 

I was discharged with a referral to an intensive program, and and urgent appointment with my psychiatrist. I thought this was a positive thing, because nothing else was working up to that point. 

Since then, my wife has been noticeably more irritated with me, and we get snippy with each other quite often. Today she blew up at me because I asked her to lose the attitude (over something really minor). She said she was completely drained from dealing with me, and that I've sucked the life out of her. She also accused me of not doing anything to improve myself since I was unable to work. I was also blamed for a few other things too. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is: how do you make someone understand how difficult it is to live with this condition? How can you make them know that I'm not being lazy or difficult? How do I get someone to see that I'm in pain?"
1276,Am I truly depressed ? Or something wrong with me ?,"Have had suicidal thoughts since I was a kid, like when I’d get angry that’s all I could think about, I tried to run away and was depressed because of a medicine side effect, these thoughts of suicide and leaving everybody I know are coming back strong any reason why?"
1277,This isnt me..,"..i have no personality. My thinking has changed. Im not me anymore. 

I should just leave this house again...."
1278,People say I have everything when I feel I have nothing,"Hello,
Man what a time to be lonely

As the virus has continued I find myself getting sadder and sadder. I have felt lonely for some years now, but it usually gets distracted when I am at school. 

I am young so I know there is a lot of life still to come, but I haven’t felt happy in some time. I haven’t had a girlfriend in two years, the more I achieve the worse I feel about myself, and sometimes I get stressed about my future. 

Two years ago I left a long relationship to pursue hook up culture. As an person who hasn’t had many relationships, the idea was thrilling. To my disappointing surprise, hook up culture is not very common. I tried going on dates and starting relationships. I met a girl that I had very strong feelings for. Not to be a simp, but she was truly angelic. A very compassionate person who was genuine and down to earth and just drop dead beautiful. But, she did not want a relationship. I was crushed. I felt so bad for such a long time and eventually got over it. Even so, I was getting rejected left and right and since have been rejected at least 10 times.

Another thing that makes me really sad is how my accomplishments don’t make up for my loneliness. I am very skilled at music and recently got accepted into Stanford. While I am very excited to go there, I still find myself very empty and sad. It seems the more I do the worse I feel. I think about how someone like myself that has all these things shouldn’t be sad, but it only makes it worse. I try talking to my mother about how I am sad but anytime I get moody or down I just get told I am ungrateful. 

Everyone I’ve talked to about my feelings tells me i am young and there is a lot left for me in the future. But sometimes I really don’t think so. I want to be my best self and I want to achieve great things. But I feel that it is impossible to feel truly satisfied with myself without feeling shitty about myself. I feel that I have missed out on a lot in high school. Being a kid who is smart and likes music, there are not a lot of opportunities to party and mingle. I have a few great friends but most go to a different school. 

What finally made me crack tonight was being told I cannot go to a party (and the only party I’ve ever been invited to) because of COVID while all my best friends and people I envy are enjoying themselves tonight. I have to watch what could’ve been all night on Snapchat. 

If anyone has read all of this, I truly appreciate you. I guess all I am asking is some advice on how to deal with all my emotions and my loneliness. Sometimes I can handle myself but nights like these really make me think bad thoughts."
1279,Been thinking about all this for weeks now,"Chronic Depression sufferer here (&gt;5 years so far).

Last summer I finally sought help after realizing that that nothing is going to be solved without professional guidance and that willpower is not enough to fight chemical imbalances. The doctor prescribed me with antidepressants and by January, I was a different person. Or rather the person I used to be before depression.

I started planning on my future again and got accepted to a Master’s degree at one of the best colleges of the world, around the same time covid19 started spreading.

It just feels so weird how the tables have turned so fast. The world has gone haywire when I finally got my sanity back. All these years it was the other way around; the world was normal while I was the anomaly."
1280,Help i need advice,"Ive been suffering from mentsl illness my whole life, in and out of treatment facilities. I stopped seeing therapists because i either forget the appointment, i belive im better or whatever the excuse i make up is. I cant afford a therapist, now that im an adult i try to push these emotions, memories back but once every couple of months out of no where it hits me hard. Idk what to do. I wanna see someone but il for sure i wount see it till the end. I dont wanna be this broke shell of a person but ik its with me till the day i die. Sometimes i feel like maybe i should just.....die."
1281,So... I had a breakdown last night. Havent really told anybody the full context. I need advice.,"Last night after watching a movie and drinking, me and my brother got into an argument. I wasnt very drunk at this point in the night, but definitely still tipsy. It ended with me running out the backdoor and taking off. Ran about a half mile and sat  on a hill next to a road for like a half hour. I was barefoot and didnt have my phone or wallet or a jacket. 

I ended up standing on the sidewalk of a small  bridge holding a  6 foot mirror and aiming it at cars..

I think about it now and it sounds crazy. 

I end up throwing the mirror off the bridge and walking home feeling strange and bad. Like a full blown panic attack but like PURE 100% fight or flight mode. So i spend the walk home trying to calm down because at this point I realize I'm having a panic attack or a psychotic episode or something,

I get home and sit in the bathroom trying to calm down for like an hour. Eventually I decide to go to bed and go to get a glass of water. My brother comes downstairs and says something to me and I ignore him and he essentially called me a drunk idiot or something then he goes upstairs, So I throw the glass straight into the sink and shatter it.

I sit down for a second bleeding all over the place and started writing notes. I dont know what I was writing but I kept crumpling them up and throwing them away. then I just wrote fuck you on a piece of paper and went upstairs into my brothers room and handed it to him and slammed his door and went downstairs, 

Then I sit in the kitchen still bleeding really bad from my finger and I finally fully break down and start bawling my eyes out. i sent texts to them and my brother essentially having a breakdown. I slowly calmed down and went to the ER to get stitches and go home at like 5am then slept for 12 hours.

The full context here is that my brother is a manipulative, racist, misogynist narcissist that has told me on multiple occasions that he  does not feel empathy, hates women and thinks their inferior to men, and that blacks and asians and hispanics are sub human.

I was kind of getting close to him recently by just biting my tongue and nodding along to whatever shit he was spewing. But now I am seriously scared of him and can't even look at him. 

Earlier tonight he asked if I was still down to go on a trip with him and his friend and I didnt answer right away because I was dissociated staring at the wall he yelled my name and said I was acting like someone with autism. 

I told my parents that he is destroying me and my sisters mental health but they didnt really hear me. They dont know about the mirror and all that but they do know I cut myself and was acting crazy. 

I used to not live at home with them and i moved out a few months ago, I moved out of my parents house within 3 months of my brother moving back in bc I was losing my mind. I was alright on my living on my own, only had a few minor panic attacks here and there due to accepting a promotion at work that moved me across the country and didnt train me. But now Ive had to move home bc of coronavirus and I am dead broke and its only been a month and this has happened.

I'm scared and I cant take this anymore. What am I supposed to do."
1282,"Not sure if this is the place to bring this up but, I want to talk about it to someone about it. It’s not that serious, I just need some opinions.","I am uploading this here because, there is no one around me I feel comfortable talking to about this.

I am a Male and I enjoy bondage. Does anyone agree that it should accepted that males enjoy bondage?

Sometimes, when I home alone, I like to tie myself up and gag myself.  I enjoy being tied up and gagged which as I know is pretty frowned upon by some people. I’m looking for your opinions.  Should I feel weird about this or is it fine? What do you guys think this? Please leave feedback. Thank you for reading and listening."
1283,Break wins and existential crisis,What helps you to get through a very bad breakdown or existential crisis? It seems I’ve been ha omg one almost everyday and I’ve doing my best to write it out or meditate or read even but just can’t seem to stop it from happening.
1284,I don’t feel emotions.,"Let me expand upon this. I am certainly not depressed, I love that I feel no emotions as convoluted as it sounds. But it’s to the point I’m starting to wonder how my circle of influence takes it. I haven’t always been this way. It started close to 2 years ago far into my enlistment in the military and I just don’t feel emotion like I seem to remember. I don’t find joy in conversation with anyone. I don’t find my job rewarding nor do I hate it. I just view it as something to keep me busy. I have several friends who I suspect do not have this problem so I figure I’m out of the norm. My fiancée wonders why I’m so drab because I don’t buy into the lovey dovey stuff all women seem to love. I just find it cliched. I just exist with what I would call a lack of emotions and stress. I am by no means complaining nor am I depressed. I feel I just kinda float, and I’m ok with that. Should I be ok with that?"
1285,I don't know what to do.,"It all started two years ago my parents work abroad and because of some travel issues I had to go to school in my home country while staying with my grand parents It wasnt that bad we had youtube netflix but no video games and nothing you'll prob think I'm spoiled but just wait and the first year isnt that bad but that doesn't mean it wasn't bad it was better than the second year because everyday I would cry on my pillow just thinking of so school ends we go back to Saudi arabia where my parents work (I'm from Egypt) and my dad's contract ends in September so we had to go back to Egypt and another year staying with my grandparents yay it was pretty hard since wifi was basically shit and we had to stay in grandmas room for it to work the problem wasnt them it was me and my brother my parents had ways of raising that our grandparents and family didn't approve of and nothing me and my brother had to share a room it wasn't five stars but 2 beds and a closet and we were pretty cozy so yeah but the problem started when the coronavirus thing happened my cousin also one of my best friends, his parents were also doctors so his caught corona he survived but I wasn't scared that much except for my dad he has work all day and he has bronchial asthma and corona is a respiratory disease so the chances of someone with asthma surviving corona were lower than healthier people and that fact left me with some pretty bad mental problems for 2 weeks knowing that there was a chance that I couldnt see my dad again shocked me and my dad is like my best friend we play games together watch movies and he would always support no matter how shitty I acted to him I would do something so bad lock myself get shitty suicidal thoughts but then I would hear my dad knock and calm me tf down so it has been three months now (almost 4) since I've seen them I'm not spoiled but going from doing everything and having fun to not even going outside not even to buy a bag of chips and not being able to have fun like everyone else my friends would support me they would always get surprised at the fact that I haven't seen my parents in a while but mostly they were pretty supportive and you know experiences make you appreciate life more and I just miss waking my dad for work making him tea that tastes like shit and he still told me he liked it and making him breakfast and then we would go on trips most Fridays sometimes we play tennis and other times to the park and hang out with friends but I just don't know what to do I don't know whether to be sad at the fact I could never see them again or appreciate all the good times we had together and be optimistic and think of the chance of me seeing my parents again and I don't wanna end it all I'm not sucidial because I know there's a chance I could see my parents again and I really dont wanna miss that chance but on the good side my mum promised me that this would be the last time we would have to do this and btw im 13 so dont call me a crybaby you won't know what the importance of your family till you don't see them. 

Tl:Dr:
I haven't seen my parents who are doctors for 3-4 months I'm scared they'll get infected don't know whether to be sad at the bad thoughts or not and try to be optimistic"
1286,Does anyone else stay up all night due to paranoia?,Does anyone else suffer with this issue? How do you help?
1287,Is there something mentally wrong with me?,"Hi guys, I’m a 14 year old male. Recently I’ve just been really sad, after my breakup, and like I have no motivation for anything. I have so much school work to catch up on, and whenever I try to do some, I just zone out and don’t really care. Like I honestly don’t really care about my responsibilities anymore, and I’m starting to question why I even exist because there’s nothing special about me. All this time alone to myself has made me realize how the world literally doesn’t need me at all. And I feel like a waste of time, food, resources, when it can be going to someone more deserving. I feel like giving up, and the only thing that I really care about anymore are my friends and family. I  used to workout and eat healthy, but like now I could care less, and barely even get off of my bed anymore. I honestly would kill myself if it wouldn’t cause my friends and family so much pain. But I honestly don’t see why I still live when there’s nothing to me, and I’m a bad student. I just feel like an empty shell, because my I loved my boyfriend so much, and I felt like I found my purpose with him. Now that he’s gone I honestly don’t know what to do, and no one will ever love someone as stupid, bad student, insecure, and awkward person like me anymore. I feel like such an asshole too, because my parents always get mad at me for not doing my work, and I seriously try, but I honestly have no motivation at all. Like what future can someone like me have in the real world, I’m destined for failure anyways"
1288,Feeling like a victim because I have to stop drinking for a health reason,"Hi folks,

I'll cut to the chase. Any copying tips appreciated.

Had an abdominal surgery 7 months ago.

It's been difficult since. Gastritis. Motility issues. The whole shebang.

I tried to continue drinking socially for a few months. My doc even said a glass of wine or two once a week would be fine. But I found that even that would make the gastritis and nausea come back (just for a few yours). So I realized that I needed to do everything in my power if I was going to feel better - and that even small indulgences were too much.

Since then I've really basically eliminated alcohol. I think I've had maybe half a glass of wine in the last month. And that was to make a toast for a special occasion.

The problem is that — at 34 — I feel like a victim and sorry for myself because of this. Which is making staying off the alcohol mentally harder. I also work a ton and that feeling of ""I deserve a reward"" (a drink) is still active to some extent.

Are there any recommended ways to stop feeling sorry for myself and like I've drawn the short straw in life?

I feel like once I can move past that feeling and just accept not drinking for what it is I will have a much easier time not resisting it mentally."
1289,How to get over my deep insecurities and perceived inferiorities?,"Just as the title says, I’ve struggled with this literally my entire life, from the first time I interacted with students at school. (I’m not sure how to truly express this, as it is the first time I have, so bear with me.) At school, I would consistently lie to others about stories which haven’t  actually happened to me, and I would constantly compare myself to others, even at a young age. At a young age, my mind would constantly race with thoughts of what the other kids were thinking about me and what adults were thinking about me. This has progressed throughout my elementary and middle school days to where I have developed deep insecurities about my face, height, weight, athletic ability, intelligence, and creative abilities. I also believe I have developed pathological lying tendencies, as I literally can not stop lying to save my life. I lie about almost every single little in my life, from what I had for breakfast to when I got to school. I would lie to my counselor about my family and their achievements and such, mostly about my father.(who was abusive?) However, I believe I do this though to impress other people, I’m not entirely sure. I need help, I can’t form healthy friendships or relationships as I constantly lie about everything, and I see myself as dirt. I’m not sure how to explain it any better than that.

PS, ignore the terrible writing, I’m sorry, I’m not a very good writer."
1290,Feeling undermined or humiliated by another person makes me really want to hurt them.,"Disclaimer: I'm 24, Male, have been prescribed many different forms of medication and have seen too many therapists.

Ever since I was younger, I had a severe lack of confidence and emotional stability. For as long as I could remember, I would get offended easily and react poorly to anyone or anything that made me feel humiliated or inferior, whether it be some sort bad social encounter, doing poorly in a sport, etc. When I feel this way, I lose all sense of human decency and normally have to do everything I can to prevent myself from getting angry and physically hurting that person. Sometimes, I would wallow in self pity and beg others for validation. I have been like this almost my whole life, I'm now 24 and I still continue to experience this. 

Because I've been trying so hard to find solutions to my problems and get professional help for almost all my life, with no success at all, I'm starting to believe that this is who I am. I'm just a monster, a pathetic person who wishes those that humiliate him would simply die, and by my own hands if possible."
1291,How do you personally stop suicidal thoughts?,What are things you do or things you tell yourself to help yourself from falling into the pit of suicidal thoughts? I feel like I keep sinking further and further in the last few days and I can't get out of my head. I could really use some enlightenment before I lose it.
1292,OCD/Anxiety medication and decreased sexual drive,"I've been taking Zoloft for about 5 years now and I started taking it at a time where I wasn't sexually active, so I didn't have the chance to observe a change in sexual drive, so idk if it's because of the meds or because I just naturally don't have a very strong sexual drive it because I'm not attracted to my partner enough? I know it sometimes makes my partner sad because I very rarely feel any sexual desire, even though I love him so so much. I know that low sexual drive is a possible side effect of antidepressants. Does anyone else experience this side effect?"
1293,I tried to attempt suicide when I was 7 years old,I’m having new flashbacks and it’s freaking me out. I remember trying to tie a noose and wrapping it around the tall lamp in my room. It wouldn’t have held my weight even if I tried (which I don’t believe that I did). I’m sad that I had to deal with being suicidal that young. It really freaking sucks.
1294,How’d you guys ask for help?,"I can’t seem to bring myself to ask for help from anyone, I feel so disconnected from everyone around me no matter how close we are. I just can’t bring myself to ask for help even when my parents offer to set up an appointment. I try my best to put up a facade, but when I’m alone my thoughts get the best of me, and I can’t stop having breakdowns. I just feel like a burden, so sorry if this is a commonly asked question"
1295,I'm at the lowest I've ever felt in my life,"Hi reddit, I'll start by saying that this is the first time I've ever made or used an actual account here, my extent of reddit before this is just reddit pages on instagram.

I (F 20) don't really know where to start, other than to say that right now my mental health is at the lowest it has ever been in my life, and I am really running out of options on what to do - if I'm being honest, mental health hasn't always been something ive addressed as I've always gotten along just fine, but since this lockdown / quarantine, I have felt so helpless. I'm not sure if this story belongs here as it is also relationship-related, so please let me know if there's somewhere more appropriate for it.
For some context, I'm currently living in the UK and i come from a more ""traditional"" family background - they dont let me date so they didn't know about my relationship.


Like most people, my life was doing quite well before the pandemic; academically i was improving, I'd found an amazing friend group, and was in a new yet very happy relationship with my best friend. Come the first couple weeks of lockdown, i could feel myself slipping slightly, but nothing i wasn't used to. I managed to meet all of my coursework deadlines, and whilst i was struggling i was always glad i had my boyfriend to give me a quick pep talk or cheer me up whenever i was feeling low. However, i wont act like we were perfect, and the stress from not seeing eachother and being inside with just my family all the time i think made me more irritational, which lead to us arguing over minor things that we would never have argued about had life been normal.

I don't know what exactly caused me to react the way i did, but the day after my last deadline i had a complete breakdown - i had been arguing a bit with my younger sister in the morning, and had the slightest disagreement with my boy, not enough at all to be considered an arguement, but i just had the worst possible reaction around late after. The day before i was actually really happy, called a few friends on video call and had a few drinks to celebrate me finishing the semester, but i did a complete 180 and felt so bad to the point i was having suicidal thoughts and tried to hurt myself. I spent hours just crying that night and felt ridiculously anxious and insecure, and the next day i still felt the same, plus guilty for the way i was thinking the night before. I felt so far away from 'me' that i didnt speak to my boy because i couldn't think of how to explain it, plus i didnt want him to feel like it was his fault, as he sometimes will feel guilt if im upset even when it isn't to do with him. Because of that, i ended up feeling ridiculously insecure, and i sent him messages saying how i didnt feel like i was good enough and so on. He tried to reassure me, but the next few days i just felt really awful in myself, and felt like i was bothering him constantly. I told him one night how i was feeling really bad in my mental health and he was supportive, but two days later, when i still felt like things weren't right, i asked if things were okay and he told me that he didnt have feelings for me anymore and ended the relationship. 
It was a relationship that i truly believed would be flourishing right now had things been normal, and i saw it lasting for potentially years, but i do realise that the circumstances were unpredictable and we weren't ready for something like this, both in the relationship together and mentally in ourselves.

This all happened a few weeks ago now, and for me i feel like the sudden change in his feelings only began after the breakdown i had and was feeling low. I've since tried to accept this and just try to be friends, but the struggle for me is now that i don't feel like i have that person anymore to talk to.
I have teached out to other friends during this time, and tried to stay busy or distracted, but really there's so much one can do, and a lot of the friends i have are not the 'message every day' type, so filling in them small gaps of the day that normally would have been him is now just a whole lot lonelier.

Its kind of difficult to explain how exact im feeling right now. For me, the loneliness is the biggest takeaway from all this. The uncertainty of the world we knew before, and all the things that may or may not happen are all making me feel really anxious and worried, but the worst feeling is that I'm isolated from all my friends. Whilst i still talk with my boy on friendly terms, i feel like im getting anxiety whenever he doesnt message or responds in maybe a more 'cold' manner, and the way time is passing by it makes it feel like he doesn't like me and it'll be like this forever, when all i want is to just talk and hang out soon maybe. The way things are going makes me feel like the possibly of actually seeing people again is so out of reach, and that theyre all thousands of miles away, almost as if im left behind. 

Every time i am alone with my own thoughts they're all just negative ones of anxiety and loneliness, and the most things i can do for distraction is watch movies, because i don't even have the energy to do my hobbies or chores like cleaning my room. This quarantine is making me feel lower than ive ever felt before, and it has been like this consistently for close to nearly a month now."
1296,What's going on?,"Hey everyone, So a girl I know is suffering from something and I'm not quite sure what it is, I'll try to explain it the best I can.

She has this weird sense that someone or something is watching or staring at her most of the time, This does be when she's alone I'm not quite sure though how it is when she's with someone.

Also, At night odd times she does see these sort of shadow figures or objects moving around her room this does come and go but recently got alot worse. She texted me not too long ago today saying that it got alot worse and she ended up getting really edgy and paranoid but she couldn't explain it as it happened tonight and she did not want to speak about it.

She has dabbled in drugs a bit too but has not touched anything in maybe over 7 or 8 months, But she did say the whole watching thing got alot worse after doing them.

The closest I'm linking it too is maybe schizophrenia or a some sort of psychosis but then again I'm not sure, If anyone can help me find what the problem is and how I can help her handle it I'd greatly appreciate it.

She is not fond of psychiatrists either so I can get to go to one thanks again."
1297,"I feel hopeless all the time, like my existence on this earth is pointless.","I am twelve years old and I am miserable. Every day I think about how nobody will remember me in a hundred years, and I’d just be another nameless, faceless person lost to time. Useless. I hate feeling this way, but I can’t stop. It’s so hard to explain but I’m always questioning my own existence. I’m not being bullied or abused or anything, I just feel like I don’t matter and I never will. I want to do something to change the world, something that will make me remembered forever, or at least for the next few thousand years. When I consider the fact that I might not be able to do this, I dissolve into tears. I don’t know why I feel this was. Does anybody have any advice?"
1298,Being judged by my best friend for my mental health...,"So early this year I was at rock bottom. I was suffering very badly from an eating disorder, anxiety, and depression. I was extremely depressed. I made the decision to reach out for help. I've been in treatment for a couple months and I've been making a lot of progress. My best friend has also had very similar mental health struggles in the past, yet she has been incredibly unsupportive. 

She is on this high horse like she knows everything that's best for me and she just loves to tell me when I'm ""making a stupid decision cause you're depressed."" I've wanted to hang out with her several times over the last couple months and every time I reach out to her she immediately has some half-assed excuse for why she can't spend time with me. 

When I brought up how she was making me feel she turned it around on me and started talking about how much I had ""hurt her"" by being depressed and told me that she forgives me but ""can't forget"" about it. I acknowledge that during that very dark time I wasn't always there for her and I know that she was very worried about me and my self-destructive behavior, but I have apologized and tried to explain that I wasn't well and that I'm in a completely different headspace now, yet she seems pretty intent on continuing to make me feel like shit for having a mental illness.

It's giving me so much anxiety and making me feel so hopeless. If it weren't for the fact that she was one of my only close friends and I rely on her a ton, I might have just cut her off entirely a while ago."
1299,Anxiety hole depression loop,"I've avoided making friends since I was around 16 I'm now almost 25 and am the most awkward person in real life.  When i think i could actually become someones friend i get all shaky and cant think of what I am going to say next. 

My anxiety has gotten so bad i mess up even with my loved ones even my boyfriend of 3 years and strangers my mind goes blank.  I think it is depression effecting my brain since my doctor said that it is a symptom.  I've never really learned how to make friends in my later developmental years. I was getting bullied in 3rd grade.  I did make some friends in middle school but i never kept in touch especially since i moved country's at the age of 16. 

Since then I've only had romantic relationships which somehow seemed easier than other kinds of relationships.  Also one toxic friend group that disband quickly.  I'm worried a lot and i know that's a big part of my issue but i feel like i'm in a loop when it comes to anxiety and talking to people and then self loathing soon follows.  

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? I feel like I'm boring and that my mind has turned into mush, how can you learn these skills now I want to connect with people but I'm too nervous and im scared to invest in something that wont work out."
1300,Nights are excruciating,"I can't stand going to sleep I can't stand having everything pop in and out I need something to do so I can take my mind off it but I'm so tired and i don't want to go play games but I'm going to anyways because anything is preferable to this.

1301,We need a national mental health day or week. This is too much!!,https://youtu.be/bLbPTWf_6IY
1302,For the first time I was able to ignore my hallucinations without harming myself (F),"Hello, I'm (F) with ASD, OCD, SLI, anxiety and terrifying hallucinations that I experience pretty much each and everyday. Some days are not as bad as others. Some nights I refuse to go to sleep because I feel vulnerable and am scared the things I see will get me. For so long I slept during the day and stayed awake during the night. This went on for months and my sleep schedule is messed up because of it. I've had voices in my head tell me to hurt myself. They don't stop unless I do it and depending on how much I damage myself they stay quiet for longer. I've been sent to the hospital for self inflicted injuries twice and all the others I kept hidden from my family and friends. I stabbed myself multiple times in the hand and arm with a kitchen knife. I felt no pain. At one point my arm felt strange, like it was foreign and didn't belong there. I attempted to cut it off to relieve me of this feeling. I managed to stop myself because I knew this would not end well. Three years later and I'm still experiencing hallucinations and these strange feelings but not as badly as I once was. This particular night happened, I went to bed at around 9pm and began to hear voices and he said to me ""Stab the underside of your wrist and drag it down towards the end of your forearm."" I tried to ignore him but he insisted I do so. He yelled at me and got more aggressive. As tempted as I was to do it I knew that if I hit an artery I would probably bleed to death. As much as I wanted to be alone in my own head I refrained from acting out what he wanted. This was ongoing from around 9pm to 4am. I got no sleep and was exhausted but I couldn't help but feel kind of proud of myself for not listening to him. I just hope that if something like this happens again in the future that I will be able to ignore it and resist carrying out such acts of violence towards myself."

1304,Bipolar 1 and All of the Fun,"The last 3-4 weeks have been a roller coaster of events. My mother (who is my huge support system) was tending to my dying grandfather for 2 weeks until he passed around midnight on Mother’s Day. Funeral was last Tuesday, I drove 6 hours the day before to be there &amp; 6 hours back to be able to be at work the next day. Returned back to work Wednesday morning, worked a half day because my boss expected me back Thursday. Thursday,  my new coworker, who I’ve trained, has lunch with me. After lunch, her boyfriend shows up and convinced her to quit that day in the middle of her shift. She lasted 3 weeks. It took us a month &amp; a half to get me a coworker. Now I’m the only sales person for my company in my store. One more thing on top of my plate is that I’m seeing someone for 3 months now and they still aren’t ready to date me or call it official and refuse to tell their mother about me.


I freak out if my mother isn’t around for so long, and makes me depressed. I’m making poor choices, routine being messed up messes with me mentally, and I am miserable where I am right now in life. 

The good news is: I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and we increased my mood stabilizer by 20 mg. She, my mother, &amp; my guy I’m seeing, all agree I need to be seeing a counselor right now. Unfortunately the one I normally see doesn’t work on Monday’s or Sunday’s which are my days off. 

Any advice would be helpful."
1305,Talking to someone and they told me this...,"So a friend and I were talking about me turning down someone who asked me to go on a date recently. My friend asked me if the person I turned down was upset so I said, it tends to be pretty painful so I assume so to which they replied...

“Unless you’re into that sort of thing which I am. Rejection is like picking a scab, it hurts so good. It’s hot.”

Rejection has always been something I have feared and avoided my entire life so this statement has literally rocked my world. It actually made me a sick and felt gross. I don’t know how to respond

Anyone else feel this way or can anyone help me understand?"
1306,Question regarding sticky thoughts,"Hiya.

This is less asking for help, and more trying to gain an understanding, which I suppose is asking for help in a way.  Anyway, thanks in advance.

For a few weeks now, I've been plagued by the thought that my old therapist is a monster or alien or what the hell ever, caused by bizarre episode where her face was distorted (about two years ago); I'm not going to go into the details, simply because I'm sick of writing it.  

At a very high level, I wouldn't say I'm convinced of this, but I've hit a bit of a wall regarding ""disproving"" it, and this is not the first time this has happened.

I've spent time coming up with various counter-arguments to this idea, such as:

1. it was just a weird glitch from being tired or something  
2. I have undiagnosed schizophrenia  
3. I have a brain tumor  
4. she really is an alien

I've tortured myself arguing against her being anything non-human, and have managed to shoot down any and all ridiculous idea that my brain can come up with.  I know, at a high-level at least, that option 4 should be the *absolute* least-likely, bottom-of-the-barrel bullshit answer available.

The problem is, the thought almost... sticks.  My brain seems to be giving it too much weight relative to the other options.  Basically, I can come up with as many counter-arguments as possible, but my brain will not stop acting as if this a legit possibility.

My question is: what the hell is the deal?  If I'm not delusional, as my therapist has told me repeatedly, why is my stupid brain getting stuck on this?  Why can't I say, with certainty, that option 4 is just wrong and move on with my damn life?

PS.

I know I shouldn't even be entertaining the idea, and should just ignore it as best as I can.  I've slowly been doing this, but this is just infuriating.

PPS.

I am aware that folks with OCD can deal with sticky thoughts.  However, according to the psych that did whatever test, my OCD is actually pretty mild, so I'm hesitant to blame it on that."
1307,How do I get my spouse to seek help?,"My husband (32m) and I (30f) have been married 3.5 years and together 8. We have both struggled with mental illness our whole lives, and In my opinion, received minimal treatment. We both suffer from severe depression, he has panic attacks triggered by stress, I am adhd and he is add, he has always had suicidal thoughts and I have always been self destructive. We fight, we always have. We are stubborn and opinionated and need to be right. Perfect pair. We’ve know each other since high school thru a mutual best friend (who happened to be my ‘first’) and passed away before our relationship started. We’ve got some baggage but at the end of the day, I would do anything for him and he would me. We truly love each other but our mental illnesses have constantly stifled any growth towards resolution. I am more than willing to seek treatment, but getting him to commit when we aren’t making up after a fight i fear will be difficult and will not stick. What should I do? I know he wants help but will not seek it himself."
1308,Day-terror/ nightmare dissociation? What is this?,"My boyfriend, (who is the only alter for my girlfriend who has DID) sometimes dissociates, which isn’t too big of a deal as that’s pretty normal to both of them and I can usually help calm them down when it happens. This time when he dissociated it was pretty scary for him. 

He went into his “void” (that’s where my bf and gf can interact with each other, they describe it as an endless blackness but they’re illuminated like there’s light)  gf tried to calm him down in the void, but then a wall got put up between them he said. He described it as if he was in some monsters mouth. The walls were bloody and fleshy, while also mechanical with teeth. He described it as a night terror but while he was awake. He said it was though he was pounding on the walls trying to escape and find gf or talk to me. At this point I grew concerned and kept saying his name to help. (I’m over video chat so I can’t do much else) He eventually responds and is extremely freaked out. 

Is this a normal thing that can happen in dissociation or DID? Things do sometimes “spawn” in their void though, such as a bed or table, but nothing like this. Gf didn’t expect his though, just bf. 

He’s really freaked and worried. Any advice or possible causes would be absolutely amazing!"
1309,COVID-19 Conspiracies and My Deteriorating Mental Health," I have anxiety, depression and PTSD. I have worked really hard this past year on my mental health, and I was very proud of my progress. But during this pandemic, I feel like I am going backwards and all my progress was for nothing. 

I love my parents. I really do – they are sweet, funny and kind people. But I cannot stand them during this pandemic. My mom has studied Microbiology (so, viruses) and my dad has never gone to school. They have both spent way too much time on their phones and have fallen into the trap of conspiracy theories. They genuinely think the whole virus is a hoax. And its either a way to control the population or get us to get vaccines or chips or something to control us or it doesn’t exist at all. They have so many theories that it doesn’t even make sense. I don’t necessarily blame them – they’ve showed me some videos and honestly, they’re kinda convincing. But no, I do not believe them at all. I am finishing my undergrad with a major in Biochemistry and a minor in microbiology. I consider myself a decently smart person (with respect to biology, virology, viruses).

I absolutely HATE conspiracy theorists. Especially with something so sensitive as a virus. You have a lot of privilege for coming up with theories from home while people are dying. I have already been super anxious with school closures, staying home for 2 months, and just so much that has put my life on hold. I am genuinely really scared about this virus and what the world will turn to after this. I have lost all passion for anything I want to do. Even watch shows or reading. I can’t get myself to do any of it – whats the point. I have lost all desire to actually do anything. Showering has become a weekly thing , sometimes even longer. I used to go to the gym every day and now I sleep till 6 pm (literally). 

But with all this, I am starting to really resent my parents. ALL THEY TALK ABOUT is this damn virus. It isn’t even productive. From where I live, cases are really declining, and normally that would be something that might help me think rationally but I can’t even get that pleasure because they keep insisting it’s a hoax. They also have a goal of trying to convince me. They know I am academically smart – If they convince me, then I guess it’ll truly confirm what they think. And I HATE IT. I don’t wanna talk about the virus. ESPECIALLY if it’s a damn conspiracy theory. They think **I am the one that’s naïve.** They grew up in countries where the government can never be trusted. None of it makes sense. Our government has spent MILLIONs to allow people to stay home – they are literally giving away grants for students and people working at home. I hate that they have so much privilege and don’t even realise it. I hate that I can’t think about anything else (no I’m not falling for the conspiracy, I just now am thinking of COVID-19 and doom all the time). I don’t want to think that all my nothingness in the last 2 months is going to continue. I want life to go back to normal. I don’t want to sleep all day and do nothing. And when I am awake, I have to hear about their dumb theories. I want to scream in their face “YOU ARE ACTUALLY STUPID”. It is truly getting to that point.  But that’s disrespectful, and my dad is already super insecure (and gets super angry with me if I bring up a valid point) about his education. IDK what do. 

I do not blame my parents for my mental health going backwards – I blame the virus (which obviously I can’t control). But my parents definitely aren’t helping. 

Please tell me ways you have coped with quarantining with family or dealing with people you REALLY disagree with.

How are you guys staying sane during this quarantine – because I really can’t find hope right now idk what to do with my mental state – I don’t have access to a therapist and I can’t even openly talk to my bf (super strict parents)."
1310,Asking a question,"So basically to get to the point, I dont know if I use bad luck and shitty events as an excuse to not improve my life or if I just get fucked by life alot. Examples being during my senior year in highschool I got really sick and failed because of it, when I recovered I got a ged and started working to make up for it, then I broke my leg, then covid happened, now I'm having issues with asthma. And with all of these things I've used them as an excuse to put plans on hold and continue when the issue is better. But I dont know if the issues are valid enough for that or if I'm just using them as an excuse to put of the difficult work of recovering from mental health issues."
1311,[TW self harm] I just cut my arm and my sister saw,"For the first time ever I cut my arm and my sister and mom saw. I cut it deep and it was getting all over the floor, and on my way to tell my mom I ran into my sister and I just laughed but I was crying and I think it fucked her up. I peeked into her room to tell her I was sorry and she was crying. Then I woke my mom up and told her not to make a scene and that I cut it too deep. She dressed the cut and told me not to do it anymore and kissed me on the cheek. I messaged my sister and told her that I’m sorry she had to see that and it wasn’t healthy and she should absolutely not do it. She asked me if I wanted to come on her room and I told her I’d be in there in a minute and now I’m here writing this. What the hell have I done..."
1312,I feel confused,I stopped taking my antidepressants and anti psychotic /mood stabilizer a month or more ago but I don't think much has changed other than that I don't have a lot of energy anymore. I smoke weed (dabs) and they mess with me and make me more depressed but I'm just too addicted to them and I even went to rehab cause it makes me go into a downward spiral and counters my meds so they don't work that's why I stopped taking them. I don't know what to do anymore I don't know how I'm gonna be an adult.. I'm almost 20 and I've never had a real job before .i just have too many issues I can't keep up with what do I do?
1313,How to stop feeling numb?,"A little backround, I haven't been to a doctor yet/been diagnosed with anything concerning my mental health, but I've been speculating that I have depression (this is just a guess considering my ""symptoms"" and family history). I've been meaning to talk to my parents and get help, unfortunately with the whole covid-19 and quarantine situation I've been putting it off since there's not much we can do at the moment. I thought I was doing pretty good, had a few rough days, but they were different from the way I feel this time. I'm just empty, my chest feels like theres nothing there and I'm just numb. I'm not feeling particularly bad, but it's unpleasant to feel like I'm just missing a piece of me. This has happened to me before, but I can't remember how I'd gotten over the feeling. Any ideas on what I could try doing/advice to get rid of the feeling?"
1314,Not sure how to interpret my paranoia?,"Hi, I hope your quarantine is going okay. I'm here to ask for some input if you have the mental energy/the time. 

I have some recurring issues that I'm not sure how to deal with, because I'm not sure how to understand them, so I'm here to get some input on how to...interpret my situation, I suppose. I hesitate to self-diagnosis and say this is caused by mental illness, but I feel like this is not normal. I already have an anxiety disorder, but I'm not sure if this stems from that or is something else entirely. I apologize if the organization of this post is confusing- it's sort of a stream of consciousness that I'm not sure how to best organize. 

Okay so without further ado: 

I'm extremely scared of the dark and I can get panic attacks from my paranoia over something potentially attacking me in the dark, or something laying in bed next to me, etc. I'm 22 years old and I have to sleep with the lights on, and even when I do, sometimes I feel like something's standing over me or in my room. When I'm more stressed (like from exam week, or problems in my personal life) I get increasingly paranoid about strangers/demons in my room watching me, though I don't actually hallucinate and see them, but I get like a sense of them in the room. Ex. I have to keep looking up behind my shoulder when I wash my face at night, because I get scared something/someone might come up behind me. I do have time periods when they're not a concern at all (like if I've had a lot of positive social interactions), but they always come back, and they seem to be correlated with me isolating myself or feeling detached from society/reality. (Then I get caught in this loop where I want to be around people but I don't feel like myself enough to have a real interaction with someone, which further distances me from my sense of self). I have a big imagination, so it could be that taking over when I'm unhappy, but I don't know..it just bothers me that I've never talked to someone else who experiences something remotely similar. 

I grew up in a heavily religious family who said spirits were real, but they themselves aren't paranoid or scared about it, so I'm not sure why my brain took it to the extreme. Fun fact (idk, this just came to mind, and I feel it's better to give you guys a fuller picture): when I was in middle school I saw a horror film that caused me to fully visually hallucinate (unlike what I experience nowadays, which is more along the lines of feeling like there's someone around and seeing it in my mind's eye clearly) and I believed my parents were possessed by demons (when I got home after the movie). It was really bad- if I closed my eyes I could see it more clearly, and if I kept them open, I could see demon faces superimposed on their's, like some kind of Augmented Reality game. (I contacted a Psychiatrist in later years to ask about that, but they said it's common to hallucinate after a really scary film. Idk, I'm still doubtful because of my other persisting issues). 

I've talked about these experiences here and there to friends over the years, but I haven't encountered anyone who's gone through anything similar (or at least, no one who will admit to it). So I'm not sure how common this really is, but I'm tired of not having anyone to relate to about it. I used to tell myself that when I grow up it'll just go away because only kids are scared of monsters/the dark/other imaginative things, but I'm 22 now and it's still really bad, so...here I am :/ 

No tldr because idk how to condense this, but if you read through, I appreciate your taking the time to look over my problems when you probably have your own to deal with. Hoping for some advice/thoughts/opinions on the matter- really anything that helps me to sort of understand my situation. Thank you."

1317,"You will get knocked down, but you will get back up","Today I had the worst mental breakdown of my life, and that’s saying a lot. While hanging out on r/depression (which probably isn’t good for me, to be honest) I noticed a lot of depressed people say “hope is a prison.” And here’s the truth: Hope is cruel, yes, because when you inevitably fail at some point it feels like you wasted that effort. That’s life. But hope is also the driving force that keeps you making that effort until someday you WILL stand up and stay up as a changed person. Thanks to retaining even the tiniest bit of hope through repeated failure. It’s terrible that we have to go through this, it really is but you can’t let it stop you from achieving the life that you deserve. Much love &lt;3"

1319,My friends are causing me stress and anxiety,"Hi, so I’ve always had a lot of contact with my friends however during this whole lockdown period (so 9 weeks for me now) I’ve found that there’s one particular friend who has become increasingly reliant on me to keep them company and speak to regularly. 

She’s constantly messaging me telling me she loves me, misses me, wants to cuddle me. In addition to this always wanting to go for social distancing walks and just generally just chat and message throughout the day. 

I’ve told her that I was going to turn my phone off a couple of times and it felt like she was annoyed about me doing so. As if I couldn’t because who would she then speak to? 

Please can someone help me out here? Thanks!!"

1322,Recovery ! (CW: mentions of anorexia and bulimia),"Hi, this tends to be a very heavy subreddit but I wanted to say I’ve recovered. I did it! I’m a healthy weight now and my weight doesn’t fluctuate as much. I can snack freely and my hair is recovering from all of the malnutrition. Last year in January was when it was the worst and I recovered all on my own with only one of my friends knowing. I just want to say if anyone is struggling with anorexia right now, it does get better. The sky is brighter. My skin is clearer. My grades are up. I am happy. Not just a “happy” like fake it till you make it happy, but actually happy. I find myself joking more and wanting to go outside. Yes there are days where I look at others girls and think “why don’t I look like her?” But how I know I’ve recovered is now I don’t care. I can take a photo and think I look good now. I can touch my hair without it falling out now. Yes, this does sound like I’m cocky but honestly I don’t care anymore! Thank you to the people who cared enough to read this :)"
1323,My half sister may have wanted to kill me,"So I have a half sister- share a mom- that is 11 years older than me. She is a narcissist and very manipulative which I only realized recently. I understand the title may sound click bait-y but I am starting to remember what she did to me and my other fully related older sister- by 2.5 years- and to be honest I don’t really know how to take it and I’m starting to wig myself out over it and just want a to hear an outsider’s thoughts on it. I have confronted her about all this but she laughed it off as a joke. 

So I first started to realize she wasn’t such a good person when I got into college and tried to turn me against my parents and religion- Christianity- and tried to make me into her gofer. And then I have basically cut ties with her about a year ago at her wedding. Here are some things she would do to me from 3 yrs old to about a yr ago. 

- lure me into her room full of friends with a puppy pic and then pull my pants and underwear down in front of them. They would laugh as a I tried to run and stumbled away

- when babysitting me and my other sister she would play ‘games’ such as holding our breathe or hide and seek or such. She would then put a pillow over our faces and smother us- holding breathe game- or throw us in a closet and lock us in for someone else to let us out or make it so we couldn’t get out from our hiding spots, or sit on us, particularly our heads. 

- one of our cats died from a vet error and she convinced me as a 4/5 yr old that I had killed him because I played with him too roughly

- when in a pool she would force my head underwater and hold it there while I struggle, laughing. she would also get her friends or boyfriend to do this as well as ‘a joke’ and when I cried they mocked me

- she tried to give me drugs- I didn’t know better but still refused- saying it was candy

- she had stoner friends at a party in our basement and I snuck halfway down the stairs to see and she put them up to try to get me to go with them. I ran to my bed. 

- as early as 3 rd grade she would accuse me of wanting to steal her boyfriends and called me a slut saying I played footsie with them. Even though she encouraged them to hang out with me. 

——— note by this time I learned to avoid her and I was bigger and heavier than her so she couldn’t physically do much of anything

- told me I had to put out and do sexual favors to get a boyfriend and keep one- described in detail and started this when I was in middle school

- said I needed to drink alcohol to be fun and tried to give drinks whenever she was around

- constantly bullied me and talked behind my back about my appearance 

- when I started college she ‘wanted to start a new relationship’. For two years she confused and tried to manipulate me into thinking my religion was a cult made by my parents to trap me to them for the rest of my life. Said that now that I was away from them I can ‘learn to be me’ and start sleeping around and partying like she did. 

- tried to alienate me from my biological father- she hates him- by bad mouthing him, making up
lies about him, and has called the police on him and us on false claims in order to get him in trouble

- when I started to have depressive and suicidal thoughts growing up, she found out about it and encouraged me to do it, telling me ways to do it too

So when all this was happening I didn’t realize what she was doing. The first couple yrs in college I had to seek out professional counseling because she messed with me so bad. A big part as to why I believe if she had gotten a chance to kill me she would have is because when I was small and she smothered me or pushed my head underwater, she laughed. I could feel that she hated me in those moments and wanted me gone. Me and my other sister. She has said she blames my dad, sister, and me for taking our mom away from her. Her biological dad was an abusive drunk that abused our mother and she left him and took her with her. Our mom met my dad and had my sister and I. She believes if we were gone then she could be happy with our mom. 

I’m conflicted. I’ve slowly been going through my memories of her and she was just awful. I’m kinda shocked rn and a little bit terrified that I lived and love someone that wanted to end my life before it really began. I truly believe that if my sister- fully related one- and I hadn’t been early bloomers and got bigger than most kids our age and if she hadn’t have been petite like she is then she would have followed through. 

I don’t talk to her or even see her anymore. After she yelled at me and accused me of many many lies after her wedding- I was even a bridesmaid- I cut contact. She now has a husband that enjoys her behavior and finds it entertaining, and she continues to be a hostesses and him a striper out west so to each their own. She’s done some other messed up crap to my fully related sister too like successfully got her into drinking alcohol heavily, and other explicit stuff that I won’t share. I still love her on a base level because she is my sister, but I know she does not have the best intentions for me. She encouraged me to ‘be myself’ while telling me to change myself entirely. She egged on my depressive thoughts and manipulated and confused me so much that it became how we interacted. I remember her hatred of me but also me crying because she ran away again and I would miss her. I’m not sure how to categorize her anymore in my life and I guess this may be her last manipulation trick. She always wanted to be the center of attention and right now I guess she is to some point and I don’t want to give her center stage in my thoughts ever again."
1324,How do you be happy?,"Hey. This will probably just be a random rambling.

When you have nothing but self hate? 

When all you can think about is that no matter how hard you try it doesn't matter, some one else gets your happiness.

Your a good significant other and they cheat and tell you you'll find love....

Your a good person asking for help and find someone who is your exact copy, you get close. Real close. Then she pulls away. Guess what happend to my happiness? Someone else got it....

How long do you push for?
How long do you wait for your happiness? 
When do you give up?
Just let everyone have all your happiness and joy....

They'll take it anyway....

Because In the end. Its not really ours..."
1325,Should I reach out to my therapist?,"I just got a new therapist after not going since I was 13/14 (I'm 18 now) I have major depression according to her and we first spoke 2 days ago.

I've been randomly crying and today my manager kept asking if I was okay (maybe I looked sad?). I don't see her again until next Wednesday but I can send her a message to try and talk sooner? I just don't wanna be this sad. Extra info: not on any meds and I usually never cry. It's been months(possibly a year)since I've last cried

My therapist says I should not do this under any circumstances because it is not good for my mental health. 

How do I tell my own mother that I don’t want to see her because of what she did/does to me? I also feel very guilty for some reason. I am afraid of what she will do if I tell her - she pays most of my college tuition but has threatened to stop if I don’t do what she tells me. Thinking about confronting her is giving me intense feelings of self harm that make me afraid."

I ran out of my Cymbalta the other day and I'm going through withdrawal since my doctor didn't approve a refill. This is my own fault. It's been almost a whole year since I've gone in. The effects from this are really kicking my ass though and I was already in a pretty rough place. Nicotine withdrawal has nothing on this. 

I've also developed a marijuana dependence over the past couple years. It's been off and on, but it's full on right now.

I am sure I am only hurting myself by self diagnosing, but I have found several personality disorders that describe my toxic traits perfectly. Explains my series of failed relationships and broken friendships.

I found out a few weeks ago that my brother was diagnosed as Bipolar 1 which means I'm much more likely to also be bipolar. This stung for some reason, but was also a relief. I have worked with my GP on so many different medicines over the years and even when things worked, I often still struggled to get out of bed and be who I wanted to be.

On top of this, I have unresolved allergy and ENT issues that drive me insane. 
My past risky behavior has me now thinking I might have a chronic STI or a much worse kind of infection. 
TMJD
Osgood-Schlatter's disease. 
IBS
Like I could seriously keep listing things I have diagnosed or are just currently bothering me.

I am so so so lost. What do I do? I can't stop crying and thinking about checking myself into a hospital. Please help me. I don't know where else to turn."
1331,Need someone to talk to,"I’ve been going though a lot lately, and just need someone from the outside to talk to. Most my problems concern the people around me so it’s hard to talk to them about it. I would just like to be able to get it all out to someone and have them put in their two cents cause I’m feeling quite lost and lonely. Thanks :)"
1332,My bf just texted me the following and Idk how to respond please HELP ME ASAP,"My head hurts rn

The thought “ I don’t want to be alive” keeps chanting in my mind 

I don’t want to do anything. Didn’t go online for class. Didn’t do Omid’ s assignment 

No tv on. No music. It all just seems like noise

Took my IG and snap off my phone

Tumblr isn’t bringing me any joy either"
1333,Is it possible to have more than 5 personality disorders?,"I’m no doctor, but I match a lot of symptoms for many personality disorders, at least 5, if not 10. Is that even possible, and how would someone like that be treated? Will I end up in a psych ward if I have a lot of symptoms of antisocial personality disorder or if doctors find I actually have it? (I’m in the US if that helps)"
1334,I want to kill myself,"I thought I had everything figured out. I met someone who really likes me, but that’s about it. I thought they’d keep me from having feelings like this but sadly, they aren’t... and if I told them that, they’d blame themselves. I was doing so good.... but lately I’ve just been having constant thoughts of either killing myself or someone else. I thought I was done with this, I really did."
1335,Insane neighbor driving me insane!,"She is kinda old and drinks A LOT. Her husband died a year ago and she’s been in a psychotic episode ever since. She’s threatened to kill us more times than I can count. I’ve been to count multiple times because of her. She’s been arrested multiple times. And this last time she was in there for nearly a month then got released due to coronavirus. She’s driving me fucking insane!!!’ Her back door faces our bathroom and kitchen window (very close proximity) and she just yells at us. About sewer pipes that don’t exist. She says we have sewer pipes that had a leak on the side of our house and killed her husband. She has said her self he died of a heart attack and has also blamed the hospice people if there even were any. Almost she says can be taken as truth. But she has said she’s frank Sinatra’s god daughter. Which is scary even if she’s lying. She said she was gonna cut us up into little pieces today. She yelled she was gonna come kill my girlfriend in front of police. They didn’t do anything. We have a restraining order against her but it literally didn’t do anything. After the police left she screamed more and I just decided to make crazy nonsense noises over her and scream that back. She’s making me loose my fucking mind. This has been going on for so long, literally like a year. We’ve never talked to her. The pipe she says is a sewer pipe was connected to our washing machine and took the extra water to plants in the front yard. She was so fixated on it, we asked our landlord to take it out and reroute it to the septic tank which she did and paid for. Also, completely unnecessary but it was done as an attempt to keep her quiet. Today when she was yelling about it I pointed out how it’s obviously not even there anymore and she said she’s just mad about how long it took us to fix the “non-existent issue”. Cops always ask us do you rent? Hinting that we should move instead of them do something. We can’t afford to move. We literally have no choice but to listen to this horrible cunt accuse us of killing her family and she does say “YOU KILLED MY FAMILY”. She’s so fucking insane it’s stressing me out a shit ton. 
The cops literally recommended we do EVERYTHING WE ALREADY DID to get her arrested AGAIN. Since they let her out again, we have to go to court on new charges, have it delayed by a month over and over for 6 months again, go to court 2 or 3 more times because she somehow gets out of showing up. THEN she gets arrested in court. That’s what happened last time. And they fucking expect me to do all this again just so I can not have this lady threaten my fiancé’s and mine lives and our pets! What the fuck do I do?"

1338,Quarantine taking a toll on my mental health,"I feel so mentally numb. I rarely chat or call my friends unless they hit me up first because I always feel like I don't know what to say or that I'm not bothered to communicate since I socialize better face to face. I haven't had suicidal thoughts in months and until recently I thought I was doing really well for myself. Now I vividly imagine myself commiting suicide, I used to do that a lot."
1339,How do you live your life?,"When I was in primary school, I was called the genius. I always scored well without trying
I see everything as black and white. I believe that being ""good"" is everything and i will help anyone and sacrifice for anyone. I smile every single time, thinking that it will influence others. Slowly life happened. I witnessed ""life""; the death of others, love ones, bullying and violence, lies and betrayal, cruel fate and ""unfairness"" of the world, human emotions and feelings.  I start to put on a ""mask"" to survive. I hate my life and this universe. I don't believe in religion anymore because everyone who has a religion is evil and fake; they will never do what they think is right. Now I have to face the fact that everyone will die one day... Is there heaven or hell? No one knows and we probably will just fade into the past. I had a dream; but now what's the point of everything? We are going to die anyway. Why do I want children? They are going to die anyway. Why do I want to get married? It won't last for eternity anyway. Why do I want to live?

I want to end it all, but I cant... My body is stopping me for some reason. Life is fragile and useless why even bother.... I can't face anything... I am weak and useless... This world is grey, there's no good and bad. There's only actions and consequences. If a human dies, his/her family will suffer, on the other hand, there will be more resources for others,etc. The only thing keeping me alive is the thought of leaving my parents. One day when they disappear, what should i do? I guess I will just focus on a new family. Living in this meaningless world just to fullfill our purpose...being alive and continue this meaningless cycle. Please tell me a blindly reassuring reason to continue living......"
1340,How can I escape my mind,"My life is just a constant search for distractions to escape my mind. Yet, when night falls and I’m alone with my thoughts, I’m completely vulnerable. Does anyone else feel this way ? If so, how can I escape this?"
1341,The thought of having to do things the next day early in the day make me stay up at night. What does this mean?,So tomorrow i might have to go in early and im gonna talk to my doctor about my anti depressants tomorrow and the thought of me having to get up at 8am (me being a night owl) makes me anxiety up . thinking about bills and stuff does too . i literally finished cleaning my bathroom to get my mind off of it.  Im tired now but still cant sleep.  Can someone explain what this might mean mentally?
1342,"Long over due to end a ""friendship""","Long story short, I finally decided to end a friendship with someone because they're just taking advantage of me too much. I wrote a letter explaining why, bit everyone's advice is to take it straight to the case worker and have her readyalong the letter (or sign a statement that the person refused to listen). I listed the top 20 reasons for how I felt the person was putting me in jeopardy and the reasons why I don't think the friendship is worth saving. My only issue is how violent towards people ""they"" can get. One time 4 people had to hold ""them"" down because she was getting violent and mouthy with the PD and paramedics &amp; even was threatening suicide. We're all sick of it. This person actually stitches their own finger (have seen this) and buys vet needles to draw &amp; squirt their own blood. (Have seen that as well).

I don't care how their going 5o take it because I just wanna worry about living at the apartment complex the way it was before ""they"" got here. Peaceful and without having someone knock on my door literally every 15-20 mins because they can't even go smoke outside by themselves. Or not have to find a person to take turns with to do laundry in shifts, or be able to walk the halls without someone yelling aggressive threats to people. Thankfully we have the cameras now"
1343,I cannot control my temper once I have lost it. I am deteriorating relationships around me because of this. I can go upset for days and pick at those who upset me till ibreak them.,"I have a serious temperament issue. I honestly believe I have an underlying mental issue or trauma that I have not processed nor do I know how to or guide myself.

Throughout my years I've been off and on with my temperament. I know that I have had a temperament issue since I was a child. I would have outbursts with me yelling out the top of my lungs and breaking things because I would refused something I didn't want to do ect. haircut. What makes my temperament stand out, however is how long it can last and how mad I can be over the smallest mistake either I or someone did. I can stay mad over something for days that took a minute to upset me. Its an anger so clouding that i can't break out of myself from it even with distractions. It also becoming too common with having a temperamental breakdown about every other week. I've also had this weird tick that I've done as a child. I punch my thighs whenever I am stressed out or feeling discomfort.

I'm currently in a relationship that has been slowly deteriorating due to my temperament. I can get mad over a simple mistake like genuine accidents and just petty language. That will lead to a incredibly long and pointless fight that I continuously instigate towards my partners. I become so clouded in this anger over nothing that I feel that I must direct all my anger towards that person. I will bother and say in and do everything to make them unhappy and i don't stop till I've made the other person cry and realized what damage I've inflicted. I realize i gain nothing in these arguments it just become another inflicted pain i share with another. I have become so abusive in this relationship its terrifying and can't seem to grasp why i will lose my temper in a otherwise perfect relationship.

This isn't exclusive to the relationship. I impacting all my family members. I also lose my temperament with my father and mother as well.  I will yell and say obscenities and also just say things meanest things without thinking.

The major issue with this temperament is how self destructive I become afterwards with myself once I have realized what I have done.  As of late last year however i've been trying to make a difference and learning to control my temperament. I keep trying to get back on my own feet making steps in building a healthy routine for my life by eating healthy, excercising, studying, ect. but once I have lost my temperament it takes days for my psyche the revert back so I may have some motivation to continue. During that period though I am just self loathing and taking steps back on my mental health. I am very bad at taking the right steps to help my break this cycle.

I believe I am very self aware of my issue but I take no action to fix it or nor do i know the right actions to fix it. 

I have done mental health counseling in the past but for a different issue. I've tried 4 different ssris and every single one has cause a different side effect that negates the benefits of the ssri. I've also had a gp experiment ativan, and adderall. The adderall boosted my productivity but I became a bigger asshole than I already was. So I decided to cut it off. I've also tried psychedelics which did help me process one extremely major personal issue i had. However it has only helped in that aspect which sexual abuse as a child. I want to try more lsd but my trip that helped me process this behavior was a really traumatizing trip, but in a positive way. Pain is needed at times to come to realize something i believe. I'm just not emotionally ready right now to use psychedelics to reveal all my flaws to me at once. I know im very hot headed however I need  to be able to slowly address this then be able to have a more level headed discussion with myself. Thats why i am desperately trying everything to get myself in the right track be setting up another mental health counseling appointment. 

&amp;#x200B;

that's not the end of it. 

I know I have a sex addiction, cannabis addiction, constant intrusive thoughts.

I'm just venting and hoping someone with whatever insight could please give me food for thought."
1344,My newest milestone,"Hey everyone,

This is my second post. I just made my account and I'm so excited to contribute to the community. Apologies for grammatical errors. I'll work on those later. 

TLDR at the bottom. 

I've been working on getting better at dealing with my depression for 11 years and personally think I'm constantly making ground, even though I still experience disruptive episodes.

During my last episodes, while talking with my roommates who are some of my greatest supporters, (quick shout out to my mom and dad too,) I identified something pretty important about how I treat myself when depressed.

When I stop being productive, whether that's due to depression or triggering depression, I subconsciously punish myself for it by not allowing myself to make time for anything else.

This obviously makes things worse, I lose more productivity, and become paralyzed/bedridden/stuck.

I find this to be different than the age old advise to do the things that are good for you, becuase I've directly acknowledged the blockage made of shame and guilt. I can now start dismissing the blockage instead of trying to will myself over it. 

Just identifying this behavior is a huge milestone. 

Today, during my current episode, I remembered this, and was able to remind myself that going and doing something fun or healthy, without guilt over not being productive, may be the thing to snap me out of it, and if not, it will be better than laying in bed.

So not only did I identify it, but I'm already working on doing better at this. I'm so excited. I'm really hoping that  this will make a huge difference in the way I bounce back, and may prevent me from reaching my deeper stages of depression.

If not, that just means I've got another exciting project coming in the future. 😁

TLDR: I figured out how to give myself permission to do things I enjoy while depressed."
1345,"I’m angry, stressed, and anxious","I’m so angry with myself for making dumb decisions landing me in student loans I can’t afford and a bill I can’t take a loan out for because I’m still young and my credit isn’t good yet and my dad doesn’t wanna help me. I can’t go back to college till I pay it. I start work tomorrow and I can’t sleep I can’t breathe I’m so fucking scared. I don’t trust anything good can happen to me. Nothing feels stable. And I mean right now nothing is stable. I just need to breathe. I just feel so angry as well. At my parent. At my mom for leaving me for drugs and not looking back, but also for leaving me with my dad. He treats me like I’m fucking stupid, wasted space and a waste of life. He makes me feel small he screams at me over everything I do. I hate him and I love him and I hate that I love him. But I don’t know what to do. I need to work and pay this off I need to be financially independent. I need to be independent.  I just feel like slamming my head into something hard enough where I won’t have to feel any of this anymore. I just feel like I’m drowning. I need help I really need help. I just don’t know what the fuck to do."
1346,What is this feeling and how to I get rid of it?,"I feel sick, I have a warm feeling in my head, chest, and legs(it’s not the good kind of warm)
If I think about a specific thing, this shock of cold chills and negative energy will shoot through my body, stressing me out a lot.
My brain cannot stop thinking about negative things, it’s stressing me out a lot and I don’t know how to get rid of it"
1347,I dont know what to do anymore my mental health is ruining my life.,"Im a 26 year old male and my life has been a swampy mess of depression for as long as I can remember. Ive lost jobs, ruined relationships and hurt many people I care about through my self destructive tenancies and emotionally altered state mind.

I wake in the morning in fear of what stupid mistakes ill make that day while being reminded of all the mistakes ive made in the past. 
I lie and twist things to myself and to my friends and loved ones out of fear of judgement or rejection normally only making things worse.
I feel more comfortable alone because im free from other peoples judgement and expectations and this keeps me from making real and meaningful connections.
I resent myself and resent the fact that im alive.

I am taking medication and seeing a therapist monthly but it doesnt seem enough. I would see the therapist more regularly but its hard to find a therapist with regular fortnightly opportunities.

My mental state moves in waves from reasonably high to ridiculous lows and the low points are where my toxic behaviours and damging personallity traits start to show, and even the high points are muddled with self doubt and anxiety.

I dont know how much longer i can go on like this, im tired of hurting and tired of living like this. Its like 24/7 heartbreak blended with a chronic migrane and today i found myself thinking of a plan to end it all and thats what scared me into making this post.

I need help clearly but any help ive gotten up untill this point has felt superficial and forced. Therapists just fit you into a box and give you a predetermined treatment and the meds dont fix anything they just dull your reallity without solving the problem."
1348,Is feeling numb normal?,"I’m only 14 years old, I was recently diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. I wanted to try counseling but due to covid-19 I haven’t been able to. Quarantine is making me feel awful, I just don’t care about anything anymore. Is this normal? I got extremely stressed and upset today but the feeling went away in a few seconds and was replaced with a feeling of numbness. I can’t focus on my feelings and it’s difficult to cry. I just want a place to vent, I’m sorry if I’m breaking an age rule or something I just want to know if what I’m experiencing is normal."
1349,How do you cope with childhood abuse as an adult?,"I’m really sick of battling with my own thoughts of wanting to cut all ties with my parents or having empathy for them because they raised me the only way they knew how. 

Hangers, belts, newspapers, shoes, and really hurtful words and reinforcement of those words. 

I’m in my 20s now and I struggle to function as a “normal” adult. I’m scared of EVERYTHING, and even when I know my fears are irrational, normal activities/interactions are often impossible because I start to feel overwhelming anxiety. Sometimes I tremble uncontrollably. 

More recently, I’ve admitted to myself that the reason I don’t post photos of myself online is because I suffer from severe body image issues and I simply don’t want to be seen. My parents don’t have the physical advantage over me anymore and now they express their control by making remarks on my body. I’ve been keeping score too. And every. single. time. it triggers a strong urge in me to just disappear.

My perception of myself is so clouded that I don’t have a safe space. I’m a whole entire adult and I can’t do anything, even exist, without feeling small."
1350,"Online friend suffering from depression, not sure what to do.","I have an online friend I have known for a while now and recently I have started to worry about there depression and ""jokes"" made about suicide. For example we recently made a new group call and she didn't join, I then asked her how she was doing and she responded with something along the lines of ""all good still want to die but whats new"" I have tried helping her and am currently trying to reach out to her brother but am not sure what to do, as I am no way qualified to efficiently help this person. From what I know she has been removed from school and attends a mental hospital. Not sure of what happens now due to Covid-19. Any suggestions or help is appreciated thank you."
1351,2 Person Bipolar Hammock,"So my (F22) boyfriend (M23) is struggling with type 2 bipolar disorder, and so am I. I’ve been getting help and taking medication for it for a year now (before I met him). I’ve been making a lot of progress and feel like I’m becoming me again. I’ve noticed that my mental health is deteriorating since I’m being taken along on his mood cycles as well as my own. I wind up being mostly just depressed all the time. He refuses to get any help, and I’ve expressed to him how I’m feeling and how this is affecting me and that I’m worried about him. He just gets upset and brushes me off. If I’m having a super good mental health day and it’s been a week of him being depressed, I haven’t been rushing home to his aid. I’ve been trying to enjoy the good days that I get. I feel like a horrible person, but I’m not strong enough to carry both of us. I can’t make him want to face his bipolar disorder. And he’s the love of my life; I don’t want to leave. Does anyone have any advice? What made you want to seek help? Do I have any hope here?"
1352,Is this ok?,"I was working on some home(9th grade) and all of a sudden I started crying out of nowhere, I wasn’t said or anything I was complicit and then I just started tearing up and getting sad. I’ve been feeling sad a lot lately but this was out of the blue and i don’t think was a breakdown."
1353,"Need help with overthinking and regret over purchases or ""buyer's remorse""","Before buying anything (clothes, electronics), I dig up a lot, think hours and hours about do I really need it or not. Even when I reach to a conclusion that I actually want it, I end up regretting about purchases. I am M(21), undergrad student, living in a third world country. I have a very limited income and I spent my money mostly on tech and video games (I could easily pirate but I try to buy games to support the developers). 

I think about ""better/updated things will come if I wait"" or ""Is this game worth my money for the hours I'll get in return?"". These constant thoughts ruin my experience afterwards and I end up just ruin my mental health and fall into stress. Any solution to escape from this would be appreciated."
1354,I feel trapped.,I'll get better than hit a low again. It's a horrible cycle. Sometimes I think it would be simpler to grab a gun and be done with it but I know it won't solve anything. I'm rapid cycling. Hopefully it will be better tomorrow.
1355,I’ve felt so worthless since childhood,"Since I was a kid I’ve felt this deep sense of worthlessness. I’ve always felt like I was a dirty, gross person and would try extra hard to have good hygiene but never felt clean enough. On top of that I feel like I’m so annoying and that I’m just so hateable. I’ve gotten slightly better and with my dearest, closest friends/husband I feel like they do like my personality. But even still with my family finds me obnoxious and every single new person I meet I get crippling anxiety they hate me and I need to shut my mouth because anything I say will blow my cover I’m a disgusting, annoying loser or ill offend them by my mere presence. I haven’t made a new friend in almost 8 years (I’m 27F for reference). I am too nervous to go to a therapist and I also don’t know... maybe everyone feels this way they just don’t verbalize it?? I do over think and I’m worried I’m just going to say something that’s a basic human issue to a therapist and they’ll think I’m self centered or wasting time. Is this normal or is there some childhood reason someone may feel like this? I just wish I could get to the root of the issue, I feel like I would finally feel free."
1356,Do you also feel being scrutinized all the time.. ??,"I am a careless clumsy happy go lucky guy... Have always been like that...

I don't analyse stuff much and am ready to that everything at face value...

I had a love marriage and it was because I felt free with her and it was comforting...

Now it's quite the opposite...I feel all the time that whatever I say or do is being scrutinized and being judged... With every task allocated a consequence clause is added which is supposed to remind me that I should not be making mistakes at all... Else consequences can range anything arbitrary from financial fines, to being made to stay awake in the night despite office the next day...
The consequences can even prop up if she feels that I have made mistakes and if I argue/debate then the fines increase...I am also not allowed to negotiate else fines pile up...

There can be an all out war in case I decide to not comply with the ""consequences""...

Her justification that all the time that I have been with her, I keep on repeating my mistakes and now irrespective of the magnitude of the mistake, fines are added exponentially to make sure I remember to keep things straight...

Now I just keep on expecting that I'll be making a fault soon and then don't know what kind of damaged I'll incur...

I still love her and the time that's good with her is really good...

I don't know if this is normal and I am just overthinking it..."
1357,I want to get better,"Hi all,
I'm a 20 year old on India. I've been brought up in a regular indian household, with the more or less normal familial issues. I have always been the odd one out since I would never get furious and have control over me emotions.
However, I have realised I am really bad at dating. I am constantly insecure, need validation, attention and am prone to jealously and overthinking. I've already ended a great relationship due to this tendency of mine. Now I am in another relationship and am trying to get better, but my issues come up often. I don't want to get toxic and smother my boyfriend. I have realised my parents have the same habits and they've somehow manifested in me. How do I get better?"
1358,An interesting title,I think quarantines taking a real toll on my mental health before this my life was fun and I was happy well as as I can be with  depression you but now I'm just thinking suicide day in Day Out and I know I'll never do it because my family would hate to lose me but there's nothing like looking at bleach tablets in the bathroom and thinking about how easy would be just pop a few and be over with it like I said before all this I was as good as I could get but the feeling of isolation is really fucking  with me.
1359,Looking for men to share their experiences with mental health.,"Hi everyone. I’m a filmmaker based in the UK and mental health is something very close to me personally. I think it’s important to me to use my art to create something to help continue raise awareness. 

I’m creating a documentary focusing on mental health in men. I’m looking for any men who have experienced mental health difficulties to share their stories with me over voice recordings. 

You will remain anonymous in the film, but for your voice. Your voice recordings will accompany the visuals in the film. 

The aim for this film is to try and highlight even further the ever-growing awareness being raised for men’s mental health. Additionally, it is also to try and create a short film that will resonate with men of all ages and backgrounds. I’m hoping that men watching and listening to other men opening up won’t feel alone. It’s also about trying to destigmatise the notion that men can’t cry, or be vulnerable. 

For those interested, please send your voice recordings to - jonnyvisuals@outlook.com

Some questions to consider: What do you feel physically? How has your mental health affected personal and professional relationships? Do you feel supported? Can you at all describe visually what you see/feel in your head? Have you ever felt suicidal - what triggered this?

The voice recordings don’t have to be professional quality, you can just use your phone if you would like.

If anyone has any further questions, please get in touch and thank you to anyone in advance who shares any of their experiences. I hope your words will resonate with other men that are struggling, whilst concurrently helping you by talking."

1362,I think I messed my head up,"Here’s the whole story: I’ve been under a lot more stress than usual. First, over the weekend, my abusive ex had basically a mental breakdown where he became delusional and thinking I was doing and saying things that I never did or said, and he ended up choking me and just all around trying to hurt me. Then, on Monday, a close friend I’ve known for a few years killed himself - my other close friend was the one who found him and described every detail. That night, (yes I know dumb decision) I smoked crystal. I also had a very very stressful fight with my mother this whole day. Everything was fine, until about 10 hours later well after the high wore off, and all the details I heard from my friends suicide and images just started racing through my head and I had the worst panic attack I’ve had in months. I took 4 vistaril and fell asleep. When I woke up, I just felt.. off. Things don’t feel real. I know they’re real, but they’re just different. It’s hard to explain. I can’t feel anything but anxiety and depression. I feel absolutely horrible in every way and the longer it goes the worse my anxiety gets because I’m scared I’ll be stuck like this forever. Then I googled derealization - and it was spot on. The article I read said derealization can be caused by extreme stress, be drug-induced, and can even be an effect felt after panic attacks. I literally have ALL 3 of these. I’m so scared, what if I got a bad hit of dope and now I’m messed up forever? I’m not hearing or seeing things. I know I’m real. It’s just almost dream like, I wanna go back to normal. I’ve been in and out of mental hospitals and I really don’t want to go back. Please, anybody who has struggled with this or knows anything about it, give me peace of mind, or even give me the hard truth - will I be like this forever? How do I make it go away? I’m absolutely terrified."

1364,Antidepressants destroy lives," Hi,

I've found this article today, on [medium.com](https://medium.com/).  This guy seems to suffer from very severe type of PSSD. Very cruel  story, which shows how psych drugs can destroy a young life.

Article:

1365,"I'm struggling with flashbacks, any help will do.","Sorry I have absolutely no clue where to post this and I currently have no one to talk to about this because I'm not very open about my mental health.

It's currently 4:40am, I've (20f) been trying to sleep for over an hour but I can't. For the past couple weeks I've been falling asleep pretty fine from around 2-3am and wake up at a decent time. Recently I can't. I wake up, stay up for a bit, then take another 2-4 hour nap. Then another nap later. By the time I've left my room it'll be 2-3pm.

I'm currently bombarded with flashbacks and things I don't wanna think about, I thought I pushed them deep down. I'm tired of constantly being reminded of things people did to me. I'm tired of constantly remembering assaults/abuse I didn't even realize were an assault/abuse until recently.
I'm not sure if this is all cause I got into a relationship recently with a guy and I've never properly dated a guy before (I've mostly dated girls but they've all ended badly), so now I'm dealing with constant flashbacks/memories of things guys have done to me and I want to cry but I can't.

Everytime I try to cry my eyes just burn up and I don't wanna continue, I keep having these dreams of me self harming, having a panic attack or telling my bf about traumatic things and he has these extreme reactions towards them in the dreams. I'm not even sure how he would react irl because hes so numb to things. 

I really wanna breakdown and just cry in hopes of it all releasing but I can't. I don't know what to do. I'm in Ontario, we are still in a slight lockdown and I've been waiting over a month for mental health resources.

I'm sorry if none of this made sense but any suggestions or help will do.

I've tried some breathing exercises but I then get anxious that I can't breathe properly for some unkown reason."
1366,i don’t want to be depressed anymore,"
i’ve been depressed for years and it’s getting way too tiring. i’ve only ever reached out for help once and my parents told me it wasn’t real, so i haven’t since, i don’t really know where to start with getting help"
1367,Coping Skill Ideas?,"I’m not really sure what to write. I was just looking for new ideas for coping skills, if y’all could help? Potentially also, just how to help me to just be calm/rational and be able to talk in situations rather than me just shutting down and walking away.

I’m trying to work on stuff again, and I just need to figure some stuff out. I’m hoping to get into therapy soon, but looking for stuff I could proactively try in the mean time.

Thanks in advance c:"
1368,Had a catharsis moment.,"A few days ago, I had a catharsis moment the night of my birthday in the privacy of my own room where no one heard. I found it to be very liberating, even though I found it quite hard to begin crying. I'm 19F, and honestly I'm not one to cry about my life. I'm not saying that my life is perfect, because it's not, but its just not easy for me to cry about it (repression maybe?). Although, I must say that it's easier for me to cry about movies etc, so I wouldn't say I'm emotionally numb yet. But that night of my birthday and some days before, I had so much pain and deadweight on my chest that I figured that crying was what I needed. I've been overthinking too much (but some of the overthinking does make sense and it's not like I'm worrying over nothing kinda) and I've just felt so out of place. Also I feel compelled to say that I'm a homebody so it's not like quarantine is taking a huge toll on me. Anyway, I cried like a motherfucker. I cried over the little things, over some slightly bigger problems and just generally everything. I felt fine moments after it and the next day I felt relatively calm. I've been wondering if that was like an anxiety attack or what did the constant pain in my chest mean? Why did I feel so terribly unbearable? I've also thought about the possibility of having ADHD. I truly relate in some aspects about it but I haven't gone to a therapist to talk about it. I don't mean to self diagnose/ask to be diagnosed here or offend anyone who has it, but my mind is elsewhere and I just don't know who to talk it to or how to make sense of my feelings. I'm sorry if I come off as foolish, I hope someone can see past that and maybe give me a few pointers on what I should do about this feeling on my chest or how to come to terms with crying. I'm just so lost.

The purpose of this post is to vent, maybe get a few tips, or just to see if people can relate."

1370,I feel like I can’t breathe,"I have always struggled with anxiety but now, every so often, when I am trying to sleep and there are no distractions I just feel like I can’t breath (shortness of breath), I feel like I have to focus on my breathing and I start to panic and continue to wake up, the whole next day I feel the same way until I either get a good sleep or have some wine to help me relax. Does anyone feel anything similar? How do you deal with it?"
1371,not good enough,"my mum keeps coming after me for my grades, and it makes me feel like absolute shit. so far this year i’ve had three tests where i’ve got 80-90%, yet she always focuses on the one test where i got 60-70%. last year i wasn’t great in maths, averaging 50-60%, so getting 80+ felt like such a huge achievement, but my mum keeps telling me i’m not working hard enough. i feel like she keeps belittling my achievements and it’s such a shit feeling. i know i’m not good enough, no need to keep rubbing it in. i’m just so sick of it."

1375,Every time I make the slightest mistake I want to die and feel like I'm worthless. (a ramble),"I've really needed a place to vent but talking to anyone feels like I'm burdening them and altogether like hell so I'm posting it here.

I don't know what to do and I don't know whats wrong with me. Every time I make the slightest misatke, I want to die and I feel like I'm worthless. Every time I try to do something I feel like I'm never good enough no matter what, so eveythings painful and eveything hurts. Every little slip up makes me want to cry and I feel so supid. I feel like a spoiled brat because whenever I'm not the best at something I feel like I'm the worst. I think it may be the reslut of being so used to succeeding when growing up, and the high standards that came with that. What makes it worse is how disconnected I feel from my family and friends. Since quaretine I've been ignoring everyone's texts and fucking up my sleep schedule so I wont have to wake up and socialize with my family throughout the day. As of now the only person I can bear talking to is my brother, but even interacting with him is starting to feel like a chore.
I'm thinking of turning back to cutting, but I think that'd just make me feel more guilty because I promised my parents I'd stop."
1376,Please help! Terrible OCD!,"So I’m 25 and I have really bad anxiety and OCD.
Recently I found out after 2 years of having a short beard that it’s good to brush it. I only ever put beard oil in it and used my hands to distribute it into my beard. I didn’t know about brushing until recently or I never thought I needed to I guess.

I feel stupid for not knowing it and have spent hours online trying to find out if their are celebrity’s out there who don’t brush their beards because it would make me feel better and make me feel like I’m not stupid....

Any guys who don’t brush their beards?

Or any girls who know guys who don’t brush their beards?

I know to some this post might seem a bit silly.....but it really is causing me ALOT of distress.....

Thanks for the replies in advance!"
1377,Would like to share my personal blog about learning to recover from trauma/dealing with mental health,"Hey, I hope this isn't against the rules, I couldn't find anything.

For the past 2 years I've been writing about recovering from a traumatic relationship and learning to deal with mental illness. Some close friends have read it and were all very positively surprised and found it relatable, so I thought I'd share it and hope that maybe it helps somebody else.

Here's the link: [https://forgotyourmind.wordpress.com](https://forgotyourmind.wordpress.com/)"
1378,"Does anyone know anything about this specific Redditardo? u/RandomBrownGurl She had posted a while ago on RoastMe and the 13or40, but then posted something very concerning on succulentwatch. I am concerned about her because she stopped posting r/mentalhealth",
1379,Reddit is the best social media app without a doubt!,I cannot believe the amount of support I’ve been getting here and I just want to say thank you and that I’m here for anyone!
1380,Just wanted to share these thoughts!,"Hey, so I'm 18 y/o. I don't have many friends or anyone I can talk to or just or spend time with. I use to be very sad about that fact, like why can't I have all those things like long nights with friends or first kiss or amazing fun moments with family.

I have this bad luck with people and no one tends to stick around more than a year. at least that's what I thought for a long time. I started overthinking every little thing and started getting anxious like what if I lose that person too.  It kept getting harder and harder to cope up with anxiety. Anxiety not just about losing people but about not having achieved anything real of being a looser and blah blah blah you know.

But then I started looking it the other way around. I am not the reason that people are not sticking around with me, fuck them who needs people anyway. And there's nothing wrong with not having achieved anything, why does that have to be wrong? I'm good enough but I'll not stop looking and finding and pursuing that moment when I WILL ACHIEVE something. 

Loneliness was a big factor in my life too but it's okay to be lonely sometimes. I am grateful for those 2 friends that show up sometimes that sometimes make me laugh. And for other times when I feel more lonely than ever, I have my books I could read and get into that character's mind and make new friends there :)) 

I am not saying that I have mastered these and stopped being miserable. There are still nights that are harder than others, times when I don't know what to do, times when I feel so lonely that my chest aches. But it's okay to have those days. now instead of avoiding those days, I go through it. Instead of avoiding all the thoughts, I try to face all of them.

All I'm saying is that instead of being miserable I am trying my best 'cos why not? what's there to lose anyway?

I know it can be a lot harder for some people but why not try to take that one step and see where it goes?

Thank you.

Let me know if I helped you in any way. I'd really appreciate it."
1381,Tips for distracting yourself?,"I just caught my long term boyfriend with a man in our house (on the roof) doing well... He left with the guy. I had to ask him to move out and now I’m on my own in our house for the quarantine and my mental health is suffering severely. I’ve been having panic attacks and haven’t been able to eat. I’m taking it day by day, eating well, not drinking etc. but does anyone have any tips to distract my brain? I haven’t been able to focus enough to read or watch anything which is frustrating"
1382,I feel like my only escape route is gone,"I've had a really tough last couple years... in essence I grew up in an abusive household, had to leave for uni before I was realistically ready for independence, and the uni I'm at has not helped - all the societies (regular social groups centred round something like a hobby or interest, or a place to meet specific folks like you such as LGBT or ASD groups) I could possibly have joined with my anxiety did not run. I complained plenty to them, even set up a society of my own, but they did nothing and nobody came to mine. Basically, I've been really painfully alone for 2 years - no physical friends from school in the same city (and they're very flaky online due to their own anxiety, so I've only been even more alone with the awful thoughts about myself from childhood day in and day out for 2 years).

I knew I needed a group of friends near me for a very long time and some good therapy so I decided a while ago to make the drastic move of changing unis. I verified the other uni's societies work properly and that the course is all good and I got accepted, so I was finally able to see a way out of this dark place... but then this FUCKING virus happened and now they might not even have face to face lectures or any social things for the whole upcoming academic year when I'd be moving

I feel like there's no escape for me now and everything is falling apart and breaking around me (my friend group has been even more flaky in the stress of quarantine and some people have snapped at me in ways which have really hurt as a response to it too) and I just dont know what to do

This might actually be it for me, I cannot do this forever..."
1383,What is the best online mental health questionnaire?,"I need to find a mental health questionnaire that possibly my wife will try taking so that we can identify if she has borderline personality disorder, but even just to show her that life is not supposed to be this hard.

My wife was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has chosen holistic natural healing verses any medical intervention, at this rate you will be dead within a year and a half and this is the saddest thing to watch, only piece that I figure would help is if we can somehow determine what her motivation is for this decision that she is making about her health. She suffers from severe childhood/past trauma that was never treated with any sort of therapy."
1384,Struggling to find reason in my life.,"Lately, I haven't been so much depressed, but moreso struggling to find a point in doing things in life when one day, it won't mean anything anymore. For example, I'll be a senior in high school next year. I only have two friends  right now, and I'm not very close to them at all. So, I see no point in trying to make a bunch of new friends next year, or do all the senior activities, when I won't see or talk to 98% of these people ever again in just a year.

I also don't know if it will be worth it for me to make a bunch of friendships and be active on campus in College either. Within four years, I will never see nor talk to 97% of the people I meet there ever again.

And then I start to ask myself, hell, what's even the point of this life if it's all going to be forgotten and not effect the planet in any way, shape, or form?"
1385,"I [14F] talked to my [13&amp;14F] friends about their ""depression"", and I'm not sure whether it changed anything.","Some background story before I start:


I have 4 friends in my group. I'll give them fake names just in case one of them finds me here.


Jasmine = She got a online boyfriend who was manipulating her and guilt-tripping her by saying he will commit suicide if Jasmine doesn't do what he says. I managed to convince her to leave him a few months ago. She broke down in school multiple times and I have accompanied her to the counsellors a few times. Now she has a therapist.


Jane = She cut her left wrist a lot of times, and sent me a photo of her standing on the window with one foot out. She doesn't tell me anything. She refuses my help and wants me to forget everything I saw, which I don't obviously, and told two teachers anonymously to keep an eye on her in case she does something. She doesn't have a therapist, and she doesn't want professional help at all.


Carly = She told me that her parents don't love her, and her mother is a piece of shit gold digger and her dad doesn't care. Her dad cheated on her mom. She also stood at the balcony wanting to jump. Carly and I have a mutual agreement that we would both talk to each other when she feels depressed or when I'm sad. She doesn't have a therapist.


Emily = She was worried for Jane, and said she might be at fault for Jane's behaviour. She gave me picture examples of what she tried to do a year ago: standing on the window, and told me she stopped cutting last year. But then recently, like a few days ago, she told me she cut her herself. I convinced her to tell her dad, and to have him look at the wound 
because it was really deep and I was scared.
She also doesn't have a therapist.

Please keep this in mind that the fact that all of them, except Jane, is 14. Jane is 13. I'm also 14. And to be the one who has to listen to everyone of them being depressed is making me go insane.


Before anyone comments down that I should leave them and find positive people to hang around with, I should clarify that they do make me happy, and all I want is them to get better and be happy.


I am the ""mom"" or ""caretaker"" of the group. Whatever happens, I am always there for them. If one of them does something wrong, I try and tell her calmly why it's wrong and how she should fix it. 

But this, have been going on for nearly a year, and I have been trying to keep myself together. I've been trying my best. 


So a few hours ago, I was talking to Carly and I started to get emotional. She suggested that I tell it to everyone, which I did. I vented for an hour, telling them how they are precious to me and how I'm so frustrated at the fact that they keep rejecting me. I voiced out all my complaints, I got mad at them, and told them everything. I told them I cried, and cried thinking about them and how they shouldn't cut themselves thinking it would fix everything. I told them that school counsellors exist, and I'm not a superman who can fix problems just because they trust me. I am also a human who has emotions, and I shouldn't be the one who they turn to when they need help. They need help from professionals. And I am not one. 


I am just merely a 14 year old female, but I know damn well myself what I should not do and do. I know that self-harm isn't the answer and neither is suicide. But what I don't know is that whether the fact that my outburst was good enough to make them realise and stop, and see how it's also affecting me. Make them tell an adult, get help from professionals who is not me. Because. I. Am. Not. A. Professional. 


I have went through this ""phase"" (?) before when I was 10. But I managed to change my mindset and always see the positive things thanks to my parents and the Internet.


I have been giving advice, convincing them to not jump or cut to them everytime. It usually works, and sometimes it doesn't. I try giving them talks, about how they're worth everything and their skin isn't a canvas to cut. I tell them how much they're gonna miss in the future if they leave now. I tell them that it's not worth it, and stop before you regret anything. I tell them that life is worth living, and everyone deserves a chance to be happy. It's just that the chance to be happy may be in the future.


They don't seem to remember the fact that although I act as if I'm older than 14, I am still 14 at heart. I don't want to deal with all of this. I have my own problems to deal with already. I know this is hurting me. 


I know how unrealistic it sounds that I am 14 and dealing with this. I have asked for advice but no one believes me because they don't believe I'm 14. Surfing the internet at a young age exposes your mind to stuff, and plus my parents with their good parenting skills makes me think that I am at least more mature than most 14 year olds. (I would show the conversation I had but I don't know how to post images. Unless someone is willing to guide me, I will post it.)



I love them, I really do. I want them to get better, but my words fail to describe my feelings. 

How can I show them that life is more than just suffering, and there's so much more waiting for them in the future? 


How can I show them, the way I see living life as?"
1386,Depressed,"I'm having a hard time right now.

I recently lost my job 3 weeks ago, and my girlfriend left me a few days ago.

I have nobody to talk to, and I've lost all motivation right now.

My roomate got me a job at a call center, where I take calls from people who are stuck in their homes and dependent on food deliveries from the government, which don't arrive.

This job is a dead end, and a significant decrease in pay 

I'm sad, lonely.

I have to finish padding my tech resume so I can move forward. I don't have the motivation.

I know what i have to do, but I'm just distraught and can't bring myself to care.

I keep having visions of me blowing my brains out, I keep seeing the back of my head explode."
1387,Rules said I could vent. So here I go,"Everyone always tells me I have depression. Or at least asks. But I don't think that's true. I'm happy almost all the time. It's really the main emotion I feel. It's just always been like that. So that's why I'm posting it here. Because it wouldn't fit in r/depression . So I hope I read the rules right 

I'm living my 3 greatest fears currently in life. I'm not gonna go to deep into why, but I am gonna give some necessary information. I'm 15 yrars old. So as you could imagine this involves school. That's basically all that's necessary so here I go, explaining my fears amd why I feel like it. Because hey, nothing better than ranting online because I never want to tell anyone any of this irl.

My biggest fear is having one small action ruin everything in my life. It's always been their, just a creeping anxiety I guess. And that's whats been happening for 2 years.  You don't actually have to read this next part. It's very long and redundant. Just read the other 2 fears below if you want 

I started having to walk to school, leading to me missing the first 2 periods of school almost everyday, leading to a court case, after winning the court case, having a distrust for authority, leading to acting out, leading to trouble, leading to detention (at lunch), leading to me skipping detention because of another fear, leading to argument with mom, leading to temporarily moving in with Dad, told friend that, teacher overheard and told principal, principal tried to kick me out because of stupid law that I don't want to get in to, won that, was informed that all my teachers were told to try and watch me for mental illness by another teacher (god bless him), more distrust in authority because I was just expressing myself and was branded mentally ill for doing it. Despite me just joking around in class. Like throwing paper at friend, met girl at start of 8th grade through her cousin, who was in my friend group, figured out she basically had no friends besides her cousin, her cousin doesn't like her very much, I wanted to guarentee she had friends till at least I went to high school (she was in 7th grade, so no matter what I couldn't guarentee that for 1 year of high school), I did that, I basically hung out with her constantly during school, she asked me to go with her to a school event, I promised I would, I then got suspended for something I did about 3 months before, she said it was fine, but was visibly upset, after that I learned she went through a similar court case as me, and was constantly targeted by staff of my school, more distrust, I then wrote Ram Ranch on finals, principal read it back to me, I laughed because it's the funniest shit, he told me to tell the lyrics to my Mom as punishment, told him no,  bell rang, I ran out because of another fear I'll get into later, told everyone I knew about it (basically everyone in the 8th grade) they started making fun of him, I promised all my friends I'd go to the same  high school (a school I've wanted to go to since 2nd grade) I got in trouble for telling everyone the principal recited Ram Ranch to me, he told me he told the other principals in the district about me, which I was informed by my brother he did, since his principal talked to him about it, skipped school because I was incredibly upset, next day I got pulled into the office, school safety officer threatened to steal my bike (he bought the chain), threatened to whip him with the chain if he tried to take my bike, and was told to not come back, snuck back in at lunch to tell my friends about it, told that girl only since everyone else I was friends with was absent, she basically ignored me, she seems to have been hanging out with other people (really happy about that), it's been a year, I didn't get into that school, went to a random charter school because it was the only one that would accept me (my local school has had multiple murders occur at it, so fuck that) made no friends because I desperately wanted to get out,started skipping school because how much I hated it, called a teacher pretentious and dumb because he called incel a political terrorist organization. Which was pretty funny, like I don't like self titled inclels either.  But it isn't an organization lmao,and he talked about ""mumble crap"", also said he looked like a sex offender on an assignment, was told to right an apology, I did because I legitimately felt sorry for calling him a sex offender, because that could have real consequences for him, didn't apologize for calling him dumb, or saying that his wife divorced him because she married him because he looks rich, but isn't, because that's funny imo, I got kicked out, and I officially haven't had a real irl conversation with someone who's around my age in 1 year. Besides one friend. Also haven't talked to that girl in a year. 

Now that you're caught up, I'll explain my other fears. In less detail because I basically just gave you the short story version of the past 3 years of my life. 

My 2nd biggest fear is wasting time. So as I said before, I walked out of a meeting wity my principal because of this, I walked home with that girl every day. So since the bell rung, I had to leave to walk with her. I didn't want to miss it because I only had 2 months left of school. After that I can't guarantee I'd ever see her again. That's also the reason I skipped all that detention I mentioned. Because I had limited lunches. And I didn't want to waste any. That lead into my current life because I haven't made a single good memory with friends this past year. It's been one huge waste. Now I'll have no good school related memories for Freshman year. Largely of my own making too. Which leads into my next fear...

I fear living a life I regret. I don't have to explain this one at all really. I don't regret what I did necessarily though, I regret what I didn't do. 

I feel this horrible feeling everyday when I think about this stuff. I can't really explain it either. It's like a pit in my stomach

If you made it this far. Please diagnos me. Or give me some advice. Something at least. Call me retarded I don't really care. If you need more information, just tell me to elaborate. I just want to talk to someone about it. It's been pretty weird just having this to myself for this long"
1388,Therapy suggestions?,"I’m a single mother in the US, and I’m having a really hard time coping with life in general. My declining mental health is making it almost impossible to care for my son, since I don’t care about myself at all. I’m looking for therapy.
Ideally, it would be sliding scale or free, online via messages, and available immediately.
It’s very important to me that I get better. If I can’t, I have to give my son up, because I can’t cope with parenting him."
1389,Hopeless,I try to find a reason to not attempt but I can't find one anymore.
1390,How Does A Pandemic Impact Children?,"The world we live in today is a very different world than the one we lived in a few months ago. Nobody knows what the new normal will be, or whether there will ever be any normal. We are all cooped up inside our homes, waiting patiently for things to get better. Hence, there is no denying that our mental health is bound to have a few hiccups on the way. But we, as adults, are emotionally equipped to handle such fluctuations, or at least recognised that there is a problem. However, staying home all the time, not meeting your friends or teachers can have a huge impact of a child’s well-being. [Child therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/), in such cases, becomes important. That is mainly because this is all so new that nobody knows what to do about it, especially the kids. Not having a routine can mess with an adult, now imagine the impact of that on a child. It is also worth noting that it is not just the mental health, but also the physical health of kids that is in jeopardy during these trying times. 

As we have iterated before, this is all too new to know anything for certain. It will take a lot of studies to truly understand the impact of a pandemic on kids. This is not to say that this is the first ever pandemic the world has ever seen, but it is the first time where have access to the internet, where communities are a lot closer and dialogue around mental health is on an upswing. If you are worried about finding a [child psychologist in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) for your kid, fret not, because the city has some of the best therapists. This is all too new for us. Nobody knows what happens next or whether something will happen next. In such times, it is imperative that you keep your children happy and occupied. 

The power of a routine is often underrated. It can fix a lot of issues in your life as an adult. And as for kids, it is even more important. Hence, now that your kid can not go out for play date, or an even football class, make sure that your kid has some sort of routine in place. Do not keep it until the day comes to decide what to do. Have a fixed time for your kid to wake up and go to sleep. Homeschool should be at fixed hours with scheduled breaks in the middle. Even the[ best child psychologist in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) or any other city will tell you that a fixed routine will have a huge impact on your child’s well-being. If you have the privilege of an accessible garden or a rooftop, take them there every day. Let the kid have some physical exertion that they were so used to earlier. Yes, we might not know what is in store for us but what we know for certain is that the times are unprecedented, and we need to take care of ourselves."
1391,Why do I keep doing this? What's wrong with me? Am I just an asshole?,"TL;DR: I got stressed and felt angry for no reason, and don't know why it keeps happening

I went downstairs in a good mood this morning. I'd been up all night, but it's because of my sleep schedule.

I was going to make myself breakfast and try to have a good day, but my mom had to shut down my positivity because my sister's pet gerbil died (she doesn't seem torn up about it, but I know it's probably affecting her). Since I wasn't too bothered by the death and usually keep to myself anyways, I started to quietly play Animal Crossing. My brother wanted to watch, so I showed him my tent (my sister came over and sat on my other side to also watch.

We started to talk, but as they were talking the sound of their voices started to get annoying. It felt like they were too loud and irritating, and I tried asking them to be a bit quieter but they wouldn't listen. I ended up giving my sister a turn to play Animal Crossing and went back to my room without food. My heart was pounding and I was angry for no reason.

This has happened so many times before, and I'm sick of it. People call me an asshole when I lash out about it, but I don't want it to happen.

If it helps, I'm a 13 year old girl. I've been diagnosed with depression and I think anxiety? It was last year, so I don't quite remember everything"
1392,Idk how to get through the day anymore.,I can't think or breathe right and it's all too much to deal with.
1393,Help. I need advice/thoughts (possible DID?),"I’m sorry if this is long/completely all-over-the-place. I’m also sorry if I get anything wrong in this post—I’m new to this.

I’m worried and don’t know what to do. So, I’m a minor and I’d had this (non-human, adult) ‘imaginary friend’ for a long time, but they was always asleep in what I called my ’safe-space’. Even though they were asleep, I always knew their name and only told a few school-friends about them, since y’know, imaginary friends are sort of normal.

However, recently (roughly the beginning of 2020), they woke up and I started getting to know them. About that time, I learnt about DID, what it was and how it worked, through the YouTube channel ‘DissociaDID’ (they’re all awesome). When I watched more and more videos, things seemed to ‘add up’. Why I felt so weird sometimes, like I was in 3rd person/inside my head. Why I had a different appearance in my safe-space than I did IRL. Why I didn’t outgrow my imaginary friend and world. Why the friend felt so real.

I have a safe-space, where I can freely communicate with the friend. It’s sort of small though and I can’t really go too far in it, but it’s beautiful.

I felt... terrible when I saw how similar all this was to DID. There’s nothing wrong with having a mental disorder, but to put the puzzle together from strangers on the internet? It didn’t feel good. Of course, I’m reaching out to other strangers on the internet now, so I probably shouldn’t complain. I learnt that some people called what I called my safe-space their inner world and that the ‘imaginary friend’ was called an alter. The thing that made me feel the worst was seeing their ‘are you traumatised’ video, where they discussed symptoms of different types of trauma and I displayed all of the symptoms listed in the second type (dissociative trauma).

My first major concern is about what happened? DID is caused by repeated trauma, and I don’t know anything in my life that I could call abuse. Even if I wouldn’t know what it is (I believe the other alter is both a protector and trauma-holder) my parents would, and they seem to be really loving and caring, etc. . I only have a few possibilities that I could even consider, which are neglect, assault or... school.

First, neglect. I find it unlikely that it could be this one. I don’t have that much human interaction throughout the day. I also have an extreme aversion to loud sounds and human touch, mainly because they rip me out of dissociating and make me feel nauseous and gross.

Second, assault. When the other alter was created, I barely remember anything except the emotions of the situation and something I said. The emotions were fear, hurt and anger and I said “Get away from me,” while crying. Then we both think the friend fronted. However, I’m sure my parents would know something about it and they’ve never brought it up/treated me differently and, since I was younger, maybe it was over something trivial.

Third... school. It’s the most lucrative one, but I had some serious stuff going on back then. There was a girl who kept trying to steal my only friend, my only friend constantly betraying me to her and giving me trust issues, severe stress from schoolwork (I was a ‘straight A child’ and always had to be. My parents never pressured me into this, but it was a common expectation) not to mention I literally moved continents during this, from a relatively wealthy country to a third-world country which was a very jarring move. However, I seem like an entitled kid for saying this one, especially when there are victims of sexual abuse on this subreddit, which brings me to my last point.

I don’t feel like I have DID. Like I don’t deserve it because I haven’t been through enough (to my knowledge). I feel like a huge fraud, like I’m taking a label I shouldn’t have, even though I’m pretty sure an alter has been co-conscious twice now and fronted once long ago, it feels like something out of a book/movie. I reached out to a friend and told them all this and they’ve been really supportive, which helped a lot. And... even if this isn’t DID, I’ve developed some strong bonds to the friend.

P.S. : If you’re wondering why I don’t go see a therapist, it’s because

* the country I’m in doesn’t have a good physical healthcare system, let alone a mental one.
* DID is so stigmatised and badly diagnosed that it’d be bad if I tried to get diagnosed.
* if I saw a therapist... they might ‘integrate’ the friend. They’re like a parent/sibling to me and I don’t want to lose them or myself.

I don’t expect a diagnosis, if you give me one, I'll take it as an opinion, but I do need advice/knowledge from past experiences."
1394,Advice on how to not feel shit ?,"Since the beginning of 2020 I told myself I was going to try and see a doctor about my mental health because i’ve been experiencing some symptoms for a while but i’m scared of just talking to new people especially about something like that so i’ve been putting it off for a while. And then lockdown hit and I feel worse than before and I just want tips on how to feel better?

At first I just questioned whether this was just prolonged teenage angst that i’d eventually get over. And whether I was subconsciously making myself feel shit because it’s trendy nowadays. Or if this was just normal human behaviour that I was being over dramatic about. How do you even make an appointment about your mental health without telling the receptionist out loud that your concerned (uk)? Honestly I just kinda wanna stop feeling shit and need some tips on how to do that :) 

I feel like i’ve always been aimless due to indecisiveness and not really liking anything. And i’ve never really had any long term goals but more and more I feel like i’m a literal jellyfish and have felt like this for a while. I just feel dull (if that makes sense). In all honesty, I never had a game plan for my career or anything because I didn’t think i’d actually make it this far. And maybe my lack of ambitions is causing me to feel shit. But here I am, ready to study law at uni in a few months and still feeling not that great. So if I could just get advice on this whole rant in general that would be great :)

(also i’m sorry if anyone is offended that i’m posting on this sub when i’m not diagnosed with anything, but I just genuinely am asking for advice on mental health and thought maybe go to people who are experienced?)"
1395,Any tips for a sheltered child turned adult?,"My mom grew up teaching me basic life skills, housework, and how to act in public. But I’ve realized that I struggle with certain interactions in my life still and thinking for myself. It took me until I was about 19 or 20 to finally learn how to properly talk to and deal with guys because I grew up being told that they are nothing but trouble. I don’t necessarily disagree with that statement ,lol, but I was desperate to get the attention of the guys who liked me or socially awkward with men and scared of most men growing up and didn’t know how to deal with guys flirting with me. It didn’t help that I was overly nice to people growing up but still managed to have no friends and have been taken advantage of because of it. I grew up thinking that if you’re really kind and good to people, you’ll get the same energy back regardless of if they do you wrong or not (which definitely isn’t the case). I spent a lot of my years cleaning and helping to take care of my brother and just sitting in my room on my phone alone for hours. I struggle with organization and being responsible. I also struggle with setting boundaries because I was so used to everybody else setting them for me and telling me what I should or shouldn’t do with my life. I’m not sure what I want to do with my life because Im not used to thinking about what I genuinely want for myself. I’m so used to relying on my families acceptance and I’m learning how to only rely on my own acceptance. Moving over 1000 miles away from my family in a diverse city has helped a lot but there’s still a lot that I have to learn. I will be seeking counseling once this is all over and once my money gets together but does anybody have any self-help tips in the meantime?"

1397,Does anyone know what an antipsychotic would do to you if you aren’t bipolar/have a mood disorder?,"I’ve posted so many times abt so many things. Anyway I believe I was misdiagnosed bipolar. In the beginning I took their abilify and I was so exhausted all I wanted to do was sleep and I felt like I couldn’t think straight so I stopped it. 

Since then they’ve tried me on lamictal which did nothing but give me a panic attack and a rash. And now they’re trying me on vraylar. I told them I started taking it a week ago, I haven’t and I’m not going to. I want a second opinion when covid is over but for now I have to deal with them. Does anyone know what an antipsychotic would make someone who doesn’t need them actually feel like? I was on abilify such a short period of time I don’t remember what it made me feel like. Like would there be 0 effects or would it make me lethargic if it was something I didn’t need? I honestly have a tele-heath visit w my therapist tmrw and should have been on my meds for a week now so I need to know if there’s anything this should make me feel like if anyone knows!!!"
1398,I'm terrified that I have bipolar disorder.,"Throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious later on.

I've struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was 11, and bulmia since I was 13. I have been placed into partial inpatient hospitalization and taken a million medications for these issues before when I was a teenager, however I no longer have the need to take medication. I have a family history of mental health problems as well. I'm in my 20s now and I've learned how to manage my mental health issues to a surprising degree. So now that I'm noticing new symptoms it's freaking me out.

For the past 6 months or so, I intermittently have difficultly sleeping and start having paranoia and very mild visual hallucinations. I keep ""seeing"" something out of the corner of my eye, or become convinced in a dark room that someone is standing there, watching me. I can't sleep with the lights off anymore unless someone is with me. Even with the light on, if I'm not distracted I can't sleep because my mind keeps going; ""there's someone right there. there's someone right there. there's someone right there. there's someone right there."" Even though there never is.

I also notice during these times that during the day I am much more agitated than usual. I'm usually not the friendliest person, but this has become way out of character for me. I keep getting into intense arguments/fights with my spouse over stupid, stupid, STUPID shit and getting very annoyed at my close friends. I also have more difficulty than usual with focusing on my classwork and work during these times as well.

Last week really scared me though. There was a big misunderstanding with my college's virtual graduation event, long story short I had been nominated by my department to give a speech at this event but I wasn't chosen and the department didn't tell me. I had every right to be upset at what happened, but that's not how it went. I have never been so infuriated in my life. I wanted to punch a hole in my drywall and I wrote out several nasty emails to the dean (that I thankfully did NOT send). My jaw was clenched so hard that my teeth hurt. 

My spouse called me to try to calm me down and it only made me angrier. I started screaming about how dare they not chose me, I have accomplished more than everyone else graduating, I did more for the college than everyone else, I am smarted than everyone else, I was entitled to it, how dare they disrespect me etc etc. It doesn't sound as bad as it actually was in writing but it was very extreme and not in character for me at all. I \*have\* accomplished a lot, and I have been awarded over 5 awards from my university for my achievements, but I am usually very humble about it and I don't like to brag at all. I find it incredibly annoying when other people do that so I don't want to be ""that guy."" I am very cognizant of the fact that I am rarely the smartest or most accomplished person in a room and I can always learn something from others.

A few days later when I calmed down I realized that these are all symptoms of a manic episode and I likely had a delusion of grandeur. Bipolar disorder runs in my family, so I always knew this was a risk. The issue is that it's taken me a decade of suffering to figure out how to manage my other mental health problems. I don't want to have to do that all again or take medication. The other issue is that I want to pursue a political career in the future, and I know that will be difficult enough with just my current history of mental health issues. If I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder I am terrified that it will ruin my career. Some one, please please please tell me that I am overreacting and I don't need to see a psychiatrist about this.

TLDR; I have a personal and family history with mental health issues and I've noticed that I have  symptoms of a manic episode every month or so. I don't want to see  a psychiatrist about it because I don't want to ruin my chances of a future political career or take medication. Please tell me I'm overreacting."
1399,(M 16) I'm having a hard time mentally this quarantine and i need advice.,"So this quarantine has been pretty hard for me and it has been actually a mess. I can't really explain but I'm going to put a list of what i have noticed.

-constant stress without stop
-intrusive thoughts that i can't control 
(i can control it better now recently)
-hard time concentrating.
- constantly switching sexualities. 
And this part i have to explain thoroughly.
Remember the ocd part? Yeah that has been going for so long and only recently have i been able to control it. This is relevant to what I'm going to talk about and i have no idea how that works.

I have this loop in my brain where i go
Whenever i am straight i have an ocd and whenever i control it i either become bi or gay and whenever i try to do something about it i become autosexual (im inlove romantically and sexually to myself). Then i go back to the sequence. 

Im not sure how this works but it's really messing with my mind and i hate it so much.

Maybe its just my lack of social interaction that's been messing with me."
1400,Helping my boyfriend during quarantine?,"Hi all,

My boyfriend is severely depressed and I'm not sure how to help him, especially since right now we are social distancing due to Covid 19.

All he's done is sleep. He hasn't done schoolwork for the University he wants to go to, he hasn't even been playing video games anymore. He's stopped eating. He started smoking pot every day.

I feel like I'm slowly watching him die. I've already alerted his older sister about the situation and have gotten some other friends to reach out but I'm not sure what else to do. He refuses any kind of therapy. 

I just don't want to lose him to this disease."
1401,Need motivation please :(,"Don't really know how to start this but I don't really feel any excitement anymore. I lost motivation to do anything. I feel a lot of pressure from my friends saying I should study,study,study. But I don't even have motivation to do anything. 
Please give me some advice :) Thank you. I hope you guys have a good day❤️"
1402,Motivation during the currant crisis,"Long story short: I spent all of my teens and early 20’s at home due to mental health (social anxiety, anxiety, depression), I haven’t had  any friends in real life since I was 16 in school. I’ve recently started a new job in March which has for the first time allowed me to have a routine and something to look forward to everyday and now due to the lockdown I am back to square one of being at home constantly. 

I can tell my line manager at work is getting annoyed (even though she doesn’t say) because of my lack of work I am doing. Everyone is supportive at work and they understand my difficulties, but I just feel so useless. 

I want to be able to sit at my desk at home and do work (I am in a marketing role so it’s quite creative to an extent) but I am lacking any motivation what so ever to do anything. 

I don’t associate being at home with anything other than being ill with mental health. It’s lack I am just getting paid to sit in bed all day and sleep and I hate it it’s so degrading. 

I just want someone to feel better"

1406,I feel so pathetic...,"I just hate how my anger has plagued me, and I want for things to get better. This feeling is giving me panic and my mind is having these racing thoughts that I cannot control very well. I feel afraid of myself and incredibly anxious. I do not feel like a man, instead I still feel like a child stuck inside his head. I can say that I hate myself. It's really difficult to live this life when all I think about is negative things."
1407,"I feel really embaressed with myself for becoming very upset over small things, and letting it affect my day.","I'm a grown man in my 20s but I think I've been struggling with some sort of emotional baggage all my life. Looking back over the years I've definitely been able to help myself to an extent manage my emotional well-being and how I respond to situations. I work in Law and have a demanding job which I've learnt to handle very well, and I don't find myself phased by it. I've started to speak with a counsellor too but haven't really reached this topic yet in our sessions. 

I'm really embaressed with myself with how I handle certain situations. I'll explain the most recent scenario. I recently managed to get my hands on the camera I've wanted the past 4 years (photography enthusiast), was really happy and felt relieved as I had the opportunity to get hold of something I actually wanted and enjoy using. Then, one of the buttons break after just under a week of use. 

I was out on my walk when it happened and didn't let it bother me, but when I got home it eventually began to really bother me and I became very sullen and upset. It really effects me to the extent I lost all my energy, don't want to move, and my family notice it and I get very embaressed. I feel frustrated and my eyes water. I get thoughts like 'it always happens to me', 'typical', 'nothing good ever happens for me', 'it's not fair'. 

I feel really embaressed becuase I can handle other situations very well, and I've for the most part been a very patient and capable person. But through my life I've noticed that over small things like this, I get really effected. It's silly and it makes me feel worse becuase it's over something relatively trivial. I handle the situation really well at first and then I gradually begin to crumble and become a bit more emotionally stale.  My camera broke yesterday, and even though I have a solution to get a refund, I'm still feeling really upset I can't get a replacement (sale, second hand) and that even when I get my refund I won't be able to afford the actual camera body and I'm stuck with lenses. I really think there's something very wrong with me - I seriously feel upset about this, more than I should probably. Yes it'd frustrate anyone but I'm legit feeling like there's no energy left in me. 

I'm just venting more than anything or seeing if anyone has had similar experiences. I don't know what the issue could be, I seem to have some emotional problems, probably buried and needs to working with."

I have anxiety, but this is different from what I’ve ever experienced before.  Ill subconsciously think up scenarios.  Ex.  Someone calls me stupid, what will I say?  But on a larger scale and with things that won’t even happen.  I’ll just be doing task and they will pop into my head, even if they aren’t related to my task.

1410,"I feel different, it’s like I’m being pushed back into my own thoughts","As the heading says, I’m being pushed back into my own mind. It’s so hard to explain but think of the movie “inside out” where they have a control panel 

well sometimes I have a strange feeling that washes over me, I hate it , it feels like my body is too tight on me, as it washes over me I feel my view over the world is getting a little blurry and like there is a glass cover over the panel and I can’t get to it. After it settles it still feel the same it’s just not so intense, but I get distance from the people around me, my bf has noticed it a couple of times but hasn’t really said anything, but when this happens I’m differently to how I normally, I feel differently about some things, I don’t really recognize my reflection but I can still see everything it’s blurry and just takes me a while. I feel so tired mentally tired but I can’t really tell how my body feels 

I start to come out of it, I don’t know how long it takes but it’s quicker then going into that state. And I feel awake and I look at my bf and thing about how much I love him and missed him. Idk what happening and it’s kind of creeping me out, it used to be only little changes but I have noticed it a lot now"
1411,How can we save our sister from her herself?,"I’m the oldest sibling, and my younger siblings are Megan (14F) and Hannah (8F) [both fake names]. Hannah is what Megan and I believe to be a “budding psychopath” because of her behaviors. 

When she was born, everything seemed normal. My sister and I both loved the idea of having a little sister. Hannah was a normal cute baby with big blue eyes. Then around the time she started walking, tantrums started. For any and everything, she’d go into hysterics. I remember once she was screaming and crying while holding her hands up as if she wanted our mom to pick her up. When she did, she began crying louder as if she wanted to be put down. It was like nothing anyone did was right. 

When Hannah was around 4-5, whenever she’d get really mad at Megan and I, she would pee next to us, right there on the ground, sometimes peeing on objects. My parents would chalk it up to her being scared, but Megan and I knew she did it to piss us off. When she’d pee, she sometimes stare at us and smile while doing so, if not during, then afterwards. She would do it out of spite, and revel in the fact that we were made to clean it up for “scaring her”. 

When she was around 7, my siblings and I all went with our grandparents to their cabin. They lets us walk alone on path since they lived miles from anyone else. Megan and I wanted go alone, but our grandparents insisted we bring Hannah with us. As we are walking, Hannah grabs a big stick and begins charging at me and Megan while swinging it us, at one point I ducked it as she threw it straight at my head. The crazy thing is, it seemed like she only did it for fun. She was giggling and smiling as if it were a game, even though she could see how distressed Megan and I were. We continued walking and we saw an injured bird who’s wing seemed damaged walking on the trail. We all knelt down around it and Megan held in her hands and suggested we take it back to our grandparents and I agreed. But Hannah disagreed and said (paraphrased), “why would we do that? We should just kill it.” When I asked why she said “birds don’t live as long as humans. By the time we walk back, tell papa, and he drives it all the way into town to get it fixed, the damage will be worse and the bird will die. We might as well kill it right now so it won’t hurt anymore.” I could’ve believed this was the rationalization of a child to want to save a hurt animal, albeit twisted and abnormal, but when she said ‘we might as well kill right now’, her eyes lit up and those pearly blues had a certain eagerness/excitement to them. A chill ran through my body and every hair stood up. It was like she wanted only to kill the bird, and the rest was just a justification. When I turned to Megan, she had the same “wttff” expression as I did. We walked it back to our grandpa, he drove it in town, and they fixed it, gave it back to my grandparents to nurse back to healt, and it flew around their garden all the time for months. Megan and I never told them what Hannah said. 

Now, aged 8, Hannah knows how to get Megan and I in trouble almost effortlessly. She can get under our skin to the point where Megan (who’s an extreme pacifist) has tried to attack her; luckily I was there to stop her from striking. We’ve also heard our parents saying that she doesn’t get along with other kids at school and has gotten in trouble for “conduct issues” for the things she says or does to her peers. My parents are turning out to be the scapegoat parents who make excuses instead of opening their eyes. They believe Hannah’s home behaviors are “normal siblings behaviors” even though me and Megan can assure you that they are NOT normal at all. They also believe her school behaviors are because “she’s more mature than other students, so they don’t always understand what she’s doing.” WTFFF!???!!? How can we help her? Should we get other extended family members  on our side? Tell teachers at our school? Will that even help? 

**TL:DR;** younger sister is a budding-psychopath and our parents are ignoring it. 

Also, there are way more stories I could tell, I just shaved it down to these few"
1412,Not sure if it's just a bad habit...,"I have alot of anxiety and am diagnosed and medicated for depression. But something that I thought would change during my recovery but haven't changed is me scratching my skin. Something I've been doing from a very young age...

I suspect I have dermatillomania (skin picking) . But since its basicly a self diagnosis it might not be. 

But I constantly feel like I am a parrot plucking my own feathers cuz of stress or anxiety. I bleed several times a day after a scratch on old wounds or blisters. 
Like how often or how severe does it have to be before I search help for this?

And do you guys maybe have some tips on how I can stop scratching? 🥺"
1413,"Fucked up, help please","I’ve posted this elsewhere but any information would be great please


I damaged my liver slightly at the start of the year from taking a staggered overdose of paracetamol and I went to a&amp;e after being convinced by a friend.  It wasn’t a suicide attempt just a stupid form of self harm and I didn’t do it again for about a month.  Then I was doing it on and off, the last time being just 8 yesterday which I tried to throw up after realising how stupid it was.  I’m scared I’ve done serious damage since I’ve had mild pain that’s mainly uncomfortable that comes and goes ever since.  The other day it was hurting but I hadn’t taken any in about a month I’d say.  

What do I do? I’m scared of going to a&amp;e again, I’ve told my mother the last time was over a month ago but not about yesterday.  When I threw up it was probably half an hour later and my food from the day and possibly crumbs of paracetamol came up so idk if that’s any help but it’s been uncomfortable again today.  I was sick but I had an energy drink and I don’t usually have those / caffeine and a bunch of anxiety so I don’t know what that was about.  

I’m freaking out.  I don’t know why, I knew it was stupid but it’s probably because I could do serious damage makes it real.  I’m too scared say I took any yesterday because I did just take 8 and I did throw up soon after and I hadn’t in a while before then.  Is there anything I can to help my liver? I’ve scared myself and I don’t really want to do it again.  If somebody could please reply to this with some help that’d be great, thanks."
1414,How can I help my friend ?,"Hey there. I need your help. 
One of my internet friend (UK) that I've known for several years now is having a real hard time but it has gotten so bad that he is in full denial. 

When I first 'met' him (online), he was that really depressed guy with some trouble but he was still kind of connected to reality. Then it got a bit funky with the time and I noticed that he was suffering from strong paranoia, believing that people were following him in the streets... until today. Today it's a complete mess, he's paranoid and imagines himself being linked to some government secret operation and that he was chosen to spread the covid-19 and is overthinking numbers everywhere, saying that everybody is plotting against him. Sometimes he can get super angry, some fits of rage and threatens to attack people (especially random people outside, cars being too noisy 'to intimidate him' etc). 

Few weeks ago he managed to finally see a therapist, and got a prescription to start taking care of his paranoia bipolar borderline disorders, but he read the notice and got scared by the undesirable effects. Then it evolved quickly since the beginning of the pandemic and now he believes that the treatment is to make him shut up about that whole conspiracy against him and refuses to take it. 
He is currently living with his family who thinks he is taking his meds because he lied to them (at this point i have no idea how they cannot notice how bad he is feeling inside) and doesn't want to go back at his own place because he thinks he is being poisoned there and that his neighbors are also plotting against him. 

With few other friends we tried to discuss with him and show him that his conspiracy theories against himself are all produced by his brain but he won't listen and it is only getting worse and worse. 


So, Reddit, I don't want to give up but what are my options ?"
1415,Welcome to hell,I live with gamers. They feel the need to spend quality time watching streamers and that’s whatever but I literally listened to indescernable screaming + car alarms for 5 minutes while trying to analyze what I was hearing no one was even awake to find me crying on the kitchen floor. I’m so over this I can’t stop HEARING screaming and crying now. This freaking drivel serves no purpose and they still can not seem to understand ‘no I don’t want to watch it no I don’t want to hear it’
1416,I've hit a wall in being able to help my brother,"Over the past few years my brother has been diagnosed with several mental illnesses. One of them being psychosis. After about year of taking medication he seemed to be getting better, but now he's an adult and doesnt want to take his medicine anymore. I don't mean to be mean by this, but he's gone off the deep end. All he talks about anymore is theories about how everything in life is related to the blockchain. I'm not sure what to do to help him since he's an adult and just throws out any advice I give him"
1417,Skin condition affecting my self-esteem,"Hi good day to all. I really do not know where to begin but this is my first ever post, specifically created a post just to vent. so yeah if anyone sees it or not its alright, at least this is a journal for me to talk things.

Background story, I am a guy suffering from this condition: Keratosis pilaris (KP). Based on google images, I can safely say I am one of the most worst cases (rate 8-9/10 i guess haha). KP is this tiny red dots manifesting all over my forearms, arms, a little on the legs and in my buttocks. This condition has no cure, with little to no clinical trials done, and is extremely stubborn to treat. I seriously hate this, like I am really low self-esteem in this. Though, I never got bullied or ostracized for such a condition. In fact, I interact rather well with my friends and even work out pretty often.

Now you must be wondering: If I am never bullied, and seems to be having a relatively ""pleasant"" life, why would I still struggle with self-esteem issues? I think the root of the answer is how I anticipate people will perceive me, when they see the redness and bumps on my skin, especially my **forearms, upper arms and my back**. The arms are the most visible area when I wear a T-shirt. I always have ""weird"" postures of my limbs especially when under a bright white light, as the redness and bumps are **extremely red and apparent**. It makes me really question myself: Why am I struggling to show my forearm/arms, when almost all people whom I've met are never ever bothered by such problems. I literally turned down every opportunity to my friend's invitation to swim or any activities that involve taking off my shirt. I absolutely hate this - the fact that I could not have fun and enjoy like most of other friends do. 

On the other hand, most people in the gym are proudly showing off their guns in tank tops/sleeveless-tee, and I know that I will never have such an opportunity to ever be proud of my biceps covered full of red dots, no matter how hard/lean I train.

I had searched for countless therapeutic treatments online, and all have never once made a significant difference for me. I even consulted several dermatologist, who also provided therapeutic treatments that did not offer significant effects. 

I really feel absolutely crushed and hopeless, knowing that I almost will never get out of this world full of skin rashes. I never knew whats it's like to wear a sleeveless-tee for a minor trip of shopping or chilling with friends, and I probably never will. This waves of hopelessness just keeps coming, and I pray to God (am a spiritual person :P) that I can finally see light at the end of this tunnel.

Thank you for reading all the day till this part. I really appreciate that you heard my rants, I really do."
1418,YOU are the answer to your problems.,"Instead of dwelling on the past and worrying about the future, Try living in the moment, every thing becomes less daunting and easier to deal with. There is a reason you are depressed and you aren't going to overcome it unless you connect with yourself and understand your mind. 

If you don't fit in, don't try to. God has a different plan for you and the faster you accept that the less you will hate yourself. When you don't try to fit in, your energy will naturally attract people. 

This is easier said than done and I am not over depression and anxiety yet. Far from it. But I now have optimism and that is the key to getting over depression. 

Sending love to all of you soldiers with mental problems. We are the ones who are awake in a world that's asleep.✌✌"
1419,Just stopped being friends with someone,"They're understandingly mad because I literally can't tell them why. I figured in time I can, but right now I can't. They just took advantage of me one too many times. Even worse, the person gave up their rights to make decisions for themselves and appointed a guardian. Now I am afraid of repercussions from both the person and the guardian.

I feel like I can just lay in bed for a week or two after this because I am on my own here due to mental health services being closed and what not. Not enough to warrant crisis, but those guys are so busy right now that they only take suicide emergencies and domestic violence emergencies right now. I'm not gonna fake being suicidal to talk to crisis, that will go south pretty bad. (Someone I know did it, last I heard they're in Adult Foster Care."
1420,Why does my father do this to me,"I just got home form a run and my dad called my name to wash the dishes, the problem is that i he expects me to hear him form across the house. Just now I didn't hear him and he flipped the fuck out. He started yelling at me that I didn't hear him he first two times and took my fucking ps4. He then started to make fun of my appearance and he pushed me telling me how stupid i am. This isn't the first time by the way. On a regular bases he verbally abuses me for the most smallest things. Because of him I don't believe in god. Its because of him I think that there is nothing to live for. It is because of him I wanted to cut myself. It is because of him I smoke. He also knows what he is doing. He said to me word for word ""If you don't do what I tell you to do, I will make your life a living hell."" When I get older and get a high paying job or a successful career, I will cut all ties with him and if  get a kid I will raise him the right way."
1421,"I need help, but I can't afford to get help","I don't know where to start, I don't know what's relevant. All I know is that right now I'm not in a good space and I don't know what to do about that. I've long come to the realisation that I am the problem and am also the solution. However that hasn't helped me. I don't know how to fix the problem, when I am the problem. It's like asking a leak to fix itself by not leaking. That's how I feel. 

I don't know what to do, I can't talk to anyone. I've tried reaching out and nothing. It's like I'm talking to those close to me and they're not even looking in my direction. I feel dejected most of the time, no motivation. Even know I just feel like I'm throwing some words together in my haste to just feel something other than wrong. I can't focus. I have a list of things to do and I'm finding it harder and harder to even start doing the things I need to do. 

I don't know where to start or what to say."
1422,Plz help. I think I'm developing a disorder,"So, I (20F) have been thin all my life. I'm not flat and my butt is pretty much defined but not round and stuff.
So I've been dating another girl (30F) for about two years. We're all good and stuff. But she called another girls who are curvy hot, cute and... several times. (some were my friends!) We talked. She said she's into me and stuff. And she didn't mean anything.
But it's too late for me. 
I keep trying to gain weight and I'm actually hurting myself as my body can't digest this suddenly increased amount of food. I'm weight lifting like crazy.
I also have IBS and lactose and gluten intolerance. So you can guess how hard it is for me to eat. And I keep eating foods that aren't really healthy for me anyway. 
I think it's turning into something serious. I've had depression for like 8 years. 
I'm obsessed with my calorie intake and when I can't take enough I suddenly start crying. 
I've even having nightmares and can't sleep well.
I feel worthless. I hate my body...."

1424,I'm so angry at myself.,"I feel like I'm stuck. I have people who would call me a friend, but i feel no connection to them. I don't know what to do with friends. I'm at that stage of life where my parents expect me to be ""responsible "", but as much as I love them and know that they mean well, I feel judjed. I have no other relation with my extended family, not a people person, and I feel useless seeing how my cousins and brorher are happy with the family. I'm stuck in a degree that I thought I liked, but I don't anymore, and I've got one year left, I can't quit, but even if I complete, I'll just have a passionless degree, with average marks and no future without further studies. I have no other employable skills, and too much dreams for my own good. I'm stuck."
1425,Instagram 'aesthetics',"Hey!
If you're reading this i first of all wanna say thank u 👌🏻 I've had this particular issue for a while now and basically wanted to see if it was a common thing.
For a bit of background, around 5 years ago i suffered with body dysmorphia which then led into me occassionally stress pulling out my eyelashes. Recovered from the ED now and pretty much stopped the eyelash thing but essentially since these issues began i don't feel as if i have had the time to figure out who I am.
Basically i will go on to instagram or see a person and be like 'omg i love their aesthetic' and then i will buy clothes to match that, decorate in a way i think represents this etc, but then someone else will come along who is totally different and i'll swap and change to whatever their aesthetic is. So for example i find someone who dresses in the korean street style, watches anime - i will do the same. Then i will see someone who is into rock music and dresses alternatively, and i will then change to that.
It sounds so ridiculous when i write it out, none of these things affect my personality (i always behave the same way) and i do enjoy rock music, anime etc but i feel like because i've been on IG so long and seen people who have very specific aesthetics, i feel like i need to dedicate my entire being in one direction if that makes sense? I am getting better with it and i'm very aware i'm doing it as well, i seem to be able to recognise and stop it quicker these days but i will fall into the same trap a few days later.
The only other thing i can think of is that i have spent so long feeling as if i am not good enough that i haven't allowed myself time to figure out who i am so i latch on to other peoples images. 
I have unfollowed the people on IG who i feel trigger me as well so hoping that helps.
I have written this as honestly as i can so hopefully someone can identify or at least pass on some wisdom because try as i might this keeps happening and its getting super frustrating. Feel free to ask any questions.
Stay safe dudes! ✌🏻😊🧡"
1426,How is Mental Health being impacted by Covid-19? Sandro Galea has some thoughts: scary.,"In this 5 minute video, Sandro Galea - Dean on Boston University's School of Public Health - talks bout how mental health is being impacted now by Covid and what to expect in post-Covid world: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R\_UWKzL11co](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_UWKzL11co)"
1427,8-year-old me was an absolute train wreck of a human being and nobody seemed to notice,"So I was doing some introspection the other day and I realized that the way I acted and behaved when I was around 8 years old could be indicative of serious mental issues (I've never been diagnosed with anything so there's no way of knowing what I actually had) but I thought I'd share this on here to try and figure out maybe what my issues were. In case anyone asks, both my parents and my school seemed to either not to notice, not to care, or they thought I was just weird and avoided the subject. As an 8-year-old I was too ashamed to ask for help and honestly I didn't know I needed it in the first place, but adult me is seeing some big red flags. That said, here's what I was like at that age:

* When going to bed, there was a certain thing that my mom would have to say to me before I would sleep. It was like a scripted thing where she'd say ""goodnight OP"" and I'd respond with ""goodnight mom,"" and then she'd have to say something like ""I love you OP"" and I'd have to follow with ""I love you m-o-m"" (I'd have to spell it instead of say the word) and so on. It was around 30 seconds long and every word and gesture had to be replicated exactly or else I would throw a fit until my mom repeated that part of the ritual the correct way. Only she could do it. If my dad tucked me in that night or if there was a babysitter, they weren't supposed to do it. So I was fine if it wasn't done, but if she tucked me in, she'd have to do it.

* I had several comfort objects. I had a small blanket that I would refuse to sleep without and I had a small stuffed toy that I needed to be kept under my pillow every night. If those things weren't there, I would freak out and I wouldn't sleep until they were found and placed there. Replacement items wouldn't work.

Before I continue, in case you're wondering what my parents' reactions were to these requirements, my mom would laugh and tell me I'm being silly, and my dad would make fun of me. He'd change his voice so he sounded like a little toddler and say things like ""I need my...widdle blanky...goo goo."" My sister would just smirk and go along with whatever my parents said.

* Because of how my parents (and sister) treated me about stuff like this, I was very prone to tantrums. They would say stuff about my quirks that would set me off and I'd yell and scream and cry for hours, and I'd talk about how I hate everyone and say really awful things, and then I'd talk about how I didn't need those things anymore but then I'd throw an even bigger fit because I realized I did and I thought I was pathetic. I cried myself to sleep a lot as a child.

* Now let's talk about school. I cried a lot in school too but it wasn't tantrums. If I realized I forgot something I was supposed to bring, I'd break down and cry. I was extremely afraid of getting in trouble. If I was scolded at school I'd be inconsolable because of how much I'd cry and withdraw into myself. One time I forgot a pencil and I was too afraid to admit that I didn't have one so I just sharpened a grey crayon so it was really pointy and I tried doing my work with it because I thought nobody would notice, but I realized how different it looked from writing in pencil so I sat there crying until a teacher gave me a pencil.

* I ate lots of stuff that wasn't food. I wouldn't just chew on my eraser, I'd eat it and swallow it. I did the same with crayons. Eventually it got really bad and I moved on to pencils (as in I'd chew and swallow the wood and the graphite, but I'd spit out the metal after I'd tear it off the pencil with my teeth). My teacher would see me doing this and just give me this death glare, like ""how dare you?""

* I let work pile up like crazy. Every student had a folder of unfinished work that they kept in a bookcase in the classroom. Everyone's folder was slim with 2 or 3 things in it but mine was overflowing with dozens of papers in it.

* I had zero attention span. I would often get in trouble for not following directions because my brain would wander and I'd daydream. I'd do things incorrectly and when called out on it I'd start to cry because I thought the teacher was holding out on telling me how to do something, but really I just wasn't paying attention.

* I had a very inflated sense of ego. Despite all the stuff above, I was fairly intelligent as a kid, and this included reading extremely well. I would sometimes boast that I was a genius and needed to skip a grade, and I would tell my parents about how everyone else in my class was stupid. Yeah, I was a dick. Really I just read a shit-ton of Magic School Bus and regurgitated the info.

Most of these behaviors disappeared after second grade, but for some reason during that one year all this stuff was really strong. The only behavior that lasted beyond second grade were the bedtime rituals and objects, everything else went back to normal. The bedtime stuff went away about a year after that.

Does anyone think they know what was wrong with me? You'd probably think OCD, but like I said, after a while I just stopped doing these things abruptly with no therapy or anything, but I was the only person in my class who was like this. I was thinking maybe obsessive behaviors set off from some kind of anxiety, but I'm not a psychologist so I'm unsure."
1428,how do i stop being a pathological liar?,i just always seem to lie for no goddamn reason and i don't know how to stop it. i don't want to lose someone because of this. is there any way i can stop lying?
1429,I stopped getting into internet arguments,"So I used to be very big on internet arguments but now I have changed a lot as I have now grown up and whenever I see an internet argument happening I now say ""This isn't my fight."" Its weird considering that whenever I get myself into internet fights I most likely couldn't handle the insults. I still post things on reddit that of course are bound to have people hate on it but I'm just glad that I keep myself away from them."
1430,Brotherly / Parental Advice,"I'm 23 years old and live with my grandparents and my sister. She is 16 and has always struggled with academics. We have always given her the benefit of the doubt and even put her in lower loaded courses to help her catch up. She's now a freshman in high school and we were all very proud when she performed very well in her first two trimesters (3 semester system). She was even in the ""normal"" classes! 

Unfortunately this didn't last, quarantine hit and the schools began online course work. She did her school work for the first week and then didn't do ANYTHING. Grades were reported and there was a conversation where she said she wasn't motivated (No reason was given as to why) and then ended with us agreeing that I would help her stay on track. This mostly included scheduling her school work and ""assigning due dates"". These were typically before the actual due date and spread throughout the week as to help her stay on task and not overwhelm her with assignments. This. Worked. Wonders. She was doing well again and she was all caught up with late work! I even noticed that she was performing this well without any non-organizational help! I told her what needed to be done and she crushed it! I told her she was doing well and that I would be stopping moderating her. I showed her how to check her due dates online and what not and I genuinely thought she was in a good place to moderate herself. Turns out I was wrong. Her final grades came in and she failed 3 of her 4 classes. She wasn't turning in her assignments! I knew something was wrong but I just didn't know what, it's possible that I STILL do not know.   


Yesterday I sat down with my grandparents and discussed a punishment of sorts for her failing this many classes. I suggested that we take away her electronics or possibly limit her usage of them. I believed this would be effective as she spends most of her time in her room watching YouTube, TV, and playing on her phone / other devices. It was then that they told me that they found out she's been engaging in self-harm. This obviously pushes her punishment on the backburner of my priority list but I have no idea how to proceed. Do we take her to a doctor? A therapist? Do we just spend more time with her and see if she opens up?   


I'm fucking clueless. I had no idea this was happening. I feel like a shitty brother for not knowing what she was doing but I did exactly what she did when I was in high school (Didn't turn in assignments and spent a lot of time on electronics) but I never self-harmed / was depressed! I just didn't know.   


I'm a 23 year old with no kids or experience taking care of another human. How can I educate myself on self-harm / mental health and provide her with the best support?   


PS: Let me know if you need more details. Sorry for the scatter brained post ..."
1431,[23M] Another therapist quit on me,"Again after the first session this new therapist just yelled at me at the end and quit. Then a few hours later the agency called me saying I am no longer being accepted as a patient there.

I hate this. Nothing works. I need to die.

Please just fucking kill me. Please just end my miserable excuse of a ""life"".

I am so tempted to punch my face over and over again. I wanna hurt myself so badly. Nothing will save me. I need to die."
1432,Does anybody feel like an invisible person judging you (or someone from the past) while doing daily work?,I feel like I'm secretly being judged by invisible people or people I hate from the past. It's like they despise me for doing that thing poorly (what I'm doing at the moment). Is there a way to shut this off? Does anybody else feel like this?
1433,Zoom Therapist ? I need one &amp; I have insurance please help,My doctor has me on mood medication and I was supposed to find a therapist but then COVID happened and I’m still medicated but I need. I really need a therapist that is available via zoom. Preferably a woman of color like me .
1434,Mental Health in the Black Community,"There is a new group that is promoting overall health and wellness called Iwokewellness. Monday they have a video series called ""Meltal Health Matters Mondays"" please take a few minutes to understand how mental health is viewed and impacts the black community.

I hope this will bring you peace, or you will learn something! I am not associated with the group but I wanted to share because I don't often hear these takes from this perspective. Peace &lt;3"
1435,Is she okay?,"I (M22) am not getting involved in my friends (F22)  odd behaviour because I don't want to make it worse. I will only get involved if she asks me too.

But just so I am prepared;

Just like me sadly, she has just been through a breakup. Together for 2 and a half years with her ex-boyfriend (M25) and it ended mid January. She had helped me alot with my breakup and feel as if I owe her the same. We haven't spoken in a few weeks now because I am a keyworker and just don't have the time. But she has started to act strange. She broke it off with him and at first said she was happy she did and started to enjoy her single life by partying and spending time with family. However, lately she has totally changed her way of life. She craves alot of attention so is always posting pictures of fancy meals and gifts and days out, etc. But now she acts strange and dresses up like clowns holding knifes, witches, zombies, Alice in Wonderland stuff. It's bizzare.

They both have each other blocked but I realised she did not delete his mother from FB. I was thinking maybe she wants the ex to see all this and text her? I don't know so any help or similar stories would be appreciated."
1436,Work Performance Following Disclosure,"Hello,

A few months ago I was diagnosed with severe depression and I started on meds about one month ago. I disclosed this to my boss around the time everything happened. I just had a discussion with my employer who informed me that I was under-performing and must now be put on an improvement plan (probation). Do I have any protections in this situation? A big factor in this has been the depression and adjustment to meds, but they do not seem to care at all.

I am employed by a UK-based charity, if that matters.

Any advice?

Thanks!"

1438,I can’t do this anymore.,"My first love was my everything. We met online and both moved to the same country to be together. He promised he would always fight for us, for as long as he lives. Well guess what, 2 years later we broke up in a text fight and he claimed he still loves me but is too tired of fighting and thinks this is for the best for ME and never sees this working out in the future. How am I supposed to deal with the fact that the most important person in my life gave up on me? It’s been the most painful, depressing weeks of my life. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I feel horrible every single day. I go to therapy 3 times a week. I have no friends where i live, he was my best friend and I didn’t bother getting to know anyone else. I wrote him a text a week ago, apologizing for my behavior and asking to talk about what has happened. He has not answered. Instead he has been changing his social media bios with quotes about a girl who he loves but it will never work out with. I hate it so much. Is it too much to ask to get a ‘no i dont want to talk’ or ‘yes i want to say something’ . How can you leave someone you love so much so impulsively and dont look back. How am I supposed to keep living in this city, filled by memories of me and him...It horrifies me. I can’t let him go. Please help me I am in so much pain"

I have late night thoughts that I assumed I’d leave at night but they’ve began to follow me wherever I go. I have the urge to just off myself, but also another that stops me. A sudden impulse I feel , is all it will take. I need advice, I don’t know what to do with my life. It’s as if all my happiness has been drained, all my goals, hopes and dreams. I’m so lost."
1440,Dissociative quarantine,"Is anyone else experiencing extreme dissociation from quarantine? Or maybe the correct term is derealization.
Nothing feels real in my life anymore. Like there would be no consequences for anything, there is no future or plans that I should care about, I have no motivation to do anything. Everything feel so.... distant.
I’m afraid it will cause me to lose my job. I’m very new and the least senior person in my company and I have basically gotten nothing accomplished the past two weeks.
Does anyone have any advice for this. I feel like my life is completely not mine and out of my control."
1441,Need help with binge eating (I think?) PLEASE,"I can’t control myself. I actually managed to fast all day, drinking water and stayed busy during lunch, and it felt great. I made it all the way home, had a small meal I cooked myself, felt great and a few hours later I laid down. I literally sat up in bed and couldn’t stop thinking about food downstairs. I finally got up, made more food (junk) and literally drank chocolate syrup and milk... what the fuck is wrong with me? 

A few months ago, I had done OMAD fasting for about a month, lost 25 lbs, was drinking only water, working out regularly, and had all but kicked the cravings. But now, after a rough breakup and this damned quarantine (I know it’s necessary but it just SUCKS) I can not control myself. I feel like a damned CHILD. 

This has become a regular feeling. Don’t think about food, think about not being fat, being healthy, only to wind up eating enough to make me queasy. 

I’m at the end of my rope here. I’m 8,000 miles from my family, it’s affecting my job, I really don’t know where to turn. 

What the hell do I do?

For reference, I’m in the military and I live overseas."
1442,My psych f*cked up,"Today at the pharmacy the pharmacist asked about my wellbutrin being lowered. I was prescribed 150 mg a day. In March I was at 300 mg. Since April it’s been 150 mg. For an entire month my wellbutrin has been cut in half. I had no knowledge of a medication change &amp; had given no consent to making any medication changes. We discussed changing a different med &amp; I didn’t want to. We agreed to leave the meds where they were at. I’ve had a number of issues &amp; symptoms pop up since the unknown med change, I thought I was just struggling because I am stressed out, we have a lot going on. Now it all makes sense. 

I emailed her for a refill &amp; for the second time she only sent four out of my five prescriptions to the pharmacy.  To the wrong pharmacy too, mind you. I’ve been trying to make an appointment with my psych for a month &amp; haven’t been able to due to technical issues with the system overcharging what I should actually pay. We talk through a virtual online psych company. I emailed her to see if I could see her in person because I know she has a practice in person not too far from me. She hasn’t responded to me. There has been more issues with her in the past. 

I am going to email her to let her know what’s going on with my meds. I just feel so defeated with mental health professionals. The last one I had was horrible too. I’ve never had a psych that I liked &amp; now I don’t care, I just want my f*cking meds so I don’t live in chaos. This has been going on for ten years, this off &amp; on of psychiatrists who suck at their jobs. My hands feel tied &amp; I’m about ready to try to find ANOTHER new psych. I’m at a loss. I don’t know what the f*ck to do."
1443,My roommate is affecting my mental health,Okay so already by the title you already know what I’ll be talking about. For quite so time I’ve been living with a roommate we became friends rely quickly and have been the time of my life. However the one thing I’ll complain about her is she’s always negative. Constantly . I know she’s struggling with poor mental health also but she brings down the mood every time we’re together. I don’t want to sound heartless but I also struggle with a mental illness and it’s really hard for me to stay positive. I love her unconditionally but I don’t know what to do.
1444,Can't stop thinking Tw:s**c*de,"Lately, I can't get suicide off my mind. I keep feeling like I never run out of things that I need to be significantly worried about. Too many expectations and responsibilities, I can't get a date, no job with covid, no car no money, and I flunked out my 8th and final semester of college. i have no choice but to drop or change.

I keep smoking pot because im so anxious my chest won't stop hurting and I can't stop crying when im sober for the past 12 months. 

I can't afford constant therapy and meds or keep up with appointments due to responsibilites. Plus I feel so hurt over the failed relationships and how they ended that I can't think about anything else.

My deadbeat dad called me to ask to claim me on his taxes. My friends gossiped about me on campus and now I have a reputation.  

I just keep feeling like I can't get a break from life. I really wish I was dead right now. I keep trying to keep my head above water and stay calm and positive, but deep down i cant stop thinking about killing myself. Idk what to do. The little coping mechanisms don't work when I feel extreme"
1445,Mental breakdown,"Okay so I live in brisbane, Aus. I suffer from bipolar affective disorder and ptsd. My regular gp does prescribe diazapam when I feel I need it, but this particular doctor works 2 weeks in brisbane and does 2 weeks work in rural areas (great dude, great doctor). I also have an appointment with a psychiatrist but that's in like 2 months. These past few days have been absolutely horrific, I'm having flashbacks, panic attacks and I've slept about 6 hours in the past 2 days. At this point I'm so uptight and paranoid I don't want to leave the house. I was wondering if one of those online doctors consults are worth sussing out for a prescription or it's just a waste of time?"
1446,Treatment options AVPD and schizoaffective disorder,"hello,


i have schizoaffective disorder and an avoidant personality disorder. I don't really know what to do anymore and thought maybe someone here can give me advice. I've always been the quiet one as long as I remember. I am always afraid of other people. I am still not sure if I am really afraid of other peoples negative judgement or if it something else and i maybe am just not compatible with people.

I also had manic phases, but even then I was kinda afraid. I was talking very loud and had lost of self-esteem etc, but even then I did not go out, when school was over. This leads me to believe, that my character is just flawed and even if my chronic depression was cured, I would still not be content with myself.

I've tried accepting, that I just can't connect to people, because I don't know what to say and am always kind of inhibited.

I don't know what do anymore. My job is boring, but I don't think I am capable of anything else than I do now (Customer service basically, but without any direct contact to customers). I live for two years in this city where I work and I have literally zero friends here. What I do after work is lay in bed the rest of the day and just watch some youtube. I think I have degenerated mentally over time. I can't really learn anything much nor have any drive to do so.

I've had three long-term talking therapies, tried 15+ different medications and was in a mental hospital three times. Nothing really helped me. I am from Germany. Now my main question besides venting is, is there anything more I can do? I read about ketamine treatment, but I don't know if my psych would prescribe it to me since i've also had psychosis an mania. I've already had CBASP in a hospital, but it didn't do much in the long run. There's ect, it could maybe make the depression better, but there's still the problem with my bad character flaws., which I can't seem to fix nor accept. There's deep-brain implants, but I don't know if I am maybe too young for that, I am around 30. And then there's the easy way out ofc, which I do think about all the time, but I will not do it, though if I am not better in ~ the next ten years I will.

Maybe someone of you has an idea for me.

I think, that a good psychotherapy May be better to adressing the root cause than medication/ect, what do you think?

Other people often say, when they were able to live their lives again form the beginning, they would do things very differently. I've often thought about this and I always get the feeling, that no matter how often I could re-live my life, with this character flaw, that I have, I would always end up in the same hole I am in right now.

thanks"

1449,Out of touch with reality?,"Yesterday I had a really bad migraine, It lasted over 8 hrs. I was vomiting and crying until I couldnt. Around the 6 hr mark my parents drove me to the doctor's and they put me on an IV with some drugs to help. 

Today I woke up feeling lingering effects, but I feel really off. I'm not sure how to word it other than being out of touch with reality. It's a really nice day with perfect weather, normally I would be happy and grateful, but I can't. I reach out hoping to feel the warmth only to feel colder. Everything seems distant, I dont feel like I'm really here. I can see everything, but it is blurry. I can feel everything, but not actually feel it. I touched my bicycle expecting it to feel warm and metallic, but when I touched it I felt nothing. I could tell I was grasping it in my hand, but if I closed my eyes I couldnt tell what it was.

1452,"Sooo, what are we supposed to do besides not dying?","Today my mom asked me why I (26) avoid everyone, why I don't have friends, and if I want to spend the rest of my life alone. I've been honestly just studying for college to make my parents happy while waiting until my time is over. I never even wanted to be born. Certainly not as a degenerate.

1454,Kickstart my life. Need help.,"With the pandemic going on, I feel like my already-low self esteem, loneliness and depression have been hitting an all-time high.  I already know one has to be safe by staying home and taking the necessary precautions to not catch the virus.  I’ve been hitting the brick wall lately by not being able to meet new friends and possibly a life-partner.

I’m a 42 year old male, with a very good job (working from home now), I enjoy playing outdoor sports, card games, love to hike and bike.  I feel like I’ll be a very good addition to a group of new friends.  Unfortunately, I’ve had a troubled past with my past relationship and all the friends that were mutual between us, have chosen to not talk to me.  I have made mistakes in my life.  I’ve succumbed to alcohol, drugs, etc to numb the pain but I really need to, like the title says, KICKSTART my life.  I would love to meet new people, even with the pandemic going on, I’m sure necessary precautions can be made with social distancing.  

I really feel like I am a good person, I really don’t mean any ill will to ANYONE.  I would love to hit the reset button and move on with my life.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts from time to time - this is why I feel its imperative to find new people who can inspire me to be better, just like I could inspire them to feel good that they’ve helped a person like me.  I know a LOT of people are out there, depressed and lonely, with nothing to look forward to.  Would love to hear what you say, even saying “Hello” could mean a lot.

I’m very good with replying back so please reply and let me know that you care.  Would love to hear and hopefully meet some of you one day."
1455,Suicide today,Today is the day my girlfriend plans to kill herself. After asking and asking and her telling me she promises to not do it I am still worried. She seems okay today but this morning she was kind of agitated I texted her dad asking if she was okay. She has had this planned for a long time but I asked her if she was feeling okay today and she said yes. I plan to go visit her this afternoon and bring her dinner. She means literally the world to me and I have expressed this by constantly telling her that and telling her she is beautiful and I love her so much. I have done and things while in this relationship. I have talked to other people online and she already had self esteem issues and that only made it worse I would think. She knows about this and has told me to move on and not talk about it. I have worried about this and hate myself for doing it. I have worried about her for a long time and she has always felt suicidal since middle school and she has been molested multiple times and been made fun of all her life. She has been told she is ugly and fat and she is not. I do not know what to do now I have told both her parents and she is at her dads house due to split custody every week and she would like to be at her moms more I think. I asked her if she is having any bad thoughts today and she said Eh and that scares me. I do not want anything to happen to her. I trust her and she has never given me any reason not to trust her. I feel as if someone is set on killing them selves they would not care to lie to someone due to not having to see how it affects others. I am scared and kind of just empty? I do not know I just am upset. I need help. I know most people will say call police and stuff but law in her situation would just make things worse I feel with the custody thing because her parents hate each other more her dad hates her mom for kicking him out after abusing her. Her being my girlfriends mom.

My senses feel 10x more heightened than everyone else.

Everything makes me angry and uncomfortable, And when I tell my family they un porpoly breath in my face and laugh at me. I cant take it.

I haven’t made any plans yet and I dont think I could do it but that thought gives me some sort of peace in the worst times. I have never talked to anyone about this and I dont know if I could.

1459,Does Life help exist?,"This might be a strange question. 

The only options seem to be a therapist/psychiatrist (which seem to be for mood/emotional/mental health issues), or a Life Coach (which seems more for losing weight or motivational support to achieve specific things in life). But what I'm talking about is someone who will spend a significant amount of time with you for a few weeks, and completely learn your life and circumstances and needs and then be extremely involved in the execution of fixes. 

It appears to me from frequenting this subreddit and many other mental health resources, that some people (me included) are just struggling in ways that a 1 hour a week therapy sessions or a life coach just won't be able to fix. I'm wondering if there's any other options?

I 100% agree that each person has to take responsibility for their own life and be the one doing the fixing, nor do I believe that God or the Flex Tape guy should come solve all your problems while you sit on the couch. But given how complicated modern life can be, and sometimes you end up in a twisted web that just gets worse and worse, that some people simply cannot make it work despite putting in the effort."
1460,What Happened Last Night? // TW: su*c*de,"Disclaimer: please proceed with caution! This topic can be extremely triggering.

Hi everyone, this is my first post. Something traumatic happened last night and I could have taken my life. I’ve actually attempted OD before in 2015, however I don’t remember much.

Last night, I got a sudden rush of sadness in the shower. This is normal for me though, so I didn’t think much of it. I got dressed and I proceeded with my night. An hour later, I began to feel extremely alone, like I truly had no one. I started to cry. And cry more. And then I stared at my wrist for a solid minute. 

*I consider myself pretty emotionally intelligent and ever since my last attempt, I’ve become better with my tendencies. 

I then couldn’t stop picturing a blade to my arms and I knew that I couldn’t do that so I got out my eyeliner and drew lines on my arm just to trick my brain. I felt a little better for the moment, however, I think that just caused an even bigger trigger. I then stared at my backpack which had my pills in it 

*I had to go to the hospital for a heart problem this fall and I still have a full bottle left for pain

Suddenly, I just wanted to hold them in my hands. I didn’t think I was going to do anything. I poured all 100 tablets into my hands and I just stared at them. They were small and white and very pretty to me at the time. I began to cradle them.. I started to cry even harder. I put them so close to my face, it was at this moment that I truly did not know whether I was going to take them or not. I’ve had suicidal tendencies before, but in the back of my head I knew I couldn’t do it again, but this time was different. There was nothing in the back of my head. I haven’t questioned a suicidal ideation the way I did last night since 2015. It’s been five years. 
I blocked out a lot of what happened, but I put the pills away. I then texted my friend because I didn’t know what I was capable of that night anymore but I could barely type. I was crying so hard, my hands were shaking, my body was shaking, everything was horrible. After a few minutes though, I just had to hold them again, so I poured the pills back into my hand and held them and started crying. Nothing was going on in my head. But the words started coming out of my mouth with no thought process.
Crying hysterically, I whispered 
“I’m just going to hold you. I’m just going to hold you. I just want to hold you. I just want to hold you.”  
“You’re so pretty you’re so pretty you are so pretty in my hands” 
“You won’t hurt me right you won’t hurt me you won’t hurt me” 
“I will protect you I will protect you I will hold you until you fall asleep and I won’t let *insert name of friend* hurt you” 

And I repeated all of these again and again. It was at this point my brain just turned off. My body was moving on its own and my brain completely switched. I tried putting the pills back but I couldn’t. I felt so bad for them and I kept them in my hands for longer. 
The only thing that got me to put the pills back was when I heard my parent get up to use the bathroom and I quickly rushed them inside the bottle and I said it’s okay it’s okay I’ll be back. And I closed the lid. I waited for my parent to go back to their room and I am STILL crying and my brain suddenly said they can’t breathe so I grabbed a pair of scissors and I tried jabbing the lid as hard as I can until I got a hole for the pills to breathe. I was about to put them back in my backpack but then I was like no they’ll be miserable in there so I put them on my table. 
Remember, at this point I had no conscious. I stopped crying. I got up and I felt light. I walked to put back my scissors and a sudden thought was like PUT AWAY THE SCISSORS but my brain, now running on its own motor function, didn’t. My hands moved on it’s own and I put the scissors on my chest. I knew I was going to do it though, I just wanted to feel it. I did this a couple of times but I finally put it away. 

I needed to use the bathroom but the entire time I was walking on my tippy toes, almost dancing gracefully to the bathroom. I did this all the way back to my bedroom where I got ready for bed. I climbed into bed and I couldn’t feel 3/4 of my body. My legs were frozen and the only thing I could move was my head and my arms. I then texted my friend I was okay. But I suddenly felt like I wasn’t in my body. Like I was astro projecting. I didn’t feel anything. I couldn’t feel the temperature and all I could do was lie perfectly still and look around my room. Then the walls started closing on me, I could actually SEE the walls coming in. I started panicking and cried again. I felt delusional guys. I was talking to my pills. I was dancing. I saw my room getting smaller.

I told my friend, I think this was my brain’s defense mechanism. I told her I was gonna research it today, but I couldn’t find anything specific to this. Maybe I just suck at finding things.
I feel better now and I feel normal. I don’t remember a lot of last nigh, again defense mechanism I think. However, I’ve never talked to my pills before.. I’ve never tippy toed danced before.. I’ve never seen my walls closing in on me. I truly felt delusional.
Please tell me what happened last night. Are there any articles or research on this? Please let me know guys. Thank you for reading this long essay."

1465,First time post - Struggling to help my wife when she is low. Need help,"Hi Guys, 

first time posting here and not sure how to express myself really but here it goes. 

Since my wife has entered the maternity leave I believe her mental health has gone worst week by week and since we had the baby last year its pretty much a mine filed now and anything can trigger her to lash out and I get sometimes frustrated and literally dont know what to do.  
According to her I am the one that is always making the mistakes and small things become like a big deal now and when i am tell her that this is getting out of hand she threatens to either leave me or it just gets really horrible and she isolates herself away from me and if i come anywhere near her she pretty much freaks out. 

Today for example.   
The day started off well. we had breakfast, fed the little one. And I got ready to work from home. My wife decided to tidy up the flat but and re-organising the flat (bare in mind we live in a tiny flat in london, so it can collate clutter quite easily.) When it came to dusting and moving away some trays which i didnt agree with and i told her to be careful as they are valuable, it literally triggered her and she got so mad that she decided to smoke (which she doesnt do, or hasnt done for years) and continued to threaten why she lives with me and that she should have left ages ago and continued to insult me which made me feel worthless. When i tried to get closer to her, she literally raised her voice by telling me not to come any closer and not to touch her. So i decided to take the little one out of the house for a few hours to calm the situation. When I returned she would still not talk to me. She did apologise (which recently she has done more often when she lashes out) but there is still a very bad tension in the room and she is isolating her self again, by either going to a dark bedroom or watching TV all day. 

When i try to talk to her she either refuses to talk to me or just gives me abrupt and short answers.   
And its very hard for me to stay quite all the time and let be ignored pretty much. 

i am sure this whole corona isolation has added some more stress to it too and being in the same room 24/7 surly doesnt help either. 

So yeah, I could probably continue talking about this for another hour or so. But the bottom line is, I am stuck and I dont know what to do anymore and I am looking for advise.

Thanks"

1470,Helping A Friend With Mental Health,"I have a friend(24), we'll call him Joe, that is struggling with delusions and mental health and I'm trying to figure out the best way to help him. The problems that are at hand currently involve the idea that I, his best friend who has lived with him for nearly half of 15 years of friendship was abusing him throughout the years and causing traumatic damage to his head causing him to forget things that I didn't want him to remember. He believes that if I were in the same room with him that I would attack him. He also thinks that his parents played a role and are hiding things from him and doesn't trust them. Not long ago he has written collegiate papers about how his mother was his biggest role model and about how strong their relationship was and how it motivated him in life. He has always had a strong family support system, myself included, and was never physically or emotionally abused in any of the extensive time i have spent in his home and life. The problem has shown signs for several months but the severity of the situation has just now been brought into the light. Several months ago he seems to have created an idea that he and another close friend of ours, we'll call her Lucy, had potentially hooked up or kissed at a party at which he says I was in attendance. He started asking vague questions about something happening between them that I may have remembered because he couldn't remember the details. These questions didn't seem to unusual as we often spent a lot of nights together drinking in excess and I didn't doubt the idea of something potentially happening between them. The strange thing was that after I told him that I didn't know what he was talking about he began to create the suspicion that I did know something and was withholding information in order to steal Lucy from him. (She has been a long time friend in our group and at points many of our guy friends have had feelings for her) He has sometimes been possessive of her in the past even though she has always viewed him as only a friend and often felt as though he deserved a chance with her because he had been friends with her the longest and was often the reason she was introduced to many of the guys, often times within our friend group, that she would talk to in a more intimate manner. The idea of him having had a drunken moment with her that he forgot and that we were withholding for him seemed strange but we (his friends and family) didn't do very much about it because he would often approach us about it very sparingly and without much detail. However, he did mention earlier in the year that he wanted to try and find help about his thoughts. He was able to get in touch with a doctor but with the quarantine beginning he never got the opportunity to meet with a psychiatrist. Things seemed to be relatively normal between us when we would occasionally meet up but sometimes late at night the questions would return about this situation. About a month ago he finally built up the courage to ask 'Lucy' about the situation and asked if there was any way that she felt the same way about him and why they were not together. She responded by telling him that she always viewed him as strictly a friend and even as a brother. He took this poorly and told her that he felt that their relationship made him feel ""gross and used"" which was saddening because they have been friends for almost 15 years and he has made remarks saying that he threw away 15 years of time. Lucy told other members of our friend group what had happened and it made us realize that he was still chasing the idea of this scenario he created where we somehow interfered with his relationship. This is where things took a serious turn, he then began locking himself in his room and discontinued communication with almost everyone in his life. I figured he was hurt by the rejection of this girl that he had had strong feelings for for a long time so I didn't think it was bad for him to spend some time to recover. I still tried reaching out to him a lot but only via text and we sometimes played some video games but all of a sudden everything ended. After spending many days alone in his room, refusing to even talk to his parents, many of his friends and family became very concerned and tried reaching out to him even more. He seemed to be aggravated by the idea that people were only texting instead of going and visiting him but the limitations of social distancing were preventing any normal hang outs with anyone. Eventually things got so bad that his friend that lives next door was tired of him not answering any texts asking to do anything that he went over and confronted him. After talking for about three hours his neighbor called me on the phone in tears telling me about some delusional things he had heard from 'Joe'. He said that he believed he had been abused over the years by his whole family and by Me throughout our childhood. The claims made against me were very concerning because 'Joe' is my best friend and I actually moved out of my own home to live with him for the majority of high school and some years afterward, and before that i used to spend almost the entire summers of 6-8th grade at his house and go on frequent weekend ski trips on winter weekends. I regard 'Joe' as my brother and his family as a one that I am a part of. This idea that I had caused him trauma in the past made no sense to me so I wanted to seek more information by trying to talk with 'Joe' about how he could make these claims. The shock factor that accompanied this news made me very concerned and I tried to get 'Joe' to meet with me and our friends (the neighbors) but he said that he still needed to ""figure out what had happened and that he would remember more by smoking weed and that it gave him more clarity' he also mentioned that he had stopped taking his adderall, to which he had been prescribed for three years, because he thought that the adderall was being used as a method of deleting his memories in order to keep him from remembering trauma. A group of three of us (myself and the sibling neighbors) went to his house and tried to get him to come out but when he saw me sitting at the bottom of the stairs he ran into his room and locked the door. This brought about a lot of crying for everyone and we became very scared of how things were going to turn out. His parents didn't know the severity of the situation until this point when they found out about the delusions and are trying their best to do whats right for him but i'm concerned by their lack of understanding in mental health issues and their previous claims that he ""needed to snap out of his weird behavior"" and sometimes setting dates as an ultimatum for him to improve his actions. He has an apartment about an hour away from his home and after convincing his parents that he was going there to get a doctors phone number that he had previously gotten in seek of help he left on his own to stay there. He told his parents that one of his roommates was also going to be with him but that turned out to be a lie and I think that spending more time alone and creating more delusions is only going to make things worse. I think that some of this behavior is made worse through his smoking of marijuana that has gotten much more frequent as these behaviors have gotten more intense. They have made an appointment for him to see a psychiatrist tomorrow morning and he says that he will go but i'm concerned about what the next steps should be for him, god forbid he skips the appointment. I've tried to connect as many people as I can to create support for him but it has created more mistrust for me and he has told some people that they should not be trusting me or his parents because we are the problem. I'm having a hard time accepting that maybe i need to step back a little from the situation because he has been my best friend for most of my life and I am so deeply imbedded in his family relations and almost all of our social circles overlap. 

I'm hoping someone can offer some advice as to what I should be doing right now to help and also what to do if he is not being honest in his pursuit of help through psychiatry. I don't want to create more mistrust by being the one who sends others to talk to him but i can't sit idly by and let my best friends mental health deteriorate any further."
1471,I’m so angry because I’m so scared,"I’ve [16M] been really angry for seemingly no reason the past few weeks. The other day I lost my shit at an online friend [15F]  for no reason, and I feel awful for it. I have no idea where that came from, I’m normally a fairly calm and compassionate person and I always try to do what’s right. I apologised to her a bunch of times and she seems to have forgiven me, but I still feel awful. I’ve been trying to help this friend of mine with her mental health for the past few months, but I’ve gone through a lot of trauma in the past as well and it taken its toll on me. I care about her so much and it hurts to see her in pain, especially this time where it was my fault. I promised I’d always be there for her, and I feel like I’ve let her down. 

After some reflection, I think that deep down, I’m just absolutely terrified and have been using anger to hide that. My life hasn’t been great, I’ve gone through a lot of traumatic stuff, but for a while, I was actually happy, and was turning a new leaf. But then, in the last few months I’ve been through hell, time after time, without any time to recover. I recently started cutting again for the first time in years and I had to turn to alcohol to calm myself down when I had a panic attack the other day. The only good thing in my life is my friends. I love them so much and I honestly would’ve killed myself if it wasn’t for them. 

I’ve been so angry lately but I’m scared more than anything. 

I’m scared of losing my friends, they are the only good thing in my life and I couldn’t live without them. I’ve lost friends before and I’ve lost family members, everyone that I’ve ever cared about seems to either die or leave me. But now, I finally feel like I belong somewhere for the first time in my life, and the thought of losing that terrifies me. 

I’m scared of getting sick again and ending up in another coma.

I’m scared that I might never have a girlfriend or boyfriend, and that has made me irrationally mad at people in relationships lately. I just wish that when I woke up in the middle of the night, sad and afraid, like I am while typing this, that I had someone to hold me and tell that everything would be alright. 

Most of all, I’m scared that I’m too broken to keep going anymore. There is nothing in this world more terrifying than having to watch yourself turn into someone you hate. Watching yourself become so twisted by anger, regret and fear that you become a mockery of everything you once stood for. I’ve gone through this once in the past, and I barely managed to pull myself out of it. I was happy for a while, and then my world fell apart again. I can’t go through this again, I’m not sure what to do"
1472,I Feel Like a Ghost,"context: I'm 18 and will enter college in the fall. I'm including this in case you guys can build off of this in some way.

Some days I feel like my skull is full of gas, and not a big lump of gray matter with blood running through it. I pick up a book and it annoys me how only a few words next to each other seem clear while the whole page has a slight blur to it. It annoys me how I can see the scene, feel it, but have that invisible wall between me and it. I don't exactly feel numb, I just feel like a puff of air, a breath. I feel like I'm easy to accept different opinions and that I have no center. Reality seems like a river to me: always flowing, always changing. I can put my hand in it. but the water runs through my fingers. I'm taking a class so I can become a CNA. I can see it being my career, but I'm only content with it. I don't feel like I have veins connecting me to this world, I feel like a cloud moving close to the ground. The days seem less like days, but a haze of day bleeding into night bleeding into day with faint borders defining what  my day should center around. I feel like I don't care about much. But, why do I feel like this? Nothing happened to me that I'm trying to repress. I've never been abused, never seen the kind of evil that soldiers in war see. I'm just this way for a reason I can't pin point.I feel some connection writing this, but it's a few feet beside me.

I realize that you may not understand what I'm saying, but I feel that talking in similes and metaphors helps me to get my emotions across."

1475,.,"Hello reddit ! This is my first post here. 
So...
Today , my private math teacher called my dad because i copied on one of my tests. I got really really scared because I thought my dad would yell at me. (My parents are divorced, and this week I am staying at my dad's place). Now don't get me wrong, He is a caring and womderfull dad. A couple months ago he bought and asambled for me a very expensive pc, and bought a complete setup for me.He only gets mad when I do things like this in school or on my online private class. So, back to the story. I got really really scared when he talked with my teacher. I got so scared, I started staring at the furniture in our kitchen. I've been staring at it for so long, not moving my eyes, that I started seeing things like there was a fog. I had been staring for 32 minutes, while he was talking to my teacher. After 32 minutes, he hung up. I got so scared I started praying that he wouldn't ground or yell at me. After the call, he called one of his friends. After the second call, he wasn't mad at all. He talked kindly to me and everything was ok. I think I might have depersonalization disorder or something because I do this preety often. I would be happy if someone would tell me if there is something wrong with me or not 😅"
1476,My mental health has finally caught up with me... Feel a bit broken,"I was doing so well before the virus, I began Therapy and dealing with issues that had plagued me for as long as I can remember. I've struggled for years holding down a job while going through lows and scraping by.

A week or so ago I reached probably the lowest I've been in a long time, and had no one to reach out to... So reached out to anyone who would listen.

Now I'm in trouble at work for saying things I shouldn't and feel utterly disheartened for what I do. No one seems to get that I've been dealing with this way before I joined the company and only a few months into professional help... To them surely none of this is causal.

Yet my work is impeccable and I'm told so, just my personal interactions are not. I don't want to be this person but I sometimes don't have control... People's comments tear through me and send me into a spiral."
1477,"Hello, I need help. What is happening?","Hello people! I am here today, because of a constant thing happening to me.

My family has told me that throughout arguments (i guess) I space out in the middle, mostly when I am crying, and stare into space. I then proceed to snap back, but they see that I am confused. I don’t ever remember any argument beforehand. I always ask them what we were talking about, but they usually never tell me and get angry with me more. They say that when I start crying again, I space out again and snap back in again. I still don’t remember the conversation.

I notice that there are around 3–4 voices in my head, but I assume they are just different emotions trying to help me cope. Even now I am struggling to type this down. I keep wanting to delete it and not post.

For a little background of my life (maybe this will help), I grew up in a very broken home. My mom and dad would always fight in front of me. I would always try to protect my siblings from being in the middle of arguments. Those arguments my mom and dad had, are one of the only things I remember from my childhood. My mom and dad split when I was around 8 and I have been living with my mom and siblings for 10 years now without a dad. My dad visited around 4–5 years ago and we went to the cemetery to say hello to a deceased family member. I don’t have good memories of my dad, so I hardly speak to him. While we were in the cemetery, he told me about things we would do when I was little, like visit cows and horses on the farm he worked at, but I don’t remember that. I keep telling him I didn’t remember and he was probably lying. He yelled at me and my mom saw and yelled back at him. I ran to the car and sat by the tire. I feel like many of the problems that happened were because of me.

I don’t know if a backstory would be helpful, but I put one just in case.

Thank you and sorry for the long post. I hope someone will help me. I don’t want to make things worse with my mom and siblings because of my forgetfulness keeps us from coming to a conclusion. I don’t know of much arguments, but they always tell me when I try to talk to them after an argument."
1478,Hire the unhireable!!!,"I need help surveying a bunch of different ""labeled"" individuals with disorders, disabilities, was a former inmate, homeless and addicts to help with my non profit work. I am creating a non profit. I am purposely building it to create a self run and worked business with only using the ""unhireable"" or however you want to call this huge society of ""Labeled"" individuals.. these people shouldnt have to struggle even more. And why do we sculpt the job for a human instead of allowing the human To sculpt themselves and allow the employer to evaluate all the skills they hold rather than only the ones they want with the other half they have to teach..? This is insane. And time/talent wasting. More people can make more money on the individual talents and inavasions one can bring than hiring roles to be filled. Why is there a negative perspective with the word ""disabled"" the definition is stupid as well.. if you dont have one of your senses for example, wouldnt that make someone have 4 super senses? I hear autistic individuals speak about not being listened to or the other side of the spectrum and being not accepted. Our whole society is based on others perspectives what is good or bad, what others believe what is right or wrong... I believe depression and suicide has a lot to do with unaccepting people and disconnection with society.  I believe we all play a part in subconsciously accepting these behaviors and not realizing what we are actually influencing in others lives. Why do the patients feel limited as well as the employers feel u are limited when learning of a diagnosis? Why are all diagnoses bad? Why is it that these labels have to be someone's identity? Why do we stereotype these and judge? I am trying to make sure my business can handle much of these issues along with tweaking as I franchise out to other states to create this business for others around the world to balance whatever they need in each of their communities. If anyone can share their struggles,  in particular to your situation specifically and share your struggles in the work force, I would be greatly appreciative. Thanks to all for any help!!"
1479,Looking for suggestions,"So my partner suffers from mental health issues that can leave her extremely stressed and agitated at times. Sometimes me trying to talk to her and cheer her up ends up making things worst.

We're trying to work out a system where she can signal to me what mood she is in without having to actually tell me as she finds this hard sometimes.

We were hoping there would be some sort of app to help where she could press a button on her phone and I'd get a notification on mine telling me what mood she was in. Ideally we wanted a traffic light sort of system where green means she is okay, orange means she is stressed or upset but I can try and cheer her up while red means I should leave her alone and give her some time to herself. Unfortunately we couldn't find any app similar to this.

I was hoping you fine reddit users could suggest any sort of similar system that could help us out.

Sorry for the rambling post and thanks for reading and any advice you can give."

I've pretty much always been an introvert, and have had mental health issues the last few years. So am used to bad days

Since maybe Sunday though, I've had this huge dark cloud loom over me. I just feel completely lost, lonely,  exhausted and fed up with life. I don't know where I'm even going with this, but I needed to say it somewhere I guess.

1485,My mental health fucked me over,"I'm in dental school and was really hoping to get a partial HPSP Scholarship which would cover 2 years of dental school+ living expenses+ stipend. My grades are great, I have a great DAT score (equivalent of MCAT) and thought I was a competitive applicant.

Well, back in Sept I finally decided to see a counselor provided by the school bc mental health stigma and all that shit, but he left before I could make an appt and was scheduled with a psychotherapist instead. He diagnosed me with disthymic disorder and I've been on buproprion ever since. Well, come today I'm in the process of submitting documents for the Air force HPSP and fill out the medical form, I'd figure I'd be honest about my mental health and my improvements on it.

Well it completely fucked me in the ass bc I get an email from the guy and he has I need to be 3 years out from medication and diagnosis from any form of disthymic disorder. In other words I can't get the fucking scholarship. So now I get to graduate with a fuckton of debt all because of this gay ass ""stop the stigma"" bullshit. If I had just kept my head down and not focused on it, I probably would've gotten the scholarship. What a crock of fucking shit.

Tl;dr can't get scholarship bc of mental health and now I get a lot of debt"

1489,I think I'm close to breaking and I'm struggling to get help,"Title really says it, but I'm freaking out... again.

Lockdown has had me feeling quite good, if I'm honest. It's a lot of time to be creative without the stress of exams of school. So I had a meeting with CAHMS to... I don't know, assess my mental health in general? But seeing as school exasperated my problems, the meeting was just me trying to remember how I feel when I feel bad (considering I struggle remembering anything that isn't happening... now); and appearing happy.

And I found out that I've been turned away from any further CAHMS treatment. I felt fine with this, but in the past three days, my mental health has quickly plummeted to the worst it's ever been.

I can't sleep; I can't remember what it feels like to not see yourself as an outsider; I can't remember *anything*; I don't feel inspired and I have art block/writer's block; and for a few minutes two days ago I lost it.

I was feeling awful already and then I just lost it. The gender dysphoria and feelings just got too much. I, thankfully alone, started flapping my hands until they hurt, hitting and biting myself, screaming without any noise, just grinning. I kept having horrible thoughts of pulling my eyes out and headbutting the mirror, and my mind was unhinged. I couldn't think straight at all. I can't explain it, but I just feel like I went insane for half an hour. Like really, truly, I wasn't coherent in any way, and words can't explain how bad it was.

And then I just stopped. I just made myself stop feeling like that. I don't know whether I'm pretending, or what, but I just decided not to feel and pushed the feelings away.

I vent to my friends, but I feel like I'm a burden. None of them know what to say to me, and as much as I love wholesome memes, they don't help. I'm scared to talk to my parents because whenever I do, it's 'come out of nowhere' and I can't explain to them how ill I feel. I'm too nervous to contact online services, and everything seems to lead back to nothing.

I'm at that point where I need someone to intervene, but no one will. I've never learnt how to cope with my feelings and I think 5 years of declining mental health is starting to come out all at once. I'm too scared to do anything, and it's just getting worse by the day"

I also cannot spend the night, because I will constantly worry about her coming into contact with things before she has washed up (Especially her hair, since women cant wash that as frequently). How do you guys deal with slight bodily fluids on the sheets and it spreading everywhere after you have slept in it?

1497,"(Long post) Sudden hallucinations/paranoia, seeking opinions","Hi, I am brand new to Reddit, so I'm sorry if the formatting is strange (I don't know how flairs work, etc). But I thought I'd share some recent experiences. Apologies in advance for the obnoxious length.

**Some relevant background information:** 

* Late twenties, female. 
* Spent the last several years living a relatively sedentary lifestyle due to university, only the usual things like walking my dog and the occasional inspired jog or rushing across campus, etc. 
* Countless all-nighters (at least once a week), highly irregular sleeping schedules, and many skipped meals and random snacks during this period. 
* Had depression and felt suicidal two years ago, but haven't seen anyone about it. Just kept a journal to track my thoughts and tried to keep positive and busy. 
* I have been feeling a bit better in the years since then, but I'm aware that my mental and physical health has taken quite a bad hit. 

Four nights ago, I kept waking in the middle of the night. This in itself isn't all that unusual, but around 4am, I woke up feeling *extremely* *paranoid* of objects in my room: My partly opened door, my closet, the head of my bed, my bulletin board -- I was convinced that all of these things were silently threatening me and watching me with a focused intent to harm. I didn't feel sleepy, I felt very sharply aware and I was very frightened.

I turned on my phone thinking the light would be comforting; the original plan was to shine it on the door to make the door fuck off (I know it makes no sense, but this was my thought process at the time); but just as soon as my screen unlocked and the light came on, I became extremely scared that the light itself was trying to harm me and was somehow watching me very intently. 

Of course, in hindsight I know these things are unreasonable; but that was not something that crossed my mind at the time. I was very ""animal-scared,"" and very much 100% convinced I was in danger, with no better way to describe it. 

Most notably, I glanced at my bookshelf and noticed that all of the titles on the spines were very curly, and this was extremely terrifying and grotesque to me. To clarify, the titles on my books didn't become curly as I looked at them, they were already curly-looking when I glanced there. And it wasn't them looking different (they're not curly in reality) that scared me, it was just their actual *shape*. The shape of curliness seemed to seethe with malevolence. Kind of like looking at a wall covered in shivering hornets that share a hateful hive-mind.

I was convinced all of these things had a silent intent to hurt me, despite not moving.

**Some things to note:** 

* Like a lot of people, I frequently and vividly hallucinate spiders when I am exhausted. However, these hallucinations don't frighten me. This recent experience had me extremely scared. I was absolutely convinced that I was in peril.
* On extremely rare occasions I think I hear voices when I'm alone, but I'm 99% sure this is just in my imagination and it's just random thoughts conversing or something of that sort. However there is a difference between these voices and the voices you hear when you're reading a book, for example, or recalling a memory. It feels physically closer to my ear (possibly inside). 
* Also like a lot of people, I sometimes catch glimpses of things that turn out to be not there, such as a person standing in the corner of the room, or a face peering through a partially opened door (usually very near the ceiling or very low near the floor). Again, much like the voices, I think this is more attributed to me feeling paranoid for no reason, or due to an overly active imagination (it's been like this since I was a small child).
* Very vivid dreams throughout life. Color, music, emotional, movie-like, complex. Can return to an old dream and pick up where left off, etc. Figures in dreams recall our past interactions and make references to other dreams, which I guess makes sense because they're all figments of our brains.
* This is my first time experiencing this kind of unreasonable paranoia. It seemingly had no build-up or signs. I'd chuckle it off, but it was really scary. 
* I doubt it's relevant, but I have no issues socializing and I'm not even a quiet person. Just an energetic introvert like many.
* I could breathe during this incident.
* I could move during this incident.

For the next couple of days I resolved to get at least eight hours of sleep. No further paranoid incidents.

But just last night, I hallucinated a polo shirt on my ceiling. I wasn't scared this time, but it's still got me worried. The edges were ripply, and I couldn't decide of the shirt was melting or not, but I was wholly preoccupied and even frustrated with trying to reach a decision on the matter. For some reason that question was very important to me, as stupid as that sounds. 

Partway through I realized something was weird and I tore my eyes off of the shirt to send a text to my friend, which currently reads like this:

&gt;*Help I'm halluimayijg again*  
*I dunno what it is but I'm lying here in the dark a nd see a floating white shirt in my ceiling*  
*Just a shirt*  
*I stated supeihard for sometimes your brwi tracks you*  
*But no critter evolution entail lemole*  
*Left in the to his own drbices*

The reason I bother to include this in my post is because I only remember sending the very first line (the ""*Help I'm hallucinating*"" bit). The rest I have no recollection of sending at all. 

My friend suggested that I possibly blacked out, but I distinctly recall feeling extremely stressed after sending ""Help I'm halluimayijg again;"" I couldn't decide if I wanted to text any further explanations or not, and felt very torn. And that's when I gave up and just continued staring at the floating shirt. 

Well, apparently I *did* text further explanations, because the rest reads like I was trying to say ""I stared super hard because sometimes your brain tricks you."" I just don't remember sending it. And the rest of the messages are complete nonsense and I have no clue where they came from. 

===============

I asked my mother if we have any history in the family of this kind of occurrence. She told me she's hallucinated before, but it was only a side-effect of her chemotherapy medications, and she's never felt the scary paranoia that I described.

I'm not entirely sure who I'm supposed to talk to for this kind of thing, and I am very concerned. But I also think it might just be a one-off deal. If it sounds like I'm making mountains out of molehills, I'd like to know.

I just thought I'd post this here in case anyone had any similar experiences or advice. Who to call, who to see, etc. If there's no reason to be concerned.

Cheers and hope you're all keeping well and safe in these times!"
1498,I've lost the ability to function in in Society.,"I just got back from failing to start a job for the second time in a row because of something resembling a panic attack. I start borderline hyperventilating and it seems like every neuron in my lizard brain is urging me to to get the fuck outta there before something happens. I don't know what this something is. Logically, I know it is nothing. The logical side of my brain feels like whatever the fuck is going on with me is turning me into a whiny drama queen that just doesn't want to work. But the panic feels so real in the moment. 

I've always felt there were two ""voices"" in my head. One Logical and one Reactionary. I compare it most readily to the scene in *The Two Towers* where Gollum is talking to his other personality, so I'll be referring to these voices like they are people from now on, because that is actually how it feels. Reactionary voice panics over something, logical voice says that is silly. A back and forth goes on. Up till two months ago, it's only ever really affected my ability to socialize. As Reactionary like to tell me I'm not worthy of friendship and Logical could never quite convince me he was wrong. 

Before the pandemic, I was getting ready to make a trip to Europe to try and get a certification to teach English overseas. I put in notice to my work, I saved money, I booked my flight, I got out of my lease (by the book, no one was screwed over) and as consequence of that I soured my last friendship I am pretty sure was toxic anyway. I decided on this course precisely because I have nothing tying me here but my family. I've got no friends. I've never had a relationship. Probably in part because of Reactionary. In fact, I had recently got rejected by a friend who zigzagged on getting into a relationship with me (first said she would like that before doing a 180). I felt like I was making no progress in my life, I was working a job that was spiritually draining. So yeah. Seemed like a good idea. Then the country I was going to go to closed its borders. 

Now I'm living with my parents at 31 and my old job won't hire me back. I've applied to several places, and gotten called back my a few. I've honestly tried to go to these jobs but my brain starts screaming in fear at the slightest provocation and I can't hack it. Even just going out to get supplies is more stressful than getting chased by a bear for me.  At least I would know what a bear will do once it get me. Reactionary is worse than ever before and Logical is not doing shit for me anymore. 

Everyone else seems to have such an easy time functioning in society and it is just getting more impossible for me the older I get. I don't see a happy or uplifting ending to this story. I'm pretty sure my own family things I am a hopeless, lazy mess that just doesn't want to work. Even I think maybe I just being a whiny bitch. My life hasn't even been traumatic enough to warrant a fear of bees, yet I can't go to the fucking store without panicking about an eventuality I can't even put a name or face to. 

I want to be normal. I just want a normal life. How the fuck can I do that? 

Sorry for ranting. Thanks to all that bothered to read this far. I don't even know what I wrote all this for..."
1499,"I'm giving it a shot, hope it works out","I signed up for a month of BetterHelp. It's still kind of expensive even for being the cheaper option, so I really hope I don't hate it. Does anyone have any experience with it they'd like to share?"
1500,Does it ever stop..,"I don't even know why I'm writing this here.
I guess its a sad cry for help on a site I know no one who knows me follows me on I guess..

I work monday - friday , i come home, I lock myself away in my room and turn on the xbox, if I'm lucky the person I want to talk to is online , although these days I have to go through someone else to speak to him.. He doesn't interact with me much anymore.. There use to be a time when he was excited to come home and talk to me.. Now I'm lucky if I get a hello when I join an xbox party..
If he's not online, and one of a very small handful of the guys I play with isn't on I just stare at my xbox home screen and cry.. For hours.
It never stops. That is my entire life at the moment. 

I'm constantly upset and hurt and my brain never shuts off. I over think everything , sometimes its even hard to tell when its just me making up scenrios in my head or if someone else actually feels how I think they do.

I've had friends in the past, but these days I don't feel like I have anyone.. I'm so god damn lonely its painful.
Ever see those memes when people feel like the background friend and even though there's people there you doubt they ever think about you when you are not there.
That's me, all the time.

I have been like this for as long as I can remember, I've already got two failed attempts from my teens under my belt, but I guess I wasn't really trying to die then.. Again, more sad cries for help maybe.. I don't understand it myself.

I'm almost 28 now..
It doesn't feel like things will ever get better.
I'm so over it
I want it all to end.

And the only reason I'm even still here is my mother.
She is legit the only person I feel would be affected if I was gone and that's What's keeping me here.


When does this shit stop, does it ever stop.

I want some badly to tell someone I know how I feel, but how can you even approach that subject.

I've tried with a few people in the past telling them I was depressed but they brushed it off, you know the typical ""ah you'll be ok"" kinda thing.. 

I keep thinking maybe if I just run away things will change, new country, new people , new life
But I work for barely above minimum wage , I'm broke as fuck and I wouldn't even know where to go..

I'm just rambling at this stage , I can't even express myself properly to a blank text page..

Fuck."
1501,One foot out and one foot in: the part that wants recovery versus the one that craves chaos,"I’ve been harm free for five years. I’ve had extensive therapy to get to this point. I’ve learned how to express the bare bones of what I’m feeling, how to keep my shit together without harming, taken away some of my triggers, and learned that I am not “less than” because of a medical issue. I’ve also learned I’m never alone, there are different parts of my identity that each deserve a place, and how people in the US/most Western cultures want things to work. I have an understanding of how both my immediate and extended family impacted me.  I know who I’m mad at and who I used to be mad at but am not anymore. 

What I haven’t figured out is how to move past that one incident I haven’t talked about or that has been badly dealt with when I HAVE talked about it, and why there is still a side of me that craves the thrill of knowing I am hurting myself and nobody else knows. I mean, I’ve put all this hard work into staying harm free. I know the benefits that incurs. Why does creating chaos look so appealing years after I stopped?"
1502,need to say whats on my mind.,"well, i got something called Asperger (idk how much its important to mention) . And the last many years i have felt empty, like emotionless, i haven't felt happy in a really long time, and tbh, i kinda forgot how it fells like to be happy, sounds weird, i know. but i still can get this annoyed feeling,  like some kinda   deep anger i got. i dont show it to people, so i keep it to myself,  and its kinda feel heavy on my shoulders, if u know what i mean. i had this like for 7 years. i tried to forgot all about many times, like try some nwe hobbies, and im tried to paint my feelings, so see if it will work.      

i tried my best to be social, but all the things that happen lately, it has been really hard to talk with someone. and i know it was before all the things that happen, but i haven't talk to anyone for around 7 months now. i know it kinda sounds not that smart idea, to be alone for 7 months.

But i think all the things i have been building up has done something with my learning Progress, like, its hard for me to remember things, and to focus on the things, and to do the things, if i like trying to do something, i feel like im gonna exploade, like i need to let out of something, and atm, i really feel like i can't get anything in my head. its feels like its kinda closed. like nothing will get in. 

and right now, when i makes this message i feel it. like, i dont want to do it, and i want to be done with everything, just want to be left alone, and just sit and wait to things slowly going away.

sorry for the jumping around in the text. i just write what's my mind is telling me to write, and what i hope that can help me to get away from this pressure feeling.  

idk what to do, i kinda feel like giving up on everything."
1503,I want to use my lived experience of mental health problems to help others,"Hey, I feel drawn to helping others with mental health problems. I feel like it’s my passion in life. Has anyone entered the mental health field to work after experiencing mental health problems? If so what role did you go into and what was your experience?"
1504,A male mental health support group,"We are a Men's Mental Health group started in South Wales [/672402636428865/) by two guys who have had their own dealings and aim to tackle the stigma attached to Men's Mental Health.

1505,Advice stopping forceful thoughts?,"So I've had these thoughts for a long time now where I feel like I need to do something. For example as I am writing this I am constantly rewriting so for example if I write a 3 letter word, I'll have to rewrite one or two of them since 3 is considered a ""bad number"".

I've got loads more than just that. Could rant for a while about it if anyones interested. Anyways, does anyone have any advice for stopping these thoughts?"
1506,Seeking advice for self hatred and social anxiety. I don't know if this is the right place to put it. I apologise.,"I'm tired of always being so unmotivated and sad. I don't want to rely on others for my happiness anymore. I don't want to be a burden to them and I don't want to keep doing this to myself. It seems like everytime I've almost got myself back something pushes me down and makes me think things that I know aren't necessarily true. I can't help think these things and I've tried everything in the book to make me happy. (Writing, journaling, picking up hobbies, exercising, donating, etc.) I just don't know if I'm doing it right. Talking to people has always been hard. I don't have any friends. I've pushed everyone away that isn't my family and I hate it. I loved having friends. I loved them but I can't really express myself right. Even over the internet it seems a little hard. It always seemed to me like I was annoying to them or that they deep down hated me. I can't help but take everything negatively. I get really nervous just being by myself in public. When I have a family member with me it seems a little easier. But I'm tired of not being able to do anything by myself. I just want to feel the happiness I felt when I was really little. Be that outgoing smalls. I want my hobbies back. I want my friends back. I really don't want to spend my days like this. I want help but I'm afraid. Anyone who's had similar feeling, how did you get over this? I'm sorry if this is messy and long. There's a lot of feeling inside me that I can't express. I just want it to stop."
1507,Help for a freind,"Hello I am new here, I just wanted a professional help from someone here in reddit
I have a friend (17F) that suffer from domestic abuse and she has a very unstable mental state, I am not a professional but I told her that she must contact local authorities and/or go see a doctor, and she apparently afraid of that since she is blaming herself for issues in her family and she is afraid that everything will get worse if she did.
I am no professional idk what I should do, idk how I must help so please can you give me some advice, anything would be helpful.

I apologize if I did a mistake am not native English speaker."
1508,My life is a pointless prison.,"Sorry beforehand if this isn’t allowed but I need to vent to the only people that can somewhat grasp this. 

Most of everything can be considered a prison. The universe, this world, life itself, your mind, body, emotions, pain, etc. Hell even death since when you’re dead it’s not like you have any options to get out of being dead forever. And the thing about death is even when you want nothing more than to die and think it’s the closest thing to actual freedom you’ll still be trapped. Trapped forever in nothingness. Absolutely everything is out of our control and those who say we atleast have the ability to react to what we experience don’t know how mental illness effects those reactions."
1509,Why do I form emotional bonds with inanimate objects?,"My dad broke my headphones today and it felt like loosing a loved one. Is this another mental health problem? I already have ocd and social anxiety, could this be a symptom of one of them? Can someone point me in the right direction?"
1510,How to help depressed people on reddit?,"I always try to say good things, offer help and support. But I always end up saying something awkward and generic. I know there are so many fake depressed people on reddit, but you never know."
1511,.25 mg Xanax ?,"I’ve never taken meds or anything but I def have been diagnosed w panic disorder , OCD and GAD . I always tell the doctors I don’t want anything but my friend gave me a .25 Xanax . I drink a lot to help not feel - if I take this when I’m sober will it help ? I’m weird about taking pills lol"
1512,How do I stop CONSTANTLY comparing myself to other women?,"So I sometimes think I’m ok looking - I’d say I’m a 6/10 and I know that the attention I get from men is only because I have a nice body. My face isn’t so nice, I have bad skin, not so feminine features, I have a long face and it’s very asymmetrical with a big forehead. I would absolutely kill to have a nice pretty feminine face, the kind of face all my friends and family seem to have. 

My sister who is close in age is absolutely stunning, she gets attention constantly from everyone and everyone I meet always tells me how gorgeous she is and how we look *nothing* alike. My mother used to tell her she should become a model someday, and would compare her to Beyoncé etc etc. She told me that the only profession she could see me in was an office clerk. I once found out my sisters boyfriend was commenting on how ‘ugly’ I am with all of his friends, to which they all agreed. So you get the idea, I’ve constantly competed myself to her growing up. 

Now I do this with everyone I know. Everyone I know is so much better looking than me in my eyes, I have no confidence as a result of this and it makes me even uglier. I can’t seem to enjoy anything if I don’t look good enough. It’s consuming my whole personality, I don’t know what to do."
1513,I need help but if I post my situation it won’t be anonymous.,I’ve been struggling atm with things in my life and the only person I trusted has broke me down and i dont know what to do. I can’t live like this anymore
1514,Do I have some kind of complex or mental illness?,"I can't relax, at all, in the slightest or in any way sometimes. If I misinterpret a joke I get stressed out and get insecure about reading the joke wrong and make a fool out of myself, my boyfriend said he wanted to take a nap instead of talk to me and I read that as him not liking me that day and I think I made a fool out of myself for being too paranoid, any fucking time I take anything out of proportion I think that I just made myself look like an idiot and wonder ""look at how high strung and unrelaxed I am, I can't believe anyone likes me"" or something similar, even when I do calm down I go to my past texts I just read on how stupidly overreactive I was and think ""Jesus, I acted that way? I'm fucking worthless"" and to back to the same exact state I was prior, thinking the exact same things and feeling the same exact way, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I literally unable to relax in any fucking form whatsoever? Why am I such an embarrassment to everybody around me?

I'd talk about it to my psychiatrist but the virus is making that difficult, and he's been highly unresponsive, and I'm 17, and PLEASE don't say ""well you're a kid"", no kid should be this much of a stressball, this is fucking ridiculous, I have no reason idea what is so wrong with me and I despise myself for it"
1515,This might be it boys,"So I’m definitely manic right now. A friend and I made a dumb ass mistake and are now facing two felony charges. I’ve decided that if we get the full sentencing, which I’m guessing would be over twenty years, I’m just going to kill myself. My gf doesn’t deserve to be with someone as shitty as me. My mom doesn’t deserve this kind of burden. It just makes sense now. If it goes the worst way I will end my life, end of story"
1516,I think about killing myself often because I'm worthless,"I have no friends or anything, so I think it would be better if I died but I'm too much of a coward to kill myself so I just exist. I wish I could just leave this world but I'm too scared to. I hate myself. I hate living but I'm scared of dying"
1517,Sudden annoying thoughts and paranoia wont let fall asleep,"17m, suffering from ASD and anxiety (diagnosed by psychiatrist).
Sometimes when i try to sleep and relax my body i start thinking about semi-realistic things that annoy me out of the sudden and so cant fall asleep for several hours. Sometimes its a past argument and sometimes its an imaginary problem. I cant distract myself from them and sometimes even have small rages or even panic attacks because of them. Im taking risperidone 2mg for more than 5 years and it seems to affect me lesser and lesser with the years. Are there any solution or tips for this kind of a situation?"
1518,How’s everyone’s quarantine going?,I want to know how your quarantine is going we can talk!
1519,I got a letter from my doctor saying the results of my blood test are abnormal and I needed to speak with them urgently,"If it’s something serious I honestly won’t have the ability to care about it or treat it. If the world wants to fuck me over that badly, then fuck it. Let it take me. But I don’t know what I’d do about my friends and family.

I know it wouldn’t be that serious but in the situation it is then idk"
1520,Suicidal thoughts,"I think of nothing but suicide from weeks and idk what to do, a part of me wants to do it but I feel bad for my loved ones"
1521,Looking for insights,"Hi everyone. I'm getting ready for a new job hopefully soon and considreing paying for a psychologits. Over the years I feel that my insecurities, sensitivites, and overall grumpiness have been getting worse and worse. I've lost friend and broken away from other relationships that I felt just weren't my time even though I knew the other side had some truth to it.  


I want to work on this but I don't know how long it will take and I wanted to ask if someone here had insights into how long it took them to resolve issues relating to insecurities in life."
1522,Looking for help,"I cant ignore this feeling anymore that something is seriously wrong with me. I've struggled with OCD and anxiety for years, but ever since recent events, I have become noticeably worse. Everyone says stay strong, find the bright side. I can't see a bright side anymore, I cannot find joy and happiness. I would accept therapy, but I find myself being too afraid to reach out. If anyone is willing to talk to me, I would greatly appreciate it. I am not expecting any miracles to happen, but some advice from someone who understands and cares would be incredible. Thank you."
1523,My friend died,"My friend ended up jumping off a bridge after doing acid, this was 7 months ago now. He didnt die straight away and instead i was talking ti my friends about i the next day while smoking worried if he was going to be able to go to a festival the next month. About 2 days afterthat i was at a party and my friend came up to me and said the brother of my friend was on the phone and saying he was going to die. Couple hours later he did poof like he never existed. I had to go on holiday being a kid and i missed his funeral, i never got to say goodbye. Month later at the festival whilst we were smoking  i called his twin brother the name of my dead friend and i felt like such a dumb cunt but he didnt even mind and he said im glad me being here make you think of my brother or something like that. New term starts at school and it seems like a competition had formed around who was his best friend and who knew him the best. This made me angry because he was close with everyone, he made everyone laugh and im not saying that because im exaggerating he really did brighten the room.

For the last few years ive been clinically depressed i realise that this is extremely common but i stopped taking my stuff because i felt like i had lost a part of me. I think although sadness is a negative emotion it is a necessary one it grounds us and gives us new appreciation for what we have. My friend was depressed same as me but i didn’t talk to hime about it we were spending more and more time together but we had only been friends for the past 6-8 months and i could have helped him i think part of his death is on me i knew how he was feeling him jumping on that trip could have been him wanting to do that or the acid making it seem as if it was a good idea. I just miss him so much and since i stopped taking my shit it hurts more and more that he’s gone thats it i could of helped but i didnt and now as a result i drink everday just to feel something to placate the void inside me. He made me feel better but him being gone made me realise that once you make that choice your gone you impact the people you didnt realise you would and thats it life is precious and his death made me realise that"
1524,The bizarre behavior of joking about death confuses me,"People will joke about dying, “haha I have an exam soon, I want to die”. Everyone starts laughing and “relating”. However if that same person said “I’ve been experiencing genuine suicidal ideation and am close to ending it” then it’s not funny anymore, there’s something fucked up in their head. Society in the USA (basing it off my country) has this terrible behavior of finding actual suicide and death not funny but the thought of it to be hilarious. This kind of thought process doesn’t apply to other types of serious issues like rape. Majority of people wouldn’t find jokes about rape that are either fictional or real to be funny. I don’t find death to be a laughing joke. However It makes more sense logically to me that everyone should either find all death funny or no death funny. Instead of this “it’s funny when it’s not genuine mentality”. It prevents people from expressing their ideation because it’s either considered a joke or others find it unacceptable."
1525,What is wrong with me?,"I don’t expect to use your guys responses as true medical advice, but maybe somebody has gone through the same thing as me and has found answers. Whenever I go through something tough in life, I change my whole personality and style. I won’t be the same person I was 6 months ago. For example about 2 years ago I went through a breakup and afterwards I was obsessed with Kylie Jenner. I bought almost ALL of her makeup, I would buy dupe outfits, I even bought some prosthetic boobs and hips to look like her. Looking back it just sounds insane. Another example would be recently. I left an incredibly verbal and emotional abusive relationship, and I am obsessed with Harley Quinn. I do my makeup like hers, I dyed my hair pink and blue, have been watching birds of prey/ suicide squad more than normal, and only listen to playlists on Spotify that are “ Harley Quinn vibes “ or something to that affect. I’m getting a big Harley Quinn tattoo on the 29th. I’ve had so many other phases with different things. I don’t know if there’s some sort of pattern or hidden message within them. But they’re typical small things within my personality that get bigger and bigger until it’s an obsession. I’ve been to therapy during my kylie jenner phase, but I don’t think I had gotten much answers, I don’t think that therapist was for me, but due to a series of unfortunate events I no longer can afford therapy. So has anybody else dealt with this? From an outsider perspective it doesn’t seem anybody I know deals with anything similar, and whenever I bring it up people don’t get it."
1526,I can’t tell what’s my mental health issues and what’s my personality,"I don’t like myself. I overthink, I’m highly strung, and dwell hugely on the past. I’m irritable, and when I feel defensive I go on the offensive. Anger and shame stemming from my past that I carry almost feels tangible. 

I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety throughout my adolescence (now 21). I know the origin of my poor responses to stress as it pertains to my environment. I remind myself a lot of my mother sometimes, who also had severe depression while I was growing up and still now to a lesser degree. I didn’t start seeking long-term treatment until last year. I thought I was getting better until recent. I felt happier, more confident, more hopeful and more normal. 

But especially in lockdown right now I‘ve had a lot of time to reflect on my behaviours, emotional baggage and insecurities. I can’t tell whether they more reflect that I still have a long way to go in getting better, or whether it’s just who I am. I feel like such a bad person. Does anyone go through this?"
1527,I'm not doing well,"I failed at work. I have as good of excuses as you can get but I still failed. I keep replaying it in my head and I still have to go in and show up and continue to look bad. 

I'm trying to keep my head up, but I haven't felt the horrible in years."
1528,"Aside from exercise, are there any other methods to release pent up anger and frustration?","

I’ve been having some anger, frustration and sadness issues recently and would be grateful for any help.

Thanks"
1529,Why do i like burning myself??,"Sometimes i take a match and grab the flame or burn myself with the hot match after i blow it out , or i put my hands through a lighter and go through slower and slower until it hurts, i dont know why i do it though"
1530,Hello everyone idk what this title should be (vent?),"This is a throwaway you probably understand 

WARNING  : this post includes self harm and suicide PLEASE don't read further if you are uncomfortable with these things 

So i never actually talk about anything like this in real life since i have trust issues from when i was younger due to personal things I'm not gonna get into here but i can't trust anyone with almost anything especially when it is about my mental health or how i feel or if i was in trouble, i just know that i can't trust them because i know most likely how they will react.

Also on Mobile so sorry for formatting and stuff.

Now to what i want to talk about
I've struggled with my mental health for a while now and it when it started i was in denial and i didn't want to believe i have depression or anything since i believed that i can't diagnose myself that was untill i started cutting surprisingly i didn't consider it cutting at first i didn't use a knife in case someone knows a knife is missing or someone sees my body since i  was close to being exposed once to cutting but i laughed and brushed it off i only realised i was cutting when i googled whatus considered cutting and how i used to cut myself ws by using my nails, i don't have long nails at all i hate long nails they make me uncomfortable but the force i use and repetition is enough to tear my skin and produce blood i cut my arms in winter because i usually wear long sleeves and i cut my upper arm and stuff the thing is i am not bad at hiding it.
I also have a problem woth cutting bumps on my skin especially on my legs so i have scars everywhere it is usually when I'm stressed but sometimes just because i don't like them and i can't stop i reach a point that i can skin then form scabs that i peel and the cycle goes on until scars form.
 
I have had suicidal thoughts and have planned how i can end it from the easiest way to the fastest and the one that people won't find my body i reached a point where i wrote a ""will"" basically stating what i was going through and how i was being treated and stuff and i stood at the edge of the window but decided at the last moment not to do that which made me more pissed that i didn't have the guts to do anything in my life and that i fail at everything and thoughts like that.

I think i also have episodes that i would be doing fine then i get these thoughts and memories flooding my brain and usually i get treated bad agin then i just go numb to think of dying there is no in between and then i stay like that for a while ranging from weeks to maybe a month of not wanting to talk to anyone at all.

I've developed hatred to most of the people oin my life the others are usually guilt that myabe I'm at the wrong. 

To give some info about who i live woth with not much detail 
My parents are divorced 

The parent i live with is a narcissist 

My sister has some narcissistic traits (she's abit ilder than me treats me like shit doesn't apologise then blames it on me and if i do the slightest and i mean like forgetting to wash a plate which i wash all the dishes anyway she gets pissed and starts yelling and stuff then expects me to apologise)

I have another siblings not bad but everyone here suffers form different things so i can't really balme any if them that much

1531,"I thought Wellbutrin was improving my mood, but it’s really just the lack of schoolwork. With AP exams and a taste of the stress I had before, I’m realizing that the medication hasn’t been helping.","I don’t know what to do at this point. I can feel so good, not anxious or depressed. And then one second later, I’m feeling at my rock bottom."
1532,My life keeps getting worse I wish I would die,"Without divining into details ( you can read some of my posts I don't post a lot you will find them easy ) 
It's just keeps getting worse and worse and I can't take it anymore it's so hard I was abused by my father since a very young age bullied at school since the first day and
All I want to know is does it get easier ?

1533,Going on medication for the first time,"Hello,

I for the entirety of my life have been battling with bipolar disorder as I was diagnosed at a young age. Due to my moms bias about medication and therapy, I was taken out of it as soon as the first session. I’m now 23 and have reached my lowest point. I have been diagnosed as an adult and am going on medication for the first time. I am excited to be able to stabilize my moods, but I’m also worried I won’t be the same person. Does anyone have any inspiring stories to keep me motivated? Thanks"
1534,Diet and depression,"Yo, i was watching a cg kid vid and he was on a meat only diet. He claimed it was like he was on long release mdma lol. Probs an overstatement, but has anyone here tried a low card, all meat, or keto diet? How did it help you?"
1535,Diagnose this,"

There is a person. He hates critisism and shuts it down instantly by pretending he has superior intelligence and usually uses just big complex words to convince themselves they are winning arguments. They are very socially awkward and state they have severe autism. They are delusional and possibly a compulsive liar. They enjoy attention. They can come across very child-like. How would you class this"
1536,please help me,"Long story short in this case: my parents- heck my whole family puts me down. But on a different level. I have severe depression and anxiety. I’m turning 17 soon (oct.11) and I know 18 isn’t so far, but I can’t live with them in my life anymore. They scream at the top of their lungs everyday and they’re embarrassing/uncivilized. I’m literally scared of my stepfather, because he’s so emotionally and mentally abusive, and 10/10 has definitely put his hands on my mom before. I can’t take this I need out of here. Does anyone recommend anything like group homes or something? I’ve had child protective services in my life before and all it did was get me an ass whooping because my parents don’t want us separated. Back in 2012, my sister at the tome was 15, she committed suicide soon when my mom started dating this man. I’d very much rather run away and be homeless then be here. I have two younger siblings who stress my mom out. She has her own problems with anxiety and stuff but always puts herself and everyone else before me. I don’t want to leave them and I know this story is all over the place. But please it’s urgent, I don’t want to kill myself but the urge keeps growing stronger and stronger. Please anyone reading this help me"
1537,Thanks for censoring my post about how I’m feeling mods. You censor my post which isn’t even that explicit and yet you keep posts up about talking about suicide? Wtf?,"Sorry beforehand if this isn’t allowed but I need to vent to the only people that can somewhat grasp this.

Since you can’t stand when someone else isn’t spouting the same old toxic positivity here’s my post yet again. Ban me for this I don’t care because seriously FUCK YOU mods. 

‘Most of everything can be considered a prison. The universe, this world, life itself, your mind, body, emotions, pain, etc. Hell even death since when you’re dead it’s not like you have any options to get out of being dead forever. And the thing about death is even when you want nothing more than to die and think it’s the closest thing to actual freedom you’ll still be trapped. Trapped forever in nothingness. Absolutely everything is out of our control and those who say we atleast have the ability to react to what we experience don’t know how mental illness affects those reactions.’

Yea censor someones thoughts and pain as always mods. Fuck this subreddit and Fuck you. Goodbye. Unsubscribe."
1538,My sister is 14 and has problems,"My sister isnt eating much just barely 2 meals a day and shes having mood swings and alot of energy levels going up and down, I dont know what to do with her, shes waiting on a new phone too so shes hoping for that, Im her older brother and I try to talk with her, shes feeling I think lonely and suicidal."
1539,Any recommendations for online therapy?,"I feel like I need help mentally, I seem to have issues with attachment, loneliness, motivation and maybe even depression. I’m not sure why but I know that I’m not feeling 100% and I think I just need some help with it. Have any of you tried online therapy? 
If so what recommendations do you have? I’ve been looking into Talkspace because of the ease of being able to text, but am still not 100% convinced. 

What are your thoughts?"
1540,I can literally feel my mental health disintegrating more and more everyday,"I’ve been in therapy for almost four years now after spending two years on a downward spiral of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. As a senior in high school, there’s a lot of pressure for me to get into a good college (I’m not from the US and our system here is much, much worse and harder). I’ve been working on my personal stuff, getting my shit together, and this year was already hard before quarantine, but *I was managing*. 

Of course, everything changed, and now with every passing day, I feel it more and more — everything that I’ve been working on is getting torn apart, piece by piece. I can’t stop comparing myself to other students, asking myself if I’m doing enough to guarantee my future or if I’m just gonna be another failure for family members to whisper about during reunions. I can’t put away the thought that I want all of this to be over. 

This is the year of my life that I most needed mental stability to take difficult tests and get into university, yet this seems to be as bad as the worst year of my life. My so called “friends” don’t bother to check up on me, every day I do the same things in the same order, and I don’t even think I’m properly learning anything through online classes. This year is over for me, it’s wasted, and its only purpose has been to tear me apart little by little until there’s nothing left. 

I don’t know for how long I’ll be able to handle this, honestly. Our president is a fucking moron who doesn’t know how to handle a crisis, so our isolation will most likely last until August. *August.* I don’t know if I’ll survive until August in this situation. I can’t. I refuse."
1541,I don’t know why I’m bothering,"I feel stupid coming here. But no one else wants to listen to me. I guess strangers on the internet works. I’ve really been struggling lately. I’m behind on months of schoolwork that I can’t push myself to do and I’ll probably fail all my classes. My physical health is horrible because I’m too lazy to do any workout plans or diets. I have no plans for my future once so ever. I feel like I’m just wasting my life. I have so many suicidal thoughts but I know I’m too scared to ever do it. Which sucks even more to me. I wish I could just do it. And here I am trying to talk to people who I don’t know and dont care about me outside of this post. I feel like I’ll be walking blind forever. No purpose. No plans. Just a fat piece of shit who everyone calls a friend but doesn’t actually care about them. I know I’d be missed if I died. I know people love me. But it doesn’t feel that way. I just feel like I’m there. I don’t have any defining qualities. People say I’m smart but I’m really not. I’d rather be called dumb. At least there’d be less pressure on me. College, military, etc. I wouldn’t last a month. I have no work ethic and I never do shit. Why do I even try anymore. I hate this. I feel fake. There are people genuinely going through shit. “Everyone has issues don’t compare yourself” they say. Well then how come no one can ever cares about the small things. How come the only way people start to care is if you actually try to kill your self. I don’t understand. I’m so tired of everything. What am I doing."
1542,My suicidal thoughts and depression.,"If you're reading this can you please upvote it so others can see, thanks for reading this as well it just helps me I guess.

My names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.

I was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.

It bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.

I was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.

2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.

We argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.

It broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.

HOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.

This is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!

September hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.

Then my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.

Everything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.

I started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.

I started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. 

In December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.

I had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.

Started the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. 
J and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. 

Throughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.

But... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.

But how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends. But I'm lonely ultimately, depressed, can't ride a bike, swim, fear of driving etc.

I don't know if anyone will make it this far, but if you are, and if you are my age, thank you, I don't know what you really can reply with but please upvote as it just helps I guess my self esteem."
1543,rage/anxiety attacks?,"Hey everyone, so I've always had anxiety and no matter how bad it got I was never the type to have panic attacks. I've always found that odd, because usually that's one of the main symptoms of people who have anxiety. By definition panic attacks are hyperventilating and stuff, I've had that happen to me maybe once. 

However the other day I read something about how anxiety attacks don't look the same on everyone, and that sometimes it can be bouts of rage. This really resonated with me because when I have bad anxiety I had these rage spells consistently, and if my anxiety is bad enough, I have what I call ""angry meltdowns"" in public that I can barely control. They're super embarrassing. 

Does anyone else experience this? Usually they go like, I get frustrated or I'm in a situation that's making me anxious (for example having to go somewhere by myself that I'm not familiar with) and I feel this blinding rage at myself, which usually results in me doing things like scratching or biting myself, hitting things or throwing them around (if I'm alone) and a lot of times it ends up in crying.

Are these anxiety attacks?"
1544,"My story-TW- self harm, homophobia, transphobia","Hi, I’m Park, I’m 12 and here is my roller coaster of a story.

So, when I was 9, my family and I moved to A new province and that’s where everything started, I discovered more about my self and when I was 10 came out as Pansexual, my family kinda just ignored it, and when I got a gf, they still ignored it. I got depressed from my parents divorce. I recently met a friend, he knows who he is, and he helped me a lot. Many people suspect I have a *few* undiagnosed mental health problems(add, depression, anxiety, and a few other things).. at school I’m known as the “psychopath” as I don’t exactly have the best emotional understanding and emotions in general. I came out as trans and lost some of my closest friends. I have 4 supportive people in my life, now with quarantine I can’t see them and I’m stuck at home with a parent who is somewhat transphobic and a father who doesn’t exactly know me very well. Dysphoria has been really bad, depression and suicidal thoughts too. I haven’t slept well in weeks or eaten well.. Everyone seems to think I’m a psychopathic killer who ya son morals, but, it’s hard to know what’s right and what’s not when you grew up in a dysfunctional family that moved every 3 years(that’s not a joke, I haven’t lived in a place for more then 3 years). I’ve turned to age regression as coping, but I tend to self harm when yelled at aggressively, leaving cuts, bite marks and bruises from myself, I’ve attempted suicide more then 10 times, I’ve lost most my hope beside 4 people. I need this quarantine to end soon.. I need to see these people or I’m afraid something is gonna happen..

1545,Empty,"Ever since 2020 has begun I have felt my life has gotten better, my dad has found a great woman for him, I have a job and graduated early from highschool and I have a very sweet boyfriend. Lately though, I have been feeling empty. I dont get happy for life anymore even though I have so much to be grateful for. What is even more scary is that I feel nothing towards my boyfriend as well, but I dont want to hurt him or even leave. It is scary to feel this way and I tear up because I feel so helpless."
1546,Any advice would be appreciated,
1547,please read........,"A greeting to whomever is reading; I think I might be a bit.... off. I don't know what is going on, but It's so odd, I don't know what to do about it. I have flashes of me doing really bloody things to other people. I haven’t done any of those things, it just ripples through me like a very small... movie. does anyone know what this is? I also have times when I am just empty and unfeeling. Please answer! I'm sick of these flashes."
1548,should i try to get myself tested for anxiety?,"i've been ruminating on this for a couple years now and i'm really unsure. when i've tried to ask for advice on it irl, i always get told everyone has anxiety, but i'm concerned that i am having too much of it.

i can't remember the last time i had a full night's sleep- it's been at least since the start of the school year. i usually wake up from a very vivid nightmare, and that's how i start my day. i always think 'this is it, this is the day i'm going to be killed/horribly maimed/etc', and i can't recall a day within the last year where i haven't had the sinking feeling something terrible is about to happen. i keep pepper spray next to my bed because i'm constantly afraid an intruder is going to come in and try to kill me, and i'm so petrified of accidentally starting a fire that i can't bring myself to touch a match. it's hard to sleep because i worry i'm letting my guard down and if something happens in the night i'll die quicker because i won't be awake to defend myself. i rarely make irl friends because i always think everyone's out to get me, and i always keep everything i am taking with me somewhere on my person because i constantly think everyone's going to steal my stuff- i never take my backpack and purse off while i'm in school, for example. i jump at sudden noises, and i can't handle the sound of anyone yelling or even speaking in an angry tone without feeling faint and in danger. i can't bring myself to hold small animals anymore because all i do is worry that i'll accidentally hurt them. i don't ask for things from other people because i worry they'll end up disappointed or mad. soon, i will have to choose what college to go to, but the concept of college gives me so much anxiety that even mentioning the year i will go to college makes me feel nauseous. i constantly worry about my school grades to the point i never seek help for them because i expect rejection if someone finds out i'm not always straight As. i don't ever feel like i'm in control, and i wish that the fear would just go away for once- i don't know what it's like to not feel constantly worried.

i don't know, i just want to know if any of that's abnormal. i think i'm just a massive coward, personally"
1549,How to Love Myself More,"I've struggled with my self esteem my whole life (I'm almost 21). As a child and teenager, I had social anxiety disorder that was untreated as my parents were in denial about it basically. I got help for it at 19 and now I'm pretty much over it and have made friends and even had a boyfriend but I still feel like there are definitely lingering effects from a childhood where I didn't have many friends, didn't stay consistent with a sport or hobby of that sort for fear of not going good enough at it or being judged, and not having boys interested in me. In general, as a teenager I just felt ""lesser than."" 

As I've gotten older I have gained some confidence through jobs and friends and college etc. Still, on some level I feel like the only thing I'm really ""good"" at is academics. I've always been good at school and responsible about it and I guess I feel like that's the one thing I'm good at is because people always praised me for that growing up. 

Even though I'm in a sorority now and have a good group of friends that seem to actually like me, and I've had guys interested in me, I still feel like fundamentally I'm not that good of a person. Not morally or ethically but just like...in general. Like sometimes I think I feel like I'm not worthy of people being friends with me or dating me. Logically I know this isn't true-I'm a loyal person, I love gift giving and doing nice things for people, I'm a good listener. However, the feeling persists. 

I feel like deep down something or things from my childhood made me feel this way but I don't know what they were besides never being ""popular"" or whatever. My parents were pretty good besides the ignoring my mental health thing and I've always been decently supported in that way. 

I don't deal with change very well-change like a breakup, losing a friend, or moving somewhere different hits me hard and usually gets me in a minor depressive episode. But I still want to experience normal adult change-moving different places, having and perhaps losing relationships, etc. I feel like if I loved myself deeply on a core level and had that confidence it would help me with this. 

Any ideas/thoughts?"
1550,The big flower fight,Not sure if this is the correct sub. But in the semi final of the big flower fight (on Netflix) one of the contests who struggles with stress and anxiety (noted in multiple episodes) but I am in love with the father. They state the father's struggles with accepting hes sons struggles and I hope that families and parents around the world and see this try and put a tenth of the effort this father put in because it will make a lifetime difference. Mental health is real and as a parent you can ignore it but it will only make your child more distant and alone.
1551,"Honestly, I can’t see any reason","
Please don’t tell me to call a hotline or talk to a therapist or any of the other standard response types.  I’m old, I have no children, I’m going to be divorced in the next year.  I have nothing, literally nothing to look forward to.  I have nobody to spend my retirement with, nobody to pass on anything to.  The only decent thing I have to pass on is my life insurance.  Don’t tell me “it gets better”...it doesnt.  Things have just gotten Progressively worse the longer I’m on this planet.  So please, tell me, when you are utterly and completely alone, when you are already last middle age, when you have nobody and no one and there’s literally nothing at all to look forward to....why?  If you’re younger, I get it.  You don’t know what the future holds, blah blah blah.  I’ve gone as far as I can in this life.  I’m not going to advance professionally, I can NOT have any children (physically and medically, not just a mental thing) and I won’t have anybody to spend my older years with so why not just “accidentally” get in a motor vehicle crash or something similar, maybe accidentally fall off a ladder, whatever it takes to just end this pointlessness and at least do a little good with the life insurance."
1552,Lack of interest in what I love and unable to focus,"I find that I can’t stay on task or complete projects. If there's any sound or movement that distracts me it de-rails my whole thought process which makes it hard to think. 

And now that I have to do school from home, I find it 100x harder to start the work I'm assigned. Even when I do get to it I have a hard time executing and prioritizing what needs to be done. 

I used to love IT, fixing things and putting ""the puzzle"" together was so much fun. But now, I just couldn't care less about it even though I love it.

It's just so frustrating to not be able to enjoy something for very long, or be able to focus on something important. Even when I'm in an argument I can't remember what I or the other person said."
1553,What’s wrong with me?,"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. But I see myself as two people. One is the fake version the person who is out and about the one everybody sees, but when I’m alone I’m the real version the one who has actual feelings and thoughts but when I’m the real one all I feel is mental pain. All the suicidal thoughts and self doubt the low self esteem it’s all I feel."
1554,a selfish vent idk,"I was told that it’s annoying whenever i talk about my problems by two close friends. this has resulted in my holding everything in, with nowhere to let it out. i’m scared to talk to anyone else in case they have the same opinion. i don’t want to burden anyone, and their comments just confirmed i do. i don’t have an outlet anymore. both of them said it’s annoying because i clearly have a lot of people who care for me, but it’s really hard to believe that especially given the irony. i don’t know if this makes sense anymore, but everyone thinks i’m fine now. i make sure to never complain on social media/when talking to them, because i don’t want to inconvenience them. i just want someone to listen to me i guess, but i’m at a point where i can’t talk to anyone without feeling like i’m a pain.  even typing this out i feel bad. in a way, i feel guilty for feeling any emotion that isn’t happiness"
1555,I don't feel attached to anyone in my life(?),"I just feel like my friends and family don't really mean that much to me emotionally. For example, I have two younger sisters, one is 10 years and the other is 2. My parents recently got divorced, and the younger one,  being two, didn't really understand what was happening, but the older of the two was extremely upset, crying, etc. But throughout all of that, I didn't feel sad or pained or anything. My biggest thought was something like ""oh man, this is inconvenient"". When our dog of 12 years died, same thing. I had to force myself to be ""sad"" about it, even though I really felt indifferent. I don't think I'm a bad person, and I do nice things for people just because of common courtesy like pick up pens, etc. Is this normal? Is there something wrong with me?"
1556,My life seems like it should be fine but I don't want to go on anymore.,"i'm a middle-class white guy just out of high school with a girlfriend and both of my parents still together. This is part of the reason that I don't really feel like I can tell anyone that I'm actually really depressed because most of them will just be like why, and I won't have an answer. sometimes I think it has something to do with the relationship I'm in. it started fine but lately, she is just mad all the time. I used to be really happy all the time, I would make jokes around her and she would laugh. lately, she seems to just get mad when I make jokes and then she wonders why I don't make them anymore. enough about that though. sometimes I go into a deep depression and just sit in my room not motivated to do anything. I get in the mood to end things and I don't even know why. by all rights, I should be happy with my life. I haven't really told many people about how I feel other than my GF (who normally just responds with same) my family thinks I'm a happy person and honestly I don't really feel safe enough to tell them the truth about me. I grew up in a pretty religious house, so naturally, I can't tell anyone in my family that I've had sex before. sometimes I feel like I'm not loved by anyone. it might just be because I stuff most of my emotions (I haven't cried in years). lately, I just don't see the point in going on."
1557,My perceptions of the world are unravelling. And I don’t know if I can cope.,"Amongst other realisations, the one that hits the most is that there is no such thing as love or good &amp;evil in this world. I don’t even know what is real anymore. I’m finding it really difficult to trust my perceptions. 
Does anyone have any advice for reconciling with this and not losing my mind?"
1558,How should you deal with confrontation how do you stay calm and collected in stressful situations without being a victim?,Hi hope everyone is well in these crap times I was just looking for advice how do you deal with confrontation in life be that physical or mental thanks everyone keep calm and stay alive 🙏
1559,Giving life meaning,"I wanted to make this post to see if there was anybody else that thinks this way. To keep it short and simple, I basically see how worthfull/less I am by how much I can help people. Its on a person by person basis, if I can help somebody then I feel like im worth something to said to person, but if I cant help them I feel like I have failed and am worthless. I almost give my ownlife value by helping others. Im struggling with this way of thinking because at the surface it sounds great and all but If I really think about it it seems extremely self destructive. Thoughts?"
1560,How do you deal with abusive people in everyday life be that dumb name calling or threats of physical violence?,Hi I hope everyone is doing well just thought I d ask around to gauge people's opinions on abusive behaviour of people how do you keep your cool without being a victim?
1561,My family member thinks they have COVID but has negative tests,"My sister(36) thinks she has COVID-19 with zero symptoms. She’s been tested 5 times. All negative tests. She knows for a fact she has it though.(shortness of breathe but that’s from anxiety.) She hasn’t left her room in months. She now thinks she’s paralyzed from the deadly virus. She can move but she’s extremely defensive if I were to ever say she doesn’t have anything really going on. Worried how to address this. Any thoughts?

First time posting in the sub not sure if this is correct place. Let me know if wrong place if so."
1562,"Hello, mental health enthusiasts!","(I have gotten approval from one of the moderators to post about this. :)  
Hiya! My name's CJ. I'm an aspiring writer and have a huge interest in mental health. I've been working on an informational book (yet to be named)  that more or less encapsulates dozens of known and some unknown mental  health/behavioral or otherwise relevant disorders and disabilities that  affect how the mind perceives things. 

I  need people who are willing to have interviews about  disorders/conditions that they may be experiencing. It's a simple  10-question text interview.

1563,How do I know if I should start therapy? How would I start?,"The main reason I'm considering therapy is because I feel like I need someone to vent all of my feelings to. I feel really selfish wanting to talk to my friends about it, and talking to myself isn't working that well anymore. Lately I've felt so disconnected from the world and I feel like no one really understands me. But is this what a therapist is really for? For me to just talk at them about what goes on in my head? Also, I fear I won't be able to talk about my feelings until I really get comfortable, which could be a while...

I guess I'd like to hear your experiences: What made you start therapy? How do you start? What do I look for in a therapist?"
1564,Is he even recovering ? Boyfriend in a mental hospital,"In my last text post I explained how I couldn’t be with by boyfriend any longer because of his drug use. He had been on an exactly 2 week bender with meth and he suffers from psychosis , sober he differentiates that what he’s hearing and reality are two distinct things, but after using meth being up all night for days at a time and no food , he turns into a complete different person. Recently he had been the worst I’ve ever seen him, he’d sleep when his body would shut down, eat when he’d wake up and then relapse again. I saw him twice over the span of these two weeks ( normally I’d see him every day but his relapsed got substantially worse and I’d have to distance myself from him when he did but it never lasted this long ) the last time I visited him he thought he was God. He asked me to come over and I didn’t know what to expect , I showed up and he was talking nonsense to someone , or to the voices in his head. He barely paid me any mind and his sister then told me he’s been like that for about a week or so. His mom mentioned that if he got out of hand she would call the cops so they could send him to a mental hospital. His mom is not a compassionate woman , and although I’m sure her sons drug addiction created an immense pain for her, she hides it very well and is very cold to him even when he’s doing good. When she first saw me there she said “ you still have faith in him ? He’s seems stuck now “ when she asked me this I cried tried to hold back tears and it was upsetting how hopeless and detached she had gotten for his situation and him , but I understand her. I went with him to the store and on our way there he was pointing at his neighbors houses and saying “ you too “ “alright alright so are you “ “ okay you are too “, I asked him what that meant and he told me he would bless all these people. He kept talking about things I couldn’t comprehend, it was obvious his mind was simply somewhere else. Three days after aka today I texted his sister and asked if he was home. Even if I don’t see him I at least hear from him once a day, the last I heard from his was Monday and my anxious mind couldn’t help but wonder if he was okay. I texted him but no reply and my message didn’t even go through. His sister just told me he was at a psychiatric hospital. I don’t know what to feel or think. I asked her if she knew which one and she leant. Even if she did would it even matter ? I think he’d have to be the one to reach out to me , i don’t know how the hospitals work. I’m not sure how to feel. I worry because he has a lot of legal issues, i don’t know if it matters in a psychiatric hospital but they can’t help but creep into my head. I also don’t know if i will ever see him again. I don’t think this was a necessarily bad choice, I hope he’s receiving the help he needs and I’m glad he’s somewhere he can sober up. I’m just worried about what can present itself after , or what will even happen ? Will he be able to willingly get himself out when the time is correct ? I’m confused on how to feel or whether I should be worried. I know I can’t do much in this situation so I’m trying to tell myself it’s better then the situation he was in , but I’m still terrified."
1565,I have a good life but i’m so miserable and for that I feel guilty,"God I hate to write this but i’m just so done. So I live what most people would consider a pretty good life. I have a great mom, okay dad, I go to a good university, I have a lot of friends and a great social life. I’m also decently attractive to be completely honest. 

But I suffer from severe depression and suicidal thoughts. every task in life feels like too much and its so hard to get out of bed. I’m the kind of person who never talks to people about my problems because i don’t want to be a burden. i live my life constantly thinking about killing myself and my anxiety and depression have destroyed me. nobody in my life notices though unless i tell them because i’ve felt this way for so long that i’ve gotten really fuckin good at hiding it. i have told a few people. i want to die and i wish i could explain why but i can’t and that makes me feel so guilty. like i hate myself for that."
1566,The Effects of Quarantine on My Studies and Plans,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this sub but I figured it'd be the best place to talk about what this pandemic has done to me as an individual.  

It's no secret that this has been hard for everyone, and it's affected everyone in different ways. For myself, it caused me to move back home all the way to Texas from going to college in Buffalo, NY. While I was glad to be home, I missed my friends who were scattered all over the country and felt a bit cheated from the spring experience of my freshman year of college. I also was a division I athlete, and had lost the ability to play my sport and work out with gym equipment. As for classes, I too was an attendee of Zoom University, and it was not a fit for me. After I moved back home, my motivation for everything went down the drain. I woke up at noon everyday, slept at 5 in the morning, only ever left my room to eat, and stayed in my pajamas. Even though there were still lectures and classes, I had lost any and all desire to attend and listen. When I was back on campus, I never missed a class and attended tutoring for 2 of my classes to stay on top of that. I've struggled with my mental health before, and during this time it's manifested in isolation, lack of motivation, and procrastination. Instead of having all of my assignments ready a few days before they were due, I was doing them a few hours before hand. I tried to bring myself to do better and even did stuff like start posting on my struggling studygram (@chrisstudies, btw) to motivate me. Nothing worked. That might've been the worst part; seeing myself struggle and being fully aware but not having it in me to change. 

On top of all that, I decided that playing in my athletic program was not working out for me and decided to try and transfer to play at another school. This is where things get even worse. I am actively struggling to try and find a new school to play at, and I don't even know what to do. There are some schools I'm interested in going to regardless, but once again I can't bring myself to research and contact other programs. Deep down I know why I'm so reluctant; I'm afraid of being rejected and being forced to quit instead of stopping on my own terms. I told myself tomorrow will be the day, and at this point, I have nothing to lose by trying.

I'm just feeling really stuck and even though school is out for the year, I still have a weight on my chest for knowing I could've done more and tried harder. I don't know where my GPA finished at this year and I'm still too scared to look. I have dreams of pursuing a career in medicine and I know I need to do better, but this whole situation has really showed me some of my flaws and that I need to control what I know I can control even if it's not my ideal environment. 

Please feel free to comment with any thoughts, advice, or criticism. I'd appreciate hearing what you have to say. :)"
1567,Too ashamed to admit that I’m depressed and scared,"I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed recently. I’ve been having a really difficult time controlling my emotions and have been having outbursts at people and cut people out of my life. It’s really frustrating and I feel ashamed, but I don’t know how to handle it. 

I have anxiety and depression, but I usually just tell people that I have anxiety because I feel way too embarrassed to admit to people that I’m depressed. For some reason, saying that I have anxiety feels easier. In this moment my depression is the thing that’s really getting to me, but I don’t want to share it with anyone, and I don’t really feel like I have anyone to share it with. 

I have never admitted this to anyone, but I was suicidal a few months ago. I was barely hanging on. Ironically, the only thing that kept me alive was the failing American healthcare system— my fear that if I failed, was found, and sent to the hospital that I wouldn’t be able to afford whatever bill I’d be sent. In these past few days I’ve started to feel pretty bad again, but it makes me even more upset that that’s the thing keeping me here and not my hopes for the future. Because I honestly don’t have many hopes for the future. Everything seems so bleak and hopeless. All I can envision for myself 10 years from now is me lonely, feeling exactly how I feel right now and I hate it. I really fucking hate it. 

Next week I’ll be moving into an apartment to live by myself and while I am happy to be living completely on my own without the stressors that come with a roommate, I am also afraid that being alone will only make my anxiety, depression, and overall sense of loneliness worse. I don’t know how to manage everything I’m feeling and I’m scared."
1568,How do I become focused during quarantine/COVID-related disruptions? I am so disappointed in myself...,"TLDR depression is killing my focus and work productivity and I feel like I'm falling so far behind I'll never catch up due to COVID. Working from home is not going well for me.

Hi y'all, I've struggled with depression for quite some time but felt like I had reached a point where I was afloat and managing... until COVID came along and disrupted daily life. I am incredibly blessed to have a job where I can do about 90% of my work from home and go into the office maybe once a week. I try to appreciate the immense privilege I benefit from due to my position in having this job.

What I'm struggling with is I can't get myself to fucking focus on my work while I'm working at home. I'll make a to do list each day and maybe get to half of it. I'll wrap up at 5:00-5:30 and tell myself I'll be back at it by 8:30 but usually only get in an hour or so from 10-11 if that (I didn't do that today). I'm struggling so much with just calling myself a lazy piece of shit in my head. I can usually chug along from 8:30-11:30/12 and then 1-3 but then lose focus and struggle to regain it, sometimes from 4-5. Right now, I have so much work, I really need to be doing 7:30 straight through to 5:30 and maybe at night too.

I'm scared I'm going to fall behind in work productivity and get fired because the economy is bad and I'm sure my employer is looking to cut anywhere possible. But somehow this fear isn't translating to me actually you know being more fucking productive, instead I waste time dicking around on reddit and facebook.

Has anything worked for y'all? Is this just me being a lazy failure? I'm so afraid I'm going to disappoint my husband and all of my loved ones because I can't get my shit together and act like an adult for once. I can't stop thinking about how lucky I am to be at this stage in my life and how I am wasting all of that because I'm just too stupid or too weak to tough this out."
1569,Here we go again,"Hey. I was recently in a pretty shitty situation (homelessness) and was lucky enough to have someone pull me out of the rut I was in. I’m currently doing just fine, but I lost ambition for my dream and completely hate my life now. Sure I guess having a job and being able to eat and sleep well is cool. But I have no more drive for a dream I didn’t commit suicide over. I have been going after my dream for 2 years and throughout all the shit I’ve faced. I’m not happy working on my dream anymore. Which really sucks because, I wanted to do something big but I guess not. With this thought in my head I kinda feel empty inside, purposeless if you will. I really don’t know what to do"
1570,Is there a name for this?,"So I currently find that I have to listen to music or have some sort of audio around me at all times because otherwise my mind goes to really dark places, is there a name for this?"
1571,Parent trouble,"Hi everyone, 
My dad has depression and claims he has ptsd but I feel that he just uses his mental illnesses as an excuse to mentally abuse me and my mom. He has said multiple times that our feelings don’t matter and that we need to change for him. Then threatens to kill himself to “prove he’s sick”. We can’t move out, we are stuck. Please help."
1572,Sexuality Problem,"I'm male and I feel like there is something really wrong with me, I fantasize about myself being woman. Specifically I deeply desire to experience sex as woman."
1573,is it normal if i want to have an imaginary friend?,"(F21) let's put you in context. i have depression and anxiety (a classic) and quarantine has obviously hit me, hard. i passed through swallowing a lot of pills (benzos which im prescribed and not prescribed on) because i got the worst two days of my life after getting in a fight with my four best friends. it was pretty upsetting and cannot be able to see anyone has been TERRIBLE. im a sociable person and I've always felt that my friends are my family because i have a very troubled one. luckily we've been getting along lately because i had long talks with my folks and family, but of course we've been able to do it cause me (the youngest of five) who decided to go to therapy one year ago and been taking clonazepam for 10 months and escitalopram for 4. so anyway, it's really really great they're actually here for me, but having my friends so far just kills me. I was about to start plaing piano again, in an institute; i was seeing my swiss boyfriend that comes once a year and this whole coronavirus thing destroyed literally everything, not just me and my situation. this has lead me to a new, yet known existential crisis which i didn't have for lots of months.
anyway, it has been shit but it also been great when i did see some friends (breaking the quarantine but cautious about it). it's have been like a emotional rollercoaster with a huge fuck of introspection which i didn't want; i wanted to start playing the incredible piano my dad bought me (he hasn't given me money since i was 16) and start my lessons, but jt didn't happen so ANYWAY.

i just was like going to bed and high (i smoke a lot of weed, already know it's not good for treatments by experience but honestly idg a shit right now about that) and i started talking to a third person which was fun. then i think about the primary cuestion. is it weird my mind responses like these? i mean, i DO am a talkative and social person and that has been my escape from my horrible house when i was younger and even just some months ago. even now sometimes. so that's the question. what do you think? thank you for reading this far lol

tl;dr: im depressed and anxious and i use my social relationships to decrease it apart from medication and also quarantine ruined me and i may wanna have an imaginary friend"
1574,i will probably sound crazy but,"i was feeling distressed and having suicidal ideation &amp; all of a sudden i started feeling nothing? my brain &amp; eyes feels empty &amp; like i’ve been voided of emotion. i feel very floaty &amp; hollow of emotion. i will try to write what i intended to right before i suddenly felt numb. it’s kinda hard to.

i genuinely think i am not supposed to be alive. i feel like i’m in life is strange where keeping a person who’s not supposed to be alive, alive, only makes things worse &amp; worse. almost everything in my life has, or is going wrong. feels like every new direction i turn to, a door is slammed in my face. 

i feel like logically, i know this may not be true. but i really believe the universe is encouraging &amp; pushing me to end my life by doing this. i don’t want to trigger others to thinking like me so if it does please don’t read. i feel like my medication is just a fake cope &amp; i don’t want to take it. i often think therapists are just lying to me because it’s their job &amp; they’re literally paid to get me to not kill myself, so i don’t trust them. 

and trust me, i have tried. i have tried for 7 years. in good faith. only to end up with a (symbolic) slap in the face each time &amp; never recover. 

this morning, i went to look for my ibuprofen bottle to potentially attempt later today. i couldn’t find it. i sit down on my bed, and suddenly it’s on my night stand. it was NOT there before (only a cup &amp; lamp was there) &amp; i have no recollection of ever taking it out of the drawer or finding it. how can you even refute that?

i feel like i know the ultimate truth. no matter how much i try to convince myself otherwise, the truth is i should not be alive. the world is a sad place &amp; i hate it. my life is a failure &amp; i am just prolonging my suffering by holding on when i am clearly being told to let go. i see clear signs. i don’t know what i did to deserve this, but i clearly did something &amp; everybody would be better off without me in the long run. even if they are sad at first, because i attract misfortune &amp; failure which affects them. 

just wanted to get it off my chest i guess."
1575,So very few ever seem to truly understand what people mean by “I feel so alone”. It’s so misunderstood.,

1577,Depression - Body vs. Mind,"I think one of the most difficult things at the moment is the combination of not wanting to miss out and not being able to keep up with anything for too long without completely burning out. There’s opportunities and fun things that I just have to pass on because I’m in no fit state to do them, and it’s frustrating - because, physically, I’m in a completely fit state to do those things. By the logic I’ve mostly grown up on, that means I have no reason to say I can’t and me struggling to get motivated is just laziness. That’s the way my brain tells it to me, and it’s difficult to come up against. 

Even if everyone around me is being kind and supportive, I continue to disregard the validity my mental health because I’m perfectly fit physically. Even expressing that thought makes me feel like I’m being preachy or over-emotional. Being this way, a healthy body with an unwell mind, and having to constantly turn things down makes me feel guilty and lonely, and then feel guilty for feeling lonely. It makes me think my friends probably care less of me or don’t want to interact with me because it’s additional stress and everyone has enough stress to deal with at the moment, when at the same time, I know that’s completely untrue. I just can’t help that feeling, it’s like an itch that can’t be scratched.

I keep waiting for my “Snap Out Of It” moment, like one day I’ll wake up and be back to normal, or someone will come along and smack some sense into my head. But I’ve been here before, and that’s not how it works. Last time, it took basically readjusting my whole direction in life to get me functioning again. I don’t know what it’ll take this time, or if it’ll take anything other than time. My mum thinks I’ll be this way for another couple of months. I’m only hoping it’s no longer. I really do feel like I’ve reached a limit with my friends, which is understandable. I wait for them to reach out to me and if they don’t, I feel like they don’t want to talk to me but if they do, I don’t want to open up that much for fear of scaring them off. And I struggle to reach out at the moment for the fear of being a burden. 

I’m glad that, as of late, mental health is beginning to be viewed on the same level as physical health. I wish it always had been. 

This has just been me shouting into the void, but any commentary/thoughts are welcome in response."
1578,I have crazy thoughts about having sexual intercourse with God and religious entities.,"This is going to sound horrible, but I have no way of getting help unless I explain it. Without going into detail, I was exposed to porn in my teenage years and was quite abhorred by it, to be honest. Eventually, I began watching it more and more. Being quite religious, I quickly started feeling guilty about what I was indulging in. I started self-shaming, asking for forgiveness constantly, etc. I eventually starting having compulsions, where I'd imagine having sex with God or religious figures/entities. As disgusting as this may sound, these movie-like images of having sex with God were quite vulgar and often reflective of what I would be disturbed by when I'd watch pornography. It's like my sick mind would recreate the scene with God, a prophet, a holy book, etc. Basically, anything that I'd HATE, my mind would conjure. I kept asking for forgiveness and having intrusions followed by obsessions. Sadly, I'm nearly 30 years old and still suffer from this problem. Is there any name for it? Is there any way to get help for it without having to disclose what it is in person. I have a hard enough time explaining it on the web, I'm 100% sure I'm not going to mention it in person and seek help, especially if I'm asked to disclose the obscene nature of my sick thoughts. Any help is welcome."
1579,I always regret about the choices I made in life. The thoughts of 'What could have been if I went that way' haunts me and makes me unhappy.,"I (26F) am not in a very bad situation right now. Even though I am not in my dream job, I have a decent job now. I'm living with my family which I don't like. I always feel unhappy by thinking that, I should have chosen otherwise then and there. What could I do?"
1580,"My dad, a senior man, asks me the same questions everyday and is really annoying me","My dad asks questions that he knows the answer to every single day. He does it to all his children as well as his wife. 

When we were in high school, my siblings and I would wake up at roughly the same time as him to get ready. Whenever he saw one of us in the morning, he would say “Good morning. What, early attendance? (school attendance)” and he would wait until we answer and then go to the bathroom. This happened every single day for years until we pointed it out and he now doesn’t do it too often.  

When I prepare for prayer, I have to wash my limbs and face. So when I am doing this it’s crystal clear that I haven’t prayed yet and I am going to pray the current prayer. Yet, every time he sees me washing myself, he asks “What? You haven’t prayed?” knowing perfectly well that I haven’t prayed yet but he still asks it and wants an answer. 

Or if we are eating dinner together and I don’t want to eat something, he could jump in and ask “What? You don’t like it?” He does it, even though he knows what I like and don’t like, I mean I’m in my 20s now. 

Or if I’m in the kitchen and I am making a sandwich or preparing something, upon entering he will ask me “What are you cooking / what are you cooking for us?” almost every time. Or if I’m eating something and he clearly sees what I’m eating, he asks “what are you eating?” and waits for an answer even though the dish is literally in front of his face and I am showing him what I am eating. 

Or if my mother makes something for dinner he will take a look at the dish and say “what is this? What have you made?” and waits for an answer even if it’s obvious what she has made

Or I always go to pray on Fridays, and I usually go to the same mosque every time, yet he asks “Did you go for prayer today? Where did you pray?”

I don’t mean to sound mean, but it’s driving me mad having to always answer these questions. Other than that, he seems to have normal social skills. I’ve heard him talk on the phone many times and talking to other people and it seems normal, but when he talks to us, his close family members then these type of questions appear. What is going on? Does he do it because he wants to interact with us? Why does he do it? I don’t think I can ask him and expect an answer."
1581,Feeling suicidal due of this,"Hi so yeah i dont really know how to start this im really not use to tell my problems, but i hope it can help me or anyone over here dealing with those issues. I guess i'll start with my main problem in my life, i dont got parents, i never really had some they are not in my life anymore, i cut every bridge i could  and its for the better but is it? I dont wanna go to much into details but to be short my dad is a drughead who was never there and my mom had mental issues, she was the one who raise me and despite everything she raised me good, she did what she can. But by age of 10 or 11 she just start hating me making my sisters always the favorite (i had one sister with the same age and one sister who already had a child at 17) so she always carred about them and not me all my teenage to my adulthood, she was always unfair to me refusing me or everything that she was giving them, being really unpolite to my friend, calling me name calling his own son, a fag, a rat, a sew rat telling me *i hate you*, she told me once: you a son of a bitch i actually laugh at that one ahaha
So it went on and on like that for years until she kicked me out she already did it a dozen of time but now it was for real for real and i was only 17 at that time , i had a good job as a helper on the roof i was about to go back to school but no that was not enough for her, so i just said fuck it, it didnt argue i just moved out. I manage to live on my own for around a year i eventualy went to live with my father 
It didnt work out i found out my mom was telling the truth about him using, he start asking me money cause he was always getting paid late so he was always borrowing me money, stealing my shit in my room so i got out not long after.
I've returned back to my mom place telling her i had no where to go that she had to take me back,
she said yes! i wont lie i really thought she changed i changed a lot in those time so why she woulnt ? The first 3 month went great i even took a night job to be sure i would not see her often it was great for some time my relation with her didnt really change she never asked me hey how are you doing ?you had a great day? She never ask me that before so i was not surprise it didnt improve. Then it all start to become like it was in my teenage everyday got worse until i snap and destroy the microwave in the kitchen asking her what all my life till this day she wanted from me and she stayed silent and she call the police i moved out. Now im turning 22 next month its been 2 years and a half i did not see, heard about anyone in my family since. Im living by myself since then having to learn pretty much everything in life.

1584,My Therapist won’t diagnose me?,"So I’m a 19 y/o F and I have a very long mental health history, I’ve been hospitalized multiple times since I was 12 and have been on different medications. I’m dramatically better than I was before but I still experience what I can only describe as manic and depressive episodes, where I go periods without sleep and have tons of energy and then I will crash and sleep for days. I truly believe I am bipolar or maybe bpd (I was diagnosed with bpd in a hospital when I was 13 but obviously that was expunged because you’re not supposed to diagnose minors with it) and my therapist agrees I meet the criteria for diagnosis...however she doesn’t want to diagnose me at all. She doesn’t think it’s necessary and its better to live without ‘labels’ but I really would like to have a label to describe all of the symptoms I’m having. I feel uncomfortable talking about my symptoms and mental illness publicly because I feel like if I mention my manic episodes I’m somehow lying/using the wrong terms because I’m not diagnosed. I just want to be able to describe myself properly and I don’t know how to explain it to her in a way that doesn’t seem like I’m trying to self diagnose myself/get attention."
1585,How to help someone,"My boyfriend suffers from bipolar disorder. He's been baker acted before a couple of times for being violent, drug abuse etc. Im only 19 and we have been dating for 4 years. This might sound intense but he gets really angry and starts to threaten to commit suicide every time I take too long to answer his texts. For example, today I stepped away from my phone for a second because my dad has been corona positive for 7 weeks already and I was helping him measure his blood pressure since he suffers from high blood pressure. I completely forgot to tell my boyfriend I was going to help my dad out. I stepped away from my phone for 3 minutes total and got back to 100 messages of him telling me that I make him want to kill himself and that I am the reason he hates his life. I text him back and explain to him that I was helping my sick dad out and he completely ignores what im saying and my reasoning behind why I wasn't answering his messages; he kept spam texting me asking me why I don't love him and that he hates his life. It is truly very toxic but I always try to calm him because I know he suffers from BPD and I really don't want him to hurt himself. I try telling him all the time that he should go see a therapist and get help if he really does feel suicidal and like he hates his life. He doesn't ever believe me that it will help and he just doesn't acknowledge my plea to him at all. Since he completely ignores me every time I tell him he should go to a therapist, I try convincing him to meditate or start to work or exercise and focus on something that will clear his mind. Its really hard and I really need help trying to convince him that he should get some help. What can I say to him to really convince him? He's really hard-headed and doesn't really believe a thing I say. I have always been loyal to him and have always been by his side. I have never hurt him and have always been there for him even at his worst so there is no reason for him to be saying that I am the reason he hates his life and why he wants to die... I just want to help him and see him do better but he just won't listen to me."
1586,Am I depressed or just attention seeking,Im laying in bed right now contemplating of just leaving this house I don't feel like I fit too well with my family I look nothing like anyone in my family I don't share any traits with them except not being very tall I often get told how much I look like everyone and thing else except what they say I was born as like my brother is told how much he looks like my father while I get compared to some random group of people but I know they probably don't mean any harm probably and I'm so far behind on school it's ridiculous I was never really smart to begin with the only thing I'm proud of is my spelling I'm decent at basic math but everything else I do is just so fucking trash I don't even know when to add a fucking period or comma for fuck sakes I've dropped out multiple times before starting in 9th grade then I just come and go multiple times I'm a senior now and this school has given me another chance but I can't even keep focus long enough to finish these packets I don't even know about like I know I can just cheat and that's what I've been doing but like I said I can't even focus even a little so that's why I've thought about just stopping and running away I'll probably block all contact with my family just in case this was probably more of a rant then a call for help I'm sorry
1587,Questioning my reactions to deaths,"Hi, I feel like I should seek some feedback on some things and I hope this is the appropriate place to do it.

Today was my father's funeral. He died about a month prior, but the arrangements and paperwork took forever. My brother has been the most affected by this loss, my mom doesn't usually show it but I know she's sad too. And I'm like the strong one in the family, the most clear-headed. That kind of worries me. 

Since his passing, I haven't really felt a lot of emotions about it. Usually I just feel neutral and my mind quickly drifts off to other things. Sometimes I'll have a fleeting emotion, but it's gone very fast. I feel like my mind would rather focus on the here and now and the future, not what is now gone. Sometimes, well, even quite often, I find myself thinking of how life might get better. This makes me feel guilty and makes me ask questions about myself: am I cold? do I lack emotions? am I a sociopath? do I just care about myself?

I can give myself several rebuttals to these questions. I can feel many emotions. I can love; I love my family and my partner. I can empathize; I cared a lot about my dad during his sickness and took care of him a great deal. I can miss people; I've missed exes. But for some reason I don't seem to miss the dead. 

When my uncle and his wife passed away many years ago when I was a child, I rationalized it: even though we wrote letters and exchanged gifts, they lived hours away and we hardly saw each other in person. We didn't even speak on the phone much. When cats I was close to passed away, I rationalized it as, well, they're cats, not humans - I can love them, but I cannot have with them the same kind of bond and communication I can have with another person. The passing of my dad is the first one that really ""hit home"", or should have. I saw him everyday, we even lived together. My only excuse is that, unfortunately, I had trouble being open with him, and with my mom too for that matter. 

Since this aspect may play a big part in this, I will explain it briefly. I'm in my thirties and very much a late bloomer. I've lived with my family all my life, and never really had any social life in person.  My parents didn't try to isolate me, but I was homeschooled and they had no friends either. So they perhaps have played an over-sized role in my life. Additionally I was a very sensitive kid and teen and would be easily hurt by everything: criticisms, judgements, shame, embarrassment. I was often depressed and faced anxiety attacks. I developed a great fear of letting my parents down or disappointing them in some way. When the curiosity of adolescence kicked in, I reached a compromise with myself - I would explore new things, but keep them secret. After living my teens and twenties this way, it reached a point where, sadly, my dad didn't even know the real me. I was too afraid to tell him. I didn't know where to start. I'd built up this whole other self, a different side of me, mostly online, where I felt freer. I had no fear of opening up to strangers if I felt they were safe enough. I felt like I had to emotionally distance myself to protect myself. 

All this may seem like an obvious explanation to my problem but a big part of me still wonders what would happen if someone I was open and intimate with were to pass away. Would I feel anything if, God forbid, my partner or future children, were to die? Or would I just feel numb and then feel guilty for that fact?

I discussed this with a friend of mine online and she suggested I was in the ""denial"" stage of grief. What if I never leave that stage? Can people stay stuck in one stage permanently? 

Because of my dad's disability and health issues, I had already gotten used to doing things without him, like shopping. He couldn't eat much so I was used to eating without him. So when he passed, I didn't feel much of a transition. It just felt like he was just gone a few days to go get treated - that was our original intention after all. I had a dream the other day even that he had come home from the hospital recovered. Seeing his body at the hospital and today at the funeral, I just felt awkward. I wanted to get out of there. 

Are my feelings ""normal""? Do others feel this way? I feel like there is something wrong with me; something ""bad"" with me but I can't change it."
1588,A sonnet about self harm. Please realize you have a future ahead of you and that you are loved.,"My form of control has become pain.
As i cut my skin I start to realize
I can decide when I tear my vein,
As well as when I do not vandalize.

But in my harm comes great and traumatizing sorrow.
With each drop of blood that is shed a tear from my eye also starts to fall.
For I know that if I have a child tomorrow,
They will have to look upon the old scars of my breasts as a recall.


As I look towards my future I am filled with great regret,
Yet the pain in the present is something I think I need.
My forever lasting cries have been ignored and they forget,
So I reluctantly continue to make myself bleed.

For those who have the urge to puncture and harm their skin,
Please remember that someday your 
great future will begin.



I am definitely not good at English or writing so please do not judge my roughly written poem. If you are thinking about or are self harming, please remember that you are an amazing and beautiful human being. No matter who you are, your future will begin someday. Be patient. Recovery is hard, so don’t be afraid to reach out whether it is family/friends, a hotline, or someone on this subreddit (including me). Be strong and remember to be brave through your tough times &lt;3."

1594,I'm not okay. I need help.,"I have seen therapists in the past and I realize that we never talked about the things that I have come to realize needed to be talked about. And just so everyone knows,  I have been diagnosed with depression starting in high school, but I know middle school is when it started. Been on every sort of pill and finally found one that helps a bit. Also diagnosed with anxiety. And I have a past with self harm/cutting though that phase is over, but I still do it or get the urge when overwhelmed. 

I came to the discovery that I am a toxic or manipulative  person. I get so overwhelmed sometimes in cetain situations and conversations and to combat it I say things like 'I guess I should just die then' or if someone doesn't respond or hear me 'I guess it doesn't matter' or sometimes when I feel insecure 'I'm surprised you hang out with me' or if I feel like I'm rambling or if they're not listening ' I guess I'll shut up'. I don't mean to be this way and I know the statements I make are not true, but they just come out even after I've realized it. I've talked to therapists about self deprecating statements and to try train myself out of saying these things, but it only goes so far when the people in my life don't always show that these statements are false. I feel like I am manipulating peoples feelings by saying these things.

When I want to do something I always try to convince people to come with me, bribing them with gas money if it's going somewhere, food, a drink, as a favor if they do. I know this is manipulative, but then I think, would they come if they really didn't want to? It's not like getting them a coffee is a big incentive that they would feel like they need to come with me just to get one. But then again, I guess I feel like the only way I can every get someone to hang out with me is to do this. I feel like my personal company is probably not enough for them to want to just hang out with me, so I give then something so they feel more inclined. Writing this, it kinda feels like giving a puppy a treat so they do what you want... but I just feel like no one would want to hang out with me unless there is something in it for then. 

I am also have very passive aggressive tendencies due to my lack of ability to communicate effectively. I don't try to be, but especially in arguments it comes out. Maybe its a part of me trying to reduce the situation so they feel bad about being mad at me and will stop, or maybe I just don't want to flat out say what I want and hurt their feelings, so I try to get around it. Now if you look up passive aggressive I don't apply all scenarios, but I have noticed I do apply to a few, acting sad so someone will ask what's wrong since I don't know how go bringing up whatever it is, acting busy so someone won't ask me something, indirectly asking someone for something because I don't know how to right out say it. 

I feel like family affected how I am, my mom and brother are not very emotional people, they have their own passive aggressive tendencies, especially my mother, and they are stubborn and you can't change their mind on things to save their life. We don't talk about feelings or emotions about things until they blow up, very little caring physical contact, the list could go on. I just grew up in a very non communicative house so growing up I just took hints and tips for how to communicate form where I could, which is why I suck at it now. 

I could list so much more but then this post would turn into a legitimate story. 

I know I should go see an actual therapist, but I always get so closed up and only bring up things I want them go hear, not what I need them go hear. Part of my anxiety thinking they will hate me if I bring up certain topics or see me in a different light. 

Tl;dr I realized my flaws and even after therapy I still don't know how to improve myself and gef rid of the the tendencies I have."
1595,Inability to function without music for long periods of time among other aspects," I'm not sure if this is really the ideal place to be posting this but I thought I'd give it a shot as it's been a huge aspect to why I've remained unemployed for so long and have felt such a decrease in emotional stability within the last two years. 

 For context, I just recently turned 18 and will be attending college starting in a few months, though my main concern is that I've never had health insurance and as a result have never had the opportunity to be properly evaluated for any mental disorders, which wouldn't be that big of a deal if it weren't for my family's extensive history with suicide attempts and depression among other things. Now, I do still struggle with negative thoughts and self harm-like behavior, but specifically relating to employment and my issues regarding work-ethic, anytime I've had a job it puts me at an emotional peak until my second or third shift. After these first few shifts I always find myself being more depressed than I have ever felt throughout my entire life. Wanting to kill myself, returning to more extreme forms of self harm, not being able to get the time of my next shift out of my head and wanting to run away from life are all common threads that employment holds for me. 

 Although, there is a catch. The few times I've been allowed to have an earbud in during downtime at a job have always returned me to a more level headed mentality temporarily. For some reason listening to my own music brings me back to my senses and relieves me of my less than okay mind-frame, at least for that short while. Of course, there comes a certain point where it no longer helps and that's usually when I'm at home. Regardless of what I do, once I'm employed it's like I am no longer an individual, I'm now nothing but an employee. This is something my younger sister who is now employed herself seems to not struggle with one bit, which leads me down an even deeper whole of inability to be an adult myself. 

 My mom used to tell me when I got my first job at sixteen years old that jobs were nothing more than a means to money, and that it's more or less impossible to enjoy what you do, no matter your age. She would also scoff at and mock my pleads to quit my first job because of my mental health issues. I used to believe her sentiment that I was just being lazy and child-like but now I feel as though it runs deeper than that. Especially seeing how my sister behaves with her job, she may feel tired sometimes and not want to go into work but she doesn't seem to be captured by it mentally.

(TLDR: I can't function at jobs, I start having extreme mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts/actions a few shifts into any job I've had. Music helps somewhat while working if it's my own personal chosen music, but I always get hung up on having to work again and being taunted by my mom for having mental health issues)

 I guess I just want someone's input, a direction, something. Either way, anything's appreciated."
1596,hypochondriac,"I struggle with anxiety and I am a hypochondriac , constantly I feel worried about my physical health , for example the thought of me having a disease have triggered panic attacks 
today I cried because I have a flue or something and I thought that I was having Covid symptoms and for a moment I thought this was real I was going to die 
the thing is yeah I have a flue but may as well be just a normal flue"
1597,Depression and anxiety make me immature,"When I was younger I was constantly told how I was very mature for my age. I was top of my class. Teachers loved me and I tried my best. I felt that I couldn’t relate to my peers because they were doing very immature things. I struggled with a severe panic disorder as well as depression. My childhood was spent through panic attacks and self injury. I often cared for others more than I did myself. 

I’m now 26 and feel very immature compared to people around me. I laugh at things that only children should laugh at. I love watching children’s movies. I am horrible at paying bills on time or keeping up with chores. I feel like younger me was more mature. 

I can’t figure out why this is. Am I just lazy? Have I decided I no longer care too much about others? I have let myself down in many ways in terms of life goals and expectations. 

Does anyone else feel this way? I feel my mental health stole my childhood and I’m stuck in coping with it."

1600,Questions about Voluntary Commission,"Hey everyone. 

I've been considering this for a long time and it's coming to a head. What happens if I voluntarily commit myself for psychiatric evaluation? I live in the US. What does it cost? How long is the hold? Can I still own firearms after? (Target shooting is a very zen/yoga type exercise for me.) Can I be involuntarily committed afterward? What if I'm actually crazy? Worse yet, what if I'm not? I can't keep living like this, but if I open the floodgates on my crazy to try to get treatment then what if I can't close them? What if my wife finds out something that hurts her? What if nobody can help me?

1601,Feel like a loser,"A little context here: I am a 19 year old student, studying in one of the most prestigious institutions of my country, India. I have always been a studious person and I've worked very hard to reach this college. But since I've been here, I've only felt burdened by the immense competition and toxicity. 

I'm in my freshman year right now, towards the end. And I see all my friends and classmates getting virtual internships, learning through e-resources, getting on a spree of completing online resources, while I do nothing, to be really honest. I have applied for many internships but didn't hear back from any. I feel like I'm not doing anything and I'm a complete failure. This is taking a toll on me. And I feel stressed and like giving up on a daily basis. This Corona lockdown has taken away the hopes I had with offline internships since I was hoping I'd get them. But seems like I don't deserve them. I feel very incompetent. And useless. And stupid and a failure. What do I do?"

Anyways with that in mind is it possible to be so angry that your body becomes numb to anger or to where you don’t feel anger like you should or does that not happen the same way.

I hope you can understand what i’m asking If anyone knows more of how it works please let me know   Thank you"

When  I'm watching stuff on YouTube, I feel content. Monday through Friday,  I'm easily irritated. I don't feel that I can focus on anything. Even  while working, I try to slack off a little and browse stuff.

Working hard in school hasn't done me any good. So I'd let my younger self do bad in school. And I'd make sure that I die before I reach where I am right now.
Ive been abandoned so many times that I can't even start new relationships, make friends or trust anyone. I hate everyone around me including myself. I've tried everything and nothing has worked so if I get a chance to relive my life, I'd stay away from everyone because I don't deserve love, care or affection.

1608,I am so scared,"I have been very scared of my health lately. On september 2019 i was told that i was a prediabetic and my BP is Going abnormaly high because of my lifestyle and i never really been fit (PS: I am 15 at that point). I heard all of this and it made me really scared to the point where i straighten up my life. That same year at may before all of this my father has been said to have gotten stroke and he is also diabetic. So you would see why i am was so scared hearing the news about my health. Months went by after i was diagnosed. I feel healthy like i have truly improved it was. I have lost weight i have been sleeping correctly i have been eating healthy. But then at January 2020 my aunt tested my bp out no where and the machine malfunctioned and showed me a bp that was high. We were all suprised because i dont feel anything that could mean i have a high bp i didnt feel dizzy, not did i feel like vommiting. They had me tested once again and it was normal. But weirdly at that moment that day i have never been so anxious about my health. I have doubled the jogging i do per day i also kept my eating to a minimal. Well after that incident i have mostly forgetten about it you know its still in my mind, it never left but i felt abit more confident that i didnt have anything wrong with me. March 2020 the after our Js Prom a random thought popped into my mind which was what if everything i did was useless and that i cant fix this what if i became like my father. I never did Alcohol i never smoked. That day scared me for 2 weeks straight, that i often see myself crying in the back of our classroom. My friend suggested that why not check my bp to the nurse we have. At first i was hesitant because what if my gut feeling was right but they convinced me and i did it. It was normal. At that moment i felt relief but that relief didnt last long. The very next day i went back there to want to check my bp with me crying becaude of fear and our nurse talked to me calming me down to the point where i truly convinced my self that it was all in my mind. The lockdown happend and i was careless i became to relaxed. I started sleeping 2 am and waking up 12 nn. I started being modest and forgetting my fitness because i had no way to jog i went to sit ups and squats which i have been doing but something i forget to do them and skip some days. With this in mind the sight of seeing my father everyday none stop made me think of alot of things like what if i was being to relaxed of my health whatif the things i do are being undone because of this lockdown because i have been careless. I have been anxious for 2 weeks now i have been exercising everyday but the sleeping habit i cant stop because everyday i think of things i say what if this what if that.
I have been so scared of myself my health that i think my mental health has been so damage that i cant think straight anymore. I cant eat normally . I lack sleep because i suddenly wake up to a thought or just a sudden urge to get up. I am so scared."
1609,My goal today was to not hurt myself with my own anger.,"TL:DR I suceeded today. 

Long ago I had problems managing anger. I would do things like slam my skateboard against a streetpole, go so fast I eat shit, or hit a car that would nearly miss me. I had to do something. The people driving those cars I slammed my skateboard into were dipshits... but I still wanted to respect their property. There was a 10-day headspace anger course. It helped, kinda. I gave up on day 7.

It def came back to bite my arse a few times too. I had tried day one again earlier today actually. One key thing I forgot was that anger(or frustration, or irritation, or impatience etc.) is just energy. I wish I could tell you how but it's hard to explain. So anyway, I got impatient and just started to breathe, paying particular attention to myself breathing out. Double whammy is that I probably would have checked people's stories to kill the impatience but nope. Just chilled there patiently.

Throughout various times of the day I got annoyed, irritated, and impatient but I didn't let those any emotions do me harm. Win."
1610,Statistically - seems I do not have long.,"I am completely left alone. Despite it not seeming that way (having some living relatives, etc.) I feel utterly abandoned. I have no friends, relationship or any real human contact anymore. It has been like this for now a very extended period of time. 

I am mentally and physically at the brink, and extremely weak.

No matter what I attempt to do - to better my state and situation - I fail miserably.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am thinking of it logically, having these odds against me and the reality of my situation - I will most likely not last much longer will I?

&amp;#x200B;

I have lost nearly all control over myself, the world has a pace too rapid for me, and I cannot cope and deal with the most simple of things - I do not see how someone can help me.

If there were to be anyone at all.

&amp;#x200B;

And I cannot help myself despite my constant attempts which only lead to more suffering, more anxiety, more depression, more self-hatred and more isolation.

Statistically - we are nearly 8 billion on this planet. I am sure there must be people like me.

I started cutting myself and I felt better for just a second it made me smile. But I felt pathetic right after. This used to be a trend among my friends but I thought it was stupid how everyone did it because everyone else did. Now I’m doing it, not only that, it’s like I’m LATE to the trend. It feels so pathetic. Now I just have cuts on my arm and I feel stupid for having them there. It was barely five minutes and now they’re there forever. I feel like a poser, why did I do this.

I can be in the best mood ever, and I find something stupid to get angry about and it ruins my whole day. Sometimes, I just get the feeling of “nothing”. Like I feel nothing, I don’t care about anything. I don’t know if this is caused by stress, anxiety. I don’t know. I don’t feel depressed or even sad a lot. I don’t have a good relationship at all with my mom, who I live with, and that causes a lot of stress. Help me please. Thanks guys"
1613,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,It has recently come to my attention that I have been being horrible to my friends and I don’t know why I didn’t realize it sooner.

They all said to me they feel they were being used and that I am abusive (which I see now) but I don’t know why I didn’t realize sooner and I don’t want to hurt them again but I also don’t want to lose them.

1614,"""Mental Health isn't an excuse to act shitty""","Yes it is! It doesn't mean it's okay but having mental health problems DOES make you act shitty.

It makes you more irritable.
It makes you cranky.
It makes you lash out at people.
Sometimes you go from ""I love you"" to ""I hate you"" so quickly. Then regret it. 
One minute you think everythings all good and then you crash.
Sometimes you feel numb.
Sometimes you just bawl your eyes out until it's nothing but dry sobbing, sometimes you run out of tears.

Of course we project it onto other people around us at times, we don't mean to, we know when we're being shitty, we can always control it but most of us are trying our best not to be.
A lot of the time, we focus on trying not to be shitty so everything gets bottled up and makes us worse in the long run.
We're sorry, we know it's not fair, we try our best not to be, sometimes it gets too heavy and we lose control though.

No one wants to feel like this, or act the way we do sometimes."

On top of that my family is facing a dilemma because of my uncle he's an alcohol and is my helper with taking care of my grandpa. But all he does is make everything worse.... 
I'm a care giver for my grandpa like I mentioned above and he just recently lost his wife/my Grandma two years ago and his dog on the 19th now he's even more depressed and refuses to take anti depressants..

Why do I do this, the smallest thing could be said or done and by the time I realized it I’ve flipped out and have my family looking at me like I’m crazy.  I bought sleeping medicine and have about 40 pills and alcohol that I’ve been saving for when I’ve had enough. I’ve come to realize that my relationships with the people around me are over the top like intense intense. I either love them or it feels like a switch and I hate them. After tonight’s fight I said some mean things to myself about a 14 year old.. A fucking 14 year old. I shocked my own self thinking about it after. Anyone else? This entire year has been a mirror in front of me and I fucking hate what I see. I’m feel like I’m out behind me watching myself freak the fuck out and there isn’t anything I can do about it... Maybe it’s time for professional help"
1617,I have some questions?,"Recently, I’ve been really paranoid. Well for like the past two months. But it feels normal at this point. I was in a deep sadness / depression (I wasn’t actually told I had depression so I’ll just call it a time of sadness), but I think I found a purpose of life. I’m not going to explain it, most people call it delusions but I just don’t think they really are understanding it. Only I can really know. Umm, my heads been all over the place for the past two months with conspiracies, which is why I won’t go to a therapist. It almost feels like I can’t stop thinking anymore, I hate it, but I also like it. It’s too hard to explain what I mean. But I think the worse part is I feel like someone is coming for me and monitoring me. That’s the worse part. But I also think maybe SOMEONE IS. I don’t want to see a therapist, they can prescribe me pills or something (maybe they won’t but just in case), and I don’t want the pills. Also, I don’t trust them very much (sorry). I don’t trust anyone actually, I don’t even know if anyone’s real! And these aren’t delusions, I mean, you can’t prove that their wrong. I don’t know, I guess I just need to tell somebody. Every else just blows me off, this is why I don’t trust people."
1618,What to do with friends?,"Hello. English isn't my native language, so I'm sorry for grammar.

I cut off my friends (4) because they were toxic (depressed and depressing and didn't want to do anything with it, gaming addicts and they're prefer to game than hang out). Yes, I was the same person, but I've started to deal with my problems.

Recently I'm feeling nostalgia and miss them. Quarantine has contributed huge part in it because I have no friends right now (don't know how to make online friends without games lol) and with everything closed it's hard to make some.  (Maybe it's an excuse though)

I've stopped relationships with them without fights or anything like that (though after very unpleasant actions toward me), just deleted social networks and changed phone number(not intentionally), so it will be easy to ""resume"".

Basically I'm lonely and need social relationships, but it will come with side effects like gaming, destroying habits I was building for months, possible depression-like state etc. 

I don't know what to do."
1619,I Just Want To Be Normal,"  Hi reddit, I am posting this at 3 a.m. because I don't trust myself that I will be willing/remember to post this in the morning. (Often I forget things and I think that's part of an escape mechanism but maybe that's for another day) I need some friendly advice from people I don't know because I feel like I don't get the help I need or don't listen to the advice from people who are close to me.
I just woke up from a very real dream and I don't know what to make of it. 

  Let's start off with what little I still remember. In my dream I was settling jewelry (which is my real job) at a store (not my store) and this gay couple came in named Jonah and Jonah. They came to look for wedding bands. I remember telling them ""wow, you don't find that very often. Especially for a white couple."" (I can't tell you why I said that, but I remember saying it). I also remember telling them something along the lines of ""I won't be here much longer"" or something indicating that I was about to quit or get fired.

 The other thing I remember was my boss and my Mom being there, I'm not sure but I think she was working there too. Well, they heard me say this and knew what I was about to do because they chased after me. (This is where I already forget how things happened) I think my boss was yelling at me to stay and maybe Mom was too? The last thing I remember was crying/screaming ""I just want to be normal!""

  Cut to now, I woke up and I felt my eyes were pretty wet, as if I was crying. I know that Jonah is from the Bible but I'm not super religious so I had to look up what he meant so I don't think that has any relation but it is weird because apparently he's the messenger of impending disaster? So now THAT'S on my mind.  But the feeling of wanting to be normal, that's been a recurring challenge in my life.

   Wanting to be normal is something I've struggled with for a long time. When I was younger I use to focus so hard on not having any feelings that I think it worked. I'm 27 now and every now and then I notice that I'm not actually feeling any genuine emotions a lot of the time, just what I think I should be feeling at the time. The only real emotions I feel are empathy with strangers(sometimes)  and getting annoyed easily which in not even sure is an emotion, I just kind of get easily bothered by little things and I've noticed it's usually when my girlfriend shows me extra love or wants me to love her. This becomes in problem in my relationship because I know I love my girlfriend but I don't actually feel it anymore. That's not to say I don't love her because I know she's is the greatest thing to happen to me in a long time, I just can't feel it. 

  My other issue I constant have is a struggle with thinking I have multiple personalities. I used to talk to myself a lot, in private, and I would be taking to any number of different sides of myself. Z, S, James, Alex, Victor. These are all other names I address myself as, all with their own way of speaking and accent (these are constants, there may be a random one from time to time). Every time I could talk to myself there would be a mirror so I could see myself or I'm in the shower (I can't more than 6 inches from my face without glasses) and I can't see anything. Surprisingly, I feel like after I get done talking to myself, that's when I know what side of me is at the wheel. The problem with this is that I usually lose that feeling of self quickly and revert back to oblivion.

  I realized that when I use marijuana I can actually get a firm grasp on reality, the problem here has that I don't use it as often as I should. Ever since I saw it as a medication for myself, I've gone months without using it partly because I use to smoke it a when I was younger and I felt myself get dumber and I don't want that to happen again. When I do self medicate, I use edible gummies we got in California back in September but that doesn't happen as often as it should. 

  So here I am, asking for your advice. I'm too afraid to see a psychologist/therapist/whoever despite having a close friend and an ex-girlfriend telling me I need to see one (I remember feeling hurt when they said that). Honestly I should use a throwaway account because I don't want my girlfriend to see this and bring this up. I just want the genuine advice of people who don't know me. My self diagnosis has been Sociopathic Tendencies along with Acute Bipolar Disorder. Thank you for taking the time to read."
1620,My name is Michael (vent),"I’m sat here on my bed on my birthday just thinking to myself, and all I think about is if I killed myself, how would I do it? If i used a gun, which angle? From the forehead to ensure a quick death or under the chin? My brain is racing and all I can see is my brains splattering over the wall. It’s weird because I was never and will never be suicidal. I don’t really even consider it an option. I feel like it’s kinda like something that’s in the back of my mind that would be  cool to have but impossible to obtain. It’s almost like I’m dreaming of these thoughts. I’ve been raised Catholic my entire life and recently became “atheist”. I know there isn’t anything left, and my biggest fear is death. I don’t even know where I’m going with this but i just had a shitty day. I’m sat here realizing that I am a failure as a person. I have no friends, I’m overweight, I don’t talk to anyone, I’m ugly, I don’t do anything, and I do shit in school... I have been pretty depressed for a while now. I’m extremely introverted, I get extreme social anxiety and it’s really hard for me to make friends. I maybe have one friend, and I don’t know if he really is my friend. I got no one to talk to, no one to love, no one to lean on... I’m all by myself. I’m lonely af. When I have those suicide thoughts, the only thing that turns those off is thinking of my future. I wanna be a successful lawyer, I wanna get married and have two boys. I feel like my dreams are unattainable. I just finished junior year of high school and all I get from my parents is “junior year is the most important year for colleges”. I get pretty shitty grades, always a below 3.0 average. I’ve kinda given up on my dreams of standing in court as a lawyer, living my dream. There’s no chance with the grades I have. I don’t know what to do with life. What’s going to drag me on? What is left for me to strive for. I’m sat here terrified of the future. I hate this world and I hate living in it. I feel like a total failure. A total waste of space. All I am is a fat glutton that gives nothing to the world. I don’t know what to do with life anymore. I’ve given up on everything. I’m really sorry for the shitty writing and structure, this is the only time I’ve ever spoken about anything to anyone, and it’s reddit haha"
1621,One of the hardest things when trying to recover from health issues is when the person who always told you “it’s ok” doesn’t tell you that anymore.,It’s broken my heart to not hear that from them when I need it most.
1622,Looking for coping techniques!,"Heya peeps. I’m Nikki from Maui and I have bipolar disorder. 

Without really going into what my specific issues are at the moment, I was just hoping to see what kind of coping mechanisms people have found helpful when it comes to distracting yourself from a person or an event, etc. I’ve really been considering mediation, but I fidget too much to sit still for long enough to get any real benefit. I’d love some helpful suggestions!  Thanks so much in advance."
1623,4:11 AM,"At 24 I am facing the truth: I am depressed and addicted to weed. I’ve used weed and sex to distract me from the fact I’m afraid. Im scared and insecure about my future. 

This is the first time I’ve discussed this.

I have been suffering from depression since 2015 &amp; the lockdown hasn’t been the best for my mental health. From antidepressants, therapy, &amp; drugs I’ve tried it all to escape my thoughts. I’ve hurt those closest to me because of my mood swings. I’ve made my loved ones cry because of my own personal demons &amp; I feel so terrible. In the moment I forget to think and it costs me every time. How can I be so stupid to hurt the very few who really love me? I’ve sabotaged romantic relationships because I expect them to end badly. I’ve been abusing marijuana for 4 years; alcohol for 2. 

I’ve made the decision to let the weed and alcohol go. I know the abuse is covering deeper issues. I just want to love again, prove to myself that I am worth it, that I am still a good person. 

Sorry y’all I felt the need to put my thoughts into the universe. Hopefully this way they’ll always find their way back."
1624,Everything gets put in a box so I dont have to face it,"I think I just want to know how common this is.

I (24f) have suffered from depression and anxiety for a long time. Its chronic and ""low grade"". I generally function fine because I have to and you wouldn't know there was anything wrong at all.

There were times when I couldn't handle myself well and external factors made it worse. Then I went through my first proper break up alone and back at my parents house, so I had to pretend everything was okay and box up my emotions. I was pretty messed up before but I could at least regulate my emotions (maybe why more people could see I was depressed).

Physically I got better, I lost excess weight I'd put on and I was doing all the normal social things that people do. Mentally I'm worse off now, I just didnt realise until yesterday.

I put things in a ""box"" in my head so I don't feel anything sad. Some days I wont react to a shitty thing that someone said or something bad that happened cos it's in the box. And other days, like today, I obsess over everything that's in the box. Self loathing etc, standard stuff lol.

On the outside everyone thinks I'm lovely and I am. I think I'm over compensating for how messed up I am. On the inside, I dont feel anything sad. I show externally what I'm supposed to feel but i dont mean it. If someone died I'd be like ""oh"" and that's about it. And that's pretty messed up. And then like I said, I'll randomly have days where I obsess over everything. It's sort of like an outlet before I go back to my ""normal happy self""

I know I'm going on a bit but just an example. My SO was really down yesterday. He told me how he doesn't love me (this isnt new news, we've been together a year and the whole things a long story) but I should've felt hurt and I just didnt care. But then today I feel low and maybe that's why but I just wonder why I didnt just deal with that emotion at the time?

I know that's a lot but does anyone else cope that way

Sorry about the grammar but I don't think anyone really cares"
1625,How do I feel good about myself after this??,
1626,I forget my feelings in the morning,"Why is it there are some nights I think about things and express how I feel about them and when I decide to make a decision about them the next day I tend to forget? I wake up and I sometimes I don’t even remember why I was feeling that way and when I do try to think about it I only remember minimal feelings and the stuff I told myself (I don’t express myself to anyone) I just know it upset me and that I had to do something but in the morning i feel like the way I reacted was maybe just me overthinking these and things are actually okay. But I also don’t know if that’s true bc what if they’re not and I’m just bottling them up and oppressing my emotions. It’s so back and forth and it’s so conflicting. I do overthink things but I also bottle things up and push things down. I don’t try to express my emotions to anyone and when I try, to the point aka my feelings doesn’t get across fully or just miscommunication. I don’t know how to help myself but I really wanna grow. Does anyone have any input? If you need any info feel free to ask"
1627,Random suicidal thoughts?,"Everything is fine with my life, nothing traumatic has ever happened to me but for some reason I'm just sad. I think about ending it, at random moments, just so this constant feeling of sadness stops but then I remember that that'll destroy mentally my parents and everyone that's close to me. These thoughts make me even more sad. 

What is this ?"
1628,"Money is always the problem, it's always in the back of our minds.","My job is making me feel depressed, I stand there all day and do the same thing, heavy lifting, smiling, standing back behind the screen. I want to be passionate about something, I want to feel like I have a future instead of being afraid of it. I've been working this job for 9months, and hearing all the people that are my age talk about what they're doing in school, it makes me feel useless. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. 

I called in sick to work today because I just couldn't do it, I've been struggling with just getting out of bed because of how emotionally exhausted I am, I got home from work yesterday and just cried. I told my parents I didn't have work but they knew I was lying, so they asked me to come down stairs and my step dad basically gave me a lecture on why I need to work for money, money, it's always money.

My family has always struggled with it, what's the difference in me quitting my job? None of my money goes towards them, only £20 for the gas and electric. I know they're just trying to help, but I don't want to be stuck in a job that makes me so miserable, and it's not just the job, honestly my co-workers are amazing, it's just ME. I'm so miserable and I just want it to stop. 

I don't really talk much, but when I do try to talk about it I'm just told that money is what I need. Honestly fuck money, I fucking hate it. I've been thinking about suicide more and more these past months and it's starting to feel like a valid option. I'll I've done in my life is struggled with my mental health and it's not worth it when this world is so riddled with corruption. I'm 18 in a month, at least I'll die an adult so it won't be so sad. 

I'm so sick of trying to do what's ""right"", what's ""right"" in this world anymore? We have so many opinions, the controversy is only getting bigger and social media is turning people into these plastic money makers. I don't even know what I value anymore, I was so sure of it before but now my mind goes blank. Somebody please help me."
1629,How do I recover?,"Hello. I am an 18 year old female. I got out of a year and a half long abusive relationship about a year ago. I was scrolling through Tik Tok and I saw someone who looked just like him. He even smirked like him, winked like him. I was rushed back to when I was in that relationship. I remember how I feared him. I remember the way he made me feel. How do I recover? I don't want to go back to this. I'm shaking so bad right now. I am probably going to have nightmares again about him. He was my first ""love"". He manipulated me to think I needed him. I was almost going to marry him. I just want to heal."
1630,I don't know what's going on,"Hello, idk if this is my first post here but i just wanna share what i feel. It's okay if no one will read this. Right now we are still under quarantine, i can't go to work since the transportation here is not yet operating. The thing is i have anxiety and it got worse because of the situation we are in. I want to learn new things/skills but no matter what i do i can't stick to doing things and i really lack motivation. Almost all of the people i know in my surrounding are good at something, while me? None. I no longer know what to feel. I can't even last a conversation through messaging apps and i sense that some of my friends really do see me as a toxic person. I don't really know what's going on to me."
1631,I just can‘t remember things or concentrate,"I suffer from depression and (social) anxiety. I don‘t know if this might be the cause of my cognitive problems but right now I just feel so dumb and disabled. 

I can‘t focus in university. Now we have online classes and it‘s the same, if not even worse so it can‘t be because of the social anxiety and the people present in the room (which could have been the case in present uni classes before corona). I just can’t follow the tasks, topics and what the docent says. After classes I just don‘t know anything we talked about or what the topics were. I don‘t remember at all. Same with books, movies, conversations and overall experiences in life. I just don‘t remember them. I can‘t tell you what the book was about, what exactly happened in the movie, what we talked about in a conversation and what I exactly experienced two days, two weeks or two months ago. 

I can‘t live like that. I can‘t learn new things, I read self improvement books or just some intelligent topics to learn about but then I don‘t even remember and it‘s like I never read them at all. In university I can‘t follow and work on the topics and tasks. It‘s very very hard for me. This also goes a lot on my grades and motivation to do something. I‘m in fourth semester of psychology now but I only remember like maybe 10% from semester 1-3. How should I be a good psychologist or student like that not remembering anything anymore? My cognition seems to fall apart and it takes much of my life quality. In conversations I don‘t know anything to talk about increasing my social anxiety as I can‘t remember any topics because I don‘t remember what I did some days ago, what I experienced when I was on holiday in for example Italy, what I read in that book or happened in that movie that might be interesting for the conversation and person I‘m talking with. In almost every life situation it‘s important to maintain focussed and later remember things you experienced or read/heard about.

What can I do? Why did my cognition turn that bad (memory/concentration/thinking issues)? It wasn‘t always like that. I think this slowly started like 3/4 years ago which also is the time when I really began experiencing severe depression and strong anxiety and social phobia. So there might be a connection. But I‘m not sure that those depression and anxiet problems might go away anyday so what do then?

Does or did anyone experience the same? And what could you do against this? What was the cause? I really can‘t live like that and I feel so dumb and unable to function. That again worsens my depression as I have severe future anxiety and self worth issues because of that. How might I be able to get my university done, work and maintain someday in a job and such things. Also other people recognized that I can‘t focus and remember things or think straight. And some get annoyed by that. That again worsens my social anxiety.

Thanks guys for everyone who read thus far. I really need help. :/"
1632,desperate to find the cause of this new horrendous feeling,"this is super weird and it just started like two days ago but, out of nowhere it feels like i’m waiting for someone to scream in my ear. the feeling last for a while but i know it’s not going to happen and it never does. i’m so confused and i absolutely hate how it feels, i tense especially in my ears. does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? i dont have auditory hallucinations, but this is really stressing me out. i suffer from diagnosed depression, anxiety and dpdr if that helps."
1633,What is wrong with me?,"What is wrong me, why everybody talk and hang with me but no one really gives a shit in my hard times, everyday just by myself, thinking too much about what if  and what would happen if I just won't be here. No one never asks me how I feel, what I want. There is no one I can trust anymore, I've fucked up to ever be what I was or wanted to be. I already accepted the fact that when I will grow up I will be alone, sometimes, in my dreams I can just see myself on the streets sleeping, having no one and nothing. Anyone I become close friends always gets hurt and hurting me. 

I really had to write this down somewhere, sorry for taking much of your time.

1634,"My experience, aspirin is really helping my anxiety and irritability","NOTE: I am not diagnosed with social anxiety, but it is a smaller symptom of my diagnosis.

My mom used to give me baby aspirin for my headaches when I was a kid, which is the dose they use for people with heart problems. My mom always had some sort of pain reliever because my family runs on morning coffee like gasoline, so she would use Aleve I think. I stopped taking the baby aspirins because they stopped helping the headaches from being older, which I had no idea.

I've begun taking a stronger dose of aspirin when I thought about that. I started taking Excedrin that has caffeine and aspirin in it. You're only supposed to take two a day, so I went ahead and experimented with OTC caffeine tablets and 325 mg aspirin tablets. When I tried the caffeine, it was working on headaches but did not get rid of the crappy feeling I would get. The aspirin since then has always seemed to work really good though... I tried to stop taking it regularly, but the caffeine wasn't getting rid of this nasty feeling I get in my head.

It is helping my anxiety so much. About the same time in the day I get really nasty, and it starts even when I wake up. I stopped taking the aspirin for a while, and I felt a lot better when I tried to use the aspirin again after a couple weeks. I would say I'm more careful about things when I take it. And with my age and the health problems I'm running into, it helps a bit with the body aches. I try not to take the max dose, but I know I feel pretty good throughout the day when I do that.

FYI what I buy are 325 mg tablets, for people interested. Baby aspirin is pretty available, I could only find two different bottles of the higher dosage. Aspirin has been used for headaches for eons, so it's one of those things that is so cheap that they make you buy a lot."
1635,Is there an issue of biploar disorder and consumption of cannabis?,"Hey yo, so recently i found out i'm on the bipolar spectrum, and also i'm a smoker for some years now. I can definitively say that smoking pot didn't trigger the disorder, it did not pave the way for it to grow, many years ago i was in counseling for being ambivalent and even with the use of cannabis, it didn't get worse. I think i developed the disorder because of the great distress i was and still am under for the past years and will be under for some following years. My upbringing was kinda rough and i always lacked support from home, so if i want to make something, i gotta do it myself. That always put hella pressure on me.
What has always helped me though is smoking a good fatty in the evening after getting my shit done, to calm down, mute the rush of thoughts etc. 
Now that i found out i'm not just ambivalent but actually became bipolar, i did some research to find out if smoking weed could worsen the disorder (because sometimes i'm really fucking close to the edge and definitively dont want to fuck myself up).

So the research was really bipolar itself which was kind of funny. There seems to be too little reliable studies are being done, some showed that in the depressed episode smoking can help, some showed it makes it worse with mania or can even trigger manic episodes, although that has never happened to me. I mainly smoke to be able to fall asleep and to calmy be able to analyze my rush of thoughts. 
What i thought was interesting is that a study from norway (i think, not 100% sure) found out that bipolar people who constantly smoke, on a daily, were mostly able to resort their thoughts better, their memory improved and their depression got managable. 
I feel well represented by that, but i know there are many people with the disorder who simply can't roll with pot. 
So i wanted to see what other people with the disorder would say about it? 
Doesn't really matter if you're a smoker or not, if you suffer from bipolar disorder, would you give me your thoughts on it? 
Does it make sense that it can improve your mental health and why? Or if not, why not? How do you practice your habits to help yourself when shit gets hard again?

Ok so i'm sorry if this all seems really unorganized or hard to understand, i'm not foreign in this language, so please be kind :)"
1636,I don't know how to ask my doctor about my mental health,"For at least a year now, I've been feeling I have some type if mental illness. I want to ask a doctor about it, but I don't have one due to moving and coronavirus. My mom has serious mental illness and so does my brother. I'm not sure about my dad. I can assume he has depression, but he's just keeping it a secret or doesn't take it seriously. When I go to my doctor, for a yearly check up. I want them to ask me about my mental health, because then I'll know they actually care and won't judge me for asking (I know it's stupid, but I still just can't do it) I'm a male and 15 and I live in America. I either need to know how to ask my doctor or if my doctor will ask me (I really hope it's the ladder) I've been ""self diagnosing"" which I know isn't useful, but I feel like I need to know. I don't think I actually have anything, I'm probably just doing it for attention. I just need clarity"
1637,I NEED HELP! My sister is showing signs of mania and possibly early psychosis and I do not know what to do,"Alright basically, a little over 6 months ago I was admitted to a male adult mental ward when I was 17 because I had an extreme episode of manic psychosis. I tried to stab my dad because I thought he was possessed, I saw angelic spirits etc etc. my sister is 14 and just recently she has started showing extremely obvious signs of dillusions and early psychosis. She believes that Jesus is visiting her at night and is having visions of religious figures and claims that she can talk to god. Having been through psychosis myself, I can CONFIRM that she is definately on her way to becoming fully manic and although she isn’t there yet, I am extremely worried by the behaviour I’m seeing from her. I have an even younger sister who is 9. She is already traumatised from seeing me go through my psychosis so both my parents are experiencing heavy anxiety and aren’t sure whether it’s a good idea to send her to a mental hospital, or keep her home and try to look after her here. My dad and I are against sending her to a ward because when I went there it fucked me up way more and I came out of hospital traumatised myself. Please I REALLY NEED HELP! Should we allow the doctors to take her in to the mental ward or take our chances and try to look after her at home? My family and I really desperately need some advice. She has not shown any signs of aggression towards my parents or myself like I did but her dillusions are really scary anyway. She is creating drawings of these visions and of the figures she is seeing at night. She also randomly starts singing worship songs for no reason and honestly I’m really fucking scared. I don’t know what to tell her or how to treat her and If anybody could give me any advice AT ALL it would be much appreciated. 

Also if anybody cares enough or wants to message me one on one that would be much appreciated to I’m freaking out honestly and my parents are even more anxious then me. 

My Snapchat is ~ herangi234
If you want to add me and we can talk more about what I should do and just advice in general I’m pretty shaken. Again, any advice is appreciated &lt;3"
1638,I HOARD DATA. I want it gone.,"I think its a mild case of OC. I like hoarding data. Softcopies especially and putting them into categorized libraries within my harddrives. I collect books, comic books, pictures, wallpapers, texts, and sadly, porn.

I realized these past few days that the quarantine has me doing stupid shit on the net again and one of that is hoarding data that i like. I don't want to be too specific here but I got hooked on finding a deleted post here on reddit and asked all commenters of the post if they've saved it. It was a picture.

I have this damn nagging inside my head that keeps on wanting to revisit that picture. For the most part, I think I want to save it because its gone. It's a rarity. No one will ever get it again. That might be the driving force behind this. I like collecting stuff. Bits of sata off the net that I'll find useful or something that I like looking back on and can say to myself that this is my collection. I'm probably the only one who has it.

To the point that I asked other redditors if they had saved it, I realize that seemed pathetic.

1642,I'm having issues.,"Hi. Im not very used to reddit, i hardly use it and when i do, i never post anything. But im sort of at my wits end. I have friends i could talk to, but i dont want to burden them too hard. Some of them know, but im tired of spilling my shit onto others.

I should probably explain whats going on.

My life is really shit. Or maybe it isnt, its just that i dont enjoy life. Its a thought i've been having for a few months now... though i've probably been feeling it for years. I dont think i want to live anymore. I dont really have a will strong enough to continue. There are only two things keeping me here; 1. The fear of death. 2. The people i might hurt by committing suicide. The things that burden me, when put into perspective against many others on here, seem somewhat pityful, but hell if thats what people think i can always delete this post and forget i ever did this. I guess i'll get specific. Theres alot, buckle in.

My family hate me. I have no doubt on that. I get told multiple times a week that im going to be kicked out, homeless. That im an accident, and i should never have been born. That my birth is a deep regret. My original parent's divorce was blamed on me immediately after, and maybe that had some effect on me. Idk. Its still blamed on me now. But i haven't felt any care for them in years. I dont last remember when someone last loved me. Thats the bit that hits the hardest. Its like i've forgotten what love feels like, in all forms. One day a few years ago i stopped talking to my dad, he got engaged with a woman after a month of knowing her, and i knew some things about her that were less than reputable. I guess it made me mad. I haven't talked to him since. I want to, but im scared that he'll feel betrayed, or maybe we'll be different and wont be able to connect anymore. Im scared i'll cut ties with him again. But anyway, my home life is miserable. I used to look forwards to college just so i could be away from them. I never leave my room because i know the only thing that will come from it is chores or arguments. Never a... 'how are you', or anything like that. Though i suppose im no better. We fight often. Sometimes it's physical. My mother's boyfriend is usually the one to escalate it to physical violence, but sometimes its her. I can atleast say i have never myself been the first to initiate that. Hah, even now, as i type this, there is an argument going on. Sometimes i wonder if its them thats delusional or me. I cant tell anymore. **As a genuine question, is this how households are? I dont know myself, but on media they always seem so loving and nice, and sometimes i witness this in my few friends' families... But i dont have that. How are normal families? Or is this normal?**

Speaking of love. There's a girl i like. I'll call her 'N', using those kinds of codes seem to be a trend on reddit, so allow me to try fit in. I dont know if its love, because as i said, i think ive forgotten what love is, if i ever even knew. It feels kind of like... a tight chest? Its a happy feeling i guess, lets me forget about everything thats going on. She's great. I met her through being put in the same work group as her, in a class she doesn't want to be in. I'd noticed her before, and whilst im not so optimistic to believe in 'true love' or whatever, it was a pretty big coincidence as i'd taken a quick liking to her before we'd ever even spoken. Anyway. When i met her, it didnt take long for us to get close. Maybe a week? If we even are close... i dont know anymore. But i'd found out around that time that she liked a boy. It kind of hurt, but i sorta just wanted her to be happy more than anything so i helped her get with him. It eventually worked, but ended up in him being pretty selfish. I guess maybe he was confused, but they didnt really connect. He just stopped talking to her. Before that, i'd told myself that i wouldn't hope for anything romantic with her. Any time i've ever thought i had a chance of getting what i want, it usually doesnt work. I've had that train of thought for a while; If i just dont hope for anything, i can never be disappointed. It admittedly works, but its also pretty depressing. Anyway after that i decided that she needed help, so i gave the best i could. She didnt have friends anymore so i spent every day i could with her to keep her company. We got really close. She told me of a time three men sexually assaulted her, and probably would have raped her had she not screamed for someone's attention. It made me so angry. One of them even goes to the same college as us. I've honestly never been so mad at something i've only been told about. She's honestly the sweetest person i think i've met, i cant imagine how some sick fuck could try that with her. Another time, specifically on valentines day, a man was following her through the streets. I sat on call with her until she felt safe, got her to tell the staff at a shop she were at about him. I guess after trying to help her through that, it made me see how puny my troubles are... And yet i crumble to them so hard. It made me feel pathetic, i suppose. This girl who's been through all this is sitting infront of me smiling, and i waste my life away laying in bed and playing video games because of some stupid desire for love. I guess maybe thats why i cant help but pursue her. She has mental issues. Big ones i dont know how to deal with. She says she see's stuff, like demons i guess. I've seen her distress when its happening, and it aches when i cant do anything to help her. I try make her laugh like i usually do, but sometimes it doesnt work. Makes me feel a bit useless. But anyway, since the lockdown, we dont talk much. I think thats just because there isnt much to talk about at the moment, so i hope after its lifted, we'll return back to talking most of every day. Sometimes my mind worries about how it will go. If im getting to hopeful? But i procrastinate on acting on those thoughts. 

During all this, one of my friends died in a freak car accident. I'd skipped college the day it happened, simply because i were unmotivated. I could've seen him before it happened, maybe the whole 'butterfly effect' would've saved his life. Who knows. We weren't tremendously close, but i did everything i could to help. I helped set up a gofundme which raised a total of £3,700 for the funeral. That felt nice, like i'd helped. But i dont think it helped with my mental state, ultimately. He had so many friends, and such a bright future ahead. And it were all gone in an instant. In a round about way, i guess it might have put me off suicide a bit. Because i knew that how that felt for me, and that perhaps someone would feel like that if i'd died.

I think a part of why i have trouble with love is because of an incident a while ago, where i thought i'd fallen for a girl. I wont go into detail, because its not really needed, but know that it ended up in the girl dating my best friend instead, and me self harming for the first time. I guess everything had built it, from family to school. They still date, but im over it now. He's still my best friend - he cant help who he loves, and i respect that. He's still the best guy i've ever had the luck of knowing.

Another issue i have; I doubt my own brain now. Its somewhat of a rabbit hole ive been in, though even now im conscious of it, i still cant escape it. Its this doubt i have of everything... I guess i cant trust anything, not even myself. Even when i write this, i dont know if im looking for help, or just seeking pity. If anything im saying is real, or fake. Even THAT seems like im pointing it out, for pity. See what i mean? I can never be 100% on whether my friends actually even like me, or if its just because they feel sympathy for my loneliness. Perhaps they couldn't face the guilt themselves if they abandoned me? Some people are too nice for their own good, i guess.

I dont know where my future is going. I've spent an extra year in college because i picked the wrong path for me - something that coincidentally, N is experiencing too. A cool coincidence, i guess. It brings is closer i think. At first, i wanted to go for a safe, job guaranteeing career, and do my hobbies and loves on the side. So i took engineering, electrical to be specific. It was a drag. I hated it, and i couldnt learn it. So, after that year i thought i'd grown wiser or something. I thought that i cant really learn if i dont WANT to learn. So, i decided i'd turn what i love into my potential career. I've taken studies in games design, and creative computing (like coding and games dev stuff). I think if i succeed, i'll go to a university i know of which hosts a real successful class of games development - if i make it that far before giving up on life. Though i dont know if i have what it takes. The games industry is so competitive, and honestly, i dont know if im better than the average, if even as good as the average. I have a passion and i know that. I really love games, they influenced my life so much because i didnt really have anyone else to connect to. They taught me many lessons, and told me many stories; i want to be proud to say i have involvement in a beautiful project. To be able to point my name out in the credits. I guess its a dream of mine - to bring an experience like that to the world. But where theres optimism, theres 100x the pessimism. I dont think i realistically will succeed. But im in what i've been told is a 'dangerous mindset' right now, of ""fuck it, i'll give it a go, and if it doesnt work i'll just kill myself"". Seen that show 'Afterlife' on netflix? It sorta feels like i have his 'superpower'.

I guess i'll end it on somewhat of a bombshell, though really, you could've figured it out by now. I dont really want to be alive. I'm not all... 'woe is me' about it, i just dont think i enjoy life. The concept of it isnt appealing, and the reward is so little compared to both risk and effort. Maybe thats just my experience, but its what i feel. People tell me 'itll get better' but ive waited since i was 13-14 and now im 18 but still, its only gotten worse. As morbid as it sounds, if there were a time that i didnt have any person that had any possibility of caring, or a way of removing that care from everyone... I'd probably already be dead by now. I dont live for myself, i live to not hurt others. And i hate it.

I know this post was way long, and probably a badly structured rant. I dont know if anybody is going to bother reading through this, but if you do, i seriously appreciate it. You dont know me, my life has no affect on you, and yet you took the time to read through. Maybe you even gave some advice, kind words, idk. I understand aswell, that im not exactly a silver tongue. Maybe all this looks like for some cry for attention. Maybe it is. I can't know anymore.

Thanks again for reading if you did. Im not expecting advice, i moreso want to just have somewhere to spill on this. I could continue venting for pages, frankly. But i doubt anyone has the time. This is kinda the short version, haha."
1643,going back to therapy! help I am feeling anxious,"hi. so ever since the pandemic outbreak I have obviously stayed home. During this time I started therapy with a new therapist over the phone and now I am going back to have my therapy session face to face. I have done this several times earlier with other therapists, but for some reason I am extremely more anxious and almost feel sick by the thought of meeting my therapist and speaking in person for some reason. It wasn’t easy before, but bearable and I was able to go through with it. Now it feels like such a humongous task that I cannot go through with. Help, I don’t know if the fact that I have stayed at home (isolated from almost everyone except from my family) has made social situations a even more difficult than before.

I always try to fo certain task like play games on my computer with friends and do some photography, but it only seems like everytime I play on my computer I feel so werid afterwards and I feel even more disconnected with myself than before. My biggest fear is that since I'm so used to being disconnected what if my body could never go back to a normal state and I would feel like this for the rest of my life.

I'll start: My closest attempt was in high school. I took a bunch of pills after a really bad beating from my mom. I was in bed for a week, my mom never called an ambulance or anything.  I don't know if it was the pills or the beating but it was the worst week in my life. I could barely eat, the water tasted bitter, I honestly waited to die. My life was miserable, we were poor, my mom was beating me daily, everyone expected so little of me they tought I was gonna find an abusive dude, marry him and have a bunch of kids by the time I was 18. Fast forward about 10 years, I have a great 6 years relationship,  a 2y/o so smart and great I am baffled by her every second of my life, a decent job, gone through therapy, over all I managed to create pretty good life for myself. If only that 14y/o knew what life had in store for her... So yeah, I am pretty happy with the fact that those pills didn't do the trick.  What about you?

TLDR : I tried to kill myself and I am happy it didn't worked out.

1646,How to communicate with delirious ex,"My (M28) girlfriend (F27) of 2 and a half years broke up with me two weeks ago after she was struggling massively with her mental health for a long while as she needed to go it alone. We split on good terms and I still care about her deeply. I received a call from one of her family members a week ago to let me know she had been admitted to a mental hospital. 

I'm now receiving lots of messages from her which don't make much sense whatsoever, thanking me for things I've never done, talking to herself and being generally delirious. I have absolutely no idea how I should communicate with her here - should I tell her she's being delirious or should I ignore those messages and focus on how she is making herself better? Is there any accepted practice for how best to communicate with someone in this state? I've been trying to message saying I'm looking forward to seeing her once she's better etc without mentioning the messages which don't make sense, but I'm worried that ignoring these isn't the right thing to do.

1650,Death thoughts...,"Hi everyone!
I would like to share some of my thoughts, a couple of advise if is possible, or just hear some similar stories....
I am 22 years old and I have had depresssion and anxiety almost my entire life. I've been in treatment since I was 14 yo and went with a few therapists but none of them were of great help. Since I can remember, most of the times I just want put an end to everything, the easy way, I am not afraid to die, but the thought of the burden that I will cause to my family after  my death have always stopped me somehow and the only time I was able yo do something I fail. My mind is like a rollercoaster; I can be happy, in peace, but even in these moments I feel like death is the best path for me...
In my last episode of depression something inside of me broke, I can't remember  things that I learned in classes after the semester ends and that make me feel like crap..
IDK how to explain the death feeling, I keep trying my best but that thought always catches me...
I don't know nothing anymore.
There's a lot more but I think that's enough. Thanks for reading c:"
1651,I cried in the shower ( I know soo dramatic 🙄),"I’ve been emotionally distant nowadays, and my anxiety hit a whole new level. I was in the shower and my insecurities made me think about my girl cheating, how I don’t have friends and how I can’t trust people. I realized how lonely and sad I am in the inside and how I don’t have anyone to talk to. This made me sad and I cried in the shower."
1652,Feeling super good during the day and extremely depressed the evenings,"Hi everyone, I’m not sure where i should have posted this so I’m sorry if I’m on the wrong subreddit.

**Background story**

I started some new medication recently including Lamotrigine, that is supposed to help regulate my mood. I’ve been depressed as a teen between 15 and 19, and on antidepressant for 6 months (January 2019-July 2019). before stopping because it made it worse. 

My depression got better after I stopped for some reason, but then anxiety kicked in. I would get panick attacks, I’d be thinking that everyone hates me, thinking they all lie and stuff, ... 

Anyway, I got diagnosed with ADHD recently and anxiety disorders, so I’m on both adhd medication and Lamotrigine. The ADHD medication help me to focus and feel a bit less anxious during the day. I didn’t take Lamotrigine long enough to see a difference in my mood. 

**My current problem :**

Since 2 weeks now, I’ve been feeling super good the mornings : confident, happy, motivated, ... and extremely down the evenings : feeling worthless, crying, thinking I shouldn’t exist, ... 

I don’t understand what’s going on. I haven’t felt depressed like this in almost a year. But at the same time I haven’t felt that good during the day in a very long time.

Has anyone experienced that ? I’m kinda lost :("
1653,"""Living vicariously"" through someone; can someone explain this to me if possible? Extreme codependency?","I know of some who ""lives vicariously"" through someone to the point of absurdity; his entire self-image seems to be based on his brother. He presents himself to people he doesn't know as X's brother, that's how blurred the line between his identity and that of his brother appears to be on the surface.

I don't know how to explain this, but I have some ideas. A lack of boundaries possibly? Is Vicarious narcissism a thing? He seems to do it in for the intentions of impressing people.

The thing is, this man has completely ruined his life through this behavior. He's completely co-dependent on his brother financially and has never had a job. It's extremely damaging to the person doing the vicarious living, as they never seemed to develop a personality or life at all. It's actually incredibly sad.

Has anyone else experienced this? It's a rarity, I have only seen it in one person and I'm sure it is a rare but serious mental health issue. 

My bets would be that it's a manifestation of extreme codependency. What do you people think? 

Thanks in advance."
1654,Throwing everything away.,"I had a severe panic attack yesterday and I called an ambulance. My sister got mad at me and I tried to wake her before I called but she didn't end up getting out of bed and helping me. I thought I was having a stomach aneurysm or a stroke. It was one of my worst panic attacks ever. My mom got mad for calling. I think I gave my entire family the Corona virus. I feel so terrible for calling but I really really thought I was gonna die yesterday. My sister called me crazy and yelled at me when I was holding on to her for dear life. Anyway, I feel like I've been an abomination and my family has said that I've been making their lives hell. I tried to starve myself yesterday and not eat but eventually caved later on. I was crying a lot yesterday and I just really want to die. I ripped up all my posters in my room and bagged all of my items except for stuff in my closet. I have bags for all my family members and the rest is going to those red bins for other people. I don't deserve anything. I deserve death. I deserve to rot. I have hurt my family so much with my issues. I almost killed my mom when I was born and I gave her a heart attack twice. I am a burden and I'm the poison in my family. Theirs only one way to get rid of the problem and that's it's source, which is me. I should've never been born. I'm also too pussy to off myself. I just want to be punished so bad and I want to live in the jungle or something. I should be treated like a slave or less then an animal. My issues are gonna kill my family and I need to go away before it happens. My sister says I'm fucking up all their lives. She said she's gonna move out because she can't stay with us any longer.

1657,How has your mental health been affected?,"I got furloughed at the end of March, so a month and a half of being housebound. The first week was the obvious lounge around the house watching films (the whole marvel series for me) and eating my weight in biscuits, chocolate and ice cream. 

I've tried to keep proactive and busy with computer games, paint by numbers and catching up on cleaning/laundry to keep my nagging brain at bay, but it's gotten to the point where I can't ignore it so end up walking around the house looking for things to do but not doing anything! 

I'm so bored. Motivation even on a sunny day whilst the dog is crying to go out is so hard to muster up! I haven't showered in 3 days, because even that has gotten boring! 

The front garden needs cleaning, my mum sorted the privacy bush out, and showed me the power washer- going outside, even to the front garden is a chore. 

I have a history of depression, and I know that being a furloughed bum and being housebound is a bad mix. 

I can't decipher if I'm being lazy, or having the feeling of going down the steepest roller coaster in the world in my tummy is whats stopping me from doing anything other than lay on the sofa pondering and listening to stupid overactive thoughts. 

I'm not eating, or showing the slightest interest in basic hygiene. I won't say that I can't do anything, because I know that there are tonnes of things to do. I just..don't know what's stopping me. 

I've had thoughts of hiding in my room, which I know is a massive trigger for my depression..if I end up in my room I won't come out for months, weeks if I'm lucky and that's the last thing I need, so I've put off redecorating it to keep me out..as its not currently a room that I would spend my day.

1662,Obsessing over finding favourite takeaway mug that's been missing for I don't know how long.,"So I have this issue where I uncontrollably obsess over things that have gone missing, and this particular takeaway mug is the latest in a long line of things I have misplaced over the years. Simply thinking about where it could be irritates me and it makes me anxious, to the point of sleeplessness and a depressed state of mind. I don't know if this is a thing or I'm just being weird.
 
Read on for rambling rant thing, or scroll for the TL;DR.

I LOVE this mug; it's leak proof, it has a removable tea infuser, I can change the design to suit my fancy, it's super easy to clean (nowhere for mould to hide!), and it has 'Foxtrot Uniform, Charlie, Kilo' written in list format (default design that came with the mug). It also cost me $17, which is a lot more than what I would normally pay, but I made an exception for this cheeky thing. I didn't use it often, so it's difficult to even pinpoint roughly the last time I saw it.

When did I last use it? Where did I last take it? Is it at my parents', packed away in some storage box when mum was cleaning the house? Is it at a mate's? Have I left it at a campground? Have I left it at the holiday house? Did it get stolen from the cupboard during an open inspection at my old house? Or did that absolute C**T of an ex-housemate steal it before she moved in June last year? It wouldn't be the first thing she's quietly pilfered my belongings and attempted to pass them off as her own, although, I distinctly recall thinking 'good, it's still here' at some point in the last year, I think.

TD;LR: This particular incident has been going on since early March, the longest 'anxiety search' by far. Does anyone else obsess over finding missing things like this? Can anyone give me any pointers on how to manage the obsessive tendencies? Much appreciated 🙏"
1663,"Mother might be schizophrenic, help me.","Hey guys, I need some advice on how to approach my mother better. She’s always been very strangely aggressive and would change facts in the middle of conversation, and sometimes straight up invent events that people around her did. I never thought of the possibility of her being schizophrenic and I just thought she was too “damaged” by people in her life.

But her freaks out would happen in periods that we could predict, so we knew that almost every Saturday she would probably make up something that we did and fight with us until we apologize for something that never happened.

One time I was about 8 years old and I just finished watching spongebob before going to bed with my brother. Our mother told us we should get ready to sleep at a specific time, I don’t remember the exact time but it was closer to 9:30. It was still only 8:30 and she would tell us that it’s already way past our bedtime.

She started freaking out, yelling and fighting and turning really red, she did this until it was actually too late for us and then blamed us for still not sleeping. Then she took out chairs to the hallway, sat us down, took a knife and told us to now not fall asleep because otherwise she would cut us into pieces. As a punishment for not listening you see.


However as of lately I have gotten Into reading about schizophrenia and I think that my mother might have some type of it.

My father passed away recently, my mother never wanted us to be in contact with him as she saw him as the worst enemy, however he was very sick and about to die so I gave him a last visit without telling my mother, because I knew she would just freak out, besides that my dying father didn’t want me to tell my mother about his condition either.

She found out somehow, and accused me and my brother of working behind the scenes with my dad to destroy her. This became an intense situation that is going on till this day, she never knew that he was about to die, just that I saw him. She told friends of hers about this and I got several violence threats along the lines of 

“how dare you destroy your mother like this”

“ your mother is now Ill because of you and if something happens you’ll pay, and I’ll make sure of that” - kinda things 

Well eventually she found that that he passed away and stopped with this accusation, however yesterday when I talked to her she completely fabricated things.


Previously she had written a letter to herself that my dad apparently gave her in person, remember, my dad lived about 150 miles away from her and was lying in bed without the ability to move. She denies writing the letter herself, but I know that it is her handwriting.

She fabricated a claim that I apparently made to her, which is something I would never say, about talking to my sister instead of my mother on Mother’s Day and rubbing it into my mother. I was shocked when she told me this because there’s no way I did that.

As the talk went on she started hysterically freaking out about us “not wanting her” and “being against her” at this point she stopped listening to me entirely and just starts shouting and yelling.

and then she dropped the bombshell on me, “oh I see you guys are fulfilling your dads last order, that is it?!? Isn’t it? His order to completely destroy me.”

I asked her what destroy even means, but she just started crying, yelling and hung up the phone and now sends me texts of how I cannot be her son and how she writes “ goodbye “.

So, I know my mother obviously has some mental conditions, none of her kids talk to her and she’s about to completely get isolated.
It hurts me to see her self destruct like that and I don’t know how to get her the help necessary.

What should I do? How can I make her realize she has an issue?

She was never clinically tested or such because she straight up refuses to have any examination and just claims that I am mentally ill if I approach her about it.

Thanks guys"
1664,LPT You guys aware of the fact that increased vegetable/fruit consumption is correlated to better mental health,"I saw a doctor (Dr. Eric Berg ) online talk about maintaining a necessary amount of vegetable consumption to meet your RDA's for potassium and magnesium when fasting. I thought I try upping my vegetable/fruit portions seeing, I've read that these minerals helps with mental health of people too. I didn't really take 10 (effin') cups of it though, but probably a good 4-5 cups daily (it's not that huge.)

&amp;#x200B;

It bettered a part of my personality, which is this irritating, very embarrassing and constant urge to move, consume , talk fast,and just quickly getting to the next thing after the next(maybe a side effect of an anxious tendency or even worse a side effect of my anti psychotic medication). I feel more grounded, a bit calmer, a bit more controlled, not as impulsive. 

  
Fortuitously it feels like I'm a bit sharper too. Yes it might be true that this is all placebo, but maybe it's not. There are studies that shows that fruits and vegetables help with mental health. If I can get my hands on something that's soo inexpensive that can make my life better like this, I'll probably eat as much as I can."
1665,[Nsfw] Is it actually possible to be addicted to pornography?,"So I watch porn like most people watch TV. It doesn't matter if I'm at home, at work, on the bus, wherever. I don't watch for pleasure really, more so just to see it, and I'll even watch catagories that I have no interests in. I don't watch YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, or any other streaming services any more. I'll watch porn just because I'm bored and want to watch something just to pass the time.


Do you ever close an app and then open it again without thinking? I do that but with porn websites. I happened to notice that one day, so I deleted all the apps that I used, cleared my browser history and deleted anything I had saved. But I keep finding myself checking the same websites or redownloading apps."
1666,When to step in,"My husband and I have been together since high school and it hasn’t ever been very smooth. 
He cheated on me many times and used me most our teens. Which I didn’t find out about the cheating till my early twenties. 
We broke up and I refused to speak or see him. 
He would show up in the middle of the night and ask for me back. He then started acting suicidal as if he couldn’t live without me.

We ended up back together and now married with two children. 
I work, manage the bills, take care of the kids, cooking and do all the cleaning. 
I get no help daily. 
I’m accused of being sneaky (even in front of company). 

If I ask for help I get lashed out at and his just leaves and doesn’t respond or come home till the middle of the night. Whenever I bring up divorce he accuse me of having a foot out the door and brainwashing the kids. And says he’s going to kill himself and it will all be on me. He threatens me and says if I call the police or his mom that, that will “seal the deal”. 

I’m consistently insulted and get no help. Anything I say is used as fuel and I’m yelled at.

What does someone do in a situation like this."
1667,Help understanding OCD,I have a close family member with OCD. She constantly cleans ALL day among many other weird things. I know she can’t help it but I just want to understand what she’s going through. Does anyone have any resources to help me understand?
1668,Voices,"I know that this is unnatural, and I haven’t been diagnosed for anything yet as I don’t trust my Therapist enough to talk to her I’m still a child and go to CAHMS and have tried to open up to her in the past and she told my mum about everything we talked about, my mum isn’t a caring person and could be seen as ‘abusive’, but on the subject I have voices in my head 2 of them not including me, now when you think this you might think weird demonic voices but there actually very normal, I get along okay with one(let’s call this one voice 1)  but me and the other have a tendency to argue (voice 2)it’s almost like voice 1 is the mature adult who stops us arguing and voice 2 is my little sibling who I bicker with constantly, I don’t find this bad and I actually take comfort in the voices I’ve tried explains this to my friends but they all say it’s ‘crazy’ and I should get checked out the other voices can get quite offended by this and so do I, I’m wondering others opinions on this and if I might need to get it sorted out, thank you! :)"
1669,This happened yesterday,"Background: I was in a mentally and sexually abusive relationship for over a year. I could say more, but it's disturbing me what's going on now.

Yesterday I started hearing his voice (not actually not sure how to explain it) but he would tell me how I was supposed to be feeling. Then there are multiple voices telling me how I feel and how he knows how I feel. I feel torn apart over this and I can't depict who's me in the midst of them. I feel like I can't choose how I feel because he'll be there in every step."
1670,How to tell my parents i have mental illness?,[deleted]
1671,Constantly feeling I'm not good enough,"I (15F) was born really late to the point that my siblings are old enough to be my parents. I only live with my mum and my sister. My 'youngest' sister (26F) has always been super smart and went to a really good secondary school and uni too. Her and my mum get along so much more because they are adults, and im just some kid. They often used to interrupt whenever I tried to join in or just ignore me altogether when I ask questions.
 
I also feel like this in school. Im constantly scared of judgement, and because of this I find it really hard to make and keep friendships. I used to fixate on everyone liking me, and it just wasnt possible. I always isolate myself from people to make me feel safer. They always talk about things I dont know because I dont really like the things they like (am an anime lover. Shoutout to my fellow otakus). I feel so left out wherever I go. I start becoming really selfconscious, which makes me anxious and appear awkward.

In school too, the expectations for me are so high. I'm an artsy person but I'd say I'm average in academics. I'm top set in everything, but really I cant catch up. I got my school report today. It was terrible. All my target grades are 8s and I'm scoring 5s and 6s in the majority of my subjects. I am not smart. I dont like to participate in class. The thought of failure terrifies me. 

I already struggled so much before, but now the lockdown has made it so much more worse. I get calls and emails about why I dont do the work, and I just want to run away from all of it. My mum is a single mother and shes always saying that she wont be my mum forever and that she wants me to get a good job so that she can leave and live her life. I have to do well otherwise all her hardwork to raise will be nothing. I feel like a burden and a failure. I started selfharming again and I feel so hopeless. I dont want to die, but I dont want to live, and it drives me insane.
Im just lucky that I dont care so much about my looks, otherwise, i probably wouldve already chosen suicide.

Sorry if this doesnt make any sense."
1672,Help me?,"Trigger Warning: Hi this is my first time on Reddit for a while and i'm upset that the only reason I've come here is for advice instead of cheap laughs.

I'm just so confused? I'll get straight to the point. I'm a pretty bad person, I've done a lot of things i regret and karma has definitely come back and hit me hard. I've taken my pain out on a lot of people and I've lost a lot of friends because of it. I've hurt a lot of people and the universe has hit me back. Since 2018  I began cutting, i tried it once to see what it was like but it became like a black hole to me and an escape away from the sadness in my life. Since then I've been through a lot but nothing necessarily majorly bad, just smaller things that create bigger problems. 

I am currently 15 years old. I recently moved in with my dad after i attempted to kill myself for a 3rd time. The reason behind this was because i believe my mum found me to be too much to handle, i think seeing her own flesh and blood do this to them self over and over again really got to her and she just wanted a break. At first i was extremely hostile towards her because of somethings she said in the heat of the moment ( like calling me an attention seeker ) but now i realise i was just hurting her more.

Nothing traumatising has ever happened to me that has taken a major turn in my life now that i think about it but i also think its the little things that have hurt me. I know i sound like one of those edgy teens you'd see plastered all over social media saying ""You don't understand my pain"", but truly not even i understand what i'm going through. 

Around the same time as i began cutting i had also begun to think i was transgender, i had always wanted to be a girl so i began acting on it. i decided that maybe it was the wrong time then; but now around a month ago i began acting on it again and i came out to my friends and family. 

This hellish environment we are living in right now has made me think about asking for advice like on here and i think i really need it right now. I don't know what i'm asking of you all but i'm asking for help. I have a doctor but i'm yet to tell her about my problems but i think i need some advice before i can do so which would be tomorrow. 

If you were to look on my profile by the way then you would see some suspicious things that would possibly make you believe this post was entirely false and posted here to karma farm, i can assure this is real, a lot of my other posts were to karma farm but now i'm really asking you for help because this is when i need it the most! i don't know whats going to happen next and i need to be prepared."
1673,Do people actually feel at home with reality?,"Sometimes I seem to ""snap back into reality"" and it's terrifying. Like I'll be thinking about the trees I am seeing and think ""wait a minute! *Those are real.* ***I am real.***

And it's the scariest thing because I realize that I'm not living in the future how I tend to imagine I am (I'm realizing that no matter how much I like to think ahead, I'm not getting there if I don't interact with reality). I've realized that it's a scape goat to prevent me from feeling awful about my situation now. 

Scary stuff. I'm thinking I have to implement more outside time into my daily life.

Do people actually experience life first-hand? Like when they're hungry or feel pain, do they actually feel those things? Like, I've felt pain but it doesn't register that it's *my* pain. Strange."

1678,Help! My mental health is preventing me from working 😭,"Hi all, I know I can’t be alone and wanted to share my story and hopefully get some advice. 

I’m a 27 year old woman, diagnosed with OCD, PTSD, Severe Panic Disorder, Severe Depression, and Anxiety Disorder. 

I have worked at the same job for 7 years in August. I do normal work consisting of accounts receivable and payables, as well as oversee my colleagues work. Nothing to stressful when it comes to my job. I have an amazing boss, one of the best people I know. I’ve made good friends at my job with some really wonderful people. There is one bad apple at work, our accountant, who is transitioning into our office manager since our current one is retiring. I’d be lying if I said that didn’t cause stress on me, but everyone else seems to deal with it fine. This isnt all of it though. I find myself some mornings just not able to wake up and get ready to go into the office. This was happening way before the transition began so I don’t think that’s the main cause of it but I’m sure it’s contributing. 
For some reason though, just getting out of bed and showering, doing my hair and makeup and getting ready that I struggle with the most. I suffer from trichotilomania (I pull my hair, eyebrows and eyelashes out) so I HAVE to wear makeup otherwise I look like a completely different person. I’m severely self conscious about it but can’t seem to stop pulling. 
I could go on about all my issues and what I deal with but I’m trying to hope this is the reason behind my getting to work problem. And that it’s not something more serious. 

I took two months off work in November December of 2019 to do intensive outpatient programs and thought that I’d be “cured”. Obviously that didn’t happen. 

How can I fix myself so that I’m able to go to work and be the dedicated, reliable employee I once was?"
1679,Decent online counselling for my girlfriend?,"Hi,

Can anyone suggest any ‘decent’ online therapy companies that could help for depression, anxiety etc? My girlfriend has suffered with her mental health since she was quite young, now 28, she’s been through various doctors and counselling and says nothing has really helped. I believe she wants to improve her mental health and is willing to do so if she had the right tools. 

Are there any good suggestions that might help? I’m just her boyfriend, I can listen to her and give her a hug but I can’t really help and often feel helpless listening to her. I just want her to be ok and understand I can’t help that.

Thank you x"
1680,I don’t know who needs to hear this...,"Hey bud, you may not be ok now but you will be. In the words of a great hooman who said to me “you’re only important to yourself, if you were to leave today, majority probably won’t care, many won’t even know, some would eventually hear, a few will be sad, and even less devastated but they will all grieve and cope and move on. If suicide is the answer you choose atleast make something of yourself like Bach or Mozart and leave the world at large to remember you but until you’re there, you’re just gonna have to stay on this hunk of rock like I am. And until you become world known, do the things that will make you happier because suicide only will make you dead-ier. If you’re a failure be the best damn failure there is and if you fail at being a failure that means you never were one to begin with. If your standards are too high, there’s no shame in lowering them so you can rise above them. You’re only important to yourself so treat yourself like you are.“

1685,"Although there is a large increase in mental health awareness in general, I think that it should be distributed in a much better way than the ones that are currently being used","So this is a more updated version of the post (you will probably find the original version somewhere in my profile history) so you will find most of the same as the last post plus a few additions because the more I learn more about this subject, the more I feel obligated to point this out

&amp;#x200B;

So there is the post

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**  **I feel that mental health awareness is more about sensationalised/romanticised marketing where the aim is more about profiting from these hardships instead of giving the right messages on how to deal with said issues.**

**I know that sending everyone of every demographic a message about an entirely complicated phenomenon is very difficult and the science is not always easy to follow. But I feel that the way how mental health awareness is distributed and explained to reshape our understandings about mental health is done in ways that can lead to harmful executions, even if they are done with good intentions in mind.**

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**Before I explain my post ...**

I want to point out before hand that this is a personal opinion so take it with a pinch of salt

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I am very aware of the seriousness of mental illness. I have struggled with mental illnesses all my life and I studied psychology so I am pretty aware why mental illness is such a big issue to tackle and why it should be tackled more in the forefront due to that it was shunned for a long time. And I know that there are still remnants of a mentality where people have the wrong impression or are given the wrong impression about what mental illness is and how it affects people (namely - news organisations who still to this day want to paint mental illness as the sole factor behind violence, mass shootings and every other crime imaginable while the reality is much more complicated)

&amp;#x200B;

**Intro**

I know that lately, mental illness is getting a lot of awareness which I do think that this is a good thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

But at the same time, I am noticing a pattern that instead of trying to make people aware that people with mental illness are still people regardless of their struggles, I feel like that there is a pattern where mental illness is being romanticized. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I have heard this phrase countless times ""this guy (ex: Einstein) was pretty smart. He must have been autistic"".

&amp;#x200B;

Ok fine, maybe he was but what does that have to do with anything? Do you have to be autistic to be smart or gifted? Why should all of their habits, traits and behaviours be related to their mental disorders or whatever kind of mental quirk that they have? 

*(Eg - an autistic person does something weird - is it because he is weird or is it because he is in a mood where he does not care or he is that daring? Same thing goes for the categorisation of other people in the opposite end like disabled people are often depicted as people of inspiration which pressures them to stand out more or else that they will get a lot of pity from others. If a disabled person does something, is it becuase this is just an act of doing or is it becuase of something deeper like growing out of that disability. But why should their disability be the only thing that defines them?)*

Does this mean that those without mental illness or those who managed to handle their mental illness are not gifted or special?

&amp;#x200B;

**Romanticism** 

I have heard and seen this type of romanticized model of mental illness countless times where people who were smart or had an influence on the world in some way had mental illness, or fictional characters in films or TV who are influential or legendary have mental illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or it does not necessarily need to be a mental illness but rather a quirk that the person has like social awkwardness like the stereotype goes that people who are socially awkward are more like to be intelligent or have a particular exceptional skill in something. Okay, maybe that is the case (or not) but why go so far to paint this person from an overly positive image when you can also point out the necessity of overcoming the obstacle of social awkwardness as it may lead to other problems in the long run such as difficulty in developing/advancing in one's career, developing meaningful relationships or even loneliness?

&amp;#x200B;

Why should mental illness be the enveloping factor that makes this person who he is or why this person is gifted the way he or she is? What about passion, upbringing, hard work, maybe even luck? Or what about mental struggles that do not necessarily involve mental illness like for example there is a black character in a film that just happens to be black, or a gay character who is gay. Ok what else? What are their passions, their flaws, the dreams and desires? Surely there is more to a person, good and bad, other than just being ""the gay character"" or the ""the black character"". 

&amp;#x200B;

**The paradox of progression and change**

Sometimes I feel that all of this ""pro-progressive"" mentality is all done for the sake of looking good and empathetic and you often find this a lot of media that are associated with reality like the X-factor or some reality show (why do you think that they like to put on-screen who have a rough background and the people with the most baggage are most likely to advance in the next stage of the competition? It is probably sensationalism to look empathetic and hopeful, making people more likely to have screen time for their background and not for their talent/skill because otherwise, if the latter was chosen over the former, then it would be seen as cruel or unfair)

&amp;#x200B;

Why should my mental illness also paradoxically define me who I am or what I am capable of doing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I do understand this. Even my mental disorders are useful to me in some ways - my depression sometimes makes me more aware of certain things - dark things but still, it is good to be aware of them (unless the depression takes over and reinforces my apathy), sometimes my anxiety goads me to act or be prepared for anything (yes, anxiety can be a nightmare and maybe the fears are not even real but that is why there is the mindfulness training to be aware of it and handling it well).

But why should my mental disorders be the defining factors of why I am capable of doing these things or who I am like Van Gogh or possibly Einstein or Newton?

This sounds very paradoxical and almost too similar to same way of how mental illnesses used to view as by outsiders - being the only factor that defines the person regardless of all the other qualities that this person has

I am fed up of this because it is unrealistic and even harmful portrayal of mental illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What direction are we aiming for?**

I feel like this pattern of trying to portray the good side of mental illness or at least the beneficial side effects of what mental illness can bring overshadows and neglects the bad side of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I find all of this sugar-coated version of awareness all too cheesy - awareness for this, awareness for that, repeatedly and repeatedly to the point where I feel that it is not getting anywhere or lacks the powerful impact that it should be provoking (and this also raises a huge question- if there is so much awareness about any things lately, why is this awareness campaign still going? Is it because all of these talks and ads and influencers are not influential enough to cause a change or at least a tiny bit of adjustment in the minds of at least a few people even though I know that changing the mentalities of entire populations could take years or even generations?)

&amp;#x200B;

*(Or sometimes, dare I say it - I sometimes find this too politically correct - so what the Joker is a person who has a mental illness. Sure, the portrayal is very shocking, scary and possibly inaccurate (the same way that a few other forms of art did in the past) but there is a message behind this of improper treatment can affect people in the long-run especially to those who are more vulnerable. Or another example that comes to mind is when you are asked to call a person ""diagnosed with autism"" instead of the word ""autistic"". Sure, the latter puts more of a label on that person but if you also suddenly want to change the former as well with the phrase ""exhibiting symptoms of autism"", I fail to see how this makes a difference on putting a label on that person anyway because you say or do not say, you will still put a label on that person/thing, whether good, bad or neutral (note - the problem is not the problem, the problem is your attitude towards the problem)*

&amp;#x200B;

Fine, maybe my anxiety sometimes helps me to be prepared or to act accordingly but I am not going to lie that it makes me feel frozen, petrified and frightened most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I say the same way for many other mental illnesses out there. Sure they can be helpful or one can accept them in their lives if this method is utilised well but that does not mean that they dont have those bad days anymore or that the mental illness (or whatever kind of mental struggle) does not get to them personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Scientific-based or marketing?**

My gut is telling me that I am seeing a lot of this is due to cheesy marketing - it looks good, it looks progressive, it looks hopeful, it sells especially for those who are not familiar with the phenomenon, whether if they did not study it or whether they did not experience it themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not saying that there is no hope at all whenever someone is struggling through mental illness (or could be any kind of mental struggle because it does not necessarily have to involve a diagnosable mental illness) and I am not saying that mental illnesses should not be treated (becuase aside from even the debate of what boils down to what a mental illness is or how it should be treated (there were a few insights that made us aware of how we view mental illness like Thomas Zsasz's criticism of the phenomenon of mental illness and the Rosenhan experiment).

&amp;#x200B;

Treatment for mental illness vary a lot depending on many things - the mental struggles themselves (similar to how a wound can be treated), the person and his/her goals, the person who treating him/her (in therapy, your personality will come into contact with the client so there will some sort of chemistry there or none at all), the philosophy behind the treatment, how difficult it is, the origins and diagnosis of the mental struggle and how to prevent reinforcing it and so on

&amp;#x200B;

But I hate how amongst all of this chaos and hardship of mental illness is often romanticized version of a burden that overshadows the weight and struggles behind that burden. Or portraying mental disorders is the sole reason why the person is capable of doing A (like a person who happens to have Aspergers. Yes, people with Aspergers tend to be highly intelligent or highly interested in a particular subject but it is not the same for every one of them) becuase paradoxically, it envelopes the person makes it as the defining feature of why the person does what he does. It is as if you are replacing one label with another except this time, it has a different colour.

*(Like I said earlier, yes, mental disorders can have their own perks if you look hard enough. But every person has many others too - dreams, desires, other flaws or patterns that do not have to involve mental disorders, the capacity to work hard and be diligent amongst all the struggles, the capacity of love, to think, to dream and so much more)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I find this romanticized effort as just as stigmatising as portraying mental illness from the opposite end of the phenomenon and gives the wrong and untruthful message to those who are unfamiliar with this phenomenon especially considering that this is an issue that is unbelievably complicated if you dig deep into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, people need to be aware of the damaging effects of mental illness and maybe mental illness and/or any mental struggle of any kind is not entirely bad or detrimental to the person but if you keep on shielding people with these bizarrely overly optimistic messages about mental illness or mental struggles in general, then you risking damaging their perception of the reality of this subject and will not give them the right tools on how to approach.

&amp;#x200B;

And because of this, I feel that this is type of portrayal of mental disorders lack of the substance that is necessary to give the following messages to those who are watching the messages:

&amp;#x200B;

* Mental disorders are just as real and a heavy burden than any other form of illness
* Apart that they are just as real as any other type of illness, mental disorders are also incredibly complicated and have so many different factors involved, biological, psychological and social
* Not every human problem can be boiled down to a mental illnesses - they are incredibly tricky to diagnose, treat and handle. Sometimes humans can be just as vulnerable without putting a label at something.
* Yes, mental disorders are terrifying and heavy to carry but there is the good as well in that phenomenon
* Yes, mental disorders can strangely have their own benefits and perks if handled and utilised correctly but they also carry so much weight and struggles
* The reality of the human mind and the capabilities of what the human mind can do and/or be, both incredible and horrible, are just as complicated and puzzling as every other subject. And not every person's stories and troubles are the same even if they carry the same amount of weight or exhibit the same amount of symptoms or come from the same backgrounds"
1686,I get close to non-verbal,"I go through periods of time when I feel like I can't speak to anyone I don't know why. Doesn't matter how lonely or sad or isolated I feel, it's like I can only say a few words. Then I'll get angry and snap at people if they try to make me talk or if they don't understand something I said and ask me to elaborate and explain further. Does anyone else get like this? For me it's nearly every day."
1687,"Bought another box of Scalpels, feeling detached.","I feel detached lately. I have all these thoughts of wanting to hurt others, and hate myself for wanting this. I hate my body, looking at me. I feel like I’ll never be good enough. I have this feeling that my husband and I won’t last. So in all, I need to cut. It takes away all the feelings, makes me numb. It’s a way of coping. I like the blood, I like that I might go to far... because I alway go back to the feeling that I need to die anyways. So if I keep going back, then why not just die. I don’t want to hurt others. I feel I may one day."
1688,How do you find your passion? Any advice?,"One of the things I often see when offering advice on mental health is to ""find your passion"" or similar. While true, I find it very hard to do anything about it. I've looked for new stuff to do, but nothing has caught my eye. I've investigated new jobs, but nothing really appeals. I've considered other hobbies, but nothing really gets me going when I think about it. I know things need to change if I want to improve, but how do I know what to try if I don't get excited about new ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

To anyone who has looked into it themselves, how did you find your passion (or go about it)?"
1689,HIPPA Violation???,"I’m trying to get a medical marijuana card for my PSTD and my psychiatrist has to send her notes to my physician. We are going on two months of her not sending it and I’m trying to see if it’s a violating of HIPAA. Does anyone know if withholding information is a violation? 

I understand that if there are notes that may harm me she can’t give out, but it’s just to my physician.

Edit: I know it’s HIPAA, I hate autocorrect."
1690,Can I beat my dad?,"I know this post sounds extremely self explanatory but hear me out.

I would call myself a very calm person. Despite almost being a black belt in Taekwondo, I just.. really don't like conflict? I just know alot of it can be avoided, to be honest.

I hate my father. No one, and I mean it when I say it, not a single person has given me as much trouble as my father. He has always followed this guideline: 

1. When he wants to get mad, he will nitpick until he finds something to be mad about (Think about that one seen from Family Guy where they showed God trying to quit smoking, and they showed him yelling at his 'wife' for finding a pen cap with no pen in the junk drawer). Even if he simply Can't find something to be mad about, he will just make it up.

2. He will buy you stuff just so he can prove to you how good he is to you, and will treat you like shit later because you didn't do something for him on the same level. He will treat gifts as a ticket to get mad at you.

3. He will hold anything, and I mean anything that you value, against you. There is nothing that I care about that he doesn't want to take away.

I am much stronger than him, I am a little bit taller than him, and I am much fucking angrier than him.

If anyone here is knowledgeable about either the legal repercussions/ impact acting on this has, let me know"
1691,A little psychoanalyse,"generally, i (15) think about a lot of stuff in life and feel a lot of different emotions. throughtout recent years i've searched up quite a lot of different mental topics and have been psychoanalyzing myself. 
 right now my mind is in this state: i feel superior to almost everyone because i feel like i've experienced stuff and understand more than them, but at the same time my self esteem is quite low. before, i used to be pretty chill but now i feel very easily irritable over many little or big stuff. well, one of the reasons i'm writing all these is because i can't even discuss many deep topics with my close friends, i can be very confusing and i kinda suck about expressing myself. as few times as i already tried talking random stuff with them, i wasn't satisfied with the conversations.. also a fact being, that if i'm irritated about something regarding them, i have to suppress my feelings a lot which causes more overthinking and sadness."
1692,I need to talk to someone,Basically I get nervous when I think about my future like going to college getting married etc but my worst fear is my parents aging and dying everytime I think of this I get really nervous and it ruins anything I feel happy about I'm also a bit bipolar because I'll tell myself I cant control the inevitable and I'm so lucky and I'm spending time with them and giving it my 100% but then a few mins later realisation sets in again and I nervous so I need to talk to someone who has lost parents at a young age to an accident or a sickness and it would be great if i could talk to someone who is an adult and has went through college and marriage i think this would help me realise how lucky I am to have my parents right now and for the next few years my dads 57 and mums 51 that's why I'm nervous about them dying and I'm only 15 so it wud be great to talk to someone with them experiences listed
1693,Please help me out,"So hi, first post and my first language isn't English.

I'm a 13(next month 14) year old female. I am gonna give some backstory so most problem make more sense. My live has been pretty hard on me and in the last 5 years of my life doctors discovered this.

-high intelligent( it does not mean that i know every single thing, it does mean that i hear, taste, feel everything 6 times intenser. I overthink everything and every situation wich leads to no mental rest and panic attacks.)

-a brain tumor. (had surgery twice at ages 9 and 11, allclear now)

-ptsd(because of the surgery and recovery)

-epilepsy(because of brain tumor, i take medication to control it but sometimes one will slip through. So this makes me very nervous when in public alone)

-migrene (stress related)

-A lot of fears like being in public or in a public situation (going to a store with someone i thrust a lot is hard alone is a no go) small spaces (ptsd) things i can't control (high IQ) over thinking and many more.

I think these where the most important things. Things i already do.

-going to a psychologist (every 2 weeks for about 4 years already)

-going to a masseuse(every week to get my muscles to losen up)

-breathing therapy

-mindfulness (still in the learning process)

-Work out

-reading/writhing about my feelings

-draw what i feel

-going half a day to school instead of a full day

-talking with my parents/teachers

So now during quarantine i feel like all the positive progress i made was just like 'yeeeettttt bye bye' and it frustrates me. Now these questions are most likely for people who are parents/close family or  friends of a high intelligent or for people who with high intelligents. But if you're not one of those feel free to comment your opinion as wel.

Now onto the question

1 how do i tell my mom that the doctor shows she watches makes me uncomfortable and stressed

2 how can i get over my fears faster

3 does anyone know somthing to keep me bussy with 

4 does anyone know some tricks to fall asleep fast and easy without using medication

5 keep up with my schoolschool work without needing a nap after because i'm tired 

My interests this maybe helpful if sombody knows 
a fun idea with it. 

-geocahing 

-the 100

-game of thrones 

-pretty little liars 

-friends

-the addams family

-reading (mostly Philipa Gregory) 

- writhing 

-black and with drawing 

-any kind of puzzle 

If you know anything that pay help please comment cause i'm going crazy. Also if you're only here to hate or to say this is fake scrol along. I know everyone is frustrated with the situation, but nobody ever needs hate. If we all would complement each other more and we would take critic better

Thank you if you got here, stay save and have a good day or night depending on where you live."
1694,Fantasy/Fiction becoming reality,"Hi all,
Has anyone every experienced when readying or watching fiction that it overcomes their vulnerable stages of mind, or more know that this may be?
For example, I've had states of drunkeness, lack of sleep, or other various states of delirium where I've experienced states where I believed that fictions I've seen or read are my reality. And acted on them.. I'm concerned because it has started to affect my reality and I don't love it.
Any clarification needed is only a question away but it feels very disconcerting..
Thanks in advance!"

1696,I need advice,"Hi r/mentalhealth. 

I need some advice and help on how to support my partner. 

He told me today that he felt that we would all be better off without him. My heart broke hearing that. I

 cried and told him we needed go get him help now. I took him to the ER. Of course because of Covid, I can't go in with him. I'm sitting in my car in the parking lot writing this with tears running down my face. 

The psychologist called me to talk to me. He asked me questions about our home life and about my partner's behavior in the past few days. I told him everything. We love each other and have a good home life. We have been best friends and been a couple for 14 years - almost half our lives. Home is good. He's hard on himself about work. He feels he's not good enough at his job, or that he can't compete work by the deadlines. And today, out of seemingly nowhere, he told he he's not good enough for life. 

The psychologist said he seems like he has boarder line personality disorder and recommended therapy. I don't know if or when he's getting discharged. I'm just waiting. 

What are we up against here? What can we expect next? How to I help him through this and keep loving him and doing what he needs?"
1697,Allergies/Sinuses increasing anxiety?,"Anyone else notice their anxiety is exacerbated when hit with allergies or a sinus infection? The combination of wearing a mask out and all the pollen in the air has wrecked havoc on my sinuses and I've noticed my anxiety has suffered because of it. Things feel less hopeful and the future looks darker all because my head is clogged and I get a bit of heartburn from all the mucus.  I feel like with therapy and meds I've got a decent enough handle on my mental state, but it feels like all the progress evaporates with a sinus infection. Is this normal? Does anyone else experience worse anxiety when they're feeling ill?"
1698,"I feel lost and broken and empty, I'm tired of pretending to be fine, and being brushed off when I try to seek help.","I'm known at my job and by people that know me as a relatively calm and cheerful person. I get comments all the time about how sweet of a personality I have and how I'm always happy. What these people don't know is that it's ALL fake, but my mask is breaking. I can't seem to keep things contained anymore. I start shaking and sobbing uncontrollably at work with seemingly no trigger. 

I can't focus, I feel like my throat is closing and I start gasping for breath like I'm drowning, even though my brain knows I can breathe just fine. My whole body goes flush and splotchy like I'm sick and I just can't seem to calm myself down. I've known for several months that I need to find a new job, and I've been looking, but right now is more difficult than usual to find a job.

I try not to talk to my fiance about my problems because he has severe depression, and I don't want to add to his mental stress. I've tried to talk to my mom, but she just brushes me off like I'm just moody and it will pass. I told her today that I was going to ask my Dr. to refer me to a psychiatrist for help, and she bluntly told me that I'd be fine and didn't need to see a psychiatrist, then rather than let me vent or confide in her she changed the subject. This is her reaction any time I try to confide in her, and when I don't she says ""you can always talk to me."" I feel like I can't though. And I've told her as much.

I feel like no-one takes me seriously. My mind is tearing me apart from the inside, and I feel like it's entirely out of my control. I have some serious problems from childhood and I think that years of holding it all in has affected me more than I thought it would. 

I'm really scared of my own mind lately and I don't know what to do about that. I want to see a psychiatrist and finally get some real help from someone who knows what they are doing, but at the same time I know that realistically I can't afford it. Which just makes me more upset and feel more helpless because I feel stuck. If I continue to try to deal on my own, I'm worried I may do something stupid. But if I find and go to a dr, I'll be adding more stress financially which also really concerns me because stress really does bad things to my sanity...

I'm falling apart and I'm afraid I won't be able to pick the pieces back up..."
1699,My brother is pre-skitzophrenic,"I have an uncle who is mildly skitzophrenic so when we found out my brother was pre-skitzophrenic it didn't come as a shock to anyone.  He actually looks quite a bit like the uncle with skitzophrenia on top of that he always sort of displayed some mild symptoms.

It hasn't really helped that he is completely anti-medication and an accomplished MMA fighter.  These two things may seem unrelated but head injuries exacerbate like all forms of mental illness.  People who participate in contact sports are known for having higher rates of depression, suicide, and psychosis.  My brother has had my subdural hematomas than I can remember, and for each one, I was his nurse as I was in the healthcare profession for a long time.

He got into a major car accident about three years ago after winning a big fight and crushed his ankle.  He spent weeks in the ICU.  The injury pretty much destroyed his chances of competing at the level he was at prior ever again.  He could still teach and participate, but it was advised he no longer compete since it is more likely than not he will end up losing his left foot eventually and fighting would excelerate that damage.  He decided he would rather accept losing a foot and even rather die than quit doing what he loves and despite all the advice against it, I chose to support him, because I knew I couldn't stop him and I didn't want him to be completely alone.

His mental health has just plummeted since the accident.  I think the ensuing depression and PTSD has just really exacerbated the skitzophrenia.  He's suddenly developed all these far right conspiracies that, frankly, members of The Donald could explain better.  He's lost all coherence.  He recently argued that COVID is a conspiracy to ""take away out humanity"" by ""forcing us to wear masks that take away our identity"", then that the government is expanding mass surveillance which will track us by our faces.  I then explained to him that ""Wouldn't the masks circumvent the mass face surveillance?  And, I mean, who exactly is forcing you to wear a mask?  Last I checked the government isn't even making PPE easily accessible to the public let alone forcing us.""  At this point he was backed into a corner and just pivoted and said ""We will have to agree to disagree.""  To which I'm like ""On what?""  to which he's like ""Why we're being forced to wear masks.""  to which I say ""But, we just determined that the government ISN'T forcing you to wear a mask.""  to which he got up all frustrating and insisted we stop talking about it.

He then goes on facebook and spreads these nonsensical conspiracy videos and gets over the top infuriated when they get taken down for violating misinformation rules on YouTube, claiming that they are working with the Dems to censor the evil things they're doing or something.  Recently he posted a doctored video of Governor Inslee saying the National Guard was coming to take our guns and force us to stay inside.  It was taken down and he is insisting that it wasn't the video that was wrong, it was YouTube censoring the information in the video.  When I explained to him ""Why would YouTube censor that if it was true?""  he had no answer and went on to complain that we are adopting Chinas censorship model and rambled on about Turkey and socialism.

Our mother, on top of this, is very politically active and very liberal.  She is heartbroken, literally sobbing.  My brother has lashed out at her on social media several times recently and she's so hurt that she's ready to stop talking to him altogether.  I tried to bring up that FaceBook is bullshit, my brother is losing his mind to skitzophrenia and head injuries, and that we shouldn't be letting FB drama destroy our family, but she got furious with me for even suggesting she was letting FB drama destroy something.

Today, after another conspiracy addled tirade this morning, my mother blocked him on social media and now says she never wants to see him again.  He is completely alone without us.  I'm not sure he's ever going to have another girlfriend again who might take care of him.  I have tried to talk to him about getting help but he just doesn't see that he has a problem.  I've tried actually showing him samples of his writing for five years ago and a sample from the other day to illustrate how incoherent he's being, but he doesn't want to address it.  He says he can't afford therapy and he doesn't want to go on medication.

Not sure what to do about it, I'm really just venting... /rant"
1700,Worst thing someone has said about you.,I know this sounds like a weird thing to ask but I think by saying the worst things people have said about you may help.

1701,I think my friends are traitors,"I don’t know why, but I randomly think my friends are doing stuff/ saying stuff without me, I get stressed thinking about it but I can’t help it, I don’t want to confront them about it because I hate confrontation i feel like they’re hiding something from me. I didn’t do anything to them to make them hate me or make them hide stuff from me. Maybe I’m overthinking it"
1702,I'm giving myself one week and then I'm seeking help,"I never say I promise because I don't want to lie to anyone, not even myself - but I promise. For once, I'm going to take my health seriously.


I've been posting rants on reddit nonstop for a few days and I can't deceive myself anymore. What I'm doing is seeking validation, help, some kind of excuse to shroud what's really the matter. I need therapy, not strangers on the internet. And I'm willing to finally seek it if I'm not able to turn things around on my own.


That's why I'm going to try. I'm going to do my utmost best for the next week and if I don't see changes, then I know this is out of my control and I have to give matters into someone else's hands.


Yes, I'm immensely anxious, because this means I have to tell my parents as my country is still on lockdown and they would find it odd if I suddenly stepped out of the house (as I'm not in school or work right now). It's scary, but I've had enough of whining online, playing victim and pitying myself. Id not for myself, I owe this to my family who don't deserve to deal with my constant mood swings and episodes.


I'm not too sure why I'm writing this. Maybe to remind myself and hold myself accountable. Maybe in the hopes that if someone is struggling and denying themselves the help, they might find the strength to reach out after reading this."
1703,How do I get help while I’m college,I’m thinking about getting a therapist but I don’t know how I would work if I dorm for most of the year and live at home for the rest. The counselors at school are absolute garbage and all of the professionals in the town are completely booked. What do you guys do if you live in multiple places?
1704,Mentally going downhill,"First I want to say thank you for reading this because It’s nice to have others read your story. 

First off, i don’t know what to do at the moment or what type of condition I have because this is so new to me. Let me explain, on the day of my birthday (May 15) I wasn’t feeling too well because I was sleep deprived. My family was getting annoyed at me because they wanted me to be happy and enjoy my day with them. After they let me sleep for a while, I felt better but woke up with no emotion. At first I faked my happiness to make everyone happy but when my little birthday party ended with my family, I felt emotionless again. 

The next day, I was told by my mom that my favorite grandpa has passed away due to the virus and I began to feel very emotional and cry a lot. I let my tears out with my family and talked about all the great things about him. Eventually, I felt very sad the whole day but I felt better letting my feelings out.

The day after my grandpa’s death I remembered my friend speaking very oddly on discord (an app where you can chat) and saying things like “I can’t live a life like this, I can’t even go outside and have fun”, at first he sounded suicidal to all of us but then he changed his attitude and acted normally. 

In the same day or the day after, I began thinking how suicide is something that shouldn’t be done and that I would never be capable of doing it because I have a strong bond to my family and if something happened to me, it will literary kill my mom. However, the moment I began thinking of the word suicide, a bunch of images I saw in the t.v where I saw suicide began popping into my mind. At first, I tried hard to disregard the fact that I was thinking about the word but then it began to get worse. I don’t know if it sounds stupid but I began to feel shame and guilt because the topic of suicide is in my mind. I’m not thinking of doing it but I personally feel very ashamed of thinking about it. This situation caused me to begin feeling emotionally distressed because I felt ashamed, disgusted and very sad whenever I thought of the word in my head. I don’t know why I can’t stop thinking about the word suicide and why my mind always remembers the things I don’t want to remember. To explain, even before the corona virus outbreak, I always had so much anxiety and whenever something small and bad happened to me, I would constantly think of that moment until I forgot. I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m going crazy, I’m attending my online classes but sometimes I feel like I get distracted. As of right now, I don’t feel like doing the things I use to do like play video games because my mind doesn’t feel the same as it use to. I afraid of letting my family know what is going on with me because they always seen me as the strongest in the family both mentally and physically but after the corona virus outbreak started, I began to lose myself slowly and slowly and felt more bored with my life. I don’t have the intentions of killing my self but the word keeps coming into my mind and I keep feeling sad because it keeps coming back into my mind. This sometimes causes images of suicide to reappear into my mind but these images our from moments I have seen on t.v or on YouTube. 

Either way, I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know what to do but as of right now I’m trying to fake my happiness in my household so that no one notices and im trying to forget about the word. Sometimes I’m successful on forgetting the word in my mind but sometimes, certain events or situations triggers me on remembering it again. I just want to be happy again and live my life as I use too. I’m currently in college and I’m afraid that if I keep thinking of the word, i’ll eventually succumb to my mind and might truly be serious with the word and start hurting my self. That’s why I trying so hard to be relaxed and distract myself but sometimes I randomly remember the word and I don’t know why. Thanks you and any advice would be helpful"
1705,"Subreddit offering a space, mental health information and news, support and a place to promote your mental health related work/blogs etc, mainly for people from the UK 🙂","Hello all! As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. [Here is my subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/)

Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

I'm keeping the sub active mainly through posting mental health news articles but eventually hoping it can be a more varied sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy.

1706,Self-healing because I can't deal with my friends anymore,"My name is Alyssa, and I'm 14. I'm the friend who listens and comfort people when they need it, and I love it when I help people, but also I can only deal with so much.

I have only four close friends, which in all of them have either contemplated suicide or cut themselves. They always come to me for comfort or advice and I always give it to them even if I'm not a professional. 2 friends have been getting better, but the other 2 have been getting worse. 

So I talked to them just now, saying how I care and all that because I really do. I want them to get professional help, or find an adult because I cannot take any of this anymore. 

I have my own mental health to take care of, and the way they are now is also affecting me. It's been nearly a year, and I have been trying my best to hold myself together.

I told countless teachers about them but they won't do anything. Telling their parents would make it worse because of some family issues. I tried to persuade them to school counsellors, which ended in fights and all.

All I want is for them to get better. And not from help from me. Because I am not a professional, and I know my limits.

I went through this before when I was 10 to 12 and found my own way of coping: self-meditation. It makes me feel better even if it seems like an unusual way(?) to heal. 

Yeah so I talked to them, but we got into a fight. Well actually, more like them getting pissed off at me because I said stuff they didn't like. I did apologise, but uh they told me to fuck off...

I think? in that conversation maybe I was wrong.

I said some stuff about my mental health and them finding professionals, talked about life and changing. Calmly. Because last time it didn't go too well and I regret it.

I feel like all my efforts to help them is getting ignored. I feel like my mental health is just a joke for the two of them. They don't want help, but come to me when one of them wants to jump or cut themselves. They show me the pictures, act crazy thinking it's all fucking funny.


What am I supposed to do here? Do they not realise that I am a human too and feel emotions?? Everytime they do something like that, the same emotions always come out: anger, worry and fear.





I don't think they remember the fact that I am a fucking 14 year old as well and not an adult even if I don't act like I'm 14. Right, so is it my fault that I don't act 14? Because I realise that life is more than just suffering, which is why I live life now. Because I know my life is mine to live and I plan to make it a happy one?


I try and try to tell them about actual help but they don't want it. But yet, they want my comforts, my advice and not from a professional. I can't do anything.

I had enough of this. Please just make it stop. Why was it me."
1707,"Paranoia self creates suspicions and symptoms, how do I stop this",[deleted]
1708,I don't know how to help my brother and it's killing me,"My (two years younger) brother and I both suffer from a wide variety of issues, mostly anxiety, depression, and alcoholism. We are both able to function fairly well, but his mental health has deteriorated far worse than mine over the past few years. He is miserably depressed, pessimistic, hates everything , etc.. He drinks every day, often is drunk at work, and frequently drives drunk. He often expresses the desire to not be alive, but doesn't explicitly threaten suicide. I think he self-harms occasionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since the coronavirus virus crisis started, it seems as though his drinking is at an all time high and his mental health is at an all time low. My mom and I have both discussed with him options to get help, but he is not very cooperative. He went to one therapy session then deemed it unable to help. Then, he was prescribed a medication to help him stop drinking, which he took once, and then stopped because it made him feel sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night he texted me and he was the drunkest I've ever experienced and he said some disturbing things to me (NOT self-harm related), that finally made me feel like.. okay, I really gotta fucking do something.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, he texted and apologized for last night. I am trying to talk to him about going to rehab, because he himself stated that he recognized that he has a problem and would like to go to rehab. But then he makes the excuse that it is too much money. Even though he has a good job, tons of savings, and good health insurance. I know that he is using the money thing as an excuse, but I'm honestly at the point where I would just pay for it myself if that's what it takes. Granted I have far less financial resources than him, and would have to go into debt to get money to pay for his rehab. But I do not know what to do at this point. He hasn't threatened suicide so I cant get him involuntarily committed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a breaking point where I'm so worried about him. I think about him constantly and I'm always so afraid he's going to die or seriously hurt himself. It feels terrible just sitting on the sidelines, watching someone's slow demise, and being absolutely powerless to stop it. And it hurts and offends me that my love, and the love of his family, are not enough to get him to get help.

&amp;#x200B;

I just know that if anything ever happens to him, I'm going right with him."
1709,Im going to kill myself,"Hi. I've never posted on Reddit before but here goes



I really want too kill myself, I'm sick of my mental health dragging me down all the time. It made me fail university and I just feel like a failure because of it. I dont have many friends because I suck at making freinds so I don't really have someone to turn too. 
I feel like I'm a worthless piece of crap. 



In two months my tenancy contract comes to an end and then I'll be homeless, you see I grew up in Foster care so I don't have a home to go back too. When I failed uni my current student housing company let me stay for one more year as I didn't have anywhere to go. However now that years coming too an end and I haven't been able to save up enough money to get somewhere new, even though I don't eat most days to save money, as I'm living on benefits. 



The voices in my head all agree that killing myself is the only solution, I have no one to turn too and no future. The voices have always been right about stuff like this, and this is the first time all of them are agreeing about it. I can't seem to get a job although I've been applying like crazy and I just don't see any reason to stay alive any more. 



There's no one who would be upset if I killed myself, to my friends and mum I would have just disappeared. I'm finding it harder and harder to find happens these days, gaming and listening to music just don't have the same effect anymore. I try everything that usually makes me happy and none of it is working."
1710,I love my family but I don't like being around them,"I don't know if that sounds messed up or not but it's true. This doesn't apply a lot but there are times where I just don't want to be around them at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is really passive-aggressive towards me sometimes and frequently makes comments about my weight and appearance all under the guise of ""I'm nagging because it's my job as your mother"" and she told me that she'll never stop worrying about me and my sister and our health and appearance and everything. And I get why she does it but it sometimes comes off hurtful and I've tried explaining that to her but it doesn't seem to get through to her and she tends to be somewhat defensive about it. My sister can somewhat be the same way and it gets really frustrating to be around them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad and brother in law are really into like conspiracy theories and have been going on about how COVID-19 ""isn't that big of a deal"" even though tens of thousands of people have died from it and they always delve into these conversations and they always get vaguely xenophobic and racist towards Chinese people. And there's no convincing them otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I traveled to Europe without them and I've never felt as relaxed and just...not stressed for the first time in a long time. I feel really awful about saying that but it's true. I sometimes feel selfish for thinking that if I moved to Europe, I'd feel so much happier seeing my family only maybe a couple times a year rather than every single day. I then feel bad because I know that there are people who have it ten times worse than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My family accepts me for being gay and they are genuinely very supportive of what I do which I'm grateful for. It's just my mom tends to put down what I'm interested in without really realizing what it is that she's doing is mean and I've called her out on it and she's gone ""Did I say that?"" and not really apologized. I know she comes from a good place but her comments tend to effect my self-esteem and I can't really voice this to her because then she says that I'm 'overreacting' and she turns back to the 'I'm nagging because I'm your mother'

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is really disjointed and rambly but I needed to get this off my chest and wanted to just rant and maybe see if anyone can relate. I know this is something I can work out but I have no idea where to start and I don't know if I'm blowing this up into something more than it is."
1711,Found something to look forward to,"Therapy. The law states that minors can't get therapy without a parent/carer's consent (which I can't get), so I gotta wait until I'm 18. I hear people who go to therapy talk about how great it is and how content they feel after a few months of therapy. I want to feel like that, and my only option is staying alive for a couple more years"
1712,im going crazy,"iv always felt off sense i was like 9 or 10, i grew up in a good environment for the most part, very rural, no phone or internet untill i was a teenager.. my life was moderatly good until my dad started using meth, that caused my parents to get divorced when i was 14 and my mom moved us 8hrs away to live with my grandparents... i did have some trauma when i was a child tho, when my uncle got locked up again he told me to go kill his dog because he couldnt take care of it any more.. that stuck with me for a min b/c it was brutal, anothe example was my dads dicipline, another ex is being physicaly handicaped and constantly having to fight people as i grew up...   at first i didnt like living with my grandparents but within a few months i felt at home.. the new school i went to had a bigger population than my town i came from, i went from a school with 200 students 2 one with 3000. and it didnt help that i was a quiet loner that didnt look like everone else, but i scraped by and graduated.. after i graduated i got a job i hated and worked it for almost a year but then my dad got out of prison and wanted me to live with him for a while, so i packed my things into my car and moved back.. and a side note i had been smoking pot and drinking since i was 16, my exuse for doing so was my depression and my physical pain, but the first day i went back home with him i tried this drug i never heard of before called spice aka k2, and i was intantly addicted, i waited about 2months and got a new job as a guard and made the best money i ever did, i spent it on my dads bills gave him some of it and spent the rest on my habbits... as time went on he got increasingly aggresive, mostly to his gf.. after the beatings he would just drive off and leave me there as doc. and it was brutal...it drove me the brink of maddness, i felt like i was always being watched, i didnt baith, i started writing random stuff down in a book that didnt make since, i felt lost or hopeles.. i finally decided to move back when he dove off the deep end with the drgs and violence, the last violent episode drew the line for me... now its been a year since iv been back and iv been clean for a few months,.. a few months back i got my first crappy job back and kept it for a year until my ashole boss fired me for taking a extra smoke break, he had it out for me.. a few months after that i felt useless and hopless drowning out my sorrow with anything i could get, even if i had to steal it..i was severly depressed, i always feel like iv thought differently than everyone around me and i could never click with someone,like i am a differnt speicese or somthing... i tried to kill myself by smoking a whole joint of k2, 10 triple c's, washed down with some liqor. my friend found me in my car and drove me to the hospital, he saved my life, i was fighting everone there sayng let me die let me die. they stuck me with some neetles and left me in a room for 4hrs and finally a nurse comes in and tells me to sign a paper, i was still incredibly high so i just scrbbled on it without seond thought and next thing i know im being transported to a mental hospital.. i spent 5 days in there, the first few days the dt's were hell but i finnaly came around and, after a little bit i met a preecher who was also being helped as a patient there, the actual doctors and nurses didnt do anything but drug you up and bitsh at you but the preecher i met realy helped me get my head on a little straighter, i got saved while i was there, found God, and got out... but im still having mild hallucinations, deppresion, anxiety. im fully functional but still feel the same way iv always felt. any one have opinions or suggestions? thanks."
1713,Just a question,"Is there a disorder where you obsess over ""not being good enough"", where no matter how hard you try, you can't see any good in yourself, where your perception of yourself and who you are is so warped it's like you're living in a separate reality  from everyone else?

K thanks bye"

1715,Unable to get over an internet argument loss.,"Hey, so I am not good with internet arguments for various reasons. I am really good with winning arguments in real life though. So, a few days back a few of my schoolmates attacked me online on my class group and of course I lost. Now, the problem is, was the school still open, they wouldn't have dared to even argue with me. And such people won an argument. 

Now I even know that once school starts again I will take care of them and be at the top. But for now I think my school people are branding me a loser. Although schoolmates are interacting with me in the same way yet I still have this illusion in my mind. 

I thought this feeling of losing to someone far below you would go but it isn't and now it's affecting my work. Please help me."
1716,I just want to get on with my life but my nightmares are holding me back,"TL;DR: After being attacked, I can't stop having nightmares and they're making me feel like I have no control. 

*potential trigger warning*

July (2019), I was sexually assaulted. It was seconds away from rape. I was blacked out and I woke up just in time that my martial arts training actually came in handy.

This really f*cked me up. I was in a rally bad place for a long time.

Now, I've gotten better and just want to move on with my life. However, there's two things holding me back. 

One I'm working on, and I'm slowly getting better. The other is my nightmares.

For most of my life, I was on a prescription drug with a side effect of having completely nonsensical dreams, none of which were ever bad. I stopped taking that medicine about when I turned 18. After that, I still rarely had bad dreams. Then, after what happened, I started having nothing but nightmares.

In the first few months, I would never remember them, but I would always wake up or if breath, my heart beating out of my chest, and my face covered in tears to where I had to literally pry my eyelids open. In those months, if my boyfriend was spending the night with me, he would occasionally have to wake me up because I would violently shake in my sleep.

These days, I don't shake in my sleep, at least that I know of, and I'm actually able to remember the nightmares. I still always wake up with tears on my face, out of breath, and hight heart rate.

The nightmares range from mockery to fighting off monsters that are trying to kill me to looking down at my own body being ripped apart with saws.

I'm so tired of what happened last summer holding me back. I just want to move on and get on with my life and not let what he did keep holding the reigns on my life. I said enough, and I pulled myself together. But I feel so defeated and helpless with the constant nightmares. I can't do anything about them. I hate that it's still eating at my subconscious.

This morning, I almost cried after waking up because I am so tired of waking up more emotionally exhausted than I fell asleep and having to grapple with my own subconscious every night. I don't want something that happened one night almost a year ago to keep eating at my soul. I don't get it, otherwise I'm usually fine these days, but I keep having to deal with these every night. 

I don't what what to do about them if there is anything I can. It feels like I'm stuck."
1717,Haha frick,"I just realized how fcked up it is that I started thinking about suicide when I was 10 and self harmed at 11.  Like... I was a child.  Children shouldn’t think stuff like that.  I’m now 18, self harming, and just realized that it’s not normal to feel the way I do every day.  I tried explaining to my brother what GAD feels like and he said “meh, you’ll get over it.”  Like... bruh.  I haven’t gotten over it for 8 years and I just assumed that everyone felt the way I do.  I can’t comprehend a day where I wake up happy, do basic self care things without contemplating how much energy they would take, look forwards to the future, and don’t get anxious at every little thing.  Like how... pls show me this power"
1718,I'm doing something wrong,"As of this moment, I hate my life. I hate all of my decisions, I hate all of my family's decisions for me, and I hate my circumstances. It's really not that bad though. I have hardworking parents who provide an excess of shelter and basic necessities. But it's the relationships that I cannot stand. It's as though every choice I make is being judged, and I know I'm the one doing a lot of the judging. Maybe I'm struggling with feelings of inadequacy? I feel fucking worthless tbh. I havent hurt myself since the last time I was living with my parents. And after a series of events this past year including a totaled car, I'm back but in my parents' new home (huge and by a lake). I just hate having all this privilege while I feel constantly reminded that I dont deserve it. I just quit my job at the bakery some weeks ago. Furloughed from my other job since God knows when. I smoke a lot of weed to get through my days. And today I havent had my first hit yet. So I've been going a little bit crazy. Basically just had a mental episode in my room for the past hour, which has led me to typing this. I dont know what I'm looking to get out of this, I think I just need a place to vent since there's not much I can do besides that."
1719,I have questions,"Beware, this is a lengthy read, so proceed with caution. There are also mentions of abuse and drug use. This is your trigger warning.

I have a lot that goes on in my head. For context, I grew up being neglected and abused (mostly emotional and mental but I have also been physically abused, just not to the extreme like the other two) and I started doing drugs when I was 18. I smoke weed everyday in place of prescription medication since I have been off of them for almost 1 year now, and I also occasionally do psychedelics (acid mostly, but I have tried shrooms and salvia). On top of this I have diagnosed depression, and I was diagnosed with PTSD but my last therapist didn’t think I have it. This is where the questions come in.

Since November last year, I fell into probably one of the longest and most intense depressive episodes I’ve ever had. I don’t actually think it’s over to be honest but I’m also unsure. But since November I’ve picked up old and new symptoms. Old symptoms being auditory hallucinations, rapid mood swings, low self esteem. All of these have come back but have been in full force for months, and are stronger than they have ever been before. The hallucinations are louder, the mood swings are so quick I can just stop mid-sob and feel fine, and the self esteem has never been lower.

The new symptoms I’ve noticed make the old ones feel even more scary and intense. I wake up, immediately disappointed I am not dead or someone else. I look in the mirror and cry over how I don’t look like how I see myself in my head. I laugh at nothing, or the wrong things, and it’s uncontrollable. I slip into a totally different mindset, thinking and acting as if I am a completely different person for however long until I (the person typing) return to this “state” I guess. I can love a person so much I’d do anything for them and let them do anything they want to/for me, and yet literally 2 seconds later I can wish that same person was dead. I am never consistent in my words and actions and tend to be extremely flip-floppy and indecisive to a fault.

As you can see, I’m essentially a dumpster fire as a human. I just... I just need some sort of clue, any idea of what I’m working with. I used to be that kind of person who looked into mental health stuff waaay too much while also being a slight hypochondriac, so I’m really trying to avoid looking anything up. I just want to dump this here, and if any of you decide to give your two cents on this, then great. If not, that’s fine too.

Thank you to those who took the time to read this. I hope you all have better days than I’m having."
1720,"Publishing Augur Of light, the game that was supposed to help coping with mental health issues.","Hi! It's me again, I've posted here before. We started a brave project to make a game that helps people with depression to cope better. Here's the fruit of our labor in a trailer

[https://youtu.be/YwalVTJV5LY](https://youtu.be/YwalVTJV5LY)

 Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, between 76% and 85% of people in low- and middle- income countries receive no treatment for their disorder. This is the problem we are trying to tackle. And we want to make games that matter. 

We're not sure if the game is helpful, as more testing needs to be done, but we hope you enjoy the experience nonetheless.

We put the game out for free, because it's not 100% done yet. And hope that you enjoy playing it as much as we liked making it

Thank you!

1721,I just need to vent a bit. You can completely ignore this.,"On classroom, a teacher of mine put a post saying that if anyone is struggling, we can reach out to him. Since I've been struggling a lot with my anxiety and depression lately, I reached out, which is the first time I've reached out for my mental health. He suggested that I talk to the school's social worker because she would be able to help more than he would since she's actually trained. So I did.

During our conversation, she asked if I wanted to talk to my parents about or if I would rather she did. I said that I would rather leave them out of it, which she said was fine but still suggested I talk to them about it. 

A little further into our conversation, she asked me a question and then left the room. I feel like I should mention that I was typing into the chat since I wasn't comfortable talking, and I also didn't want my parents to overhear or eavesdrop what we were talking about because I wanted to leave them out of the whole situation. 

Anyways, she left the room while I was typing, which I don't think she should've done, but whatever. Now, sometimes Google Meet does this thing where it doesn't automatically scroll down when someone sends a message to the chat. And it did that, and since she was in another room when I sent the answer, she didn't know that I responded when she came back.

After about five minutes of just sitting there, she apparently thought I was doing something potentially dangerous to myself in the middle of a Google Meet and had someone call my mom and tell her everything that was going on. 

Which is, you know, the last thing I wanted to come of this.

So I'm very upset and now I feel like I can't trust professionals with this stuff anymore because I feel like they're just gonna do the one thing I don't want them to do."
1722,Is anyone else constantly being underestimated?,"I really hate it, pretty much my entire life even when I actually have a valid solution to a problem people don’t want to listen and pretty much just ignore what I’m saying but alot of the time I actually turn out to be correct

It even happened today - last night the light bulb in our oven went off so I took it out so I’d know which ones to order, ordered a pack on Amazon which arrived today (I ordered it this morning with same day delivery) and I left a note explaining the light went out but the oven still works, not to touch the glass dome that covers the bulb that I left on the side etc and they were doubting me throughout and acting as if I were about to do an operation on a dying person or something, once I actually changed the bulb and the oven light came on again as usual they were apologising for doubting me and saying they were proud of me but at the same time it annoys me that they doubted me in the first place it’s literally just changing a light bulb

I just hate how people always seem to underestimate and doubt me even when I’m correct"
1723,Nothing really. I just want to type it out.,"Well, hello, people of Reddit. This post is probably going to be veeeery long and spontaneous, so if you don't want to read it, I understand. But I would really appreciate it if someone would at least take a look, or upvote, so people can see. (also please forgive my bad english :))

I am a 14 year old girl. I only recognized a few years ago, that I've been a victim of emotional abuse my entire life. As a small child, I've always thought that it was completely normal to be afraid of your own mother. But turns out, most people don't get hours of terror just for not greeting a stranger in the street.
I have no self-esteem, no friends, nothing. I am terrified when I have to be around people. For so long, I thought that it was my fault. My mother sometimes tells me that I'm beautiful, and how proud she is. But sometimes she tells me that I'm a stupid whore, a disappointment, and that I should die as well. Whenever I disagree with something, she starts screaming at me for hours, then she gives me the silent treatment. Sometimes this can go on for days. This made me hide my emotions and bottle up everything inside. Whenever I have problems, she doesn't take me seriously because ""she gives me everything."" But money is NOT everything. It got to the point where I don't feel good anywhere at all. I hate my school (so glad that I'm leaving this year) but I also hate being at home because of the constant anxiety. Even if I'm not the reason she's mad, she gives me the shit for it. She's mad at me for not talking to her, but whenever I try to talk to hear, she tells EVERYTHING to her friends literally 5 minutes later. Note that this is a small village, therefore everyone knows everyone. The gossip is fucking real. But she does really fucked up things as well. I have memories from when I was small, and she put her hands around my neck as if she wanted to choke me, but my dad stopped her. Last summer she hit me and I almost got a black eye, it was so swollen. Anytime we met someone, she made me lie about it and said that I just ran into something by accident. She never lets me have ANY privacy, she comes into the bathroom while I'm bathing, or even taking a shit, she randomly falls asleep in my bed whenever she feels like it, and whennI even try to kindly mention it, and ask her not to do that, I'm the piece of shit. Of course. Sometimes I wonder: Why me? I've always been a very well behaved, quiet kid, even as a baby, I didn't cry as much as other babies. I still consider myself very well behaved. I've never smoked, never drank more than a small glass of champagne, never done drugs, never snuck out, never had sex, never skipped classes, I am also a straight A student, so I don't do ""teenager things"". I always try my best, but she' s slowly destroying my life, and I just have to sit quietly and... handle it I guess.. what else can I do? I have nowhere to go at 14. I don't think I can handle her for 4 more years, I'm either going to commit suicide or go fucking insane. The local police officers are literally her fucking friends. No one in this fucking village knows about the things she does to me, and no one would ever believe me.
I'm gonna keep it short now because this is getting insanely long. So I really want to do something about this. 2 of my grandparents live like 3 houses away, so I cannot move to them. My other grandma lives pretty far away, and I already got accepted into a high school. How should I cope? How can I not go insane in this household? Am I overreacting and I'm really just a spoiled kid? I have no idea. Yesterday we had a huge fight. I'm feeling terrified every time she opens the front door. If you read all of this, and you can't help, i don't care, I still appreciate you for taking your time. I just really want to end my fucking life, I'm not going to live 4+ more years with her."
1724,"I was looking at a website about Social Anxiety Disorder, as I suspect I might have it. I saw a section about telling someone about it, and as I imagined myself telling my parents about my suspicions, I burst into tears.","As the title said. I couldn’t control myself for about 20 minutes. I don’t know if a fear of this is normal or not. How do I go about telling my parents about my thoughts? Any time I even think of doing it, I become extremely stressed and nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

1726,Anyone else?,Is anyone else getting really tired of people treating sensory sensitivities like some sort of phobia that you can just get over or deal with? Like I have a phobia of loud sudden sounds. I have a sensitivity to high pitched sounds and intense temperatures. There is a big difference between the two people.
1727,I'm so scared,"I'm 19, I recently finished high school and I'll have my final exams in about two weeks. And I've never thought I would be alive right now. I have anxiety and depression since few years, I've never cared about my future, because I was constantly telling myself that ""I'll just kill myself before going to high school"", then it changed to ""I'll  just kill myself before the final exams or graduation"". And look, here I am, still alive, two weeks to fucking exams. I know it may sound stupid, but I can't force myself to learn or make any plans for the future. I stay in bed whole day or play computer games to distract myself, otherwise I would go insane. I'm stressed all the time, like, very very stressed. I sleep two or three hours a day, because I'm too stressed to just calmly fall asleep. I started having panic attacks every day. I feel like I'm about to cry all the time. And I do cry a lot. I don't know, it just to much for me. How could I even be able to pass these exams? Dammit, how could I go to school as if nothing had happened and just sit in the class for few hours a day without throwing up, crying, shaking, having panic attacks or any other stupid things I can't control? And what am I supposed to do after (if at all) passing these exams? I'm to scared to go to the university and because of my depression I don't really enjoy anything, literally, nothing is pleasant, entertaining, interesting for me, so there's nothing I would enjoy doing. If I could, I would stay in my room forever. 

It's not like I want to kill myself right now, but I also don't wanna live, you know. Everything is too stressful and I'm so so so fucking scared all the time. It's so difficult. I don't know what I should do now, I'm not even sure I'll be able to go take all these exams.

Also I take meds, although I'm not sure my current ones are working properly. And because of the isolation I couldn't contact with any therapist. 

Thank you for reading, I needed to write it all somewhere"
1728,Does depression make anyone else overly sensitive?,Like I can't even have people touch me because it hurts and light and sound just make my skin crawl or make me break into a cold sweat. Anyone else have this?
1729,I just realized that ADHD might be the reason why I have been running regularly for 7 years.,That's kinda funny and weird. I guess we like to move sometimes.
1730,"Untitled, unimportant.","I'm laughing inside of my head right now. I don't want to think or be conscious right now so I'm focusing on these words I'm typing just to relieve the pain. Why can't I stop my brain from laughing at me? Why can't I stop thinking of myself as nothing more than a joke? Why do the people around me who I once cared about start to hate me? If life is this sick of a joke, when does it stop being funny? I look in the mirror just to see my stupid face, to see the evil monster who created and destroyed any hope of being a successful person or even just a content person. I'm useless, I'm hopeless and I'm no one, I don't know who I even am. When is it time to check into a mental hospital?"
1731,"I believe my father might be a narcissist, and I don't know what to do...","I am not really an expert on this, so I thought I would come here to ask for help. I believe my father is a narcissist.

Before I begin, I feel slightly obligated to say that I have Asperger's, ADHD, and Anxiety Disorder. Sometimes, I may tend to look at bad situations as worse than what they really are, so with that in consideration, I don't know if my father is really a narcissist or if I am just over exaggerating with this post. I will allow my fellow Redditors to be the judge of that. I would also like to say that I am a sixteen year old male, mainly because it might help people understand this a bit more in some way.

Anyways, my father has some of the characteristics of a narcissist. For starters, he is very egotistical. He thinks very highly of himself, and he tends to brag about himself. When people don't understand him or don't do things as fast as he does, he tends to make fun of them and secretly cuss them out. For example, the other day, when we were in the McDonald's drive thru getting dinner, there was a woman who was taking a bit too long to grab her food and drive off. He called her a slightly unpleasant name and said things along the lines of, ""Sometime today would be nice,"" and ""Can't you be any slower?"" The woman was not even taking that long. However, despite this, my father claims himself to be a ""very patient person."" He also says he has a ""tendency to be right most of the time.""

Not only does my father brag about himself, but he also brags about me and my older sister. My sister made all A's and B's her high school career, was in the top ten of her class, and is having her college tuition completely paid for. Not to mention, she also was in a lot of clubs and made a very good impression of herself with her teachers. I am an all A student, and I am the current salutatorian of my class. My best friend is actually the current valedictorian. Also like my sister, I am in a lot of clubs, and I am also the treasurer of my class.

Any chance my father gets, he uses me and my sister's accomplishments as a way to brag to people. He always makes sure to do it when me and my sister are around, as well.

My father can also become very angry and impatient at times for no reason at all. My father also considers himself a ""helpful guy,"" but when people don't appreciate his help or thank him, he becomes very angry. I believe helping others is one of his ways of manipulating people into doing what he wants. My father also tends to borrow money from me, and when he does, he sweet talks me and tells me that me and him are a ""team,"" and he also tells me that I am a very helpful guy. He never takes responsibility for his actions, and he HATES admitting that he is wrong. My father has also only ever apologized once or twice to me in his entire life. My father is divorced from my mother, who he frequently talks bad about. My father also loves being the center of attention.

I don't know if I am overreacting or not, but I believe my father is a narcissist. My father, however, does provide for me. He gives me food, a place to sleep, WiFi, and of course the essential wants and needs of any teenage boy, but he also sometimes holds this over my head. 

All I want is maybe someone to talk to and someone to maybe tell me whether I am right or wrong.

I am sorry if this post was too long. Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a great day! :)"
1732,Any other hypochondriac?,"I feel really anxiously constantly
in this pandemic how have you been coping?"
1733,Hating myself for being depressed,"First time posting. Not really even sure why I'm writing this but I just feel like I need to talk about it before things get worse.

So a while back I was in a much worse place in life. I didn't have a steady job, I was barely making rent, I was failing school, and I felt like I was falling out of love with my long time SO. This felt like a yearly cycle where I would spiral down but then get a little hope or change to my situation only to sink even lower. I managed to pull myself back from the depths of depression after months of wrestling with the thought of ending it all. I didn't reach out to anyone, I didn't want to bother them with my problems, I just one day decided to try something different and I started acting like I was happy. 

It led to big changes in my life. I got a job, I moved to a better place, and I feel closer in my relationship. But even though I recognize all of that as positive change I am still deeply dissatisfied with life. Ultimately I feel that acting like I'm happy led to all this but it didn't fix the problem of being unhappy, it just masked it. Now I'm starting to feel like this is just how I am and no matter how good life gets I may not ever truly be happy. Some part of me is always going to be hidden away and gnawing at the back of my mind trying to drag me back into depression. Is this just how it is? Will I always have to struggle to be content with where I am in life? 


TLDR; Young adult down on his luck decides to fake being happy. Things start to turn around for him but deep down he knows he is still depressed and hates himself for feeling that way. What do?"
1734,feel lesser compared to my siblings,"being in quarantine has rly brought a lot of these feelings to surface where i just constantly compare myself to my siblings. i just don’t know where i fit, im so obsessed with the idea of having a specific position being the funny one or the pretty one or crazy one but i just feel so much less interesting. my parents also point how i’m always by myself and never being crazy and loud with them like i’m just so drained and exhausted i just don’t have it in me right now.

not to mention my siblings constantly bring up my past. they’re always talking about how i quiet and awkward i used to be, everytime we dig up old albums i leave the room so i don’t have to hear them laugh about how i unhappy i looked in pictures. like yeah i was being traumatised and bullied what do u expect me to do??????? 

idk it’s just really tiring recently the only thing i can do is just ignore it but then they get mad at me for not hanging out with them.
this post is all over the place but yh just needed to rant for a bit"
1735,A year ago I left my abusive relationship... A week ago I left my abusive job!,"Not here to ramble or ask for claps, just wanted to say that after 30 years of feeling hopeless... I finally realized I have control over my life. Getting rid of the pieces that have been dragging my mental health down has been the most HEALING thing I've ever done! And it all started with one decision. Literally a different person than I was a year ago. I can't imagine going back to who I was!"
1736,I live my life though strict deadlines.,"I don’t know why but I literally set strict deadlines for everything, eating, sleeping, cleaning, relationships, everything. I live my life minuet by minuet trying to efficiently complete tasks and goals on a timeline set in my head."
1737,What’s this called,"I’m a really really social person. Cause when I’m alone I get really intensely sad but as soon as I’m with another person those feelings disappear and I’m extremely happy. It’s not really a huge issue because I have family and friends that I see often, but I was just wondering why I might feel this way or if there’s a name for it other than just being extroverted. Would really appreciate the help :)"
1738,So here’s what bothers me. I started thinking of a todo list in my head.,"Then I decided to write it down. Then I got side tracked &amp; didn’t touch for a day. The next day I found it; &amp; decided I need to start over. But then I just thought, wait maybe I should be typing this. So I was just about to restart it &amp; then decided that it doesn’t matter I just need to finish it. But then instead I thought that this was a weird thing that I do, thought I was weird, &amp; now I’m writing this reddit post about it


Edit; &amp; then everything that’s happening feels related directly towards me. Songs remind me of myself, TV shows, etc."
1739,Does my recent drug use indicate I may be depressed?,"Before a few weeks ago the only drug I had ever used was weed, just smoked to ease my mind sometimes. However, the past 5 weeks I’ve been taking cocaine, to feel a little bit of light, only to feel the horrors the next day.

I’m asking because I don’t know if I have a mental illness, and I can’t go to the GP at the min due to COVID. I don’t feel particularly suicidal, but I do have a hard time finding pleasure in things, I seldom have hobbies and I’ve been feeling low more regularly, like giving myself a hard time, inside my mind.

I’m worried that drug use could be a sign that I am depressed, I have some friends , a family that love me, and I try my best in my life, but I have a big problem with my self esteem, which is really low, and I always feel anxious too, like I worry and think the worse a lot, every day.

Does it sound like I need to see a doctor?

Edit: any I don’t mean every day, just binges on Saturday night."
1740,I want to die,"I don't really want to die, I just want life to end. Like I feel like I'm nothing. I gave a hint to my mom that I should go to counseling(this was before corona). she didn't care. I told her that it hurts when she compares me to others, she still does it. 
But like I feel like you need some backstory. When I was 7, a family friend almost raped me. I haven't told anyone, until I was 13. I opened up to my mom. she said that everything will be ok. I believed her. My father doesn't know. This happened at my grandma, so when I do to her I tried to avoid him. My mom still wants me to go to him and his wife( to get stuff like milk or cheese). I never.
So anyway very since 7, I was depressed. I closed myself, started gaining weight and my classmates started bullying me. I never told anyone. In 6th grade, I switch schools. I thought I would be happy. But ever since with the quarantine I feel miserable. 
I want to kill myself, and i even wrote a suicide letter. I'm not even 14.
If you read this far, thank you. I really appreciate it.
(also I made from Romania if that helps with anything)"
1741,Need advice on seeking medication during COVID,"Hello all. I hope that everyone has been maintaining and trying to stay healthy during these crazy times. 
I am posting wondering if anyone knew any resources or ways I could find a new psychiatrist to prescribe medication during quarantine. 
I have seen several psychiatrists in the past, my most recent one being from my college town which i graduated last year. However, he is no longer working and would not be able to write a scrip for me.

Are there any easy ways/online services that offer psychiatry  without having to go in for a physical appointment? Im looking to get back on medication as soon as possible.
Thank you all."
1742,[Potential Trigger Warning] How Do You Persuade Someone To Understand That Suicide Isn't Cowardly And Depression Isn't A Choice?,"My boyfriend and I have spoken about Suicide in the past and he says that it is cowardly and that no matter what, things will always get better. While I agree that there is always a way, those who turn to suicide may be fooled into thinking that there is no other way out than to take their own life. He doesn't understand the concept of your mind being against you and doesn't understand that Depression can be extremely irrational and can fool yourself into thinking things that aren't even true. That Depression can fog up your perception of reality. Is there no other way to convince my boyfriend other than for him to eventually go through it himself? He seems sort of narrow minded in that sense, though he always fights to be understanding and helpful to those he cares for that are struggling. 
Any ideas?"

1745,Marks Worsened my Depression,"I don't know if this is worthy enough to post, so many people have worse situations then me that deserve to be heard. But I just feel good typing this out even if nobody is listening. I am covered in marks across my entire body everywhere, (yes, in fact stretch marks). I have no reason I can say to be proud of them, they are not from pregnancy or something that can be deemed a happy reason. They are from my horrible eating habits and puberty. I feel awful about them, I feel like a monster some days. I wonder if anyone would ever love me like this. I am incredibly self conscious to the point I'll wear clothes when bathing. Thank you for listening to my venting if you read this far."
1746,Is it common to outgrow social anxiety?,"I’m 17 and I’ve had pretty serious social anxiety since I was 15. It’s something that has completely disrupted my life. I was happy and carefree throughout my early childhood, and now I cant get through a single day without my anxiety crippling me. The strange thing is that from the outside I seem like a completely normal, well adjusted kid. I’m definitely an introvert but I have no problem fitting in and making friends. I’m actually fairly popular at school. But any situation that involves more than 1 or 2 people (i.e. school, family gatherings, and social events) immediately stresses me out. This makes simple things like going to school, going to work, or hanging out with friends fucking terrifying. My hands, feet, and underarms start sweating uncontrollably to the point where I can only wear black or white shirts, and I dread shaking hands with anyone. 

My anxiety is a huge problem at school because I’m surrounded by 20+ people constantly. I love learning new skills and concepts, and my classmates are generally fun people to be around, and yet I suffer through the entire school day simply because of my social anxiety. Obviously, this has severely disrupted my life. The only time I’m ever truly comfortable is when I’m alone (and even then I sometimes feel anxious).

My biggest worry is that my anxiety is going to completely derail my life and inhibit me from achieving my goals. I’ve always excelled at school, and I’ve always dreamt of becoming a physician. I’m not naive, and I know that it’s an incredibly difficult thing to pursue but I know I have the intellectual capacity to do it. The problem is my social anxiety might inhibit me from accomplishing this goal. If I can barely get through a day of high school just because of my anxiety, how can I expect to succeed in college, and med school?

My question is— do teenagers often outgrow social anxiety like this? Can I look forward to a brighter future or will I be forever burdened with this anxiety?

Honest advice would be greatly appreciated."
1747,"Don't know where else to post this but, I don't know what else to do","Hi all. As the title states I don't know if this is a good place to post this but it's seriously making me feel like shit. 

For context, I work in a pharmacy and at a time like this that doesn't really help.

About 3 months ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me, it wasn't a bad breakup or anything and we left things quite happily with the promise of hopefully staying friends eventually but that's still weighing on me. I'm much less affected by it now but with recent events it's just getting to me again. At work I was supposed to do a test to get a qualification which actually allows me to work there (My Medical counter assistant course level 2 for reference) but I failed that because I was just not having a good day. Not only that but I tried to upgrade my computer parts recently but I have now ended up fucking it all up somehow (Firstly there was a motherboard/powersupply problem that I fixed by getting ALL new parts, then my NEW powersupply shorted and potentially broke my NEW motherboard costing me even more money). Now all that is enough to really damage my already low mood but to top it off, i've come to the realization that my dog is not long for this world. He's been coughing so much more recently (because of his heart) and just now I swear he was gasping for breath, but it could have been a particularly back cough. Now pair all this with my really bad back pain that just won't go away no matter what medication I try and you get extreme mental breakdowns. I just honestly don't know what to do anymore and I don't know how much more of this I can take. It is just constantly getting worse for me and I'm starting to loose it more than I already had.

I apologize if this post seems like a grasp for attention or to get sympathy, it's not. I just want help. 

I also want to clarify that I am not suicidal and haven't had suicidal thoughts. I'm just loosing it.

If this post isn't good for this sub-reddit please let me know and Ill happily delete it and move it somewhere else."
1748,I think I'm going to end up doing something stupid,"Life is unfair, I'm filled with anger depression, anxiety, and jealousy.

I've been narcissistic for a while. I don't know how to cope with it. I hate it I don't want it. I want to be a good person. I want friends and I want to be a good son, brother and partner.. One day father, grandfather, etc.. I've never held a good relationship. I hold grudges I burn bridges. I hate myself. I get suicidal. Depressed. Anxious. Lonely. I've had trouble in school in the past and used to drink and do drugs frequently. I am antisocial but i want to be around people. I want to be outside enjoying life. I want to further my career. I want to be successful and have a good life and brighten other peoples lives. I want to make the world a better place. I want to have an impact. I don't want to be useless. I don't feel like anyone wants me around or wants anything to do with me. I don't know what it is or how to fix it. I must be narcissistic. I always put myself first. I put others down. It seems like there's no hope but I refuse to believe that. I want to be selfless. I want to help people. Obviously I want to help myself.. How else am I supposed to help people? I feel so lost and I don't know where to go. I'm looking for work.. I probably make myself out to be more than I am. I don't know where to go. I feel like such a loser. I feel like I have no friends . I don't know who to talk to. I don't know how to get better.. I want to know what others think of me. I'm insecure. If i found out what they saw or what they thought or knew.. maybe I would be able to make myself better.. I don't know. I don't know if you're there or if your going to read this or anyone is but it's worth a shot. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just want help. Please. I don't have money for therapy. I don't even have a damn health care card. I have no job. I'm living at my moms. I barely see anyone. I just want to be around people. Laugh. Have fun. Struggle. Live. I feel so up and down. Like I'm all good and then I hate myself again."
1750,Are things really going to be okay?,"I feel like Im going crazy. I just want someone to tell the things are going to be ok. It’s in the middle of the night and my sleepy girlfriend who doesn’t answer my questions makes me think on my parent when they are drunk. It makes me feel so fucking bad and disgusting and I feel like I’m not real. No one is. No one talks to me and really talks. It feels like everyone is an npc. I want to cry. I’m so alone. Who the fuck made me this way. I would rather be dead a lot. I want you to talk to me like a real living person with interest. I talk to much. I ask to many questions. I would love a hug right now. No one is telling me that everything will be ok. Why won’t anyone tell me everything’s going to be ok. What if I do something I won’t regret???? I need to talk to a real person. 

Does anyone feel like me? Is anyone alone and miserable? 
I feel so starved, it feels like I’ve never ever in my life ever eaten something that would fuel me up.
My parent are fighting and my mother won’t go to the hospital despite having problems and pains. 

The good thing is that I cough a frog today. It was exiting. I released it after I took some pictures. 

Does anyone need a friend because I do"
1751,My boyfriend has schizophrenia and I don’t know what to do. Please help.,"I’m sorry this is a long story. 

Background: I started dating him when I was 14. I’m now 20 and so is he. We broke up our freshman year of college. We were separated for about a year then he messaged me out of the blue asking me if he could take me out and I let him. We ended up sleeping with each other that night and getting back together. We’ve been back together for about 2 months. I was aware he had some little issues such as anxiety but his family didn’t tell me everything that had happened between our break up. We had both went into the ward while we were broken up. Mine was for untreated  BPD and his was for him seeing things and hearing things. 

Last night: last night he came over and I was not aware that he was on a antipsychotic. I was told by him that he was only on anxiety medication and his hallucinations had came from him being extremely stressed out. Which I had been through so I believed him. Well we drank about 4 beers a piece and he walked into my hallway and screamed bloody murder. He started saying stuff that wasn’t true such as him being molested by his father (I know this isn’t true because his father passed away when he was young.) I tried to get it under control and got him calm but crying to me about a girl that he broke up with while we were broken up. (His mom told me he was never talking to someone while we were broken up.) he even told me that there was a female voice in his head that wanted to hurt my feelings because it wanted me to break up with him because it didn’t want him to be happy and loved. He even came out as bisexual to me. (Which I don’t know if he was serious or not) He hasn’t been diagnosed with schizophrenia but I’m sure that is what’s going on. Well I called his mom because I still couldn’t get him to go back to normal and she came and picked him up. It took us about an hour to talk him into getting in the car and he told his mom he hated her and wanted to stay with me. He then screamed out of his moms car that I was using him for sex. I immediately started crying as I walked back to my front door and then he opened the door and said, “I love you.” And I said, “I love you too babe.” And his mom drove off. I went to my room, lit a cig and balled my eyes out for the first time since I was really unstable. Finally he got home and slept. His older brother called me and told me he had been arrested and sent to the ward while he was at work. He’d been missing for 3 days before they found out where he was. (We were broken up at this time and he told me that he willingly went to the ward himself.) 

Today: This morning he is still acting off but super scared imma break up with him over this. Which I don’t want to do. He is now telling me he hates his family and that he doesn’t understand why this is happening to him. 

Concerns: I’ve loved this man since I was 14 years old but at the same time I don’t know if this is what I want with my life. Idk If imma ever  have a normal life with him or how this is going to effect my mental health because I have issues of my own. Having BPD and I am terrified of being abandoned. The fact I don’t think we will ever be stable scares me. I want to have kids and have a normal household but I don’t know if I can ever have that with him. I don’t know if I should break up with him or stay and try to help the best I can. He’s supposed to going to the phycologist in June to help with a diagnosis. 

Questions I have: 

1. Should I continue this relationship dispute me have my own mental health issues? 

2. Can we have a normal life together? 

3. Will he be able to be a good father if we do have children later on? 

4. Can he recover and ever go back to who he was a year ago?

5. How can I help him recover? 

6. How do I deal with the manic episodes? 

7. Any advice?"
1752,I’m really paranoid at night and I don’t know what to do anymore!,"Sorry if this has any grammar and spelling mistakes I honestly can’t be bothered to check and also I am not sure whether I should post it here but I don’t have anywhere else.Hey reddit.So I have always found it hard to sleep to the point where even if I stay up all night and get to 7:00am I’m still not tired so my whole life I have disliked sleeping as I could be doing something else.But yesterday I was just on my phone at night (even though I am not allowed to be on it and supposed to be asleep) and I heard a noise.After hearing this noise for a few times I sat up and got my phone light on.Then I discovered a bug on my bed.After a whole of panicking and trying to get it off I threw my covers off and just started crying and shaking.Luckily,my best friend stays up late into the night so I texted her and she managed to get me to calm down a bit.After a while (like 1 hour) I was finally able to get some sleep but now I’m really paranoid about a bug being on my bed.I already have arachnophobia and now I believe that I have a phobia of some bugs.I can’t sleep and I really just want to rest and then in the morning it will be fine but  I can’t because every 3 minutes I get paranoid and feel like I have to check my bed and the surrounding area.Does anyone know anything that can help me?Please at this point I’m desperate.Thank you."

1755,Is this normal?,"So I have kept this quiet from anyone I know for a long time. I have managed to ignore it, and push the blame to whatever else I could think of. Yesterday, I told a friend of mine that sometimes I have thoughts that i wouldn't really consider my own. I don't hear voices, I would not classify it as voices and the thoughts do not sound like anyone specifically, but I dont really recognize them as something that I am directly thinking. 

Sometimes the thoughts have to do with what I'm doing other times it is kind of random. Sometimes they are full sentences, sometimes just phrases or words. Sometimes it feels like I'm having conversations in my head and I answer them (in my head, or with body language) 

So writing this all down, it doesnt seem like this is normal behavior. And right now, as I'm beginning to think to myself that this cant be normal behavior, thoughts pour in that ""I'm fine, I'm being dramatic"" etc etc"
1756,Thought this would be helpful,
1757,I used to be charismatic. Now I have a hard time getting words out.,"I'm not good at many things naturally.  I *was* however born with the gift of gab, which has been a total curse and blessing all at the same time.  I've always suffered from a range of social anxiety, but as I've (27M) have gotten older, it's gotten out of control.  I'm nervous and scared in every social situation outside of interacting with my wife and kids (wife is 27, kids are 8, 5, 2, 9mo).  

I can barely make words when asking for cigarettes at the gas station, or can't control my volume very well.  I do Zoom meetings for college, and I want to ask questions, but I just stare at the the un-mute button until they change topics.  If I do end up mustering up the courage, the second I do it feels like my breathing gets shaky, my heart drops, and I can hear my heartbeat cranked up to 11.  I feel like my words won't come out, or my brain will scramble everything.   Also it doesn't help that my brain keeps swapping letters around as if I'm dyslexic.   And I've become so awkward.  My existence is awkward, my walk is awkward, the way I just look at people when they talk not knowing what to say and not caring is just absolutely awkward.  Such an uncomfortable existence now-a-days.  I used to be able to talk people down from their mental breakdowns, and really be genuine.  I guess I feel cold now too.

Other things going on are random auditory hallucinations that I've convinced myself is from stress.  I keep hearing people yelling up to me from downstairs, like my name or whistling.  I'm the only person in my house who can whistle, and sometimes I'll be the only one home.  It's simply horrifying even if it's just stress.  Also keep having paranoia and delusions about people around me.  Like cars wanting to run me over, or people following me on the road.  Thinking every car that pulls up next to me is going to blow my brains out through the window.  But it's weird because I'm not totally floating away in my brain, I maintain reason, but still feel the anxiety.

I don't know; just a rant I suppose."
1758,Why can't I ever do anything right?,"I really thought this was the year. I thought 2020 was the year I finally started trying to turn my life around. Boy, was I fucking wrong. It's only May and I'm ready for this garbage year to be over. Coronavirus fucked up my spring semester, I've mentally checked out, somebody hit my car the day before yesterday so I had to get a rental car while my car gets fixed and literally THE DAY AFTER I get the rental, I scratch up the side mirror because this car is huge compared to my car and I'm not used to it. It might seem trivial, but it's really soured my mood and now I'm just frustrated with myself per usual. I feel like I'm destined to forever be a screwup... this sucks"

Ok, so i dont know where to post this, but i really do need an answere to this - if there really is an answere at all? I hope you can help me figure it out.

So the reason why im writing this and is in the need of answeres, is because today i had a really bad flashback (kind of?). I have no idea whats happening in the flashback, whos there etc. only that im scared SHITLESS. The flashback lasts maybe 2 seconds, but it terrifies me SO bad. The same flashback happens maybe once a year, but nothing triggers it. Its from my childhood, and i (as an adult, 23f) am not scared, but i as a child is so incredible scared. Its something happening or something has happened, and multiple times i think, because the feeling is SO familiar. And its not like a «scared of a dog» feeling, but i can feel it through my bones. And as an adult i KNOW that no child (or adult) should experience this feeling. But the problem is that i cannot recall the flashback after ive had it, so i dont know whats happening. I have had a great childhood, nothing bad has ever happened. So, what is this? What is the reason? Im starting to think that its something traumatizing that has happened in my childhood and my mind has forced me to forget it."
