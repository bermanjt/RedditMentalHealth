0,Fuck knows I got no one I can talk to,"everyone I know is either struggling themself or just not the kind of person I’d talk about stuff like this with.

Fact is, I’m doing like shit and I need someone.
Can anyone spare a bit of time and talk to me?"
1,Was he an adult?,"So I wanna know if the guy who raped me was an adult or teenager. This guy told me that he was 16 at the time and I was 15. I barley knew him. He had a lot of facial hair that he shaved, he was 6’2”, he seemed to know what he wanted (to rape me), he seemed off and I had a bad feeling about him. My family saw him once too and didn’t believe me that he was only 16. What are some symptoms of an adult vs teenager? How likely was it that he lied about his age? Feel free to ask me any questions."
2,Help in need,[removed]
3,How to stop having unrealistic ideas,"I have come to the conclusion I have way to high standards. And this sets me up to become disappointed and incredibly angry. 
I have a picture in my mind and when it doesn’t come out that way I get upset. I end up being a grumpy pants and I can say or act mean to people I love. Today I almost lost my shit over a quesadilla. I had to remain calm and I was proud that I was polite to the waitress and my husband so I definitely felt like I won that battle but then I get crazy thoughts like my husband is going to go get me a quesadilla on the way home since I didn’t eat. I know my husband loves me but his little man mind doesn’t think that far ahead so I know better that I have to get that thought out or when he gets home I’ll be disappointed. I don’t want to expect more out of people and I don’t want to think unrealistically I do this to everyone I know. And I kill my relationship what can I do to stop this habit"
4,Looking for some guidance,So I’ve gone to my parents about anxiety and asked to see a doctor. They insisted than medication from a doctor will not fix my problem and that I should talk to them about my anxiety to cure it. I denied them and said I wanted to get a prescription from a doctor and see how I improve.  I have not seen a doctor because they insisted it wouldn’t help. I am now 18 and can see a doctor on my own but I’m not sure how I would pay for it or what to do. Any thoughts?
5,Venting/not knowing what's wrong with me.,"Lately I've been feeling down.
I'm a normal-ish teenage guy(15)
This week was catastrofic due to some outside factors and my stupidity.
I've been getting  bullied/picked on for a while now and it's getting worse and worse...
I've been called a retard by a girl I literally never had a conversation with.(only maybe a word or 2)
I even started to self harm and it's the only relief in life I have. Unfortunatelly gaming/anime/reading just feel empty and I kinda lost interest.
I hate myself for maybe like 3 to 4 years(still do) and I'm bad at dealling with stress/talking about how I feel and I'm a isolated introvert. (Have no friends)
2 days ago I got a girl next to me into trouble because she tried to explain the task(maths) to me and teacher saw her and yelled at her...if only I didn't look like an idiot then maybe she wouldn't have gotten into trouble...
I can still feel happiness(like when you buy a game and play it) but after an hour it just feels...empty.
I can laugh at something and after a couple of moments feel empty.
Tbh, since my tics calmed a bit my mental health has beed pretty solid...but not it just keeps going down...
I feel like a failure, I'm even starting to hate my existance.
I feel like I can't trust anyone...like I was backstabed because teachers won't help me and my mum tells me to ignore it...
I may be over reacting...but I feel cornered...
Maybe these problems will just go away...at least I hope it will.
And I can't see a psychologist(not even sure if my school even has one) or a psychiatrist without a good reasson so I decided to just vent a bit here.

 
Anyway, thanks for reading."
6,Why do people hate me so much ?,"I really don’t understand why people hate me so much - i am nice person.
I can’t get friends or girlfriend it’s not cool, because everyone can get friends, relationships why not me?
I am good looking too, and girls even said that to me, but they don’t give me a chance to be my girlfriend or even be my female friend. 
I’m alone all the time, i walk alone somewhere and i see teenagers (same age as me) and they are hanging out with friends - partying, doing some stuff.
When i tried to make friends - i got ignored, why ? 
I’m just feeling like everything in this world is not real i am the only person here i feel like that."
7,Finding a therapist and medication has been SO goddamn hard and it's getting to me.,"I'm a grad student with ADHD and C-PTSD.  Up until December, I was on my parents insurance plan, which was an HMO.  In other words, in the town I came from (2.5hrs from my university), it's excellent and covers everything, but I'm SOL if I need anything where I live now.  In other words, if I want to see a psychiatrist, it's gotta be in my hometown, and during the week when I have class.  So that means, more or less, that I couldn't see a psychiatrist.

I've been seeing a LMHC all of last semester.  She was fantastic. Unfortunately, at the start of this semester, she canceled my sessions 5 times in a row.  The previous semester, she'd canceled on me around 4 times, but it was more spread-out, and I was more willing to look past it since she was so good when I actually got in to see her.

Meanwhile, I can't get medication for my ADHD because my GP is scared to prescribe me anything due to my co-occurring anxiety disorder.  He referred me to a psychiatrist, but every psychiatrist in my current town is booked for like 2 months out.  My semester is 3 months long

Right now, I'm really overwhelmed by ADHD symptoms.  I've gotten really good at managing them over time, but right now none of my coping strategies are working.  I'm feeling very impulsive, very short of attention, and very distractable.  I'm not retaining much of anything when I try and study.  I'm not allowed to get less than a B on any of my classes (I'll have to retake), and I have a crazy course load plus intense clinic days.

I see the thing that I think would help me, but I don't think I can get it when I need it.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know why when I get to see a doctor it ends up being so bad."
8,Inner monologue,"Hello, I just recently discovered the “controversy” behind inner monologue and “non inner monologue”

I’m just wondering if it’s “normal” for people to consider themselves to have both or decide when to activate either or. For example (also please explain more clearly if I am wrong
(My examples revolve around video games))

An inner monologue example in Call of Duty would be:

“I’m currently running down this corridor, I plan on taking a left and entering the third door, I hope there is no enemy camping,.. But, what if there is an enemy camping? Will I be able to handle him? My hands starting to get clammy and shaking.. I can’t stop my thumbs, why am I just running in, Oh god, okay, I’m running in.”

An example of “non inner monologue” would be:

-Corridor, run down, left door, enter, enemy, crouched, shoot, enemy dead, exit through rear door, grenade, throw grenade back, run away-

If both examples shown accurately depicts what an inner monologue and a “non inner monologue”  looks like. Would the inner monologue be more prone to judgement(in general), depression and other mental illness relation. Or am I just all over the place with this post. 

Thanks"
9,I don't even know what to title this as...,"Hi all. I've lurked on here for a long time. Just reading everyone's story and thinking to myself, I know how they feel. I thought maybe it's my time and maybe someone our there can relate.

So last month, I was released from an IRTS (intensive rehabilitation treatment service). I was 4 hours away from home. I did that on purpose. So the program was DBT based and I actually loved it. It was all females so of course there was drama but otherwise I learned a lot from them. I was actually told by a lot of the staff that I was their favorite. Made me feel good. 

So I get home, everyone telling me they are so proud of me, if I need anything let them know. Well, I have reached out every day this week. Just to have company. Nothing. Nada. Zip. I get they have families, lives, jobs... But is it really that hard to maybe take 30 mins to come over and just hang? I went from living with 7 other females to it just being me. 

I am sinking back into my depression. I am reverting back to what and who I was before I went to the program. I freaking hate borderline. My case manager has been trying to get me into groups here and trying to motivate me but I am continually finding reasons I can't go. The only thing I do religiously is my therapist because he actually wants to help me and I have a good rapport with him. 

I don't think I'm asking for advice or anything. I think I just finally needed to vent and get some of my shit out. I just feel lost. 

Thanks for reading..."
10,Low self confidence and nothing to do about it,"I've really want to get therapy or something, but alas I'm only 14 and we aren't in the best financial status. Me and my brother have both agreed that I shouldn't bring it up because we just can't afford to go to the doctors, much less therapy.

It is hard though, physically and mentally I feel incredibly pained. Maybe I'm grown up too fast, or maybe I'm still just a kid deep inside. A narc mom has really made me view myself as below everyone else, my only goal currently is to not be a bother to other people. I can't even make friends because I don't want to bother people.

I know self diagnosing is wildly unpopular but I can't help but want to know what's going on with me since going to the doctor's is only a wish instead of something realistic. I've thought I could have depression, anxiety, PTSD, and maybe some sort of learning disability. It's not like I do bad in school, but I also likely have tourettes which is often pared with a learning disability, plus my other signs. I might also have PTSD, or maybe cptsd because of my mother, or maybe it's just side effects of trauma? 

Honestly no clue what's going on with my body though, I can imagine it's stress but it's incredibly severe. I probably am anemic/have an iron deficiency, but I also get pain and have trouble breathing a lot of the time. I'm incredibly nauseous a good percentage of the time, I'm not sure what it is, but I'm ok, I'm functioning most of the time at least."
11,I think I need help again but I’m too afraid to ask,"I want to go back to a mental hospital but I’m too afraid to get help. I think I need it , but I’m so scared that I won’t go or that they’ll send me to a fucked up place ."
12,My friend,"So I have an online friend, he's super nice, and he can be very supportive and fun to talk to, but it can be kinda hard sometimes, cause he has manic schizoaffective disorder, and he has episodes which are kinda hard, like it only happens on occasion, and generally not for that long, cause I am decent at getting him to calm down, but its kinda distressing. And I don't really know what to, he says i'm kinda his only friend, and he can get pretty depressed, and seems like a pretty vulnerable person, and I don't what to do. I can get kinda depressed to, and when that happens it can be hard for me to engage with someone unless they're pretty enjoyable to talk to, but I feel like I am getting more stressed out, and its hard to play doctor, idk. He has his own therapist, councillor and psychiatrist he sees I think, but schizoaffectve isn't curable at the moment i'm pretty sure, and I feel like I might eventually get stressed out and cut him of.."
13,A question for mental health professionals about appropriate relationships with patients?,"Hello! I'm looking for information on what constitutes a professional relationship with a patient. My mother has been seeing a therapist for 14 years (I checked, license active and in good standing) but some of the stuff I'm hearing about her concerns me. My mother goes to her church and Sunday school, is Facebook friends with her, and volunteers by helping her doctors senior mother once or twice a week with errands and house cleaning. 

Meanwhile she is billed and her insurance pays for her weekly visits for the past fourteen years. My mother has become more and more out of touch with reality and more validated in her histrionic, victim mentality and has become heavily dependent on medications, takes lorazepam multiple times a day, celexa, sleeping pills and all of these with what is starting to concern me as a dependency. She refuses to see another therapist because she's comfortable with her doctors ""relationship with God"" 

Bottom line, all my research shows that I can complain about licensing or sexual deviance but I don't see anywhere that tells me I can register a complaint or start an investigation on this on behalf of my mother. Is there anything I can do at all? 

State of Florida if that helps. Thanks for your time!"
14,"My mom is having severe memory loss, among other things, and it’s getting worse","This’ll be long, sorry.

My mom is in her very early forties, and quite literally her entire life she has been the obedient listener to somebody controlling and borderline to severely abusive. Her parents were very strict and hyper-religious (which added another layer to that strictness), her first husband was abusive in every way and drove her to alcohol abuse. And her current and second husband is controlling, emotionally and mentally abusive and neglectful, and completely incapable of taking care of himself through refusal to do so. He’s physically capable. But he refuses to do so much as take his own plate to the sink.

She has done everything everyone else tells her to do- more often than not under the threat of physical or mental harm -for her entire life. And her entire life she has admitted openly to bottling things, denying an issue (through denial or genuine ignorance of the problem existing), refusing help of any sort, and exaggerating the issues through her own detrimental habits.

In the last couple of years these things have gotten worse. She began to have minor memory loss where she would completely forget a conversation she’d had a few hours ago and repeat everything. She doesn’t take very good physical care of herself and doesn’t see her bad diet as an issue, even joking about having not eaten for the whole day then getting offended when I don’t laugh.

Today hit a head though. She had a complete meltdown. She had lost an hour and a half of time. She has no recollection of taking me to work or picking up my younger brother from school. She has a bag of makeup she doesn’t remember buying, and it’s things she wouldn’t have ever bought in the first place, such as bright red eyeliner. She called me at work an hour after dropping me off, crying, asking where I was because she didn’t remember taking me to work. In the last year this has happened on a smaller scale, where she forgets having gone places or saying things. But this is the longest gap that I know of.

Her current husband is stifling her. Everything is under his name, and he has access to everything of herself. Every account she owns. She isn’t allowed to leave the house or talk to people, she has to check in with him on nearly everything. She won’t go to a therapist or specialist because she’s terrified of him. I wasn’t there for the meltdown but my sister was, and she told me that our mom went on and on about how she felt trapped and helpless. She’s terrified of doing anything because she’s convinced we’ll get kicked out, and honestly I’m scared of that too.

She was sober for a few years now but I firmly believe she’s relapsed at least  somewhat. She- I hope at least -doesn’t drink as much as she used to. But there are a handful of times I’m certain she was tipsy or drunk.

I’m not sure what to get from posting this. Part of me needs a place to vent. Another part of me hopes somebody has some magical solution. Most of me just wants to run away and never let these people back in my life again. I’m eighteen, but I nowhere near have the means to live on my own yet. That’s my nearest goal right now but saving up that kind of money takes time, and time is what I’m scared I don’t have much of.

TL:DR; My severely stressed, traumatized, and abused mom is having extreme memory loss and other (mental) health issues, but is refusing to get any meaningful help due to denial, fear, and likely stubbornness. I’m scared for myself and my two younger siblings, and I don’t know what to do to make sure we three keep a roof over our heads. 

Anything from well wishes to advice has my thanks. I understand not everyone has world changing advice and sometimes the best you can do is hope somebody the best. I hate doing that too because I feel unhelpful but I promise that it does help, even if just a little bit. So thank you, for anything you can offer."
15,Probably the weirdest thing you've ever read,"I have this thing that happens and I don't know what it's called. I have no fucking idea. This isnt just a panic attack. here's my best explanation. 
It's a feeling.
Like a physical feeling.
It's old. I remember first feeling it when I was sitting down on a church pew in a dress. 
Its...a feeling of discomfort.
Theres not really easy warning signs.
It happens when I'm around my family members and when I was forced to go to church as a kid. 
Vulnerability, fear, disgust with my own body.
Suddenly my veins are alive and squirming and I want to rip my skin apart until I dont exist.
Suddenly I'm hyper aware of...well. I'm hyper aware of my vagina. Literally. And my breasts.
I'm scared someone is going to touch them.
Or my mind is convinced that my family members are aware of the fact that I have genitals. Abd they'll touch them.
Its remedied by running away and curling up in a tight ball and taking violent deep breaths in order to curb a severe panic attack. 
And in my head I'm saying ""I hate you. I hate you, body. I hate you.""
My family members have never touched me. I was sexually assaulted by a random person when I was 14 but this feeling is younger than that.
I don't remember anything traumatizing that started this. But it screws with me so bad that I sleep all day and avoid life. 
Anyone else or am I crazy?"
16,Growth.,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was about 8, I never knew what was wrong I didn’t understand it, all I knew was that it hurt my body. It’s followed me throughout middle school and high school and it was a burden I just ignored. I’m 21 now and the past 4 months have been stressful since I’m going through my first breakup alone. I ended up taking myself to the hospital because the anxiety was just tearing me down it was so bad and it hit me all at once my mom even thought it was signs of a stroke 
But anyways 
After years and years sad it had to come to this point but so glad I’m finally getting help for it and taking medication to hopefully feel better. I think this is what I needed and the best self care I can give myself 
What’s better than a clear mind? 
I’m new to any medication, how should I expect to feel?"
17,Jealousy,"I've been struggling with this a lot lately and I don't know where else to turn.

I have a close friend. A great one at that. She's funny, supportive, and just generally a great friend.

However, I have a lingering jealousy of her that won't go away. She excels in academics (with a nearly 4.0 GPA and a #1 ranking in our class), is far better at drawing than me, she's far more likable than I am, etc. Hell, she even wins at every game we play competitively. She's so far above my level that I question whether she's my friend because she genuinely likes me or if she only talks to me out of pity. 

Even when I do achieve anything noteworthy, I can't help but think about how much better she did at the same thing. Thus, I don't try anything that has a chance of failure, because I'm too scared to. She's so much more intelligent and competent than me, so why bother doing anything when she'll just come along and do it better? 

I know everyone advises against comparing yourself to others. I've heard it several times. But when she does everything that I can do better, then what's the point of trying at all? 

I don't want to be better than her and make her feel bad or anything. I simply want to match her and be at the same level for once. But it'll never happen. I'm also afraid that she'll eventually end our friendship when she realizes that she deserves a better friend.

Has anyone struggled with something similar? Is there something I might be missing that could help?"
18,Mental illness seems so normal that it doesn't feel real. Anyone else feel the same way ?,"So, I may just be dissociating here, but mental illness doesn't feel real anymore to me. I have depression and anxiety. I was diagnosed around three years ago but I've had the illnesses for probably around five or six years. Treatment is only going so-so. At this point, I'm used to feeling miserable all the time. I expect it. 

But so many people around me have mental illnesses too, and it's not like kids making up illnesses for attention or anything. My school has a higher number of mentally ill students for a variety of reasons. I've seen a lot of kids from my school in the local psych unit during my hospitalizations. I also spend a lot of my time in spec ed, where I'm around a lot of other students with depression and anxiety as well as other mental illnesses.

On the internet, everyone is talking about mental illness now, too. People mention mental illnesses on all sorts of subreddits, not just ones about mental illness like this one. A lot of artists I follow open up about their illnesses through their art, too. 

It feels like everywhere I look, in real life and online, mental illness is there. 

It almost doesn't feel real to me anymore. Like, I've had it for so long and it's just a *thing* all around me. It feels almost like just an abstract concept like time.

Maybe I'm just dissociating, but it's just weird to me. I know my perspective is really limited because of where I live and go to school, and what parts of the internet I'm on, but I just feel weird. It's kind of like that thing where if you say a word enough times, it loses all meaning. Apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, apple. It's just a collection of squiggles, now. Same with depression.

I know this isn't exactly a refined thought or anything, but it's hard for me to turn my thoughts into words right now. Sorry, I don't know."
19,They keep finding me,"Former family that I completely cut off 5 years ago keeps finding new ways to contact me. Last year they found out my home address and where I worked. I quit my job and I moved. I don't know how they found out my address. I suspect from government documents/DMV database since my dad's a cop. I don't put my home address on anything anymore; I have a PO box that I send everything to.

I want absolutely nothing to do with them. I tried to kill myself 3 times when I was living at home and for that I can never forgive them. I've had trial separations from them before. The longest was 2 years, after which they said they'd change and would work on fixing their problematic behavior. That lasted maybe a few weeks before they were right back at it. I finally cut them off completely right before I graduated college.

Living with absolutely no safety net is hard. Trying to navigate life and being a functional adult is a damn challenge every single day of my life. I'm still struggling with mood swings and cyclical depression. But I'll gladly take all of it if it means I never have to talk to them again. I consider myself an orphan with no family. 

Yesterday my former-brother found me on linkedin and found my email. I'd managed to block everyone else on every platform I could think of but I couldn't find him before since he goes by a pseudonym (I've found him now and blocked him too).

Every time they find me again it sends me on another downward spiral. I can't afford that right now as I'm moving again soon and then I'm working on jump-starting my career. I don't know what I need right now. I just needed to tell someone."
20,I am extremely scared of Death,"I am 19 years old and i am extremely scared of death.

i have full blown evening episodes where its extreme existential dread.

The Antidepressants dont help... nothing helps

i just feel so weird

like im so out of place in life

too aware of my life and just constantly dreading death

i hope that since i was technically dead before i was born that rebirth is the thing to be the thing for me but i just get eaten up by this extreme fear...

im perfectly healthy and as successful as never before but all my mind is obsessed about is what comes after.

i just want this to stop...

its eating me up so much and i dont know why...

it hurts so much.

im scared.

the PTSD really doesnt do me any favors in that case either."

22,I don’t know how to move forward with my life.,"I’ve been struggling with cannabis use for the better part of a decade and in the past year I’ve been desperate to quit but I keep falling back into my old habits. I’m getting sick of it and I feel like I’m stuck. I want to leave it behind for good but I’m usually quick to relapse and I don’t have much in the way of a support system. Admittedly, because of my use and the anxiety it’s caused me, I have very few friends and those that I do have are mostly pot smokers. 

I’ve now been sober for five days, and while I wasn’t necessarily expecting things to get any easier, I sure as hell wasn’t expect them to get so much harder. My negative mind loop hasn’t ended and I’m still struggling with destructive habits—binge eating, chronic laziness, reliance on porn for self pleasure, mindless scrolling through social media. If anything, each of these feels like it’s getting worse to consume the space that being sober has left. 

My job and coworkers are pretty good, but I work as a paper pusher and don’t really have anything going for me outside of work. It feels like there’s no end in sight, and most of the time, I’d just rather not be alive. I don’t know how to connect to anyone or anything anymore and I don’t know how to get that back. 

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. But I don’t know who else to turn to."

25,Where can I find resources or communities for dealing with hangups about creativity?,"I don't know where it started, but I have some serious problems with being creative. One of my main hobbies is Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Tabletop RPGs and I really love them, but my anxieties about creativity really create problems for me when I'm trying to DM or create characters and really hinders my enjoyment.  

Basically, when I try to be creative I shut down all my ideas before I can have them. I think all my ideas and thoughts are wrong and bad.  I start to feel very anxious in my chest and body. It's a lot worse when I'm trying to be creative in a group because I compare my ideas to other peoples'.  The only ways I'm able to be creative in a healthy way is when someone else comes to me with an idea and asks me specific questions about a problem they have with it, or when I'm adapting pre-existing material (like adventures) that I deem are more inherently ""worthy"" than my own ideas (though during those times I tend to paradoxically feel bad because they're not my own ideas.)

This is really hard for me because I really highly value creativity, and I enjoy these hobbies that involve creativity when I'm able to get more ""in the moment.""  I've talked to two therapists about this and neither of them have been helpful.  They both basically said they don't know anything about creativity and that I should try freewriting.

Does anybody know forums, books, tips, subreddits -- anything really, where I could find help for this problem?

TL;DR: I have anxiety and self-esteem problems stemming from creativity, both of my therapists have basically shrugged it off and said it's not their area of expertise, so I was hoping to find resources or communities online."

I feel like I'm worthless, like I am nothing and i will always will be nothing. I feel annoying as shit because how could anyone enjoy my presence? I try to be happy by myself but I cant be, I always feel like I'm going through hell when I'm left alone, when I'm alone my mind goes to the fact that I hate myself and everyone around me loves someone who does deserve love because I dont deserve the love these people give me, I hate that they care about me because they want to continue to be with me but I dont want people to stay, I just want one and done because a peice of trash should just be left alone"

when I take my pills
It's not
when I don't
But
is that because they make me complacent
agreeable
conforming
When I am really
independent
strong willed
free thinking
Are those such bad things to be
They may make me harder to be around
But maybe only
to those who want me bent over 
backwards for them
kneeling at their feet
beneath them

Or is this all being spoken by a disease"
29,Anyone ever feel like this?,"Most of the time I feel ""fine"". I'm not necessarily happy, but I'm *there,* I'm *existing*. It's like I'm in some kind of nonreactive, neutral state. Then, the smallest inconvenience, or perhaps even nothing at all, causes me to spiral. I hurt myself, I want to die, I make a plan, I write a note. I'm ready to leave the world behind. But the night passes and I wake up the next day, still living. I continue my life in the same state of neutrality, as if nothing had happened at all."
30,My mind just opened like a crocodile mouth after seeing a steak!,I suddenly feel like I'm here. I haven't felt this way in years just listening to an album I haven't listened to in a while.
31,They might not let me try TMS because of my MS /: What are my next options for severe depression?,"It's not for sure, they have to talk to my neurologist, but apparently the doctor at the TMS clinic is hesitant to take me on due to my having MS. I'm guessing it's gonna be the same for most treatments for those who are treatment resistant. Meds seem to keep me stable and from spiraling and being hysterical, but i'm still consistently very depressed and i've tried so many. Any thoughts?"
32,What books have helped you understand mental health?,"I think reading is a great way to learn more about your mental health and would like to share a few of my favorites.

1. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain
2.  Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Cause of Depression by Johann Hari 

If you have your own favorite feel free to share it."
33,I question my sanity all the time,"Im extremely scared of the idea of going crazy.
I interpret everything as a proof of my mental insanity, i don't even know what's normal and what's not anymore

Im scared of the idea of seeing things or hearing things that are not there. I also worry about losing control and hurting me at other people

Im extremely scared of mental hospitals and institutions. I find myself preferring death over losing my mind

I just dont want to be insane"
34,Therapy apps/cites,"So, i’m only 14 and i can’t talk to my parents about a therapist. i’m going through some stuff rn, does anybody know any free therapy apps or just someone to talk to? or any calming apps. most of the ones i find cost money."
35,Help..,"I bought utility knives the other day to work on a craft.. and I fear that I may relapse.. I don't know what to do.. I can't let myself do that.. I feel like it won't be a little cut, but another attempt.. I don't want to relapse.. but a lot of the time when I relapse I do it without thinking...."
36,I Think I'm Regressing,"When I was younger, I use to have suffer from large amount of anxiety, experience panic attacks on a daily basis, and overall was a self loathing person due to what I believed was my horrible and physically abusive upbringing. I never believed in myself and always pushed everyone away from myself as I genuinely did not want to live. Throughout my high school years, I gathered numerous awkward and devastating memories that use to take over my thought process and hindered my day to day life, such as the sudden death of a family member I was extremely close to or just genuinely causing social damage that still exists into today. Due to these memories, I use to punish myself through over eating and had consistent thoughts about how everyone's lives would be better without me in it

Lately, I've been thinking about the various bad events that have occurred in my past at random, usually during moments that should be considered 'good' or 'calming' (such as spending time with my partner or with family). These bad memories tend to either make me negative or cause me to panic (short breathe and blurred vision). Alongside the reoccurring bad memories, I've been sort of enacting what my younger more mentally broken self use to do; such as over eating unhealthy foods, being overly sluggish, being more negative about current or future events and generally being more self-destructive.

I've been a lot more sad lately, crying when I'm alone and willingly letting everyone I love, leave me. I don't know what to do or where to go. I've been told to go see a therapist but I've heard that there's a chance that they may do more damage then good... Any advice?"
37,"A simple reminder that it’s true, for most of us struggling- this too shall pass!","Right up until December 2019 I was seriously suicidal. I had planned my fool proof method- but removed myself from gaining the means of said method around October 2019 knowing that eventually I will no longer have such inclinations and the removal would hopefully decrease suicidal idealisation. And I was right- now just a couple of months down the line I can look back and just be so relieved I no longer feel that way- that things feel so much better, that I actually value my life to some degree. No longer do I have a death wish while crossing the road and hoping, just hoping someone does me a favour...

One thing that got me through that time was every day, every time I had those thoughts, remembering the impact my actions could have on others- even those you don’t think would be impacted. How they have to deal with the aftermath of any actions I took and how I didn’t want that for those I cared about. 

There’s still work to do. I still have the remnants of depression but it’s not as severe and as all encompassing as it was. I still need to accept I have anxiety and work out ways to continue dealing with that as a functioning human being... but I’m getting there. 

I just wanted to reassure anyone who’s feeling that bad, that honestly it’s surprising how the tides can turn and don’t give up on that feeling that things can improve."
38,My girlfriend broke up with me,"Just tonight we were at play practice and she pulled me aside and we talked for a bit. Before dating we had agreed if she found a girl that she really liked (she’s bi) then we would break up. So she did find a girl but wanted to tell me first before dating her. I was happy and all because we were friends before dating and we still are now. I guess I just needed to vent because there is no way in hell that 8 would tell her what 8 am feeling rn, that would crush her and make her feel like it’s her fault, she’s already depressed enough without that"
39,I feel stupid for having depression.,"I was diagnosed with MDD when I was 15. I've been off &amp; on anti-depressants (wellbutrin to be specfic) since then &amp; I'm 22 now. 
I've never felt stupid for having depression before. But, I felt like I had reasons before. When I was younger I was in a coming of age really. I had an on again off again relationship that was toxic. My mom died in a car accident. I broke my femur in that same accident. Multiple surgeries. 
&amp; Bc of all of the above mentioned I always felt like I had good reason to be depressed. 
But now. I've moved on about my mom's death (I really only have bad days on mother's day &amp; the anniversary of her death. This is a huge win, it's taken me years to get to this point). I got married to the love of my life 5 months ago. We're currently looking to buy our first home together. I'm in-between jobs rn, but I feel like that just can't be a reason to be depressed. 

I haven't showered in 2 weeks. I haven't done any laundry (except for my husband's laundry bc I would feel bad if he suffered bc of my illness). It took me a week to do the dishes that were starting to stink in the sink. &amp; The only reason I finally did them was bc my dad yelled at me. (My husband &amp; I are staying with my dad until we find a house. Living with my dad sucks.) Today I didn't wake up until 2pm. I didn't get out of bed until 4pm. &amp; Then I got back in bed at 4:30pm, laid there &amp; cried for an hour until my husband came &amp; consoled me &amp; finally convinced me to go to the store with him. ""Just to pick some stuff up for the super bowl party"" he said. But I really think that was just his way of getting me out of bed. 

I feel like I don't have a valid reason to be sad. I keep trying to figure out why, but I literally can't think of anything. &amp; For some reason this just makes me even more depressed. 
I just feel stupid."
40,i dont want to be touched//tw,"i see my sugar daddy on sunday, he is bringing me a lot of weed and i'll be smoking most of it before i repay him because i don't want to remember any of it. he is a paedophile, he is disgusting.

he says he wants to fuck me. i am 15 almost 16, he is 25. he said he'd give me half an ounce of weed (14 grams) if i sat on his lap and let him caress my thighs a bit. i know he'll be hard. i know he'll try to overdo it. i know he'll try to get me extra high, and i welcome that.

if i don't remember anything, maybe sex between my girlfriend and i will remain as blissful. the last thing i want to do is ruin another thing between us, not this close to our anniversary, not ever again."
41,Has anyone had intrusive thoughts that are fleeting but relentless? They negatively impact my QOL and I’m not sure where to go from here. Any experiences/advice?,"Has anyone experienced intrusive thoughts that only last a couple seconds and then go away, but this happens every 5-10 minutes all day long? The intrusive thoughts are a memory coupled with crippling shame. They are not always the same memories. It makes me have to put my hand over my mouth or eyes and squeeze my eyes shut and scrunch my face in pain. Sometimes I can think of this memory later and it does not always trigger the feeling. The memory+feeling combo just happens out of nowhere. The moments leave sort of a “bad taste in my mouth” and I never fully get rid of the feeling of unease and it is honestly exhausting.

I also get disturbing intrusive thoughts when, for example, I’m driving and my brain plays out a scenario where the beams in the truck in front of me get loose and smash through my windshield. I will experience the process of my death in exquisite detail and the last thoughts going through my head. I can’t drive behind any vehicle carrying a load. It happens pretty frequently when I’m driving but also in other situations. Basically this thought about dying will play through my head for 30 seconds or so and I will be completely lost in thought and sometimes even have a look of shock or a frown on my face. It sometimes happens mid-conversation and I’ll realize someone asked me a question and is waiting for a response but I have no idea what they said because it was so vivid. I know about the call of the void but these moments are frequent, disturbing, vivid, and disruptive.

These intrusive thoughts negatively impact my quality of life, and I have even started looking for more treatment options like NAC, which I’m unsure if it helps. My pdoc said I could try neurotherapy but it seems expensive and I need to get put on a waiting list. I am already taking psychiatric medications so I’m not really sure where to go next.

Are these symptoms of OCD or PTSD? They started in full severity after an extremely traumatic and stressful period. I have mentioned them to my pdocs in the past but no one seems to understand how much it impacts me. I think I need to stress it in the future. I am still functional, but it seriously impacts my quality of life."
42,Can Somebody explain dissociation to me?,I’ve heard this term numerous times and I’ve googled it but I still really don’t understand it or even what it is. If you’ve gone through it can you describe it?
43,Words seem unfathomable,I don’t know how to describe what I’m feeling. I disassociate. I feel empty. I feel like less than half a person. I feel disconnected. I don’t care. This is my reality. I want to cry. I want to fall apart. I want to just be. I’m numb.
44,It hurts,"I've been on meds for a year and a half since I attempted suicide and failed. If I died my parents would have gotten a divorce and I would have destroyed my siblings' life. I'm the first born, 17. I have no irl friends. I have online ""friends"" on discord but the most we'd do is chat. Ever since my attempt, I have lost interest in everything. I don't find joy in anything. And how I feel... consistent emotional and mental pain. I don't even know if I'm making any sense. I've been thinking that maybe I'm not one of the lucky people who can get better. Maybe I'm ment to be one the people who succeed in taking my own life. I've used to be invisible so I'm not getting my hopes up for any response. I just wanted to leave a message so I'm not totally forgetting."
45,Lakers lost and I’m about to cry.,"I’m the biggest Laker fan. I watch every game. My girlfriend and I fight a lot but whenever the Lakers win, I know that everything will be okay. This superstition started bc it was true for so long. No matter what we fought about, when the Lakers got a W, we got back together and say sorry. But today the Lakers lost. I’m so fucked. Why am I so sad?"
46,I have to wait 7 weeks to see a psychiatrist. Mental health is rapidly declining. I need help.,"I was on medication while I was pregnant and they were great! I felt really balanced. Fast forward and I gave birth and my hormones were all over the place so I stopped taking my meds. It’s been since may. Just recently I’ve been having extreme ADHD tendencies and long, draining panic attacks/elevated moments where I am in flight or fight for hours! I need help coming up with things to do while I’m waiting to see a psychiatrist. My next therapy appointment is next week but it’s rapidly getting worse and I just need some suggestions.

Thank you in advance."
47,IDK,"I hope this gets buried, but I need to tell someone. Today my brother, who was the person I confided in about my struggles, told me to kill myself. I know he might not have meant it, but it hurt. Later today, he said, Imagine wanting to kill yourself, to me. My friend, his girlfriend told him to stop. She said something after, that, all though well intentioned, deepened the wound. She said that having those thoughts and acting on them are not the same thing, and she did not act on them. Last month I cut myself for the first time (I did not use a blade, but I'm not going to tell others how to discretely self harm, just thought I should clarify). I had taken many Advil pills in hopes of dying. I've been using mcr's reunion as a method of coping. My entire family bashes the music and culture, but they have no understanding of what that does to me. Today, I just sort of broke down again. I tried cutting two days ago, so I tried to avoid that today. I can't talk to friends and I feel trapped. I just needed an outlet, so I apologize to anyone who reads this. I don't want to dump all my problems on strangers, but I didn't know what else to do. Sorry for being obnoxious. I am from northern VA"
48,I’m just looking for some advice or words of wisdom.,"In 2017 I moved to my current city, started a good job right away and thought at 37(at the time) I was in a good spot in life. 

I was married, and was told by my partner they were not in love with me.  A 10 year relationship end in a few months time. This was the start of something that unwrapped me as a person and I can’t get my brain back to what it was at this point. From this point, I’ve lost my good job, burnt every work opportunity in the area cause I’ve been unreliable and flakey cause I have a hard time focusing now.  I’ve not worked at all in 2018, went through my savings staying afloat. I get no assistance or financial help. I’ve worked my entire life in mediocre jobs up to this point., so I never had much anyways. This month I’m literally going to be selling my personal items somewhere to have food money. I’ve isolated myself from everyone. I haven’t had a social
Circle or friends for a few years now. I’m definitely a loser, I know we’re all special blah blah but I’m the definition of a loser at this point. 

I’m so anxious all the time, I can’t shake it. I don’t know what to do or how to handle my life at this point.  I remember what having feelings and getting excited feel like, I just haven’t been able to feel it. Nothing I try is working , I don’t have a doctor (I’m in Canada) so It’s weeks to find one if I can. I went to the walk in but was shamed basically by the nurse registering me so I left. I think what’s really upsetting me is I see my life is in the toilet and I can’t react, or feel emotionless about it. I have a “why bother”, defeated feeling now. 

How does one get out of this mind set? I’m in Canada, no insurance and a not a lot of money. I get so anxious I don’t even know how to get help ."
49,It’s actually so hard to be a good “human”,"Not in a personality type of way (but that’s hard too)

But more all the things you have to do...
- stay healthy
- work
- lotion your body
- brush your teeth
- floss your teeth
- brush your hair 
- wear nice clothes 
- drive appropriately 
- smile at others when eye contact is made 
- spend time with others 
- get enough sleep 
- watch your weight


Idk... just been having a really rough last couple months :/ but they should be filled with so much excitement."
50,"Those (or those close to someone) with BPD or anything similar, what made you go to the doctor for help?","I don’t know if I should call the years leading up to seeking medical or psychological attention “symptoms” or “tells” or “behaviors”?

I have had people close to me wonder if I am bi polar and I’ve wonder myself for many years. I have felt at a total loss for what’s “wrong” with me or if I just find myself in situations were it’s difficult for me to process stress or handle life well or if I’m “normal” and I’m just overthinking...

So, I’m curious of your personal journeys or the perspective of a S/O or family member that has seen someone go through BPD."
51,Realizing I have no coping skills,
52,i want to become something that is not real,hi there everyone my name is bloom i am a girl who has a dream of being bloom from winx club its very depressing for me everytime i looking mirror and do not see her its has brang my life down to a place where i can not live anymore better yet as i am transgender it is making it harder for me what can i do about this its hurting and ruining my life knowning i will never be her
53,Conflicting issues with touch,"I don't get touched very often, maybe every few months or up to a year at family holiday get-togethers. I find myself craving touch almost every day, but being touched has usually been intensely uncomfortable for me. In the days leading up to those family get-togethers, I will think about how my relatives will want to hug me and how it will make me uncomfortable, kind of steel myself, and then wince through it. I remember one time I was out to eat with a couple of friends and a girl that I liked, who I guess was trying to be flirty, reached around my back to get something. I grimaced and ducked out of the way, making a nice awkward silence for the table. If I had to describe it, I would say it feels too loud if that makes sense? It's much worse if I'm not expecting it. I even feel off for a few minutes afterwards. Does anyone else experience this? I think I have other issues, but is this specifically a mental health thing? If so, has anyone had any luck becoming more normal about touch?"
54,31 long years,"Today is the 31st anniversary of my mother's death. She committed suicide when I was 6 and I don't know that I've ever completely recovered. I think there was this idea that because I and my 2 younger brothers were so young that we would be fine. I know I haven't. I've struggled with depression since about age 10. At times damn near debilitating. There have been many milestones in my life that I've been so saddened and feel such a tremendous loss that she wasn't here to see. My wedding day, the day of my first child's birth, the day I graduated college (I'm the only one who even took a college course and I did it with 5 children), the day I did a reading of a piece of writting that was published in a book, my divorce and the hell I endured that I could have used her support....I don't think my brothers have been okay either but I'll leave that for a different post. The last 3 1/2 yrs have been increadibly difficult after escaping my abusive marriage and having feelings again. You make yourself numb to deal,  the day I finally admitted to myself that I was being abused and the day I found my spine again and asked for a divorce were complete turning points for me. Feeling all that shit, questioning why me, wtf is wrong with me, I think I finally broke and the healing has been the messiest thing I've ever gone through. It has been hell. 
No I haven't been okay. I remember everything. Everything about that day and the days after. Her funeral. Everything. I miss my mom every single damn day since that evening my uncle loaded my brothers and I into his truck and took us to our grandparents where I saw my dad cry for the first time in my life while he told us that our mom was an angel now. 
I haven't fucking been okay! Some days are worse than others. Some yrs are worse than previous yrs. I was terrified to turn 25 as that's how old she was when she killed herself. It's terrifying to know that I've made it to 37. I've outlived my mother's yrs on this plain. It's hard to explain but when you look just like someone to the point that your face is not your own, nothing is yours. My face is now my own. I have little lines around my eyes that she didn't live long enough to earn. I've got a few grey hairs even that she never had the chance to cover up. Now finally as I enter my late 30s, my reflection is my own. 
It's been a long 31 yrs and I still miss her as much as that day. I still see her face even though I can't hear her voice anymore tell me that no matter what, she loves me. 
I know I wouldn't be the person I am today had she lived and I know in my heart that I am good. I'm just tired of the pain. 
I wish you had been stronger Mom."
55,I had a really good day which is something I haven't genuinely had for a while,"I slept through my alarm but I went to my class this morning and I'm so glad I did because it really helped me in a way I didn't expect at all. My professor is adamant about getting everyone in class to get to know each other so we get put in groups and have multiple opportunities to talk to each other, which is something I've never had in a college class before. I've never done that with classmates since everyone usually does their own thing and there aren't many chances to even talk to each other in class. 

This class really helps me open up. Today, my professor mentioned that she does it because college can be a lonely experience. I wouldn't be surprised if that statement flew over some people's heads but I thought about it a lot because it has been lonely for me. We also got put into groups for a project today and I'm happy that my group is getting along. We're planning to get together outside of class to work on it. Next week, we're watching a film (it's a 3 hour class) and that's all we'll do so I'm excited to bake cookies for my class. The professor ""jokes"" about bringing doughnuts if you're late so someone is bringing that, another is bringing water, and she said anyone else can bake something or whatever since she wants it to be fun for us"
56,Why was there a bowl in my hand???,"Why was there a bowl in my hand after I don’t remember picking it up?  I know this sounds really weird but one time when I was walking back upstairs to my room I looked down and there was a bowl in my hand, I don’t remeber picking it up or even feeling bowl in my hand during that walk? Wtf does this say about my brain??? This has happened about 3 times where I have something in my hand with no memory of picking it up.."
57,Ive never been able to love myself (21m),"As long as I can remember I’ve never been able to truly love myself. I can have self confidence but things will always get interrupted with myself critiquing myself and how I live life. I try to better myself (and have) but no matter what I accomplish I have that little voice in my head that just reminds me who the fuck I was and what I’ve done. I have a group of friends who I’m proud to call my brothers, but I’m not one to put my burdens on someone else fearing that they may be dealing with their own demons. They know I have my depression issues and that It. Is there any things that can help me?"
58,Found a cool trick to reduce stress.,I'm schizoaffective bipolar type. I'm trying to learn this music program. I want to practice a little every day. Today I watched some tutorial videos which for me is the easy part but opening the program seems like a daunting task. I decided to set a time for myself so I chose 6. I thought to myself that that would give me some time to just chill. The surprising effect though was that now every time the stressful thought of the program comes up I say to myself 6 and it immediately goes away. I hope you can use it.
59,My mom has bpd and I am worried I might as well.,"Tdlr are my behaviors learned from my mother or do I have the same disorder?

I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ptsd. my mom has bpd. She ruins all of her relationships, I'm terrified I actually have it too. I have alot of similar coping strategies as her, and for my first relationship I didnt recognize it untill we broke up. I dont know if it's because I grew up with her or I actually have it.

 I literally tortured my ex the same way she tortured me and I had no idea untill later. I fucking hate that I didnt see it sooner. I cared about him too much if that makes sense. Like way too much. 

I have alot of issues that I can trace back to things my mom would force me into or things that happened as a kid and I have never been diagnosed or had my doctors even bring it up before,  I am really worried that because of how I was with my ex that means I am.

 I have made every effort to recognize my actions with him, and I really dont forsee myself ever getting so attached to anyone else again. I ruined my relationship with him the same way my mom ruined every relationship shes ever had. She has one friend and she lives across the country. 

My brother hates her because she treats me badly and guilted him untill he cries. She basically spent years emotionally torturing him for not seeing her more often, he was a little kid and everytime he saw his mom he was made to feel like shit or see his big sister get treated like shit, when it was entirely out of his control. He would do something my mom deemed rude, or made her upset, I had to take him aside and talk to him or ""discipline "" him. I basically just explained why she was mad and he would get upset at her and ask why shes so crazy.

 When he was upset or hurt he came to me, and it got to a point where my mom was mad at me because my brother liked me more, and didnt want to be around her as much as me. I think it's just because he respects me more. Mom now blames me for it, and says I made him hate her. She usually pulls that card out on my birthday. She blames me for her entire family hating her, she says I lied to them and made them think bad things about her. But they have kindof hated her since I was little. My aunt is the one who initially got my brother and I taken away.

My whole family thinks shes an addict, because she acts so erratic and hysterical that it seems like shes on drugs. 

My first boyfriend and at the time I was having alot going on and my mom had isolated me and the only people I saw for years were my mom and my boyfriend. He and I were teenagers when he moved in. I never attached like that to anyone but him before except my mom when I was little because I was taken away alot. He and I had absolutely no boundries, and spent all of our time together. I thought we just were really close, I had never been in a healthy relationship or seen one. 

I genuinely believed we would be together forever, I trusted him completely. It took me a good few months to really get over him but I'm okay with it now. I was completely freaking out because I hadnt been eating or sleeping and i was working really hard and doing alot of physically strenuous work. my brain fuses kinda blew, basically like went through a really bad really long manic episode. I'm lucky I wasnt with someone who gave a fuck about me because I would have been hospitalized but my best friend at the time enjoys watching people spiral. I was really dependent on him just with everything. We had a super toxic relationship on both ends. I didnt know how I was acting untill I was able to see it from the outside, and was able to live around people who act logical. I'm terrified of becoming like my mother. She tortures people, she makes peoples lives hell and in turn makes her own life hell. 

I find that most of my relationships platonic or otherwise are with very negative influences or just kindof bad people in general. I all have made friends with the dick head kids because I always found ways to excuse bad behavior, or find reasons why they are good. I hate seeing people sad, and I hate being the cause of it. I'm also super insecure, and I'm terrified of what people think of me, because if they think I am on drugs I could have my kids taken away, if I am ugly people will make fun of me, if I mess up at work they will think I'm stupid and might fire me. I dont know if I'm paranoid or what, but the last thing on earth I want is to be like my mother."
60,"Do you ever feel so sad that you wanted so badly for someone to listen but when someone came, you can’t even begin to articulate what you’re feeling or to even explain why you’re so sad?","You really wanted to talk about it but when you start (if you can even begin), everything cones out so wrong and different that whoever’s listening misunderstands the situation."
61,Close friend feeling really depressed,"So tonight me, a friend we'll call Cody, and a ton of our friends decided to hang out, get drunk, and just hang out and have a good time. We were all doing shots and goofing around, until the conversation turned towards mental health.

Cody I've known for a while has suffered with anxiety, depression, weight issues, and OCD. (Which makes him latch onto certain ideas or thoughts for days or months on end) I mentioned how he hasn't seemed to want to hang out as much, and I wanted to make sure he's OK. 

He ended up telling us that his OCD has made his depression really bad as of late, so he hasn't wanted to hang out, even to play DnD. (One of his favorite things to do, almost ever)

Well he went on a drunken spiel about how he's been crushing on this girl in our friend group. (Who'll we'll name Claire) He thinks that she'd never ""go for a guy like him"" because she currently has a crush on me. I told him that I see Claire as a friend, but not anything more. We all opened up about our own individual experiences with depression, and how we each individually get through it.

But after many hours of talking later, Cody hadn't seemed to change his mind. He still thinks he should die and that he's worthless. Worrying about him, we made the plan that since I'm closest that I'd walk with him back to his dorm, before I walk back to my house.

The reasoning behind this was that Cody has prescription xanax in his room, and was honestly too scared to be left in the same room as them. So I told him that I will hold onto them until he feels safe to have them in his possession again.

We all want Cody to live his life to the fullest, and be as happy as possible while doing that. At this point I feel like I've said everything I can to him, but it doesn't feel like enough.

Are there any ideas on how we can show him that we care without being overbearing on him? I want him to feel like he truly is loved by us, but not so much that we feel pushy about it."
62,I just want to feel good,"Diaclaimer: you don't have to reply or even read this, I just need to get it off my chest and vent a little.

I'm tired of feeling bad. Anxious, stressed, depressed, dysphoric, irritable. Now I'm taking medication but it doesn't work completely and gives another bad feelings, I feel tired and sleepy, dizzy and heavy and still depressed. I feel lonely, I feel overwhelmed. If I'm being more energetic usually I'm just restless and fidgety. Or I'm having a few minutes of feeling very euphoric, that I start to act weird especially if I'm in public and I might seem crazy laughing to myself out of nowhere.

I just want to feel safe, comfortable and confident. I want to feel good about myself without needing constant confirmation from outside that only last for a short moment. I want to feel good about my body and the way I look without constantly watching what I eat or feeling guilty when I eat 'too much'. I want to find my place in life and I want to know what I want to do and what I'm good at. I want to figure out my dreams and passions and follow them. I want to be able to not be scared of other people. I want to talk without hesitating, messing up sentences and not finding words. I want to enjoy myself without thinking later about everything I might have done wrong. 

I want to feel happy and at peace."
63,"I just recorded Hamlet's ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy to avoid trying to end my own life","Despite this, I still struggle to bother caring for myself or have the ability to forget a perturbed past, and I care not what happens to me as of present. This soliloquy is one I read in high school in studying Shakespear, and in the past, I would attempt to recite the entirety of it in my mind before doing anything hasty. Well, now I decided it would be better to just verbalize it, record the audio, and repeat until the thoughts dissipated. I now have saved on my computer 4 recordings of myself iterating this soliloquy, with the intention being to stop myself from ending the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. I know now I can only stymy myself for so long before I end up performing a rash action without redemption. I would attempt to institutionalize, but the last time I was in this present state, I was turned away as I was deemed to not be a substantial threat to myself or others. Thankfully at that time, I was under the direct supervision of family members, but now I'm back to university and alone. Well not alone, but I avoid contact with others like it's smallpox. I'm beginning to think others are having genuine worry, but if I can't receive the aid I need, what's the point but to be burdensome? 

Maybe the answer is not to be. For being is pain, while dying is easy. Being is work. Being is difficult. Being requires resolve and I find myself running empty. Is there a means at which I can acquire aid, or am I doomed to restless existence until I elect not to be?

If it's required, I'm based in the Midwestern US."

66,"I need help, why do i keep hitting my head?","So like for context when I'm stressed or trying not to cry i hit the side of my head to 'help'. Its become a habit.

So i was just scratching the side of my head when i started hitting it uncontrollably. I tried to stop it but it didn't stop. I thought nothing of it at first, but just putting my hand near my head can trigger it.

Any ideas of what's happening or how to stop it??"
67,Doxazosin,Has anyone that’s been on Doxazosin know how long it takes before they start making symptoms of PTSD easier? I’ve been on them for nearly a week now and I had a terrible night last night. I got told they should start working in a couple of days and so far I’ve not had any benefits.
68,The human walk,"Tonight I find myself angry and bitter about my circumstances. I may have adequate material possessions and financially I have what I need, and more. But the reason I'm bitter is because I'm alone, in my house most weekends with no female company or affection. My anger and resentment is because I am hated and not loved by the world particularly females. The hatred is not confined to me only, hatred for one another is evident. People don't talk any more, they like you or dislike you based on your tribe. Are you a vegan or meat eater, gay or straight, male or female or neither, what culture do you celebrate, what music, movies, sports team, clothing label, followers you have or people you follow. Your education level, your proffession, your income, where you live, what you own, where you go. This complex modern tribalism segregates us, like the tribes of our ancestors. Segregation and division, and that leads to loss of love. And all the evidence suggests that we are an unhappy generation. And I say, that this unhappiness comes from the love dying in the world. The most disturbing thing about all this, is that it's not allowed to be discusses according to unwritten social laws created by us. So instead to have this conversation, I go to the only platform I have, to write. Can anybody correct me?"
69,Honestly don’t know how much more I can take,"Probably a useless post/rant but I needed to get it somewhere. 
Honestly feel like I’ve no use being here anymore, “friends” don’t seem to wanna bother with me and end up going out and not inviting me to anything and I find out after, my family don’t bother with me either
And I honestly don’t feel like I’m wanted or anything and I guess I’m really lost. I do nothing either to be treated this way.. I always go out of my way for people, always try to make them smile and always there when they need somebody and for what? Feel like I’m constantly talking to myself or on my own and hitting a brick wall 

If it wasn’t for the fact I have 2 beautiful kids to get me up in the morning I think I would’ve called it quits a long time ago😢 

Sorry, as I said probably a useless post but felt like getting it out"
70,All I want to do is sleep,"I'm afraid to talk to people because I know at some point I won't be able to hold back the tears when someone asks how I am.

I haven't felt like this in nearly 10 years.  I lost my job then because I was so depressed I couldn't focus on work.  I wish I could stop working again and focus on what I actually care about, but that's impossible.

I'm starting therapy this month...again...which just means time and money is going to go to something I don't care about, but know I need.  Maybe?  Talk won't help anything, only change will.

All I want to do is sleep."
71,not sure if i’m having hallucinations or not,so i’ve been depressed and anxious for the past 5ish years of my life with it getting increasingly worse each year. in the past year i’ve noticed an increase in things that aren’t actually there. i often can feel bugs crawling on me that aren’t there that can happen several times a night. i hear my name being called occasionally like it sounds like my mum calling me from the other side of the house (i check everytime) also just like mumbling that isn’t happening. sometimes i think i see people like in the corner of my eye but then no ones there. it’s only little things like this that i don’t know if everyone experiences or if this is some type of psychosis but i’ve never seen anything super bizarre or scary so i feel like it can’t be a hallucination. anyone got any idea?
72,Please help!,"Okay so maybe I’m an idiot idk, sure seems that way lately tbh. But I wanted to just ask if anyone in the group has any personal experience/knowledge about what steps a new mental health provider opening a new facility would have to take to secure an insurance policy/set up network coverage through third party insurance? More specifically, the specific processes and individual requirements that the new provider would have to take in order to submit claims billing the third party insurance company for the reimbursement of the services that they have provided to clients so far at their new mental health facility?

73,I’m In a horrible mental place right now.,"Tears streaming down my face. Feeling depressed, Misophonia getting worse. No one wants me. I feel like hell. I can’t live like this.  Started slapping myself in the face. I can’t eat. I can’t stop crying. I just want to give up. Life has no purpose right now.

74,Just sad?,"I just recently got out of a not so serious relationship that lasted 3 months, ever since then i sit up at night thinking of everything we did together and how much fun it was. I get that this might be normal but im not usually a person who gets longterm hurt by people leaving but this feels like more than a scar left by someone i dated, ive never really felt ""depressed"" about anything in life uptill now and ive been feeling this way for around 4 or 5 months.

Im really just asking if im going to be okay by leaving it alone or should i talk to her or get professional help?"
75,notes on the misfortune of discomfort,"yo, I’m kinda sad and high and so ima type this in a hood accent **

“Grove street home, at least I thought it was before I fucked everything up” - CJ

I don’t know man. I want some dialogue and people just to tell me what they think (keep it peaceful with love tho). I feel guilty of my life man 

I was like born poor as shit in a shittt urban neighbourhood - mum was ill and dad wasn’t around 

I grew up got the highest grades and went to oxford and received a scholarship recently to continue my studies at Harvard and Yale. 

I also overachieve in orher areas of my life also disclaimer I’m pretty young and i know I ain’t experienced shit but I’m not even complaining (I’m 21) I’m just trying confess my sadness really 

anyways I overachieved in other areas of my life too sports, debate, music, theatre etc and was really into acting at university whereupon graduating I signed with a massive acting agency that now represent me. This was a dream come true. 

On the surface, everyone I know understandably thinks I’ve got it all figured out and I was smooth because I got all da pretty girls and shit but like those girls all just used me to look cool. never fallen in love (and it’s cool cus I’m 21 but I bet people don’t kno) 

I’ve also been depressed as a damn mothafucka since like 12. lmao that sounds like a joke but it’s not. I been on all types of meds and seen dozens of therapists and nothing fucking works except for weed and alcohol really and I fucking know that’s a slippery slope but like god fucking damn i can’t stand to be in my skin for a single second anymore. I need to be numb constantly and I am right now as I write as a plea for help more than anything through dialogue and if anyone has similar experiences or advice 


i worked so hard growing up and was driven to push people up and so I did non stop volunteer work for last 5 years as I was studying etc and it took up all my time and i couldn’t accept pay and then I’ve had people tell me I’m selfish. on god, my dream is to open a charity to look out for the kids from my hood. 

I have ptsd too and really bad anxiety which I cover up really well because most of my interests in the arts force me to be social even when I don’t want to. I’ve overdosed a couple times on meds drugs and alcohol too 

yo on a level tho people wonder why I’m so damn messed up now and it’s like I understand why they might not get it at first but man think of it like this;”:

you’re born into a poor immigrant family in the hood with no guidance in my development as a child or intellectual engagement or any kind (even less then most average working class families) and then u grow up to be the first person in ur entire neighbourhood to go to the best uni in the world or whatever and people don’t understand that growing up I had so many barriers man, it was violent where I’m from, I was trying to be a ball player too but I wasn’t good enough lmao and I came very close to being excluded from my school. 

So when it came to applying for uni my school legit sabotaged my application and tried to exclude from the school despite my achievements and I fucking literally stayed behind school every fucking day helping other students like how the fuck the school never acknowledge that shit at the very least - I don’t want a fucking thank you but how can u think I’m a malicious person. I swear to god yo I actually rewrote a girls university application because she was panicking and it took me a good few hours and when I finished this amazing ass application she told me to legit fuck off. I don’t give a shit that she said it but all I’m saying is that I’m not the arrogant one so I don’t understand why the school would do that 

anyways at home shit got worse and I don’t even know where to begin on that front 

uni I fucking did it all and achieved everything but I hated every fucking second of it. I’m not exaggerating please believe me I can show proof but like it was all for nothing man I felt so empty and such an outcast. I remember all the white girls getting scared when I walked into the lecture halls with a hoody on and they all thought I was “a thug” which I’ve been called many times and even been questioned “you go to OxFoRd??????????):7/&amp;2:!(:6?” Like yes I go to oxford and I legit graduated top of my class but just because I like to listen to real rap music and box and do research on social inequality doesn’t mean I ain’t smart on god bruh 

I don’t know what I’m saying man I just need to get some shit off my chest. I appreciate that this post reads weirdly as hell now and I do apologise to anyone who made it to the end, I hope it was at least entertaining. 

Talk to me people and be nice man today im in drake feels clearly lmao"
76,I become very jealous and angry,"when I see people around my age being succesful and having full time jobs and having their own apartment and going on out of the country vacation trips. Normal adult things.  
People that can get out of work on a friday, get home, open the balcony to a place they rent/own and just sit there and relax. People that can put up wallpaper on their walls!!!! 

but then I think  
add a decade of mental illness to that and maybe they'd be in the same place as me.  
Because I'm only now getting my shit together but now I barely have any time left.

Do you ever think about how much further you would have gotten in life if it wasn't for your stupid brain ruining everything? I feel like I've lost my entire teenage years and I feel like a big part of it was just spent in my room not doing anything to improve my life but how would I know I would have bipolar disorder by 17 it's almost like there's not much I could have done anyway."
77,"panic attacks, weed and mental health?","never thought id be typing this and it sucks. but 3 days ago i smoked a joint and had a full-blown panic attack. i went completely crazy as i had no idea what a panic attack was and had no idea they could get this bad. i’ve always been stressed and also smoked, so not sure whats changing right now.

i suddenly started feeling uncomfortable so i went to bed (thank god i was alone) and started shaking, hyperventilating and sweating. i genuinely thought i was going to die and started thinking about what everyone’s going to do after my death and even was going to call or text some people that im dying etc and then call the ambulance until i googled some things and a friend that i reached out to told me its probably a panic attack. when i was sure it was a panic attack and not infact a heart attack, i calmed down a bit but it lasted for maybe a couple hours. i had another one later on (didnt smoke) and 2 more the day after which lead me to flushing my weed down the toilet during one. 
now i live in a constant state of anxiety about when the next one is going to be and im genuinely scared of smoking weed because of how terrifying the experience was. 

im used to stress so not sure why this happened.

i guess im just venting but does anybody know anything about this or experienced something similar? i already booked an appointment with a psychiatrist and psychologist soon but its honestly shit as i have PTSD and ADHD and weed is the only thing thats ever helped me :("
78,Is it normal to feel a bit crap from being unfriended on social media? Even if you haven’t seen nor spoken to the person in a few years?,"Don’t know whether this is the right subreddit to ask this. But I recently discovered I had been unfriended on social media from someone who I haven’t seen in awhile. Even though I didn’t have much of a real connection to this person anymore, it still instigated these thoughts and feelings of self-doubt and confusion. Maybe I’m just being petty, but has anybody else here had a similar experience in this regard?? And are there any good methods for dealing with these kind of thoughts and feelings?? Thanks in advance :)"
79,Help please I am so angry at my mom all the time.,"She left me with 3 dogs, one is mine, 2 are hers, they were never properly trained, they pee everywhere etc. She left me with a house that she didn’t take care of for 30 years. She had a maid but she couldn’t actually clean the house she had to pick up my mothers mess all the time. She is so toxic. But in exchange for fixing her mess and taking care of her stupid dogs 24/7 she pays for my food and bills. Am I actually the spoiled bitch here ? I so want to never talk to her again. And keep her from seing her dogs. They’re untrained annoying and irritating as hell but I love them so much. But at the same time she is my mom and even though I hate her, well I love her. I hate this toxic relationship"
80,Saw some comments about PTSD and I’ve got questions.,"I saw a meme in r/trollcoping about hearing what sounds like an argument, and your heart picks up and you feel the urge to run. 

Here’s my question: will repressed childhood memories cause a reaction like this? It’s been a couple of months since I found out my biological father hit me when I was little. He abused my older brothers the same way, and yelling was a part of our household for a long time. That’s my only solid memory of him, is yelling and irritation.

Throughout my entire life, yelling and verbal fights have made my heart pound and my head spin. I can’t remember much about those moments, either. I’m almost 28 now, but if I hear a loud noise or what I think is yelling, I freeze and feel my adrenaline spike. And I still have little to no memory of when my bio father lived with us. I know you guys can’t diagnose, but is this indicative of PTSD I may not have realized I carry? 

I don’t need a solid yes or no, just an idea. I’m going to get a referral to a specialist this year, as my husband’s insurance covers it now. (Yay!)"
81,I can't stop thinking about my past actions,Last year of my high school was really bad when I think about it. I can't stop thinking about embarrassing things I said and I am constantly in fear what if I meet one of them when I go out.
82,I’m losing hope,"I just...
I’m trying to apply for a job I really REALLY want. And I can’t even open the application form properly because they’ve used a document format I don’t have software for.

All the time I feel like everyone else is off and running and I have to slog a mile uphill just to get to the starting line because there’s ALWAYS SOMETHING.
And then everyone eats like I’m making excuses or getting upset about nothing.

And it’s close to 34 years now of “it won’t always be like this” but WHEN IS IT GONNA CHANGE. THINGS ARE JUST GETTING WORSE IN FACT.

And when I point that out I’m “just being negative” despite the unequivocal proof that they are not, in fact, getting better. I’m still poor, I’m still depressed and anxious, and I still get bullied.

So. “It will get better” is a fucking FAIRY TALE. I’d be as well off wishing on a fucking star because I’m running myself into the ground actually trying."

84,Can someone kindly explain to me,"why living a shit life is so important to everyone around me who live a shit life too but live it without starving to death? ya, I'm seriously not well. my spinal cord shows issues, my mobility is lacking, i brain kinda fades in and out, both heels are confirmed broken, the 7th vertebrae saw light in '95, someone blew out my brains in '74, i have 3 confirmed herniated discs in my lower spine, when i eat. i end up with sliders in my pants or diaper. my left arm is weak and numb, my left hand goes limp and numb, my right side ain't much better. i dont sleep much anymore due to fears i'm not gonna wake up i cry more than i ever have. no one gives a flying fuck or even have the idea we're all separate individuals hence, we're all different. yet I feel If I die, I take everything away from everything ever made. I've been told by BC medical they think I think I'm God, I've been beated down, thrown in both jail and psych ward, had some prick beat me in both temples calling me the son. I feel mortified knowing more than I ever have. I have a pyramid outlined in veins in my left hand, hieroglyphics running down the inner right leg. I've deciphered one ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and the timing of everything is getting really weird. I had a brain injury in 1974. am told I fell on a rock that took off like a bullet. I used to be able to look at pictures of planets for 3 to 5 minutes, look away and watch what I was focused on manifest in front of my eyes. gifted, yeah, more than gifted. I have this 1 ability, being able to lay on the ground without sucking my thumb retaking every ounce of control implements immediate respect peace calm. we've all felt it slip in, and fall out. peace of the gift is based on the ability not to fold, had I been fed all my life and not starved, we'd all live the better life, since society keeps placing the blame on the creator. I stepped in, wanted to see what the fuck you kids were up too, to find out. life is a pathetic waste of time. I really don't know who keeps bringing the day or if its time scheduled or what the fuck. I lost my nerve, I lost your trust, and I lost interest. I know damn well the effects of everyone quitting on me. I die

thank you for the betrayal. means everything knowing humans are this greedy they'd seek and destroy a creator. fuckin pathetic retards ain't gettin another fuckin thing from me or my parents. you people are too god damn pathetic and ignorant to waste any more time on. 

this species are too mentally unstable, far too ill and will never grow up. you all stick suckle the oil titty and murdered yet another creators dream. fuckin waste of energy"
85,I don’t care about anything.,"I can enjoy things. I like playing the game, hanging w friends, because it’s fun. Of course it’s fun. But I don’t honestly care about them. I don’t want to lose them or want them to die or something like that but if they left or died I would be more upset about having to make new friends that were funny and everything, I would have lost a whole schools life in grooming and molding them to be like me. Have my humor, be callous.. they act how I want them to act because of how I made them. And if I lost them I wouldn’t have the chance to do it again. We’re young adults now and so molding someone is going to be extremely more of a pain in be neck. I’m indifferent to them but enjoy them and want them to be around..I’m indifferent to my family. Don’t get me wrong they’re good people and I grew up being loved. But I never felt the same way about them. They’re just a group of people I was born into and idk but I don’t feel that unconditional love towards them. My job is nice I make good money but I don’t care about it nor am I motivated by money. I’m not motivated to go really I just do it because that’s what we’re supposed to do..I’m just moving. Not that life is meaningless I just don’t think it’s meaningful. I don’t like talking about it with people in fear of being alienated. I do have emotions..I know so because sometimes I cry and I’m sad. Sometimes I get angry. Sometimes I’m enjoying myself. But there’s always that indifference to everything still there. I almost got hit by a car on a highway while riding my bike.. I remember looking at it..had to be going at least 40 and I remember saying in my head “what do you want to do?” And I let it get closer and then at the last second the car swerved out of the way, jumped the divider and braked. I was alive. While I’m typing this I realize how it sounds. Never looked at the words like that or even thought back to it. I don’t want to die. But when put in that scenario it feels like I chose to die. I wasn’t scared or anything and it felt cold and warm at the same time. It felt like nothing And I remember seeing my friends faces. I turned around to look at them and they were horrified. And to calm them down I smiled. I have suicidal thoughts but I doubt I’ll ever act on them. It’s just how everyone thinks about it but really would never do it. I usually think about everything I do. My facial expression, my micro expressions. I’m prone to some slip ups here and there but I’m aware of myself 90% of the time. I try using it to my advantage and it had its perks ya know.. making people feel deeper bonds, or building trust.. making people feel that you are authentic and real. But it feels like every thing I do or say is a lie. And honestly it is (isn’t that a paradox?) everything I said to them about my past or what I’m doing is a lie..it’s easier to lie than to tell the truth. Not lying for any gain but just to keep their mind at ease that I’m ok. I hate when people worry😭gets in the way of everything. I’m talking to you as if you were a therapist and I was in a chair😂. I’m trying to be professional sounding while not overbearing. And I know not everybody wants to sit there and read all this so I’ll stop now😂"
86,I think I have derealization or depersonalizaton,"The reason I said ""I think"" in the title is because I'm not 100% sure. I haven't gone to a professional yet but will soon. The reason why I'm posting on here is to hopefully find ways to cope with it or get rid of it.

I'm 16, male and I'm from Ireland. I've think dealt with this for 4 years now (very minor incidents) but it's like something snapped a week ago and it feels like it's gotten worst and haven't been the same since.

 It's really hard to explain but it feels like nothing is real, everything doesn't have mass or I can't precieve an object that's gone behind a wall. It's feels like I'm watching reality through a screen and everything is blurry.

 It takes my mind to a few more extra seconds to comprehend something that is familiar to me like my home, my room, my cats, my family. Until I understand what I'm looking at, it/them feels unfamiliar or completely alien to me.

Sounds and music don't really hit me as much as they used to either. I'll dance and smile but it doesn't seem like I'm doing it or I'm not in control.

I constantly feel like I'm in a dream or my mind is foggy, even though I know I'm not in a dream everything I do feel like it lead to nowhere or nothing.

Lastly, I don't feel in control of anything I do. Similar to how I react to music, I'll act somewhat normal and complete daily tasks with better results than usual but it doesn't feel like me doing it. I feel like I'm being controlled the instinct to be a normal person and not myself. 

When I speak, it feels almost like I'm possessed, I know what I'm saying, I know what I'm conveying but at the same time I don't.

When I touch an object or someone, they don't feel like a real object or they feel empty. 

When I want to convey emotion, I can but it doesn't feel like me doing it, again, it feels like the instinct to be normal and smile back at a person smiling. However I've notice this one symptom as becomes lacking at certain times and I'm just emotionless and feel depressed.

These are the main symptoms that are really bothering me the most right now but if your interested to hear more, just comment.

Anyone please give me advice to hopefully get me back to normal or help me cope with it better because it's really terrifiying and frustrating.

Thank you for reading this long post."
87,"most therapists single out whom they deem ""weak"" and tell them fallacies","If they come across a person they connect with or think is superior, they would go by the book of the DSM.

But if they don't connect with somebody, or think they look/act weak, they would tell them fallacies.

One of them did it with me, because he told me that having tattoos are wrong, or not going to church is wrong. he tried to deny me living a normal life as like millions of others in society do. All of him and unit did. There are people with mental conditions who don't go to church often, but they don't come down on them.

they get offended if people them deem weak live a normal life. 

It's my intention to live normally as others do - and get what all others got/received in life."

90,I remembered my grandfather,"He died almost 5 years ago but there are times when I feel regretful and can't help but dwell on what could have been. When he was still alive, I used to buy something for him at least once a week. I was still in college then so those are like the little things. But when he can't sit anymore and would just lie down all day because of his age and illness, I kept thinking of what I could give him because he can't eat that much anymore. I kept thinking and thinking of what I could buy for him until I can't, anymore. And now, there are times when I think of him and I would cry because the simple gesture I used to do for him, I can't do it no longer. I was 16 at the time. I am 21 now. I was too young to think about death and how fragile life is and so I thought that I have all the time in the world to appreciate the people I love and myself. I still cry. I feel sad.

92,Help i dont know what to do,"A few months ago i started talking to my best friend about my depression. Since then it became kind of a habit to call her whenever i was having a panic attack. 
It felt pretty good to have someone with whom i could talk about my thoughts. But 2 weeks ago, when i had another panic attack, she texted me that she didn‘t wanna talk about that topic with me anymore because she doesn’t know how she could help me. I told her that she‘s already helping me by listening to me but we are still not talking about it. Since then my self-hatred and depression has become much worse. We are still best friends but im feeling like she doesn‘t want to be that anymore. Now im scared im going to lose my best friend because i confronted her with how im feeling. Can anyone give me an advice on how to get this friendship back on track or how i can handle this situation?"
93,Obsessing over my loved one’s deaths (they’re all alive),"Hi. I’m (24F) noticing recently that I’ve been really fixating on when my loved ones will die and how horrifying that will be. 

For some backstory, I do have anxiety, depression, and OCD. Also in 2015 five members of my friends and family passed unexpectedly, and that was the first time I had ever experienced the death of people I loved. I went to grief counseling during this time and was feeling a lot better after about a year. 

Recently I’ve been falling asleep in bed next to my partner and suddenly waking in a panic realizing his mortality. I start picturing the police calling me, having to attend the funeral, and I get to the point of shaking and sweating. This was happening for awhile and recently I’ve started to panic over the realization that children naturally outlive their parents, and I can do nothing to keep my family safe forever. Again, I can’t keep the image of the moments I find out they’ve passed out of my head. 

This has really been consuming my life and I don’t know why it’s happening. I haven’t told anyone because I don’t want to scare them. If anyone has advice or has experienced this I’d love to discuss. 

tl:dr; I’ve been panicking over my loved ones deaths, though they are all alive and well."
94,Extremely emotional person. Considering therapy. Is it normal to feel this way?,"I think I’m an extremely sensitive person. There are topics I can’t talk about without crying. I feel extreme empathy to the point where I hate hearing sad stories or anything that hurts people because it makes me extremely upset. I also have attachment issues with both people and inanimate objects. Ever since I was small I remember owning something, like a pencil for example, and being extremely distraught if I lost it or someone took it by accident. I would almost personify the object and think about how it was “mine” and I had to take care of it. I have no idea where these feelings come from but they are ruining my relationships and make me feel extremely depressed because I hate the idea of living the rest of my life knowing I’m going to experience so much pain and sadness that I don’t want to go through. Does anyone else feel this way or is this something I need to seek therapy for? Maybe it’s just my personality to be extremely sensitive. I’m not sure."
95,i hurt someone and its triggering me,"long story short im bad at cleaning and my housemate called me out for it and i was annoyed so i reacted harshly and now she wont talk to me. all my friends are saying that what i did was childish and being criticized is making me feel like shit.

my housemate is taking a bloody long time to forgive me or even just reply to my apologies (i apologised twice because my friend said the first one wasnt good enough, but the second was really good)

i didnt realise my interpersonal skills were that bad but both apologies sounded the same to me and i didnt really MEAN any of them. i just told them what they wanted to hear. but obviously im going to make sure i clean from now on cos im not trying to have this happen again

this whole situation has made me kinda spiral. im having urges to blame my mental health on everything. i want to be the victim, i want the attention, i want people to like me again, i want to pretend to be suicidal so my friends will listen to me more.

i think the good thing is i HAVENT done any of these things so thats good. *im just slightly worried as to why im acting this way.* i also binged (i have bulimia) but i didn't even feel like bingeing i just WANTED to be sad. 

**TL;DR** i hurt someones feelings but im hating it bc i was criticised and im pretending my mental health is taking a hit because i dont want to face reality lol

any advice or can anyone relate?"
96,Is my doctor hiding a diagnosis?,I have been seeing my psych for a while now and she has never told me a diagnosis. I am on antipsychotics for hallucinations and delusions and feel I know what my diagnosis would be but she’s just never told me anything. Do I need some sort of special screening or is she just hiding it for my sanity? I’m in the dark I don’t know what’s going on.
97,How to actually get proper mental health help in the UK (NHS),"I’ve never received proper mental health help, it’s so hard to reach out and it makes it even more difficult when you have in the past and nothing has come of it. I’ve struggled with my mental health since a young teenager, I finally asked for help at 17 years old and was told to come back when you are 18. Because they couldn’t give me adult treatment yet and by the time I would get to the front of the waiting list for CAMHS I would be too old. I went back when I was 18 and they just gave me antidepressants and sent me on my way. When they weren’t working effectively I went back and they just put up the dosage. When they still weren’t working effectively I changed doctors and at my new surgery I asked for CBT. I waited a long time on the waiting list and finally got a couple of sessions to just be told they don’t deal with “people like me” as I was self harming at the time and was told I could no longer do the CBT without any alternatives given. At 21 I moved house and doctors again, I asked to do CBT at my new doctors and was given some sessions over the phone...I felt like all it did was put a tiny dent in my massive amount of problems as they could only do the sessions on one topic. After I finished, again I wasn’t offered anything more for any of my other issues. And here I am now still feeling like I haven’t gotten hardly anywhere in all this time. I don’t know how to get proper help and have been left feeling like going private is my only option but just not affordable for me right now. I’m left contemplating taking drastic measures, maybe if I pretend to attempt suicide or if I go outside and run around naked or something someone might finally take me seriously! Or probably not. I just don’t know how to get help anymore. I have asked before for a mental health evaluation so I can get a proper diagnosis and have been ignored. Is it really too much to ask? How can I be treated properly if they don’t even know what is wrong with me."
98,Please help! I need advice from people with OCD,"Hello! I'm an author and I'm writing a book where the main character has OCD. I want to make sure to represent this disorder truthfully, instead of portray a generalized perception from the media. Is there someone (or many people, hopefully) willing to share their story with me? I've done lots of research, but real life always differs from textbook.

Please, reach out! Thank you!"
99,Can you?,"Can you say that you have recovered from an eating disorder? Is it something that always stays with you in the deep part of your mind, or can you truly call yourself cured and healed when you reach a certain point?

I like to believe I am healed and cured from both of mine now, but as I never actually received treatment for them, I was never able to broach this question to anyone?"
100,Raised very secluded,I was raises in a cult like religion. Kept pretty secluded.parents didn't talk to me and i wasn't aloud to have friends. Over all i feel like my mental health is. Ok. But i have a lot of trouble with language. When i try to speak its difficult to hold onto thoughts long enough. I loose whatever i was trying to say after the first sentence or two. Getting professional help isnt really feasible right now. Im wondering if there are any things i can do to self help.any advice?
101,Took my mom to the docs.,Now im in the car waiting.  Feeling a bit anxious. Hiw are you all doing??
102,I have a crush on my Art professor and I start to become him myself,"                 The thing is that I have a crush on my Art teacher (college) and he already has a girlfriend who is also one of his students. Well, she is my senior, recently graduated and over 18, so I guess it’s okay for them to date. I try not to pursue my teacher because I think it’s inappropriate for a student to do that kind of thing. Then this girl just popped out of nowhere and became his girlfriend (I think they was dating when they were still in the class together).  It hurts me so much and it makes me feel conflicted. 

                I have a crush on him for 3 years now and I have one more year left; I won’t be able see him anymore. The moment I saw him for the first time, I just thought to myself that he looked really similar like I have met him before.  My feelings for him started to grow more when I attended his class and saw his personality, talents, and charms. He’s very funny, direct, artistic, sometimes mean, moody and childish. I caught myself locking my eyes at him and started to daze off with every words he said.  He’s also very playful. His playful interaction makes me like him even more. He smiled and jokingly knocked his pen down on my head when I tried to make some bullshit excuse for my work’s concept, measured my face and lips with his pencil while explaining the class about drawing theory. Recently, this incident really blown my heart, he just drawn my entire face as a demonstration for soft pastel painting lesson. While he was showing us how to use soft pastel colors, he then said that he would draw someone and turned to me ( I was standing and watching him from behind. We had to gathered around to watch him drawing something) and said “This one”. He adjusted the lighting, told me to look to the left slightly, and took a picture of my face. I was screaming inside. It’s so embarrassing. After the class, he asked my name indirectly from my friends, playfully signed his name on the portrait and said that I could keep it. I walked to my dorm-room while happily screaming inside that night. (Our class starts at 7:30pm to 9:30pm...)


                  I tried to tone down my feelings but I cannot help it because I have to attend his class (it’s my minor). I want to impress him all the time. I want to be cool. I like whenever he compliments my works (mostly got badly ripped though). The jealousy of others and his girlfriend hurts me in the chest. I try to control myself by not getting too close to him, not joking around with him (like I used to), and put on a resting bitch face every time I see him. I am afraid that he will know that I like him, so I try not to act too delighting around him. And this makes him starting to be more stern with me and does not  look at me much when he’s talking to the class. (I am also afraid that he may thinks that I hate him)

                  I examined him and noticed a lot of things; I noticed that his face does really look a bit like my father’s and mine. (My friends used to also joke about how our faces look similar to each other. We’re both have Chinese descendants, both wear glasses, almost the same heights). This might be the first reason why  get attached to him in the first place.

                 Now I feel like I’m losing myself. I stated to cut my hair short like him; try to style my hair like him, try to wear clothes like him and act like him in order to soothe myself. Now I look more like him, even some of my friends noticed and joked about that like teasing me by calling me by his name. (They don’t know that I have a crush on him though and they think that I’m more of a tomboy) I know that this sounds crazy and pathetic but I feel like if I can’t have him, then I need to become him myself. I need become my own man even though I’m a girl. I’m going to graduate in a year and the thought of not seeing him anymore and the sight of him and his girlfriend is killing me. I wish I could be better and find someone for once."

104,I'm so lonely,"I have great friends I have a great family but I still just feel this overwhelming sense of loneliness. Sometimes it doesn't particularly bother me but others times it's all I can think about and it just makes me so sad. 

I dint know what to do to stop it, I've opened up to people before but the loneliness never left. Idk I just feel as tho I cant be myself."
105,How does the medical model of mental illness harm the public goal of mental health?,"By using a disease model on the public and tending not to fund expert professional psychotherapy from proper non-medical and non-psychiatric experts, many feel mental health services sabotage the public, when, with fewer costs, they could vastly improve the lives of millions of people, help their children, save careers, prevent poverty, preserve lifetime income and allow for much more prosperity.."
106,Mental health plan,"So this Saturday my health benefits finally kick in and I can get all the help I need. I have been steadily declining since the summer. 

My plan is to a) make it through a shit trip with my narc mom. b) get the therapy I've been needing. C) then once I'm good start exercising again. D) slowly get our finances back in order and start saving again so that we can afford a new furnace in 2-4 years. Which will help our mental health

Part b also includes my husband as he will be starting the therapy he needs and now that his PPMS is in remission he can refocus on his health. Which will help him with work which will help with his health. 
Me not taking over a caretaker role will help our relationship which will help us both.

Everything feels so impossible right now because it's too much for me. I feel overwhelmed looking at the list.

But I know that I have a plan in place. I can get it going and will succeed. I am finally ready to target the root in my mental health issues and find out if I have a diog. on anything. I've been not wanting to go that far ever before since it feels so real and I already have like imposter syndrome about all of it."
107,Am I okay !!!?,"So long story short, after 30mn of any human interaction I lose interest and I always wanna go back home and sit alone. Be that with friends in a bar, breakfast, lunch or any social activity."
108,Anxiety and effects,"I was wondering what feeling do you have physically when having and anxiety and or panic attacks. Like sore after , numbness, sharp pains or anything. 
 
I have soreness , pains in my back and neck, and numbness on my shoulders."
109,I have suicidal thoughts and zero self esteem . I cannot get anything right in my life .,"A lot of people may say “ you cannot get stuff right because of your attitude “ . But To be honest; I just keep getting problem after the other and every time I think I finally got things under control everything falls apart again... 

I am a university student, well into my 20s and I have been suffering for as long as I can remember. 
I never fit in and I have this dilemma that I am always playing “ catch” with my peers . 
I see everyone balancing their lives , going out , participate in activities and there’s me ... I will go nuts because of work . I haven’t seen anyone in ages . I haven’t seen my family in a while and I haven’t had more than 5 hours sleep in a long time . 

I am not trying to victimize my situation nor this is my goal , I am just too slow in comparison to everyone around me . 
I take time to know things and I feel very dumb . 
It is that feeling that you threw a small animal into a pack of lions . I feel out of place with the successful people I meet on a daily basis . 
My incompetence is triggering my  suicidal thoughts switch . And when I do see my family , they mock me at my worst to the point I regret coming home in the first place . 
They are there to remind me how much of a s*** of a human being I am . 
And it started to rub off to my roommate who told me last week “ you cannot even do that right?”
Mentioning that roommate/ colleague I have always felt that everything comes so easily on a silver plate for her , that she is doing so well everywhere and that she is having a fun , fulfilling life . 

I am tired of myself . In fact I have had suicidal thoughts before university as well ,because i was different for not knowing what I’ll do in the future while everyone was set on a goal . 
Also even before that ; i hated how everyone looked at me as if i was a “ mutant” just because I didn’t like what they liked and that made me very socially awkward. 
In other words even if I want to empty my bottled up negativity I am afraid because the one time i did it as a kid the school called my mom and mom gave me a harsh lecture about not telling others about my insecurities, so my only choice is going anonymously online . 

Anyways back to the topic, I am now in a phase where i cry myself to sleep when I do have the time to sleep , I feel tired , incompetent and I wish i could erase myself for my own happiness. I don’t care about ridding the world of my unneeded existence like other people . I just want to be rather more fulfilled than not . If I cannot do that I’d rather not live at all fighting a battle like this . 

PS: 3 therapists couldn’t help , one of them said I am unstable but still gave me prescriptions , and the other said I am lying and called my parents telling them I was fake . 
The school therapist also couldn’t be of much help . That was 10 years ago ."
110,my father makes me feel worthless,My father has made me feel worthless and suicidal for years. He does the most to make me understand that I cannot do anything and I am bad at everything. I once told him how I felt after years of bottling it up and he said it was my fault for being worthless and laughed when I told him I wanted to die. He now suddenly has the audacity to tell me to not be upset at him and how he’s doing everything for me. What do I do?
111,I get clusters of suicidal thoughts and panic attacks when im left alone,I can't be alone and even when I'm not I feel so lonely I stopped talking to my only friend (which is my ex girlfriend too) all the people I know are turning so cold and distant and sometiems I manage to hold it together but lately I can't have any peace and feel so socially deprived and feel like I'm little shitty attention seeker and I don't know what to do with all this and what to think of it
112,Feeling extreme misanthropy after watching Rick and morty,I fear that it'll take control over me. I don't know why I feel it to this extreme
113,Please help! Establishing healthy boundaries with a mom who has depended on me for years,"Hi all, 

I'm 24years old and have been my mom's only real confidante since before I can remember. There is some debate within me on whether or not this can be considered ""emotional incest,"" but that will have to wait for another time. 

I am currently trying to get a handle on my own mental health. I was just recently diagnosed with a chronic illness, and I'm really making an effort to take everything in stride and re-establish a healthy relationship with myself, my goals, and my environment. I have been depressed for years, and I just got on antidepressants and am actively looking for a therapist. 

That being said, my mother has been going through a really, really rough time, and has been for a number of years. Whenever we talk, it circles back to how difficult things are for her, how depressed she is, her suicidal contempations, etc. I have been actively encouraging her to seek out help, but I haven't heard or seen any progress on this front. While I have tried to be there for her in the past, I've noticed that this relationship is taking a negative toll on my life, and on my perspective of her. I do not think it's healthy for us to continue this way, and I find myself making excuses to avoid talking to her because I am no longer in a position where I am able to shoulder her pain. 

How do I make it clear that I don't want to abandon her, and that I want to be there for her/would even be willing to talk about difficult things when I am in a place to recieve them, but that I need boundaries in my adult life? How do I keep my anger in check regarding our relationship, and the way she has treated me in the past? How do I respond with kindness, let her know that I care, without making her feel abandoned or betrayed? 

Thank you"
114,I haven’t smiled in weeks...,"I can’t seem to pinpoint what’s wrong with me. I have no energy to do anything. I’ve completely withdrawn myself from seeing friends because it doesn’t even feel fun being around them. I go to school. Come home. Go to work. Come home. It’s not like I have no desire to go out and do fun things but I just don’t have the energy and it’s frustrating. Last week, I called off work all week because I just felt god awful. I went in for one day but stayed for two hours before just packing up and crying on my way back home. 

I have my first therapy appointment next week so I’m hoping that’ll help a bit but I get anxiety thinking of the cost of it and if I’ll be able to continue seeing them consistently. I’m not sure if it’s because I haven’t been outside in the sun lately or if I’m super anxious to graduate college and move far away from this place that I have no intention on staying in or if I’m just in a really deep, low place but I hope this improves. I miss having motivation and energy to just live my life."
115,Please help,
116,How do I tell my parent how I feel?,"My parents are completely oblivious. I've felt like this for years. All they know is that I have trouble sleeping and that I never clean my room. I've never talked to them about my feelings before. I feel like the conversation will be incredibly awkward, or I'll start to break down in front of them. On top of that, they are already stressed with work, and I don't want to add to their stress. I also am afraid that they'll reject or dismiss me. I don't know what I'd do if that happened. I might not even be able to say it, I'm so embarrassed with myself."
117,Who am I after recovery?,"Recovery is a strange process. I started it truly about a year ago.

Has anyone noticed that their preferences are changing? I like different colors and different types of music and different activities. 

But the real problem is, everyone spent most of high school trying to figure themselves out, but I'm halfway through college, 20 now, and I don't even know what my personality really is or who I am without my depression. I was severely depressed and suicidal from 12 to 18, and I am still trying to figure out who I really am. I don't know what I truly enjoy or what my place in the world is. I don't have many social skills, and trying to make friends is difficult. I feel as if I lost a lot of years.

I'm trying to remind myself that life is not a race. Just be happy in the little things and be happy that my life can finally begin."
118,Hallucinations when I'm falling asleep??,"I'm not sure if this is technically a hallucination, but when I'm falling asleep especially when I'm very stressed, I kinda hear sounds that aren't there. I know they aren't real, it's like somewhere in my subconscious, but also I can kind of audibly hear it. The sounds change, it's mostly like soft music or a tune playing, sometimes its chatter. It's like my brain thinks it too quiet so It makes up sounds.  The sounds almost always stop if I wake up. It's more annoying than distressing. To get rid if it I have to turn on the tv just for background noise. Is this normal? Do other people experience this?"
119,OCPD Experiences?,"Yesterday, my psychiatrist and I were talking and it was on the topic of ADHD. I mentioned to her my issues with hyper fixation in school and she said that it could be related to OCPD rather than ADHD. I haven't mentioned to her before that my mom is certain I have OCD, but I've never heard of OCPD. The symptoms sounded like me when she listed them, but I've always passed it off as being a ""perfectionist"", wanting to do good in school, or just being a very organized person. I told my mom what my psychiatrist told me and she joked that it was because I'm an ISTJ (I guess from the lists and stuff?)

So is it just my personality or OCPD? What are your experiences with the disorder?

Also, sorry, I don't know much about OCPD since yesterday was my first time hearing about it and the internet is not telling me much."
120,"I want to die, but I'm to much of a coward to do it.","I don't want to live. All the that I get happiness is fleeting, it never lasts more than at most an hour. I have nothing that I want to do with or in my life, and I don't like living; it's just bad periods with a spike in happiness every week or so. 

I have family that loves me and I have some close  friends that likes me. I live in a relatively good economic situation, I would say somewhere in the middle to higher end of the working class. I have  never been bullied, and everyone that I meet I think generally likes me. I  haven't had any bad  experiences at all in my life, no one's died in my family or in my circle of friends. In school I have good grades, and I don't have any problems with it. I have a perfectly fine and okay life with lite to no problems. 

In spite all of all that I have I still don't want to be alive. My anxiety over school is nearly always kind of in the back of my head, even though I shouldn't give a fuck, because I don't want to do anything and I want to die. My social anxiety is nearly always on in nearly every every social interaction with everyone except for my family. The social anxiety is on even when I'm with my close friends, even though it shouldn't as they probably still will be friends with me regardless. 
Because of this and some more I want to die. 

I'm somewhat of a nihilist and a pessimist, and it has finally just come to a point where I just don't see want to continue. But I can't make myself do it. 
My mind doesn't want to continue, but my whole body is against it. It's like it's throwing everything at me to stop me from doing it, and I'm to weak willed to go against it, and I'm too much of a coward to actually do something that would be better for the world.

I don't know why I'm writing this, I think it just makes me seem like an attention seeker seeking pity. I also don't think that this will do anything to help me. Well since I am posting here I might as well ask for some help, I guess? It probably won't be able to help much, but I will try at least."
121,‘You probably feel this more strongly than I do’ is a nicer perspective than ‘This is nothing.’,Just a reminder that we're all processing things differently: [https://medium.com/@cathlynmelvin/a-brief-moment-of-sunlight-25ec9656a08d](https://medium.com/@cathlynmelvin/a-brief-moment-of-sunlight-25ec9656a08d)
122,I’m using weed as a crutch for my problems..,"I’m a 28 F and I’ve struggled with mental health since I can remember. About a year ago I started experimenting with marijuana for the first time to help with my anxiety and sleeping issues, and now I smoke daily. When I’m not high, I’m looking forward to when I can get high. It’s starting to make me worry how I’m relying on it so heavily to feel good. I feel that maybe I’m just the type of person who should completely avoid anything like that because I get hooked. Has anyone else experienced this issue in their life?"
123,How can we convince my grandmother (Fmid-90s) to get help for an undiagnosed mental health condition and possible eating disorder? (UK-based),"TL:DR! my grandmother self-neglects, doesn't eat, seems depressed, refuses to see a doctor. What are our options?

Does anyone have experience of very elderly relatives self-neglecting/having depression and having to stage an intervention and get them help against their will? How do you go about doing that kindly?

(For the record, there is no suggestion at all of dementia or alzheiemers - she is incredibly clear in her mind/memory)

My grandmother has always seemed to have a tricky relationship with food, usually only eating mouthfuls, or just pushing food around her plate. It's something we've always kept an eye on but we figured she'd got by like that for her entire adult life and she just doesn't manage large quantities of food. She's tiny in stature but she's hardy, stubborn, and has lived independently (without nurses or additional help) to a very old age.

Things got really bad when my granddad died a couple of years ago (he wasn't the nicest, and was a bit controlling towards her). She went downhill very quickly, and during that time she really wasn't looking after herself or the house and ended up being hospitalised.

Side note: no matter how ill she gets, she flat out *refuses* to see a doctor. The woman got through shingles in her late 80s without telling a soul. She won't even see an optician or anything. In the end, her cough got so bad that she had to go to the doctor and they immediately admitted her to hospital where she stayed for many weeks. I think that episode reinforced why she doesn't see doctors - she is convinced they will send her away to hospital.

Anyway, she seemed to be doing a lot better after she was discharged. She wanted to move nearer to us and we found her a really nice flat, nearer to the family. She started eating again and taking pride in the new flat, enjoying making little decisions about decorating for the first time without her husband.

Trouble is that she absolutely refuses to let anyone help her (medical profession, cleaners, carers, etc.) and only accepts very limited help from family. We do everything that she'll let us: my mum or my uncle will visit her at least once a week and take her food shopping and also stay and eat with her. But we can't supervise every meal and she won't allow us to clean.

That was working well until recently - she seems to have gotten bad again. She clearly isn't eating - she is incredibly thin and ill. She is evasive about the topic of her health and food and is very good at brushing everything off. She lies that she doesn't need to go food shopping and that she has food in the house. She'll say she doesn't want bread, doesn't like it anymore, doesn't like eggs, that she has 'loads of bread in the freezer' - but when we check there is none anywhere in the house. She's funny about us looking in her fridge/freezer/cupboards and also won't let us near her bins or take the bins out like she's hiding something - we suspect she's throwing food away.

When we bring up seeing a doctor, she lies about having been (a. it's highly unlikely she would have gone at all, let alone on her own. and b. the doc has apparently told her she's in 'perfect health' and sent her away - which they really wouldn't have done given her BMI).

The flat is also in a bad way - she isn't washing herself or cleaning anything in the house (note - she is very elderly, but is so adamant that she will not accept someone coming in to help)

She says she feels lonely and isolated, but then also blocks any suggestions of going to local community centers, meeting new people, or being moved into a nursing home where she might enjoy a bit more community. She says she doesn't want to meet or see people.

She talks often about how 'it doesn't matter' - ' I wont be here much longer anyway' - 'I thought I'd be dead by now...'

I'm convinced this is more than just 'being elderly' and not being able to cope with day-to-day tasks and I suspect she's severely depressed and/or dealing with an eating disorder.

I know she's really old and would die naturally soon even if she was looking after herself, but self-neglecting and living with depression is such a horrible way to live your last few years. I have no idea how hard it would be to tackle an eating disorder in your mid-90s but it seems wrong for us, her family, not to help her try.

So far we haven't insisted or forced things on her. At which point can you? We can't force her to allow a cleaner or a carer into her own home against her will. We can't force her to see a doctor and talk to them about her mental health if she doesn't want to. We can't force her to eat. We can't force her into a Care Home.

Does anyone have experience of very elderly relatives self-neglecting/having depression and having to stage an intervention and get them help against their will? How do you go about doing that kindly?"
124,autism diagnosed at older age,Anyone here who got diagnosed with autism in their 20s? How did it happen? Did you notice some symptomps yourself and decided to get it checked out? Did a doctor made you realize there IS something wrong?
125,"I feel like someone else has taken over my body, I can't tell if I'm faking or not, please help me out","I've avoided researching too much into this because I don't want my brain to latch on to information and convince me that I'm experiencing these things. Also sorry in advance if this is a jumbled mess, I still haven't completely figured out what's going on.

I don't know how to describe this other than it feeling like I've infiltrated someone else's body and adopted her memories as my own. They're my memories, I know that, but I don't feel a connection to them. It doesn't feel like I progressed from a baby into who I am in a time line, it's like there are two timelines, me now and the person I'm supposed to have been before. I'm watching the timeline of the kid from my own timeline but they're not connected. Maybe this is normal, all I know is that I definitely felt a connection to the memories before and now I don't.

Right now, I can't tell if I'm in a stranger's body, or if something else has come into my mind with me and is interfering with my ability to know who I am. It's progressed more and more this whole week. It went from random jolts of who the fuck am I every one or two hours (dk if it's normal, but this definitely hasn't happened before) to me feeling like I'm something without an identity or face, and I'm just in this shell that's my body. Usually I can sleep off any strange moods I'm in but this was the first thing I felt in the morning.

I've also started experiencing bursts of not recognizing my own voice, and feeling like I don't know my family.

Looking in the mirror doesn't do anything, because it's like I'm starting at a statue or something, it seems to not be registering that I have a face. When looking at pictures of myself, my face looks lopsided and kind of deformed.

It's so hard to explain most of these things so I don't know if I'm faking but there is definitely something that feels off.

Before this, I would space out without knowing it. I'd realize that I'd been staring at someone in class for too long (not because they're attractive or something stands out about their appearance). My eyes just rest on them and I don't realize it. Or I'll be paying attention in class, and genuinely think I'm paying attention but I'm not. An example would be me thinking I was paying attention in my foreign language class, then out of nowhere everyone is staring at me waiting for me to clear my desk to take the test. I could've sworn I was completely paying attention, but idk what happened. I'm not daydreaming during this time, and my mind isn't particularly preoccupied with something. Again, these things might be normal, but up until maybe a few years ago, I've never experienced them.

Just in general I feel slow too. Slow to react to certain things, it's like I've been sedated. Bumping into people in the halls of school has become more common, etc. My mom even says I've started seeming generally apathetic to everything. The way I talk has been really affected. I'll start sentences and forget what direction I was taking when speaking, so I'll either have weirdly long pauses in the middle of sentences, or I'll mush two words together, or my sentences will end up just not making any sense. Even if I knew exactly what I wanted to say, the words just won't be put in the right order or I'll just forget what I wanted to say. 

I'm not sure what this is, how real or how serious it is, but even if I'm not focused on trying to figure out what's going on, I feel off, so can anyone confirm if I'm making this up or what? I'm definitely not making up the thing about the speaking abilities worsening because people have been commenting on it but idk what to do about it.

And this isn't because of substances, last time I've taken anything was over 3 months ago."
126,How do you stop comparing yourself with your peers? (specific techniques please!),"A decade of severe depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder has definitely withered away a lot of my life. 

I think it's natural to get jealous and maybe even angry and bitter at the hand you've been dealt. This obviously is ignoring the fact that all of us have a choice, however difficult it may seem, in responding differently to our natural inclination to depression. 

BUT at the end of the day, if you don't remind yourself that everyone moves through life in different, winding paths at our own pace, you are sunk. That's just how life works for everyone. If you can't find a way to think positively, you crash and burn. 

**What are specific ways you snap yourself out of comparison?**"
127,Not doing well. Been quiet for a bit.,"I've tried to be quiet and not whine about every single little thing that I'm fealing but I'm really having a hard time today. I can feel the angst and restlessness and the need for fire building up like a thunderstorm. It is Sat. so everyone ishould is home and it's kind of too miserable out to walk. Besides, I don't trust myself walking many places alone (only to the bus stop when I am still not quite awake, downtown where there are a lot of people around, and home from the bus stop top when I am too tired from a full day of the Program to do much) and nobody wants to go outside. Sigh, I will eND up burning something over the toilet or cutting...so I'm gonna watch some videos to see if I can distract myself.

Sorry to bother y'all. I know I'm nothing but a pain in the ass and a whiny bitch.

Peace out and Namaste to all."
128,I've given up,"Every time I feel as tho it's getting better something just comes along and knocks it over. I'm so tired of feeling like this. Everything it's just evrything I cant deal with it anymore I dont know what to do. I just want to get out but I cant and 
I'm sinking"
129,Everything's just falling apart,My life everything Its i cant. I dotn know how to put it in words anymore but I'm just sad all the time I'm falling onto this pit of despair. Everytime it try and climb up I fall and
130,Kept thinking about the past,"Sometimes I feeel like I'm over exagerating things that happened to me, and when I'm down, I get stuck in a cycle of self pity for days until, one day I wake up and feel fine again. Then it relapses. 
Sine I could remember, I was physically bulied by my older brothers as a child. Had no one to talk to. People made fun of me when I talk (follow tv shows as example). I spent my days lonely and the only company I felt like I had was my neighbour's dog when I was in kindergarden. In primary school, I'd always get in trouble for not doing my work, slow in copying stuff on the board. Its not like I want to forget, I just do. The worse was when I actively tried my best and hardest to finish all my homework but forgot a few as they werent written on the homework section on the board. I feel isolated from people my age, i can't remember people I've talked to. I tried to be social, and everyone says im annoying. I sometimes actively try to get into fights even though im a girl, but not on purpose, I was just frustrated and i wanted to vent by baiting them on. I cried (no sound, just tears) that day out of guilt and anger, because I couldnt understand why I'd do that, and what the guy said snapped me out of it, I was unreasonable, im sorry. My classmate berated the person i provoked which honestly made me cry more as it wasnt his fault.  I couldn't stop talking in a condescending way(like make fun of others), it was traumatic as in my head I'm just screaming at myself to stop talking. I tried my damn hardest to practice speaking politely, and smile nicely after that. I'd always thought relationships were somethibg that could make me happy(barbie for ex. Or other disney shows or anime), and was heart broken when i relised I cant understand whether a guy liked me or not. (Apparently, sex doesn't equal love, but really I didnt even know what sex was when I was 8, but thank god my instincts were screaming at me to not talk to my classmate anymore). When i was 9 people just kept blaming me for stuff, usually they were adults. It got to the point where I believed everything was my fault. I made my friend cry once, when I was roleplaying to myself to be a ""strict and upright "" person for a day. It haunts me, as I realised well aparently sticking to rules too firmly is annoying to others. My childhood friend got a new friend, and i knew she dislikes me, she picked her. This happened a around 4 times in my whole childhood. Sometimes, i get the ""you don't have problems, your family is rich"" from people around me, yea, but that's not my money, my family doesn't buy stuff, we just have a nice house, I realised people dont really care much i guess my feeling arent that important. When I was 11, i transfered, was bullied by a prefect and the first person I met. People at my old school asked me""are we not good enough that you'd tranfer/are you looking down on us-as it was a public to private school transfer"" i forgot all my old classmates in 3 months, despite knowing every single one of them for 5 years. I felt insecure of my memory. I've at most remembered 5 names out of 40 of them. My parents were nice, mean when I'm not listening to them, but decent, which is why I was super hurt when my mom would randomly say""you'd be slapped by your husband in the future"" "" you know that aunt I dont like? You remind me of her"" , as she would be super caring at other tines, I honestly hate the idea of dating even till now, so i've never dated even tho I get the ocasional crush(my mom says that as one of my aunt(on my dads side) is in an abusive relationship, my parent have never fought verbally nor physically) . my dad doesn't talk much to me when I was young. 
Now that I'm older, I get along with my dad, as I realised he's just not interested in others life too much, so I'd ask him about his. I get along with my mom, although her random snide comments do hurt. My parents chabged alot when I off handly said they didnt feel like parents to me at secondary school, apparently they were so shocked they went around asking for advice to be more caring.My brothers dont bully me anymore. The friends I make? They are at a distance, my memory has been much better. But the memories do pop up randomly at times and I'd drown in it for hours at times. I'd complained casually once, and the response was the generic look forward as they are in the past. But its when it creep up on me that it sucks"
131,I need someone in IRL who I can let my heart out to who won’t call the police. I feel so alone. I’m hurting so much.,"I have no one I can trust. It’s killing me to bottle this up. 

I’ve been in therapy for 14 years. They convinced me to put trust in myself, but once becoming suicidal, they say the opposite. 

I just want someone to trust me. I promise I will fight for it my life if someone will just fucking trust that I know what will help me and what will hurt me. (*The hospital will hurt me*) I want to take control of my treatment, and I think I have a right to do that. And I think I have a right to a dignified process.

I feel heartbroken... but by a million people at once  vs. just one. I’ve feel dehumanized by what I’ve experienced since becoming suicidal. 

If I make it, I promise to be that one person who will allow those who are suffering autonomy. I will prioritize their relief over their life; and that may sound awful to some, but everyone else is doing the opposite. There needs to be balance."
132,"Accidentally interrupted a suicide attempt... upset with my T, help","I feel like my T failed me last night, am I wrong? Help

Last night I was at work and I walked into the back, and my employee had a knife, held it up over his shoulder, and then swiftly into his wrist—well he tried, I screamed so loud that he ended up missing and just got a small scratch. He was drunk, he admitted to 6 beers and a kolonipin, he also wasn’t working at the time, he lives in his car in our parking lot and I assumed he came in to use the bathroom. So, I accidentally  interrupted a suicide attempt. After making sure he was safe and getting someone else to watch him, I went to the bathroom and sobbed, I couldn’t stop shaking and I text my therapist, it was around 10:50 pm, which I know is late! I have been seeing him for 10 months and I have never called/texted/ emailed. The offer to contact him at anytime has always been there, I just never felt the need before. He replied within 10 minutes and told me if I wanted to talk about it, I could text him tomorrow (today) between 9-2. I didn’t bother, as I have been at work the entire time. I just feel like this (on top of you know, all my other trauma and BPD) would be a lot for anyone, and maybe some talking during that time would have been more appropriate. However, I do realize that it was late, and he is a person who may have been sleeping or partying (he is young, maybe 27-30 tops) or just relaxing and it is not really his responsibility, but I just can’t shake the feeling that he could have offered a little more at this time. I see him Monday and I don’t want to accuse him of anything, but I also don’t know if I really have any justification for these feelings. Help?"
133,How do I talk to a counselor?,"Recently, I've been having some mental health problems. I don't know what's causing them. I've had a couple of friends asking me/encouraging me to talk and pointing out that something is bothering me. My work also has a chart with different mental health states and all my stuff is either in the injured or ill columns.

I plan on going to talk to a counselor or therapist or whatever the right term is, but I don't want to feel like I'm wasting their time. What do I say to them so that I'm not in the way of someone who needs help more?"
134,A broken heart on top of depression,I actually made it out of my house today. It was only for 2 hours but that's progress I suppose. I did break down at the restaurant and just cry.

135,Bedtime anxiety,"For about 6 weeks I have struggled with bedtime anxiety. I feel fine during the days and usually all evenings aswell, but as soon as I go to bed i feel my pulse raising and a general sense of unease. Does anyone else experience this?"
136,How do I explain anxiety?,"      I’m 27. I’ve struggled with being anxious from childhood. I always thought it was something I would grow out of, but i am realizing that probably won’t happen. People close to me seem fed up with my behavior. As am I. I’m staying inside most of the day, I’m not communicating with friends and it’s become pretty tough to get through a week. Im having trouble explaining exactly what’s going on in my head to other people.  It makes sense that they would be more understanding if I could explain what I’m feeling or how I feel. But I can’t seem to do that very well.  I’ve noticed that it gets even hard to talk when I’m worried about even one thing. I wish people could read my mind so they could see what’s going on but I know they can’t. So what do I say to people close to me telling me that I need to change? Or that they don’t understand. It’s getting real old hearing people tell me that somethings wrong with me if I don’t have goals or don’t seem interested. I understand where they’re coming from, but it’s hard to cope with feelings I can’t seem to dissipate. I know I’ve rambled here I just would like to have advice on what to say."
137,Question for anyone that’s ever taken Antidepressants,"Hi everyone - 

I have been on a slew of antidepressants in the past year, and just switched to a new psychiatrist. I told her my history with antidepressants, and that I have a tendency to be sensitive to medications. She started me on a low dose of Zoloft recently, and since starting it, I have been extremely itchy all over, very irritable, and my entire body hurts. It’s almost like a musculoskeletal pain or arthritis kind of pain, but my entire body. I have spoken to her about it but she hasn’t wanted to do anything about it yet.

I was wondering if this or anything similar has happened to anyone else on antidepressants or specifically on Zoloft?

I hope you are all well!"
138,"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm dangerously sick. Someone please help me.","I'm a 19 year old male, I was sexually abused for an extended period of time during kindergarten, abused by two of my step fathers, and have abandonment issues due to father figures coming and going in my life. I self harm regularly and have absolutely no impulse control, I sometimes cut/burn at work, in public, at friend's houses, etc. The earliest memory I have of SHing was when I was a very young child. I broke a piece of the dashboard of our car off and started scraping my legs until they bled. My mom scolded me and told me that only ""crazy"" people do that, but I kept going and still hurt myself today. I often times have visions of myself being brutally mutilated or dying, by my own hands most of the time. I have tried to take my own life 4 times already, and I have the urge to try again at least once a week. I'm obsessed with pain and feeling like shit, I do everything I can to hurt myself physically and emotionally. My emotions are very intense, and tend to come out of no where. Something everyone else can shrug off is something that bothers me throughout the whole day until I can go home and slit my legs open. The only break I get from this constant hell is when I have my weird moments where I feel completely empty and emotionless, or when I black out. My blackouts happen throughout the day at random. I'll do a task at work, have no recollection of doing said task, and go to do it again 5 minutes later, just to find that I had just done that. I've had serious episodes before where I lost track of where I am, and sometimes even who I am and what I'm meant to be doing. This happens constantly and it can be very scary and frustrating at times. don't know what's wrong with me, I truly fucking don't. My girlfriend is a psych major and has a copy of the DSM-V, and she's pretty confident that I have BPD. Someone please help me, this is going to kill me."
139,What happens when you say you think about suicide at therapy?,"I have always heard that if they hear that you are going/want to kill your self, they will have to do something ab it. On Wednesday, I am going to my first therapy appointment in like 2 months with a brand new person, and I don’t know if I should be honest or not when they ask that.

But it’s also difficult, because yea sometimes I just want to die and nothing is worth it. But at the same time, even though I think ab it a lot, I am not going to. It’s not like I’m am scared to, I just know I have God but my side and even tho it’s tough now it won’t be later and I know he has my bets Interest in mind and he is doing what he needs to do. I know my life has purpose, but I still think about wanting to die, I will never do it tho. So at that point should I even say I have thought about suicide?"

141,*brags about how good this title is*,"I brag about the things that I am good at. Especially at school things. Grades, amount of homework done, progress on a project.  I hate that I think like that, I hate that I think like I'm better than  them if I had a better grade or something.

On the other hand, I don't even want to make the conversation about me. This is why I almost never can strike up a conversation myself, but when I do, I'll only say about the good things I've done. Which makes their opinion of me lobsided."

Lately, I’ve been feeling sad and my anxiety as been all over the place. I don’t know what to do!"
143,what is wrong with me?,"Hey Reddit. 

so, i’m new to all of this and i’m not exactly sure how it works or if any of this is appropriate. However, i will still post it. 

for some background i am 18 years old  and transgender male to female. 

since i can remember i have been treated by the mental health services here in the UK. i was diagnosed with a handful of things before i reached the age of 14. however, doctors have always said to me (whilst i was 13-16) that i show symptoms of several mental health disorders but could not diagnose me with anything because of my age (bipolar, some have speculated BPD, and the most common confirmed, yet somehow undiagnosed, PTSD)

once i reached 18 i had hopes of getting these diagnosis’ (before anyone says anything, i know we shouldn’t want and/or label a diagnosis, however, i feel with diagnosis’ they can open doors for new means of help, ie, medication, specific forms of therapy etc). although, once reaching 18 the adult mental health services refused to put me on their books by stating i wasn’t “severe enough”. to rub salt in the wounds they sent me a list of what IS considered severe enough. this consisted of drug addiction, homicidal thoughts etc. but that is neither here nor there. 

I have been recently taking matters into my own hands and doing research into what could possibly be wrong with me. before i say what i think the issue could be i just want to give an insight on what exactly consists of me being “unstable”. 

*Outbursts of rage - every now and then something inconvenient will happen that will fill me with an almost uncontrollable feeling of pure rage. this could be things such as dropping my phone, not liking how my food tastes or not being able to sleep. i however most get like this when i feel as if someone is on a higher level than me and i feel belittled. usually i’m pretty good with containing it. by “containing” it i mean by clenching my whole body and waiting until i get home to completely break down, scream and smash everything in sight. 

*Self image - growing up male, i was incredibly unattractive. even at the start of my transition i looked like a mess. i was bullied relentlessly for everything i did. however, once i turned about 15 or 16 i started to look good. i started getting compliments everywhere i went but it was never good enough for me and i felt as if it was just something people would say to keep up friendly conversation. then once i got this validation from everybody i couldn’t live without it. if i didn’t get a compliment one day i would completely shut down and feel worthless and ugly. i had/have to be the best looking in the room, i have to be the funniest, the smartest, just the BEST. i cant stop until i’m the physical embodiment of perfection. if i look in the mirror and even the SLIGHTEST imperfection is on my face, or even if i just don’t like how i look a certain day, it will send me into a complete rage. 

*Outlook on life - my days consist of a cycle of either “the world is beautiful, nature is great, i’m a practicing buddhist! drinking water everyday to keep healthy :)”  to  “everything and everyone is pointless, i don’t care about anyone other than myself and why should i? no one cares for me why should i return the favour. if i can’t be happy then no one can”. 

me and my mum are really into psychology and enjoy psycho-analysing one another. we were discussing yesterday about me and she said something very interesting. she told me she is no longer assuming i am bipolar, she however thinks i am a narcissist with slight sociopathic tendencies. her reasons for this were:

-My inability to feel bad for anyone or anything except for certain circumstances
-My selfishness 
-My desire to strip anyone else of happiness for my own expense 
-My manipulation 

i know from the outside it looks as if my mother is being toxic and rude but i assure you it is not like that. 

if anyone relates or if anyone can help me to better understand myself i would be more than happy to elaborate in the reply section. i could not possibly write every detail in this post as it would just be too much to read."
144,I dont know what to do..,"I really can‘t talk about it in real life, so i made this account here. I had a really bad panic attack for the first time about 6 months ago. It felt like I was going crazy and since then everything got worse. Everything feels fake, like I‘m dreaming. I‘m in such a bad mental state, i have no friends left. Went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with an anxiety/panic disorder. I hated therapy and stopped going there. I take medication daily. It doesn‘t help. I‘ve read many thing about so called derealisation and it feels somehow like that.  Doing anything that used to bring me joy fills me with so much panic. It was always hard for me to make friends and i always had the feeling that I struggle with my mental health. But now I know what that feels like. I used to smoke and drink alcohol, went to parties and was actually a extrovert. I quit everything because only the thought of drinking or smoking makes me so nervous. I couldnt go to university anymore, every day was so painful that i cried non stop on my way home. I feel like I‘m never going to be happy and I‘m just wasting  my time. Everything is meaningless. I just want to feel alive again. Does anyone know what I should do?
I‘m not suicidal, I want to live I really do. But I just don‘t know how.."
145,I feel dizzy when thinking of that certain place,"I lost someone (not dead), a few years ago. And I got scared again or some shit, so I ran away from home and school. Until I came somewhere I stayed for hours. After that I got caught by the police and got home. But after a few months (now), I get dizzy when I think of that specific location. I saw the one who I've lost also there, mostly sitting next to me or screaming at me.



So when I think of that specific place I just get dizzy and see everything turning, it's not that drastic but I wanna know why."

I thought I would pass and everything would be okay, but no. it's my birthday month too. my 16TH BIRTHDAY MONTH...AND IT SUCKS.

150,How do people feel/what do they think (or you) when people always justify themselves?,"Like, whenever I’m talking to people in person or text, I always say “sorry if I’m being annoying” or like when I ask them something I say “if not it’s fine!” Stuff like that.

I know I don’t need to and I feel like it’s really annoying to people to read it when my message could probably be so much shorter if I cut those things out, but like, I’m just curious what people think when they read it.

Like if I’m just making it a big deal out of nothing (I probably am, I tend to do that) or if people do actually find it annoying

I’ve been trying to catch myself and stop, but I just feel bad, idk, lol."
151,I have cried every day for the past 5 months,"I genuinely don't want to live, I feel so lonely, all I have ever wanted is somebody who cares about me, to know that I am on somebody's mind for a while. I do not enjoy anything and often sit and stare for large portions of my day. I really want a girlfriend and have no social skills and I don't know how to make friends or to get a girlfriend. I feel like nobody cares about me and almost everybody annoys me. I haven't experienced the same things as most people and quite often don't know how to have a conversation when people talk about movie references, songs etc. because usually I haven't watched or enjoy any movies like that. I have watched very few movies and don't listen to pop songs and can't really relate to people. People with personalities people love tend to annoy me and I don't enjoy talking to them. I am extremely lonely and don't really relate to people. I tend to be the last person asked to do anything. I feel like death would be an easier way to end my pain than by solving my problems. I am extremely awkward when talking to people and it bothers me."
152,I don’t wanna see myself like this again,Hey im here to share my story and here it goes.... i was in 8th standard and my whole life started to change i used to get so depressed abt every little thing and make it look lyk a big deal if my parents asked me to come for dinner i used to say no and when they asked me over n over again or even raised their voice a little i used to make a big issue out of it start crying not eat for days. This continued till i was in 12th standard i used to harm myself for the slightest inconvenience and hurt my parents to the most it never used to be my intention to do that but at that situation I reacted in that way my parents cried looking at me in situations i used to hurt myself feel so guilty that im good for nothing that I cannot make my parents happy. Everything changed when i moved to another country for my higher studies i met a guy there who literally changed my life I looked at life differently I understood things from my parents side my parents speak to him occasionally n tell me im lucky to have him in my life that he helps me understand and guide me its been a year everything was going good and exactly after a 1 yr 2 months i fell into a fight with the guy over a simplest thing n it was actually my fault but I fought so badly i cried so loud harmed my self n my whole body was shivering I looked at myself in the mirror n it was the same me a year ago it didn’t change I dint change I donot understand me I cannot control myself im always letting myself n my family down i feel terrible i want to seek help can anyone pls suggest me things. Thankyou
153,poem I've been writing about wanting to kill myself,"Clawing at the walls,
their closing in, 
where did the air go,
it's getting thin, 
which way is up,
i do not know, 
it's getting dark, 
spinning, 
alone, 
falling fast, 
losing forever, 
this is it, 
i have the answer, 
goodbye
goodbye
Goodnight forever.
hopefully tomorrow will be better."
154,Alternative to Traditional Therapy?,"TL;DR I think that I might be a maladaptive perfectionist and I want to get better, but I don’t have the time, money, interest or patience to go to a therapist about it. Solutions?"
155,I... want to die... again,"I'm back here... again. This time, though, I don't see a future. I don't see my happily ever after like I've been planning. Now that's all gone. I just want to disappear and die. I have a plan. I wrote a note. My fiance saw my note and said nothing to me. They brushed it off, like nothing happened. I feel like a burden, but I don't want to be a burden with my dead body. I'm more or less venting at this point. Maybe I should just end it."
156,"I watched Joker again today, and Arthur and Joker are both so relatable","I rewatched it after theaters and I feel the same now. Arthur was hurting, and he couldn't get past that hurt to see what he loved doing. I love that he gets his retribution by killing those who not only hurt him, but shamed him for being different. His mother, who would silently shame him with passive aggressive disagreements (and other things but that's mainly what you see). Murray, who only wanted to laugh at him and make him look like a freak in front of others because he knew the revolution would become out of hand. Everyone in Gotham treated him like a punchline. Like he wasn't volatile and ready to explode at any moment, but he was ready to fly and hunt at the end. He didn't need to hide behind a mask because he struck fear in everyone automatically. I looked up to DC characters as a kid because they knew what torture and abandonment felt like as well, but Arthur Fleck is almost inspiring to see him become the new head of a dead town. I look up to people like him, like me, who have nothing left but to try to take back what was wrenched from our hands, and I revere those who really will do whatever they have to to ensure their freedom from pain. He honestly was a hero in the end, and those people who treated him so horribly should've been ready for the brutal end they got."
157,I think I've ruined a close friendship and it's really damaged me,"So last Thursday I had a really great night with one of my close friends and we ended up alone and we had been drinking... my perception was that it got a bit flirty and if one of us had had of made a move it would've ended physically (you get the picture). I did once have feelings for this person and i think i still might do, especially after that night. Then the next day we were out with a few other people and j was trying just to talk and be ljke how we usually are, not flirty or anything, and i felt a bit ignored. This built up and built up and noticably brought my mood down. When i got home i texted the person because they are usually the one I've been talking to about a lot of my problems and i told them i was beginning to have suicidal thoughts again (which i was). The next day i saw them again and it just felt like i was getting the cold shoulder again. I asked and they basically told me they were sick of me being in a low mood all the time and talkjng about my problems and they told me to 'lay off' which i understand and told them that but it was really hurtful. Then after that we hadn't spoke for a bit so i tried to start a conversation and got ignored. Then i snapped and had a real go at them for ignoring me and they just got ticked off too and i regret it because it ended with them saying we shouldn't talk anymore and me realising how stupid I'd been. I've apologised multiple times and they've said they've accepted it but i still feel as though they don't want to be around me and don't like me anymore. I'm trying to give it time but they were like my only close friend and now i feel as though i have no one. I really don't know what to do and want to fix things so that they are like how they were last thursday. I see them havjng a great time with my other friends and then it's like I'm either not there or they just really don't like me. I just want to fix it because something is definitely wrong and it's just destroying me."
158,Rant bc I've never told anyone this in my life nor do I have any kind of friend I trust,"I have my phone and the laptop I’m typing this on but I don’t have conversations over text, I don’t get it (how to have a conversation). I’m grounded because I have low grades (2 c's) and it affects our family but I don’t fucking get it. Like, what does that actually mean for my future and all I don’t get it most of the time I’ve either been able to talk my way into something or I just get fucking mad and get over it. Like, I broke my computer which is something that I used to play on a fucking lot, like over 8 hours a day, but it’s broke now and it’s whatever, I miss it but I was addicted to that shit and I’m anxious about playing games because it’s seen as a dumbass thing to do by most people so that keeps me from really caring and when I find myself caring I beat myself up. Now I just sit in 1 of 3 places and watch youtube and occasionally check instagram, sometimes I laugh at insta memes but I’m not sure if it’s partly genuine or not, I feel like it’s to make me feel “normal” and also a show for other people to make me seem like a better person (more social &amp; happy &amp; human). I think I might just have instagram because it allows me to play into a fantasy of not being super lonely &amp; too insecure. I’ve been too anxious to post there but there’s a confidence boost I got from it bc I’m following about 30-50 people and I have about 2x the followers so when people see my page they might assume that I'm more interesting/have a funny/social/good side. I can’t really talk to females or males conversation wise that’s why the only 2 friends I have are hyperactive as fuck because they just fucking talk and talk but it’s conversation and socializing where all I have to do is listen and I feel content with it even if they annoy the fuck out of me because I just want that human interaction. Sometimes I get energetic especially at night when everyone’s asleep &amp; I’m alone listening to music but it’s an awful feeling because of how I suppress it so much because I feel like I’m a fucking weirdo. I’m getting more insecure because my only friend who I ever hang out with talks more and more about talking to girls and hanging out with friends &amp; is active on social media I get insecure that he’s not gonna hangout with me anymore since that’s what another friend of mine did. When he started being more social now he barely wants to hangout with me and I kinda read signals that he doesn’t like me, not as much now since we had a good few short conversations about some drama that happened. I get a sense that he thinks I have a fucked up view on life &amp; shit so he is apprehensive about both being my friend and not being my friend. The act of having conversation with anyone makes me fucking anxious because I feel like I can’t have a normal conversation, even my mom gets mad at me for it sometimes and my dad has to. Sometimes I get angry enough at my parents where I lash out physically but I could never yell because it makes me anxious, if I could it would probably help me get some anger out where it doesn’t build up like that but I can’t even speak with my normal voice I always do that high pitch thing people do when they’re anxious I can’t speak relaxed because there’s always a lot of tension in my voice. I’d love to branch out and meet new people but I genuinely get fucking confused when talking to people and can’t keep a steady train of thought because I have so many things going through my mind. Also, I have body dysmorphia not diagnosed like I have been with depression and anxiety but I haven’t ever went into detail with it. Just reading the symptoms and shit I know I have it, used to always look in the mirror whatever reflection I could 30-50x times a day, now I avoid mirrors altogether pretty much, one time I was at camp and didn’t recognize myself at first after catching a glimpse and I wish I could be like that all the time (never see mirrors) but that’s not realistic. I do think about it and judge myself constantly though occasionally I can’t help to look in a mirror but it’s not for a long time because I just can’t handle the stress it gives me. I've had suicidal thoughts because of it."
159,What is this?,"Hey guys im 16 and i have had anxiety most of my life and ive had depression for about a year now. Well, about 2 weeks ago i smoked a little too much weed and had a bad panic attack and i dissociated very badly. Since then, I have felt very numb and just kinda weird. My depression has gotten worse and im just constantly emotionless and bored. Also, i have been dissociating since then. It'll happen a lot throughout the day and last for maybe 30-45 minutes and after its over ill just be depressed again. But even after the initial dissociation period is  over i still feel kinda ""off"" I was just wondering what this is and could the weed have triggered something? Thanks for any responses."
160,Don't understand how to enjoy life and be remotely fucking normal,"Currently in university and do part-time programming work; high grades and decent pay but incapable of maintaining good/healthy habits for shit, zero self-control, life is an utter mess. I'm a lazy tosspot who whiles away most of my free time on pointless shit like abstract music/art and obscure software with no tangible value.

Been sleeping 3 hours a night the past month as my body just won't let me sleep more (and I have terrifying nightmares), and appetite fluctuates like crazy. Also been wrongly referred to an ""early intervention in psychosis"" unit as the deluded government social worker I had to speak to completely misconstrued me and made erroneous assumptions.

While I somehow still have friends, I'm a KHV/never had a gf as there's something intrinsically off about my personality; I used to do modelling so know I'm not hideous, girls have asked me to sleep with them and I've shared a bed but always too shy to make a move.

I spend hours literally talking to myself, as I get into arguments with myself as if I'm talking to another person and compulsively have to try resolve the conflict, it's really odd... even in public, I don't give a fuck anymore. I can't comprehend my internal monologue, it's like a personality that's continually shifting and trying to sabotage me.

Only reason I haven't killed myself is I couldn't do that to my family, but I'm effectively killing myself in life smoking like a chimney and drinking like a fish to escape this torture, don't know how to stop.

Venting I guess but desperate for any advice on what to do, if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and just how to feel normal and want to work towards something ultimately constructive and more than myself so to speak."
161,Not sure how to even put this..,"I'm going to regret not making this on a throwaway account, but whatever. 

I've dealt with having depression in the past, I'd say since fifth grade to, maybe half of sixth grade, which led to few suicide attempts. I knew why I did most of it, and that was because of my mom. She was a paranoid, narcissistic schizo and pretty crazy. Recently, she lost custody of me because of her taking me states away from my home state without my, or my dad's consent and she didnt let me pack anything. Anyway, ever since that even happened I've just felt so numb, and it's been hard to have empathy towards anyone, and I've manipulated and lied to so many people. I feel like everyone is going to outsmart me, but I tell myself not to be like my paranoid mother. I can't keep any relationships because I find it hard to talk to people, and I'm pretty antisocial, and very bad at keeping and committing to relationships, as for example, I had a relationship that I was quite happy in, and I'd say I felt something towards him, whether or not the feelings were forced by me or not, and I lost it. I also lost my closest childhood friend a year ago, which wasn't too hard to get over, but a lot to comprehend because I knew I wouldnt have her around anymore, because I've felt like I've had nobody to talk to about my past emotions, or how I feel now. Welp, let me know what you guys think.. I probably need therapy"
162,Idk if i have OCD or not and I want to find out.,"I have impulses to do things certain amounts of times. Like turning doorknobs or having things in line. Whatever happens to the left happens to the right then to the middle. The amount of times I can do an action is 1 3 5 6 15 35 30 33 35 50 51 53 55 60 61 63 65 75 100 times, so if I don't do a certain routine like turning on taps 3 times correctly I then have to do it 5 times and so on. I don't want to do any of these routines. It's just an impulse. I haven't been diagnosed with OCD, however I have with aspergers. These routines get very frustrating when I'm on a schedule. I've tried not doing them but it feels like a weight on my brain that I can't take off until I do. Do I have OCD or is it something else?"
163,"I would like to get some opinions (a bit of a vent). If your job becomes ""toxic"" such that it negatively affects your mental health regularly and possibly affects job performance, what would your course of action be: look for new job or stay at job (more info in post)","I am new to my field. I have been in my job for a year now. Great boss, the type of work itself is great (although can cause stress due to there being a lot of work and I'm the only manager in my department at that site to do that work), the residents I work with are lovely and I have helped make some great mental health changes for them to improve their quality of life, but the last few months have caused undue stress due to staff/coworkers. They have been escalating more recently, with this past week feeling like I am being completely disrespected and my opinions and knowledge base entirely undermined and ignored. My boss (she works at our sister site but does try to come weekly) sees what is going on and is aware of the negative dynamics. I am working with her to try and continue to grow in my own ways as a manager as well as hopefully to help reduce these negative coworker interactions, but honestly I have had a few instances where I've not wanted to come into work because of the staff issues. 

In a conversation about my frustrations I told my partner that if the environment becomes too toxic I will look for a new job. He has argued with me on a few occasions since that this is a bad idea, because he claims that I will be the ""bottom of the totem pole"" and if there are any cuts I am first to go (healthcare, and in AB Canada, so currently that is actually a reality unfortunately). Much like coworkers, he is focusing on one single part of an entire context I've laid out and essentially making it out that I'm going to quit tomorrow because one staff said something mean to me. No, this is a hypothetical of if over the rest of this year things escalate or continue to stay as they are with no improvements even with my and my boss's best efforts and it starts to regularly/significantly carry over into my own mental health stability and triggers poor mental health (dx bipolar 2) that in turn might possibly affect performance and even attendance, then I would 100% try to find a new job ASAP.

Obviously, I understand that with any new job there are risks. He claims that if I were to be in an interview and were asked why I'm leaving, if I explain that there is a negative working atmosphere within the job that I would basically be taken out of contention. Whereas I would see no issue with a potential employee saying that they are striving to find a healthier workplace that would enable them to really showcase their abilities and talents in the best way possible while making the work they do enjoyable in a way that it isn't currently at the current location despite best efforts made to ameliorate the situation.

So, if you were in my shoes with all this info taken into account... Do you:

1. Keep your current job while looking for a new job and then leave current one once you've been offered another job, even if this potentially means that you could *potentially* increase your chances of being cut at the new job because you have less seniority
2. Keep your current job and suck it up and don't look for another job because you might potentially have a smaller chance of losing current job due to being there longer.
3. Some other solution that was not proposed by either of us

I take my mental health and stability seriously, having struggled since I was a child and now 29YO. I don't need to put up with sh\*t at work if it means my health takes a beating, and I would much rather potentially increase my risk of job security by venturing out into another company if given the opportunity. I'm not stupid, I'd make sure i have enough money saved up to hopefully get me by long enough if I were to ever lose a job. And worst case scenario, I can't find a job in my title I take the non-managerial job in my field and get paid at the higher end of the wage scale (less than I'd make as a manager but enough to still live life).

Thanks for any outside perspectives you guys can give!"
164,"I feel like I’m drowning some days, yet the next I feel fine.","This past year has been one of the worst for me in regards to mental health. I’ve always been an anxious and skittish person, but lately I’ve been stuck in this constant back and forth of feeling fine then suddenly feeling this overwhelming sense of dispare, sadness, and overall negativity. Almost every other day I find myself crippled in on myself sobbing for no clear reason. 
In March I lost my grandmother who basically raised me and I was devastated, and I’m sure that is a factor of my pain but I feel there is something else contributing. I am confused on whether to seek therapy because after I pull myself out of an episode I feel completely fine until it happens again a few days later. I am tired of feeling this way, yet I have no idea what to do about it. 
I am healthy and I am getting an amazing postsecondary education yet I feel like there is something living in me and eating me alive. 
I’m tired and just want to be happy again."
165,Inability to cry coming in periods.,"Around the age of 16 and until around the age of 18, I wasn't able to cry at all, no matter how sad or touched I got. Suddenly, around the age of 18, I was really not okay and it's like all those emotions poured out and suddenly I was a frequent crier,very often crying when touched but something, but it would rarely he sadness. Now I'm 20 and within the past few months, I realized I haven't been crying at all. When I was 16, I could explain some of my emotional numbness with my parents' divorce, but I really don't know what the reason could be now. There are some little things, but nothing to really make me emotionally shut down. I'm feeling a lot better than last year, but is losing the ability to cry again a bad thing? What could be going on?"
166,"Man , I am upset about so many things, why can’t those people just apologize, and say the right things rather than having me build up all this anger inside",
167,I don't feel entirely real,"\[I know I need to go to an actual doctor/therapist for this, but until I'm able to yet, so I hope I could get a little advice from here (I'm not trying to be diagnosed or anything, just need a bit of advice).\]

I don't feel entirely real. It's an incredibly difficult feeling to explain. I never see myself from the outside or daydream, it's not that. It's this weird floating feeling. Feeling far away from existence. I can feel my body and objects around me, but I don't feel *here*. I don't feel grounded and clear-minded. I feel dizzy and floaty. Again, this is so hard to explain, so I'm sorry if this really doesn't make sense. 

For a bit of background, I've been badly isolated for around 4 years. I think I have an avoidant personality disorder. I have a debilitating fear of socializing, hence why I isolate myself (and I've never had real friends in my life, and I'm 22). Nearly the majority of every day for 4 years, I've been alone. It's been worse since my sister moved out, now I typically have zero human contact and I realize this is really detrimental to a person's mental health, I really understand that now because it's what' I'm experiencing.

Now, the rare times I'm around people, I feel quite airheaded and confused. And when I speak, I feel like there's so much pressure on me, so I get nervous and talk slowly, sometimes I even stutter (which isn't normal for me). It's like my mind is so clouded and dizzy, combined with my extremely severe social anxiety, that it feels like I'm talking while in a daze.

Also, recently, I've noticed while writing something like I am now, I feel like I can't express myself correctly. Like I can't find the right words to say, or that I'm saying the wrong things. It's like I have brain fog and I can't be as concise as I'd like to (I used to write a lot and be really good at it, so this also isn't normal for me). 

So, I just feel not real. It's scary. There have been a few times I had to drive recently and it just feels weird since I don't feel entirely here. 

Also, I've noticed a very small but weird change about me. In the past, when I had to open a bottle, I would hold the bottle in my right hand and then screw off the lid with my left hand -- I've done this my entire life. Recently, without thinking, I would hold the bottle and my left hand and then try to take off the lid with my right hand. That's something completely unnatural for me, so it's really weird that I would unconsciously do that. 

Has anyone experienced something like this? Do you have ways of feeling more real? I've thought maybe I have something like dissociation or derealization, but I don't have all of the symptoms. But I am extremely anxious and under stress pretty much all the time. I'd really appreciate any insight on this, and I'm trying to get to a doctor as soon as I can!"
168,My bitter behaviour pushes friends away from me,"I get stressed by things in life, especially stress at work and stress about having a busy diary. They're both illogical because I have a good job and lots of fun social commitments so I shouldn't complain. 

But I do. The stress makes me bitter and angry, self-pitying, and resentful of other people. It makes me convinced I've been treated unfairly by people, very entitled, like I'm owed something by everyone. 

For example at work I'm pissed off if I'm not given enough responsibility, because they evidently don't trust me. When they then do give me responsibility I'm pissed off at them because they won't give me enough support because they evidently don't care about me. 

You get the picture. This makes me an irritating and bitter person to know, who's always complaining about his terrible but fictional situation, and who blames everyone for the way he feels. I complain about things that I totally have the power to fix, like having a busy diary, making me even more annoying to people as they can't offer a solution to make me shut up. This makes other people annoyed, upset and defensive, so it pushes people away from me.   

The trouble is I genuinely feel it - I honestly feel powerless to fix my busy diary that gives me little time to relax, I honestly feel like work both doesn't trust me and doesn't care about me, and it is very hard to wish those feelings away. Everything upsets me and none of it feels like my fault, but my attitude pushes people away from this. 

Has anyone ever experienced this and do they have any ideas at how not to be so entitled or angry?

169,Im scared and I don’t know what to do,"For a while I was a chain smoker, and I stopped smoking recently because of paranoia and panic attacks I would get when I was high, I often felt like things that didn’t happen would happen, an example would be when watching the ID channel and falling asleep i would wake up high thinking I murdered someone and freaking out, and I had serious memory loss, I don’t know what to do because I constantly feel out of control and that any minute cops will come running through my door, I have a horrible time sleeping because I will also have extremely vivid nightmares, and to be honest I don’t know If I murdered anyone or not, This has been scaring me for months and taking a serious toll on my mental health, what do I do?"
170,Speaking Mantras everyday,"Disclaimer: I have incredibly bad OCD mixed with depression and subtle anxiety. I think I’m starting to figure out how to beat it without medication. I’m 27 years old and I’ve dealt with this my entire life


So I recently started repeating mantras everyday and 
my life is getting better and better. I repeat different “I am affirmations” hundreds of times a day and now I feel good and I don’t know why. It’s like my OCD is starting to become a super power because I’m harnessing it’s intense energy. It used to be feeling bad for no reason but now I feel genuinely good. I still have bad days but now I make the conscious effort to speak highly of myself even when I don’t want too. Mamba mentality. Speaking highly of yourself enables you to replace those habitual negative thoughts with positive ones. Eventually your mind is just going to bring the positive out of every situation. Remember that we are supposed to be happy, life is supposed to be FUN. Don’t let your parents, friends or the media tell you any different. You are a creator of your own reality and you CAN control your thoughts. It’s just like working out a muscle so just practice positive thinking everyday and you will be mind blown by the results within the first month. 

Since I’ve become aware that entertaining a negative thought is a choice, I’ve gained so much liberty with the thoughts I choose to think about. Staying sad/miserable is easy, but so can being happy. You don’t need an experience to feel something - you can feel prosperous and live in abundance before it actually manifests. It’s all about the thoughts you choose. Thoughts become beliefs and then that becomes our reality. So start believing that you are worthy of greatness, that you have everything in abundance, that you live a life of prosperity and love. Don’t say “I want to feel blah blah blah” or “I wish I had blah blah blah” say “I AM” Like I said I STILL HAVE BAD DAYS, but it’s different now. Once I started to change the things I think about, the things I looked at changed. I can literally look at a piece of poop and see so much beauty in it. 

I know I know; this sounds so cliché but the most effective ways of life/phrases are usually cliché


You’re thoughts are like a radio tuner. Just tune to the frequency that you want (thought or belief) and then put all of your focus on that. Visualize it and see it happening over and over again. Don’t worry about “how” it will happen. Don’t put it on a pedestal and most importantly have FUN. I’ll leave it at this...BELIEVE

171,I can't cry.,"I can't cry for more than a week, any tips?"
172,Can you transfer someone to another psychiatric facility,"My son(38) lost his wife after 13 yrs of marriage he has been hospitalized at a state hospital(KY) for 6 months and they are not helping him, their just trying to push medication which is not helping him at all. I want to transfer him but they said legally they do not have to transfer him to another hospital, is there I can do to get him transferred."
173,I'm caring for my father in the hospital and no one else is helping,"I literally had to call a depression hotline because nobody wants to or is able to talk to me lmao. Some of my people are too busy, others have the time but don't want to spend energy on it. 

I've spent a week in a shitty depressing motel without a TV. It's been sleep then hospital visit for hour then stress eat then sleep. 

I had a godsend in the form of an unusually long Lifeline call with an unusually good counsellor. I'll get over it but the silence and apathy are deafening."
174,Why do I feel so miserable when he leaves,I don't like being alone but my fiance goes to his parents how every weekend and I hate it so much. It feels like all my happiness is sucked dry when he leaves. I feel so empty and I hate being alone. I feel so desperate for attention for those two days that I have sit alone. Am I a bad person? Am I too needy?
175,Help I need advice,So I’m 13 and I’ve recently been diagnosed with anxiety. My mom is the one who knew and got help for me as she deals with anxiety and depression to and she wanted me to get help as soon as possible the thing is she is telling the psychiatrist that she sees her anxiety in me but not her depression. I don’t know if I’m depressed as I’m not a professional but I don’t just worry about stuff. I often think I’m a failure and worthless and I have thoughts about ending my life and I keep telling myself it would hurt my family so don’t do it because they’ll be hurt if I do. I also feel like I have no energy a lot. I’ve also went through something last year where I visibly was losing weight and I don’t want to admit this but before I started losing weight I had been saying I was fat and had to lose weight to myself and even though I wasn’t exactly aware I was eating less at the time when my mom started saying I was losing weight and I wouldn’t eat anything I realized it and I was like sh*t I got to stop because my brothers were having trouble with their mental health at the time and I didn’t want to give my mom more stress. So I stopped eating less and tried to be normal again even though I’m unhappy with my weight. Last year I was going through a lot as well as I was stopping going to school because of my mental health and me and my parents were fighting a lot causing me to start self harming as it took the emotional pain away in a way. It was really hard to stop but I knew I had to the night I felt so bad that I just didn’t care and cut so much my arm burned for hours and I had over 30 cuts. When my psychiatrist asked me if I ever had thoughts about ending my life or harming myself or if I had harmed myself I said no I just couldn’t bring myself to say it knowing how much my mom would feel destroyed knowing how bad I was hurting. And I always had these thoughts and feelings because I was always bullied and that’s why I stopped going to school it was just to much when people stared at me like I wasn’t human. I know my mental health is much worse than they think but I can’t bring myself to tell anyone and I don’t know what to do
176,I need help,"I've suffering my whole life with something that I can't understand at whole, and it's ruinning my life. I suffer ocassionaly strong headaches in the back of my head, and during this headaches, I've loathly thoughts and visions, like me killing someone that I just meet. I also have an extremely bipolar behaviour, and some times I just lose control of my own mind and I start to act with violence to everyone without reason... I can't stand anymore..."
177,Past self-harmers... do you still think about it?,"A few years ago I stopped self harming after an on-and-off relationship with it, but I still think about it sometimes. Not even when I’m upset or if I’ve had a bad day. I’ve had a really good week but today as I tidied my office I found a small razor blade and knew I should just throw it out, but my mind said to keep it “just in case”, but I caught myself and told my boyfriend what was going on. I have no reason to want to relapse, but I still had that thought and it upset me. 
Has anyone else struggled with this? Still thinking about it years later?"
178,School Rumors,"I’ve been dealing with this rumor that a popular guy told a girl, and the girl told other guys, and now the rumor has gotten around. I’m now a senior in high school and the rumor started last year when I was a junior. My life was perfect before.

The rumor is that I’m a male to female transgender and that I have a penis. I am a female and was born a female.

It has ruined any possible friendships I could’ve formed with males at my school and I often hear people whispering about me. 

A couple weeks ago, I heard this guy saying “trans, trans, trans” around his friends when I was walking past them. 

I often wear a fanny pack now because the little bulge thingy on the zipper that shows up when I wear jeans just fuels the rumors. 

Actually, my teacher fueled the rumors Friday when I said “here” quietly during attendance and she said “that wasn’t your voice, it sounded too deep!” And went on to make a deep, masculine sounding voice to mimick me. And you already know how this is gonna turn out Monday.

This rumor is just ruining my life and making me feel suicidal. No one wants to talk to me other than the friends I already have now, and I can’t believe people believe this rumor. 

Any advice on how to fix this, or is the damage already done?"
179,i’ve reached an extremely low point,"i’m 17 and extremely addicted to alcohol. i’ve been trying to fix my mental issues for so long (bipolar with psychotic features and social anxiety) and nothing has worked and i honestly just kinda started drinking to be less lonely. my parents are aware of my problem and went thru my room today and found and threw away all my alcohol. they just went out on a date, and i dug through all of the trash bags in the trash bin and found my alcohol and am about to drink it. i’ve seriously reached an all time low. i was considering drinking a little bit of rubbing alcohol earlier because i was so desperate without it. 

i’m sorry if this is tmi, i just need to get it off my chest :/

*my parents are aware of my addiction and want to get me help but i’ve been putting it off because 30 days in a program is too long, i wouldn’t be able to see my boyfriend or graduate early"
180,"I told my grandma that I was going to start singing lessons and she looked at me in confusion and straight out said ""your voice is terrible""","Thanks grandma for encouraging me. I asked my husband if he thought the same and he said no. I don't understand how someone whom is supposed to be a close family member would actively discourage someone who wanted to be happy and practice a hobby they simply enjoy? 

It's hard not to take it personally. But why is my grandmother so mean? I don't need my family reminding me that I'm terrible at something I just need their encouragement so that I can go and practice and get better."
181,I 'miss' being depressed,"I haven't felt depressed since the summertime when I kind of lost my shit and hit rock bottom. Since then I've graduated, moved back in with my parents and got a half decent job that I really enjoy. 

Despite things being great there's this part of me that seems to 'miss' (for lack of a better word) the depression, which seems almost insane considering I was abusing drugs and having suicidal thoughts.

It almost feels like I'm a different person now and yet there's still a part of me that misses it because it was so familiar for so long.

Idk why im even bothering writing this post. I guess its because i dont want to bother my friends any more now that im okay and I feel like i need to vent to someone. 

Thanks to whoever took the time to read this"
182,Am I just supposed to accept this,"Hi so me (27f) and my husband (26m) have been married for almost two years now..

We both have struggled with our mental health. I started really having problems and was kind of pushed into seeking out outside help. I started seeing a therapist, eventually got a psychiatrist and have been working through my problems. 

My husband on the other hand has not. He’d go to therapy casually, listen to what the therapist had to say; but never applied anything. He was even prescribed a low dose of Zoloft for depression and anxiety. He’s completely stopped going and making his own mental health a priority. 

It has seriously started to affect our relationship. A few months after we got married he became so cold towards me. He stopped “dating” me. Yes I know relationships go through it and marriage is very different but I can’t even get him to be affectionate towards me unless it’s his terms.

He only is sweet to me when he wants to be intimate. Sex is always on his terms..in fact everything is. 

I decided to bring up some of these things I was noticing and he completely shut me down. He said he’s not happy, and I said yeah with me and he said no it’s “not you”. He said he doesn’t feel any emotions or anything at all. 

He made some joke about wanting to do it and I said no I’m not really in the mood right now. He got annoyed and I’ll admit I snapped at him. I said that maybe if he spent some quality time with me, took me out, and when I’m not feeling well I shouldn’t have to beg him to comfort me..then I’d be more willing to have sex with him. 

He threw a fit and told me he’s not doing therapy and refuses to work on himself. So am I just supposed to accept the fact that I’m married to someone who refuses to put their mental health first and is a complete jerk to me."

184,I don't know what's wrong with me...,"Lately I've been feeling down.
I'm a normal-ish teenage guy(15) in UK.
This week was catastrofic due to some outside factors and my stupidity.
I've been getting  bullied/picked on for a while now and it's getting worse and worse...
I've been called a retard by a girl I literally never had a conversation with.(only maybe a word or 2)
I even started to self harm and it's the only relief in life I have. Unfortunatelly gaming/anime/reading just feel empty and I kinda lost interest.
I hate myself for maybe like 3 to 4 years(still do) and I'm bad at dealling with stress/talking about how I feel and I'm a isolated introvert. (Have no friends)
2 days ago I got a girl next to me into trouble because she tried to explain the task(maths) to me and teacher saw her and yelled at her...if only I didn't look like an idiot then maybe she wouldn't have gotten into trouble...
I can still feel happiness(like when you buy a game and play it) but after an hour it just feels...empty.
I can laugh at something and after a couple of moments feel empty.
Tbh, since my tics calmed a bit my mental health has beed pretty solid...but not it just keeps going down...
I feel like a failure, I'm even starting to hate my existance.
I feel like I can't trust anyone...like I was backstabed because teachers won't help me and my mum tells me to ignore it...
I may be over reacting...but I feel cornered...
Maybe these problems will just go away...at least I hope it will.
And I can't see a psychologist(not even sure if my school even has one) or a psychiatrist without a good reasson so I decided to just vent a bit here.
I just wanted to create this post to see how this situation looks from a different point of view.

Anyway, thanks for reading."

186,My ex is wanting to kill herself and I don't know how/what to do to help,"Me (24m) and my ex (23f) just broke up 2 days ago. She suffers from depression, bipolar disorder, and severe anxiety. She went from being all for our relationship and being happy to her wanting to go down to the train. Tracks every day to wait for a train to kill her. I have worried about her every single day since we have broken up. I told her how much she means to me and that I will be there for her if/when she needs someone. She just kind of shoved it to the side and told me "" I wish people wouldn't care for me so much so it would make me killing myself easier"". I am terrified that I am going to get a call from her parents saying she has passed away. I tried to tell her parents about how serious the situation is, but they are all like "" oh this has happened in the past and it will blow over."" 

She told me she went to her therapist and that the therapist said that she does not need therapy. They just want her to continue with her current prescription of anti-depression medicine. I fear maybe she did not tell them the truth or is not wanting to. She tells me she still loves me as a friend but just needs time to figure stuff out with herself. I'm not really asking for relationship advice, more so how do I make sure she is safe. What can I do to help. It has even begun to effect my mental health as well."

188,Random Outburst of Sadness,"Hey, I'm writing this about a random outburst of sadness I had this morning. For some context I'm 16 years old and just got into my first senior year, while we were walking back from church my parents noticed that I had grown a grey hair. Being the supportive and wonderful parents that they are they asked me if I was stressed or had some problems. I answered no, which I thought was the truth but as we were walking back I suddenly had to hold back tears, I got a lump in my throat and for around 3 hours afterwards I started thinking some very negative thoughts. Now I feel absolutely fine, happy even so I'm just very confused about where this all came from. My life is going well, I have great friends, a wonderful supportive family, school is going fine but sometimes I have these random emotional outbursts (this wasn't the first time). I would really appreciate it if anyone could share their own experiences with emotional outbursts or some advice.  
Thanks"
189,Insurance Question for Accessing Behavioural Health Services,"Hi, I'm looking for a little bit of help regarding accessing behavioural health therapy. I currently live in Arizona and am under my parent's insurance. I am seeking therapy for mental health and did talk to my PCP about it who gave me a referral. Unfortunately after talking to clinic it seemed to be about $97 per appointment, which is not affordable for me at the moment. I did ask for another referral however she said there was only 1 other available clinic that accepts my insurance plan and their price was even higher. I did discuss the cost with them, but they did not offer any sort of assistance. I was hoping if the cost was not high so I would be able to cover it myself without my parents finding out. I've been doing a little more reading and realized that they can access all of the information about the healthcare I receive under their insurance. I do not want them to know/they would not be supportive of me seeking therapy so I was looking at options for self pay. It looks like you have to state your insurance if you have one or you are committing insurance fraud which I obviously do not want to do. I also heard they then do not offer sliding scale/assistance for costs. I tried looking up university clinics/cheaper options, but I can't seem to find any that are available to non students. The university does offer $15 counseling appointments which would have been great, but I'm no longer a student. I was wondering if there is anyway I can have the best of both worlds with affordable services and not have it listed on insurance for my parents to see? Thank you in advance for any advice/help!"
190,LAMICTAL (lamotrigine) Almost Killed Me! My Review and Dangerous Side Ef...,[https://youtu.be/UaDJiC6fXAo](https://youtu.be/UaDJiC6fXAo)
191,I used weed as a coping mechanism and now I'm in a worse place.,"So the first time I smoked I was 9 years old, it was with my older brother and I don't really remember much from that night. 

*Fast Forward* 

Summer or 2018: I start smoking everyday with my mother, I enjoyed being high and soon realized that when I was high I died have panic/anxiety attack's and wasn't afraid to go places. I had agreed to stop smoking once school started due to me being randomly drug tested because I am in marching band. I did stop smoking for about 6-7 weeks then realized that I was not okay whenever I didn't use it. (NOTE: I was not addicted to it, I put it down multiple times because I wanted to see if I could quit. And I could, I just was a much calmer person when I could use every night) so I started using again until my mom found out by searching my room. I was then forced to quit because mom had her eyes on me. 

*Summer of 2019* 

Started working and spent a good amount of my money on weed. So I stayed high most of the time, school started and I was not going to school high or letting anyone know my business. I started dating a girl who also smoked, but her parents are super strict and religious so they ended up finding out that she was smoking. They forced her to turn herself into the school, now them putting 2 and 2 together they figured since she smoked and I probably did as well. I was called into a ""random"" drug test and failed for weed. I now am not able to march in band (which is the main thing that keeps me calm) and now I'm very depressed. I know that I did it to myself and there is nothing I can do about it now but I'm considering dropping out because I am barely passing my classes, I can't march, and I don't really want to keep going and almost breaking down everyday. I really don't know what to do."
192,Help. Raised very secluded. Dont know how to talk.,Maybe theirs a better reddit to post in. If someone could direct me there id appreciate it. I was raised in a cult like religion. Kept pretty secluded.parents didn't talk to me and i wasn't aloud to have friends. Over all i feel like my mental health is. Ok. But i have a lot of trouble with language. When i try to speak its difficult to hold onto thoughts long enough. I loose whatever i was trying to say after the first sentence or two. Getting professional help isnt really feasible right now. Im wondering if there are any things i can do to self help.any advice?I

I've gotten falsely accused of a crime which I did not commit. Someone used my number in some kind of spoofing device. They used my number and called an local gas station in my area and made a bomb threat. I got arrested and charged with ""making a bomb threat"". Now I am wanting to commit suicide cause I am worried that I cannot fly on an plane anymore cause I suspect that I'm on a no fly list. I'm supposed to be getting married next year to my fiancee in vietnam. I'm in extreme crisis and I tried reaching out online for help on how to resolve this issue. I asked on an law forum on yahoo answers and people attacked me. Someone said ""your crisis is not our problem, deal with it on your own"". Then some others said "" you can forget about marrying your fiancee, your never getting on an airplane for the rest of your life, you'll just die alone"".

196,I am never extremely happy or sad,"I am 16 currently. Ever since I started puberty around 4 years ago I noticed I am never extremely happy or sad and have became more and more monotone. When ever certain events happen my emotions and tone can change but its never by a lot. When ever I get something or spend time with friends and family I am for the most part happy, but i'm never extremely happy. Example, when Christmas came this year I got my favorite pair of shoes I've been wanting for over 2 years. I was happy and smiled, but was only a little more happy than usual. This also happens with me being sad. When my sister left for college last year, I was sad but not crying like the rest of my family, including my very tough emotionally and physically dad. I dont feel extremely about anything. I dont feel mixed emotionally though, I feel more content. I just want to know if there is a name for the way I am, if anyone can relate? Is it just my personality?"

I’m 5’3-5’4 and being this short as a male is a dating death sentence. I’m leaving for college in August and I’m praying that I’ll be able to meet a girl while I’m there. I’m a pretty sociable person and I’d like to think I have a decent personality. 

This fear is eating away at me. It’s the 1st thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I go to sleep. Why am I like this? Why can’t I just be a normal teenage guy and be happy?"
198,I feel like I’m always trying to be a character in a show or somthing,"I feel like I’m always trying to play a character

I feel constantly confused like every situation I’m trying to play a character in a tv show.

 I have no clue who I really am. I keep trying to be authentic me but end up falling into a character whiteout realising I don’t even know how to be authentic...

I’m on the waitlist for therapy but as an adolescent I went to counselling and they basically just said past trauma has caused social anxiety and depression so it lead to nowhere 

How do I figure out who I am, I don’t even know if I really like the movies I watch or the music I listen to... I don’t know what I like or what I’ve made myself like to be a certain person.

My dad stopped talking to me, my family is falling apart yet again, my friendships are the least comfortable they've ever been, my heart feels like it's been hit by a train, everything hurts. Everywhere I go people flee or they just fuckin' die. I'm 22 and I can name at least 7 people in my life who have died. Nothing ever fucking lasts, all senses of stability I've managed to build over the past year have been demolished. All I can think about, the only thing that makes me feel relaxed, is reopening my forearm. The memory of my ""attempt"" is the most calming thing I have right now.

I have this image of a happy future in my mind and that's why I don't give in. That sliver of hope. But it just seems so far out of reach. There's too much work to do. And i'm already so goddamn tired.

202,I Need Advice...,"Hi All,
Like a lot of people in this world I have depression and anxiety and, fortunately, I was recently diagnosed. That being said I think the most limiting part of my depression in my incessant need to not be outwardly expressive about who I actually am inside. What I mean by that is that is I feel like I have created this version of myself that everyone sees as kinda like a “straightforward dude” if that makes any sense. And obviously I have people that I feel I can be honest with like my sister and my friends but I find it the most challenging thing in the world to just be myself around most people. 

So my biggest question is how can I practice just being myself around new people.

Any sort of advice would be super helpful whether it’s personally stories or links to articles or books, etc.

Thanks"

Started doing meth, after being clean off cocaine for 20+ years. Been on it for 6 months, actually tried shooting it for the first time a few weeks ago. I’m not depressed on the Rexulti, but I do stupid shit. I can’t be depressed, all I do is sleep all day and most of the night. Anyone else experience impulsive behavior on this med?

204,Therapist telling me that I am being too harsh on myself made me emotionally/mentally break down,"I met my therapist a couple of days back. He normally does not say a lot and just listens. I am quite new to therapy. So, although I'd rather have more feedback from him than me just sobbing through my tales to him, I want to stick with it and see where things go. Yesterday I was telling him about something that I am dealing with over the past couple of years which has caused me a significant amount of trauma and makes me feel stuck, like I just cannot move on from this. I was talking about how I feel that I should have been able to handle it much better alongside a lot of other stuff. He kept saying things likes ""that's harsh"", as in am I being too harsh on myself and ""You are kicking yourself when you are down"". Hearing him say these things had me feeling incredibly upset and caused me to feel more vulnerable and broken than I have felt in a long while. Even now, two days after my session, I am just randomly bursting into tears and I feel emotionally/mentally exhausted. I spent all of yesterday feeling physically exhausted and spent a good part of it in bed. I do not understand this reaction of mine. Shouldn't someone telling me that I am being too hard on myself,  make me ease up and feel better? I cannot comprehend this strong emotionally draining reaction that I am having to being told that I should probably be more forgiving of myself. How do I make sense of this?"
205,Advice for dealing with self harm urges ?,"I have heard of the rubber band thing where you smack yourself with a rubber band and it’s supposed to help with self harm urges, but I get very itchy and scratch through skin when feeling overwhelmed and those are the urges that I can’t seem to get a grip on.

206,My mood just drops through the floor sometimes for seemingly no reason,"Mostly venting here. I had a great day yesterday, a perfect damn day. Today started out great, got up and got a text from a friend to meet for lunch. Lunch was great and I came back home. Then my mood and thoughts just started turning dark. Nothing even bad happened. The rest of the day has been just me being depressed, and I don't know why. I hate that. It just feels out of my control and my mood can be stable or just drop super low at any given time. Even when my mood is good, it's not like I'm super happy or bubbly, me being a great mood is just me not being sad.

I've been reading about depression and medications and other ""fixes"" for a decade, and I still don't know how to get better. Nothing seems to help much or at all. I think diet can play a big part in mood and mood swings, and I need to pay closer attention to what I eat and how it affects me, but there are so many other factors as well. I just want to have a stable ""I'm okay"" mood for a month or two. I wish I would get better and feel good much more often."

My roommates would probably be like whatever, since I just moved in  two weeks ago after my roommate passed away and my other roommate and I decided to change rooms because it was too painful to live there.  (we are in different rooms now)

It's the complete opposite of my late friend and roommate. Even if he hadn't died, and just went home, lots of people would notice and care. However no one would care if I just disappeared. Sure we laugh and hangout, but no one ever messages me or goes out of their way to try and talk to me. I'm always the odd man out in many conversations. 

I'm lonely, I'm sad, and no one from the real world even talks to me unless I approach them. It's like I'm a bother to them, and they'd probably be happy to have never met me."

I was quite numb to it and that’s just how I got around my day to day life until it all just exploded and came spilling out in 2019. I’m just curious if anyone else did the same thing because I literally was a ticking time bomb at one point. 

As a matter of fact, there’s still things that I haven’t told anyone to this day. Either that or I’ve kept it really tight and close. I don’t feel ready right now. At some point (whenever I feel ready), I do plan on telling someone and having an extensive conversation on it."
210,I literally talk to myself out loud and beg the universe to kill me everyday,"I have no idea why I’m posting right now. Im not looking for advice. I just want to write this somewhere because I’ve felt like this for years now. I’m too much of a coward to take my own life. Every moment I get I look up at the sky and beg for this to be my last day alive. I just don’t want to wake up anymore. I hate myself more than anyone ever could. Im just a complete doormat. 

I see so many tragedies on the news and I’m actually jealous that i wasn’t a victim. I’m just sick of living. I know the people in my life would be sad for a while, but they just have no idea how much better life would be without me. I sound like I’m feeling sorry for myself, but I don’t. I just know that I’m a lost cause. I have no motivation to do anything besides play call of duty to pass the time. Anxiety has completely destroyed my social life. I lost all my friends. The family that I don’t live with have given up on trying to contact me because I don’t answer the phone. 

Hopefully tomorrow I’ll finally drop dead from a heart attack or get shot in the head with a stray bullet. Maybe I’ll wake up with enough balls to slit my wrists or something. Hopefully the 6 Benadryl pills I take every night to go to sleep kill me in my sleep and I don’t wake up at all. I just give up."
211,I don’t know how I feel about this advice,"So I’ve been going to my university’s counseling center for a couple weeks now. Just started. The person I’ve been talking to is recommending that I talk to my friends, in person, about what’s been bugging me (I’m very simple and kind of vague terms, I feel like I’m annoying every one of them). I don’t know how I feel about this. I don’t know if I have it in me to do it. For a few reasons:

1. I get very emotional very easy when talking about this stuff. It’s extremely embarrassing. 

2. I feel like I’ve been too negative lately and I’ve been trying to cut back on that kind of thing 

3.  I don’t want to seem like the kind of person who’s just looking for attention 

4. I don’t want my friends to blame themselves 

5. I don’t know if anyone actually cares enough to listen 

I just wanted to put this out there. To kinda say all the reasons somewhere so that someone will listen. I don’t know how to do this, really. It’s been too long"
212,Had a really strong disassociation episode today,"Kind of still in it honestly. It’s taking so much mental energy to make my body follow commands. I feel extremely disconnected from the physical plane. Typing this out is making it worse. 

I’m in the bathroom at work. It feels better when I’m working and can’t think about my physical being. 

I made my fiancé really worry before I went to work. That feels bad. 

I hope I feel more connected to myself tomorrow."
213,Very concerned about a friend,"Alright guys I really do need some advice. A couple weeks ago I’d say my friend found some weird videos on Instagram of people pooping and stuff, kinda memey. I thought it was a bit weird but I could see how you could find it funny. However, this obsession to find strange videos turned dark. He sent me a video of someone getting hit with an axe in a corner store. It wasn’t too graphic so I didn’t think much of it, until a couple days ago. I sent him a funny video of a car crashing with a wii bowling sound effect on it, he replied with a video of a literal dead body being scavenged for meat. In the video three people are literally destroying this dead body and tearing it apart, I don’t want to get too specific. They took the guys eye out. After watching this I was immediately disgusted and felt like crying (kinda). This wasn’t even the worst part. The worst part is that he isn’t phased by any of this he sent that video with two laughing emojis; 😂 😂. I’m really concerned about his mental health, we are only 13. What should I do?"
214,Is therapists omitting some diagnoses a myth or true?,"This is a question simply out of curiosity. I've heard several times that high-functioning mental disorders\*, such as BPD and autism spectrum ones, are often omitted when consulting a psychologist as the diagnosis often carries a stigma and the disorder\* doesn't affect as much the other's life.

I'm asking if this is true because, despite having a SAD diagnosis, some of my behaviours are quite unusual in a mental health way. Such as getting easily upset, having an extreme reaction from that and quickly jumping to regret such reaction, which often includes crying in a way that surely doesn't match my age. Still, my therapist only focused on how there isn't much I can do to avoid such, and all I can do is to avoid situations that make me like that. That often made me wonder if she was overlooking important information about my mental health. But I remembered about hearing some choose to omit some diagnoses, and thought if that was true I don't need to worry much. 

\*I'm not sure if those words are the correct ones. If they aren't, I'll gladly change them."
215,ya when i vent i get chewed out,"when i clam up i explode  
when you people vent you people bring violence to my front and terrify me  
would be nice to have you all ,live my life, see my sights, hear your anger, feel your misguided fists beating my head in making me think suicide is the only way off this rock. then again, suicide is. to kill off my own misguided life by doing something we'd all not. try, never give up, always have a slight sliver of thought things will improve. they don't but it might save my life. i have nothing else to live for but me and my cats. you all got this figured out. could have at least filled me in, woulda saved your now worthless lives and souls"
216,Traumatic experiences leading to self sabotage,"Right now I feel like I’m sabotaging my own relationship because I can’t get the image of my boyfriend’s mom’s lifeless body out of my head.

Some extremely condensed background...I’ve struggled this past year with a couple of traumatic experiences. My sister swallowed an entire bottle of pills earlier this year and was involuntarily committed. Because of her struggles, mine are often often brushed off by my family because they’re “not bad” in comparison. I’ve been really having a hard time coping with this, and trying desperately to get to a therapist but my needs are being put on the back burner.

So, that being said, my boyfriend and I decided to unwind about a week ago with some edibles. His mom joined us, and at first all was well. But then she started to “not feel good” - she got up to go to the bathroom and just collapsed suddenly. We sat her up and she insisted she had to go to the bathroom so we let her...she was taking too long...stopped responding to our knocks and questions. I went in and what I saw was truly terrifying. Her head was bent back and she was struggling to breathe. Her face was pale and lips blue. I screamed and tried sitting her up and shaking her and she slumped forward. I held her because I didn’t know what else to do. He called 911. I was high and terrified. She seemed like she stopped breathing and I honestly thought she was dead for a moment there. She came back to consciousness and the paramedics came and ultimately took her but I couldn’t calm down and was shaking for hours and hours. It was the scariest experience of my life, albeit one I would have handled much better had I been sober. (Note: the medical situation was a fluke unrelated to the edibles, but that was necessary for accuracy of the story)

Now I just can’t stop thinking about it. Right now I can’t sleep because I’m shaking reliving it in my head. My boyfriend and I got into a dumb argument 2 days ago about something completely arbitrary but I know I made it worse than it needed to be and I feel guilty. We aren’t really speaking, and I can’t help but think I sabotaged things because of what happened. I just don’t know what to do. It’s just getting worse."
217,never said this before,"Dread, sadness and isolation. I feel these so much, I feel these everyday. Where does it come from? I feel I know the source but am torn between thinking it's imposed on me or in fact, self imposed. Have I painted myself into this corner? Is my life the result of someone who has no spine in making their own decisions? Have I towed the line for so long I've lost who I truly am? I have an urge, a desire to create but am terrified of the ridicule and inevitable disappointment it would cause dad. Mum I miss you. You always were there when I felt like this, you could always talk me down. Now I'm high, so high there's no coming down. Where do I go? How do I regain control? Am I insane? the end of it all seems so peaceful, no longer creating a life to make someone else happy. What is my own happiness? Any thought I shoot down internally, the voice in my head is the worst critic of them all, constantly in the spotlight, constantly in fear, never a chance for peace. Mum you showed me life is a gift but I feel I can't control it, I'm so inept at anything, how can anyone do anything in life and be happy? Get a job, grind it out, show up everyday, even if you hate it, you know there's kids in Africa who slave in the mines for cents a day, yet I'm too much of a fuck wit to even use the head start I have to do anything. So what's the point? If I could trade places with them I would, they deserve to have this, not me. Trade and then end it all, give someone the opportunity to use a gift I was given, give it to someone who knows how to use it. I've had enough of this feeling, carrying a wight that gets heavier every day, what a fucking waste. I hate my job, I hate it so much I've thought about killing myself to escape, what kind of coward kills himself to escape a job, the type who fears the faces of those who trust him to be something he's not. I'm supposed to be someone who has it figured out, who has a job that he worked for, who made decisions, who is purposeful, I can't tell you how far from the truth I am from all of that. I'm lost. I love those who love me, I will never kill myself because it would hurt them too much, I'm not worried what it would do to me, I only care what it would do to them and I could never be the reason for such pain. So I lie in limbo, waiting for an end, towing the line, living in dread, as I have many days before, as I will for the rest to come."
218,Getting foggy: Anybody dealing with pseudo-dementia out there?,"I had tests done and there is no physical explanation for my symptoms. I feel like it's so incredibly hard to concentrate, I experience lower capacity when it comes to memorizing or recalling. My therapist (and the neurologist) suspect pseudo -dementia due to my years of depression and other mental health problems. Anybody else experience this? Is in treatment? Can tell me how they deal with it?
Thank you friends"
219,is there something wrong with me?,"Hey guys, so I'm going to make this short. 

A year or so ago, my family issues were horrible. I dont want to talk about it but my family became very abusive and toxic towards me, I remember having a mental breakdown every day in the toilet and thinking about dying. I was then diagnosed with anxiety (which hasn't gone away). One day, I was crying so much that there were no tears left, dry and painful crying. Then all of a sudden I couldn't feel it anymore, I couldn't feel the sadness or really any emotion. I seriously felt almost blunt. Numb. It's been getting a little better, I can get sad but I never cry, I can however get very angry, I can get happy but not easily, and I cant feel excitement full stop. All I think is 'I'll get through today'. I have a few friends, but none that really care about me. I like to socialize sometimes but the thought of it gives me a lot of anxiety. 

What's wrong with me and how can I start to feel again? I'm sick of this absolutely dull feeling. The only time that I cry is when I create scenarios in my head where all my family is dead except from me and I'm alone, they feel so real and I cant stop them."
220,i’m having a panic attack,guys i don’t know what to do. i’m having the worst panic attack that i’ve ever felt and i can barely breathe and my dads screaming and i don’t know what to go and i just want to die. i have one of my best friends trying to calm me down and my boyfriend too. the person that i was upset about with (my sister) tried calming me down and was calm and patient with me. my dad was screaming at me “IM DONE WITH THIS BULLSHIT YEA FUCKING CRY IT ALL OUT” and my mom is ignoring me.
221,Dissociation and anxiety. Please read and help me or just at least comment,"Okay so I’m 17. I have always had anxiety and I obviously knew it but I have just recently became worse and aware. It is usually in social situations where it gets really bad. I have anxiety with what I am going to do with my life because I have such bad anxiety I quit 3 jobs because of out I feel while working and also I would zone out and not understand thing. I’m almost positive I have dissociation. But I am confused. It tends to bother me A LOT when I am in class. I kind of go into this paralyzed feeling and I get stuck in a staring or trance like state and my mind goes blank completely which I think also happens due to extreme anxiety and I get nervous that other people can notice so I stare at the teacher while she’s lecturing but I’m not really there. It’s like I am wearing foggy glasses That are stuck to my face. But this is where it gets confusing and weird for me... legitimately ALL the time 24/7 I feel zoned out. I cant seem to think of anything and when I do.. I can’t seem to keep the thought in my head for very long sometimes. When I am in the car and I am not driving EVERY single time, I will kind of like “open my eyes” and realize where we are and I will not remember a single goddamn thing of the drive and like stuff then I go back to doing it. The thing that is irritating me tho lately is that I can’t remember much of anything anymore in my past. I used to. And I know I used to but now it’s like so difficult to remember hardly anything from even just a year ago. It is like my brain has slowed down and stopped working properly. 

If anyone needs any background on me that could’ve “caused” these issues I legit cannot think of anything from my childhood but I these : I abused drugs but it was for a short period of time, probably 5 months the longest. Usually it was xanax or coke and weed or ecstasy. I did it with my boyfriend that I have been with for 2 years. I also went though some bad experiences for about a week ONLY a week, where me and my boyfriend were emotionally unstable and would get into unreasonable arguments mainly because we were using drugs and he abused me I guess. Example : He has thrown me out of a chair, punched me in my eye/nose but in his defense I was threatening to throw a lamp at him, and at one point the worst moment was when we were on drugs arguing and I took about 7 blows to the head and I just covered my head and cried to sleep. But as soon as we stopped using drugs, this all stopped."
222,Sometimes I feel like a different person.,"I have had depersonalization before for a year on and off. Idk if that’s what this is. 

When I look at my boyfriend or daughter or kind of anyone I know it kind of feels like I don’t know them. It even feels that way when I look at myself. I just don’t feel like that’s me. Idk. It’s very strange. I’ve kind of always had these thoughts since I was younger but on a 1-10 scale, when I was younger it was like a 2 and in the past year it’s like an 8-9. 

Idk how to explain the way I feel. I just look at my boyfriend and think, wow he’s really by boyfriend huh? Or I look at my daughter and I’m like oh fuck I really had a child what the hell and she looks just like me. 

Everything’s weird. Unfamiliar kind of. 

Am I alone in this? Sometimes I feel like I have a mental illness not discovered yet."
223,I don’t know what to do.,"My mother is in a lot of pain, everyday, as a result of this and other factors she is very depressed, and has attempted suicide a few times, once again tonight. She’s been admitted to a mental hospital once and it did no good whatsoever. we really have no idea what to do, we can’t get her out of pain and we know it’s just a matter of time before someone isn’t there to call the paramedics. I really just don’t know what to do anymore or how to handle it. I try and support her as much as I can but it doesn’t seem to change much. I appreciate any advice."
224,I'm done looking for help,"At this point, I could on and on about depression this autism that anxiety here addiction there, but the truth is, I'm done asking myself questions like this. I'm done stressing a out having to talk to my mom about going to a therapist. I'm done reaching out to friends who could care less and have better things to be doing. I'm honestly a fraud for joining this sub. I deserve this"
225,No friends for a long time,"I left my old life and moved to a new country  in a boarding school to study I was 14. Now I'm 16,ive had no friends all this time and been avoiding people because of my social anxiety. I don't talk to people and i always sit alone in class. After school I would just usually stay in my room and be on my phone.

Now I'm feeling weird. I have this constant feeling that I'm about to go crazy. I have to keep my mind occupied so I won't feel this feeling

What's wrong with me?"
226,So i lost my 2 closest friends,basically i had 2 friends who i was very close with and they left because i had some problems and i’m sort of being kicked while i’m down. we have a group chat and some kids in said chat are being really rude to me. so i really don’t know what to do anymore
227,I think I’m a psychopath,"I don’t really know what to do. The thought scares me, because people say psychopaths are close to evil and irredeemable. I hear about a death, no matter how close I am to them, and I don’t care. I literally do not care, and my apathy breaks my heart. Why?? What is wrong with me? I am in love with someone, I KNOW I am. But at the same time are emotions real??? Why does only one person make me feel? What’s happening? What’s wrong with me?"
228,Any advice or does anyone have a similar or same thing as me," I've had this situation for years now before I started college. It's hard to explain and I feel embarrassed about it's the first time it's ever left my mind  but basically, I have always had strange coping choices that have helped me alot but I'm not sure where I developed them and I feel very embarrassed that I have them I was wondering of anyone had this to a similar or same extent. Basically I have had this method that to cope with being put down in life I have had to develop scenarios and people in my mind that are usually being projected as people that I know, where I'm falling apart and that person that I'm projecting it on is kind to me and practically takes care of me. It's not even like partners or just being kind but more like I'm a child they have that is seriously struggling with life and has been through alot that has effected them.

I have used this every night for years and in the day where, they are practically taking care of me when I'm in fear feel down or feel like I'm falling apart when I'm in bed it's automatic that it's like I'm a child and I sleep next to them to feel comfort from it.

These are always females that I tend to have an attraction to not just as liking them but more feel safe around them.

I'm not sure if what I have written is understandable it's hard for me to explain does anyone else have anything like this that they do on a daily basis."
229,Is it normal to be constantly worrying and wondering about why humans real and if consciousness is real. I constantly think about quantum immortality and if reaity is real and worth existing in.,Serious question no stupid anwsers
230,I have stopped socializing.,"I have been going out with friends almost everyday for over a year now, it brought me joy, but as of the past week I have completely blocked myself into my room and only leave to get food / water.

I sit with my ringer on my phone off, programming and reading articles while staying up late at night, I have no intentions to be outside and have told my friends I am busy when I truly am not.  Something doesn't seem right with this, and I am aware of it.

Any explanations for a change so dramatic and quick in my personality?  People are starting to take notice and I am not sure how to explain it to anyone.

Thank you."

232,Why do I feel more comfortable talking to women about my problems than men?,"I hope I don’t come off as sexist towards men or anything but hear me out:

     So I’m a 21 year old straight male and I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  When I was young I was diagnosed with ADD.  But now I’m starting to think that there might be other things I have as well because of the other problems I’ve been having, including anxiety, compulsions, panic attacks, etc.
     
     Anyways, for some reason I’d rather talk to a female about this than a male.  I hate to sound sexist but I can’t fix the fact that it just feels more comfortable opening up to a woman than a man.  I’ve had a few friends in high school that I hung out with a few times and they were all females.  I still talk to a few of them on Snapchat but I haven’t hung out with any of them for awhile because of my anxiety and social awkwardness.  I also have one sibling(my sister) that I’m pretty close with.  I don’t know if me being more around women has anything to do with it but I think it’s a possibility.
     
     So if I see a psychiatrist or someone that I can open up to, I would hope it’s a woman because it feels much easier for some reason.  I’ve never tried talking to any guys because it seems like they lack any interest in the “emotional stuff”.  I’m not saying that men wouldn’t care or anything but I just don’t feel very comfortable talking to one about my mental health issues, even if he was a professional.

     Anyone know a reason behind this or not?  

I would also appreciate it if there’s any advice you could give me on seeking help for my mental health issues.  Thanks!"
233,Being voluntarily admitted into a crisis center tonight and finally feeling some hope.,"TW: talk of suicide/self harm 

So last night I walked into an Emergency room and told them that I’m suicidal, I can’t keep myself safe anymore, and that I’d been self harming. The security guard took my razor blades from me. They only kept me for three hours. The put an IV in my arm that they didn’t use. They gave me a tetanus shot. Each nurse that treated me asked me to recount exactly why I was there, in detail. They asked a lot of personal and violating questions, and didn’t seem to write any of my answers down? They had me strip and put on a gown in front of a male nurse, after I requested a female nurse. They sent a clinician in that asked me all of same questions as the last five nurses and then she lectured me on being too dependent on other people because “it’s not healthy for them either.” She then printed out a couple papers with suicide hotlines and access to homeless shelters (I’m not homeless. I never told anyone I was homeless) and told me I was ‘good to go’.
The male nurse came in to take out my IV and said ‘Okay. Off like a bandaid!’, grabbed the tape and RIPPED it out of my arm. I didn’t even get discharge papers with my lab results. 
Here’s the real kicker: when I was leaving, the security guard asked me if I wanted my razor blades back. 

————-

Fast forward to today. 
I spent hours self harming today. I slit both my wrists in my bathtub and came very close to drowning myself. 
A loving friend said some extremely kind things to me and asked me to try again. One more time. 
So I came to a crisis center that deals specifically with mental/behavioral health. 
After a bit of a wait, ONE PERSON evaluated me. Told me that she can’t fix everything, but that they’re going to do a lot to help. And encouraged me to file a grievance against the previous hospital. She promised that when I leave I’ll get a case manager and they’ll get me continued therapy. And that no one will hand me my razor blades back😭
I’ll be stayed here for five days, with individual and group therapy. My boyfriend and dog will be allowed to visit me and hug me.
For the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m doing something right."
234,The story of my life has been that I half-ass things because I'm afraid of putting in 100% effort and failing. Is this fixable?,"I listened to a talk between a psychiatrist and one of their clients and client's problem really seems to resemble my own problem.  I apologize if this isn't the correct place to post this. 

I'm 26M.  So, I've been in college for about 8.5 years (5.5 years at community college, 3 years at my current university) projected to graduate this May.  I don't remember exactly when but probably during junior high, and moreso in high school, a habit manifested in me where if things got ""difficult"" for me in my classes, I'd default to half-assing those specific classes (AP/honors) and just spend my time after school playing video games, maybe because if I failed in games, it'd be okay because I could keep trying and getting better and essentially it feels like theres no ceiling for what I could accomplish for putting my all into video games.  So, fast forward to college and basically a shit show happens during my community college years, extending my time there to 5.5 years(from 2-3 years).  I get into my first semester courses, get mediocre grades because I refused to do homework in my tougher classes and, again, would spend all my time after class playing video games.  Then, it got worse to the point where I was failing my hardest classes (which were multi-variable calculus and calculus-based physics during that period) and re-taking them multiple times, putting in the same low amount of effort.  I'd always tell myself ""I'm going to work my ass off and get an A"" only to fall back to the same vicious cycle.

I transfer to university and the deep regret I had in my failures as a student (and as a person) essentially fueled me to work harder and my grades drastically got better.  However, I still fall back to the same stupid cycle a few times here (failed basically the two hardest courses of my degree because I refused to try).  I want to change.  I realize this is my problem now and I want to be able to put in 100% effort, regardless of the outcome."
235,I haven't been this happy in more than a year and I'm finally starting to feel like myself again,"Last year was the worst year of my entire life. I got injured back in November 2018. Then, my brother crashed my car and it was total loss but he was okay. Then, I lost my job because the injury got worse and worse. My injury made my back look crooked and that brought down my self esteem so low that every time I looked at the mirror, I cried. I did not like the person I was looking at; I looked horrible and weak. I used to be this energetic  girl who was working and going to school full time, traveling, dating around and just having the time of my life. Seeing myself in the mirror so weak, broke my heart to million pieces. 

I had a successful surgery on September because I'm back to normal. MY BACK IS NOT CROOKED ANYMORE! I still have some pain but I don't pay attention to it anymore. 

Well, my friends and I cooked dinner today and we had a little reunion. You guys have no idea how much I laughed. It's been an hour since I left and my stomach and my throat still hurt because of how much I laughed. I used to be this girl who would make other people laugh and seeing that girl today just made me so happy. It made me realize that not everything's lost and just because I had a tough year, doesn't mean it's gonna be like that for the rest of my life.

I came home and I found my parents hugging each other and as soon as they saw me, they ran towards me and hugged me. And my mom instantly said: You have no idea how much we love you *mi amor.* Then, they both gave me a kiss on the forehead and I simply started crying of happiness. 

I will never forget this day."
236,Do i have ASPD or am i a narcissist,New and grammar bad so dont expect the best. Very social but dont really get emotionally attached to people. I am very open to family told them did drugs was treated like out cast then proved them wrong. more but wanna see first opinion like to put my self in situation i think are not bad to the extreme to prove people wrong and i enjoy it. At the same time fam and people learn also weird emotionally detached
237,Is it wrong to believe that everything is my fault?,"I dislike the whole victimization thing that some professionals do while looking at me like I'm a hurt puppy. I want to believe that my problems are all my fault because it gives me inner peace and everything makes sense. Things suck, but then it's alright, it's a fair punishment. It's an explanation for everything and I can stop thinking about it. Is that wrong?"
238,I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style. Please recommend me books.,"I searched but couldn't find what I was looking for. I am looking for a detailed description of this struggle but most of all STRATEGIES how to HEAL, exercises and similar."
239,Have I ruined my life? Where to go from here,"I went to a 'networking event' the other night, only had 4 glasses of wine but I'm pretty small and a lightweight (25/F). Headed home with a friend - we live in college campus accommodation.

He made it back to his room but I was stopped on the way in and deemed 'incredibly intoxicated'. I had honestly been fine up until that point but I guess it all hit me pretty hard on the way home.

Campus security basically decided I needed to go to hospital to be checked out, but I insisted I was fine and just wanted to head to my room. They eventually relented and escorted me to my room, but not without telling my roommate about the incident and instructing her to take care of me. (For context, it's a building housing only grad students and professors, so drinking is not forbidden).

Obviously my roommate was furious and kept asking me what drugs I had taken, not believing me when I told her I hadn't. Once I thought she had gone to bed, I decided to avoid the tension by heading to a friend's room on a different floor (he invited me over). Unfortunately he had changed room recently, so a Resident Assistant then found me on a different floor waiting for him to text me back, she definitely did not believe me that I was meeting someone so brought me back to my floor. FINALLY got in touch with my friend, went to his and vented/recovered from the incident.

The next day I got an email from the Residential Services with an 'account' of the night before and checking that I was okay. I responded but they are out of office for the weekend. I also emailed the Resident Assistant in question and she was super nice about everything.

ANYWAY I'm completely freaking out. The past two days I haven't left my room because I'm too scared to face my roommate, let alone the building security guys on front desk. I'm literally petrified but this can't go on forever. I can't believe this all escalated so fast over a few glasses of wine.

WTF do I do? Will I face major repercussions for this?

TL;DR - got in trouble with campus security for being drunk, scared to face them ever again."
240,My boyfriend suffers from social anxiety,My boyfriend has just told me he has social anxiety and has been seeing a councillor for 2 years. I really want to help him but when he said i couldnt think of anything to say. What sort of things can i say to him? What can i do to help him? He is 27 i am 23 we have been dating for 8 months.
241,:(,"I don’t even know what to say or why I’m writing this but this must mean I have SOME hope, right? I am unwell. I can’t handle emotions, I don’t even know what I’m feeling and I act without a brain. I don’t want to go to therapy I don’t even want to be nice I don’t know what the hell I want really but I really really want SOMETHING. It feels like I’m missing. Like I’m in the passenger seat and I don’t know what’s driving me anymore. I don’t want to be me I never have been and I have felt more and more fake daily and I hate myself so fucking much. I don’t know what to do, especially if I feel like nothings worth doing. I am an asshole and I don’t care about other people. The small amount of apathy I feel is in guilt which I have so fucking much of because I’m an asshole."

243,"PLEASE ADVISE ME: About CBT, DBT and increased libido and my miserable life these last years","I'm gonna start saying my native language's not English, so sorry if I mess anything up. This ended up being very long, so I'm highlighting the parts that actually require medical advice, but I would really appreciate it if you could read it and help me with anything at all.

And then I'm going to actually start by saying that I'm not 100% sure that I'm BPD as of now. I've been diagnosed some years ago (after much arguing with doctors that never seem to be by my side), but my recent behavior (and if I look deep into it, pretty much all of my life) has given me strong feelings that I'm bipolar.

I don't really know how to start this, and it's probably going to be long, but I really would appreciate some help. I'm going to try and sum it up. We're in January and I've already been to the hospital because of a suicide attempt. I thought this year was supposed to be different. After being admitted to a mental institution sometime last year and having to drop college because of it, I changed psychiatrists. My last psychiatrist didn't take me seriously and, honestly, I'm sorry, it's hard writing this because I'm so emotional about everything and it makes me really mad, so I'm just going to use some bad words if you allow me. She was a fucking bitch. I was literally almost dying because of depression but she wouldn't change my medication or give me what I asked for, for almost 1 year (Lithium), because she was afraid that my ""perfect skin"" was going to be fucked up. Honestly. After being to the mental institution, and let me make a little pause here, because, I live in Brazil, in a not-so-poor-but-still-miserable city, and the mental institution was literally fucking hell. I thought I was going to die, I swear. It looked like a prison, it felt like a prison, it smelt like a prison. Fuck. It makes me teary just thinking about it. I don't want to ever go back to that absolute shithole.

But the shithole had a very good and kind psychiatrist, and we decided to switch psychiatrists and stay with her. I've been with her for around 6 months, and I wanna say I'm better but things just keep getting worse for me, so I don't really know. But I can see she's very smart and she actually knows what she's doing. She's prescribed me Lamictal, Lithium, Pamelor, and I don't really remember all the names but I'm also taking Xanax for 5 years now and she didn't try to change that yet because I'm obviously addicted and the withdrawal would probably fuck me up and I don't have the strength for that right now.

**My new psychiatrist recommended I start a new therapy, which was initially only EMDR because I have an awful lot of trauma and repressed memories. I went to the therapist and it turns out she's also a CBT therapist. I mistook CBT for DBT (which is the one that's good for bipolar or BPD folks like me, correct me if I'm wrong). So, the first session was absolutely fucking disastrous shit. I thought the therapist was honestly a bitch and she wouldn't help me or give me advice, it was a really strange and uncomfortable experience, but everyone's telling me I should go some more times before I decide it's bad. The therapy actually made me feel like a fucking mess yesterday and I felt really bad, and some repressed memories and events came up to my mind, and it was 2 or 3 AM and it was unbearable. But maybe that's what's it's supposed to do? Please enlighten me. I need to know what to expect, what to tell her, how to react, I don't know. Please just help me if you have any advice or experience with similar events.** I'm honestly so lost. I've been in this hole for 5 years and it's gotten to the point where I don't even know if I can kill myself, so I don't try anymore, but if I had a chance I'd probably take it. I'm so afraid of going back to that absolute shithole or having to spend the rest of my life bedridden by this goddamned sickness. Sorry. It's just really hard to write this. I'm at my limit.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, second part. I had an OD on Xanax, Lamictal, and Klonopin (a lot) and almost died some weeks ago. I couldn't eat afterward for an entire week because I'd throw everything up and I had to go back to the hospital. My dad is a doctor and he discussed some possibilities with my psychiatrist, and it probably was either a serotonin syndrome or lithium overdose (even though I didn't take lithium on the suicide attempt, I got dehydrated and the proportion of Lithium in my body got messed up). Nevertheless, after that, my psychiatrist changed my doses and I'm also taking Pamelor now. I've been having an unwanted side effect. I searched a little bit about it, and it seems that there are no psychiatrical meds that can increase your libido. But that's what happened to me. I usually masturbated once or twice a week, but now I have to do it at least 6 times a day or I go crazy. I feel like I have even less control over myself, and my sexual parts literally hurt when I touch them because it's been awful, and I also have some bad memories of having sexual relationships and it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable watching porn. Can someone give me advice on that too? I'd really, really appreciate it.**

I'm really sorry this is so long and probably very confusing. I'm desperate. I'm 20. I've had this fucking shit since I was 15 and not all meds in the world seem to be able to control it. It just got worse. And it's not like anything really bad is happening. My trauma is just, in the past. But it just gets worse. And I feel like sometimes I'm really happy and up and I could do anything in the world but all of sudden the depression creeps in and it's so unbearable and it lasts so long. And I've been in this cycle for 5 years and you could tell me all the names of meds you know and I'd tell you, I've taken every single one. And it always changes after some time or a crisis and I always hope it's going to be the last time, but it never is. I'm really fucking tired, so I'd just really appreciate some help. I'm really sorry. I've lost all good opportunities that were given to me, I've lost a scholarship for college in Japan, I dropped out of college in my city because I literally couldn't take it, and I've hurt so many people. And I keep thinking the longer I'm alive the more people I'm going to meet and therefore hurt if I die. So isn't now the best time for suicide? Because things will just get worse with time. I'm sorry this ended up as just meaningless venting but I could really appreciate some advice. Thank you so very much."

245,Help with an academic survey which focuses on exposure to violence and burnout on adolescent inpatient units,"Hey Everyone, 
As a heads up, this post only really applies to inpatient mental health workers and/or residential counselors. I was recently sent this survey (https://williamjames.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_77is6d3CdImrIMZ) via a mental health email listserv that I am a part of. Unfortunately, I don't meet the participation criteria, but it seemed pretty interesting and I figured I should pass it along to another community. The topic is burnout, and how exposure to violence on inpatient units impacts mental health workers/direct care staff. I thought that some individuals who are members of this sub might meet the criteria, and might be interested in helping this guy out. If you're able to participate, I'm sure it would be much appreciated. If not, feel free to pass the survey onto other individuals who qualify.  

Thanks everyone. Much love.

PS Just as an fyi, all the information regarding how the survey-info will be used/protected, which organizations this person belongs to, and any conflicts of interest (there do not appear to be any) is explained in the title page of the survey, before you begin taking it. Again, this isn’t my survey, but I’ll try to answer questions on it. Thanks!"

247,What is this feeling?,"Since around halfway through November I’ve been feeling off and I didn’t really know how to properly word what I was feeling until about a month ago. I’ve decided the best way to explain it is that I don’t feel like me. I know I have to be me because who else could I be but I really feel like a different person. 
It’s similar to how I imagine Wanda feels from The Host, where she’s in control of Melanie’s body and what Melanie says and feels, but she knows that they’re two different people. The big difference is that I don’t know who I am if I’m not me.
It’s not a matter of feeling like I’m a guy in a girl’s body or anything like that, I just feel really disconnected from my name and even my own thoughts. I thought I’d reach out and see if this is something other people have experienced and if anyone knew what I was feeling.

If anything’s confusing lmk and I’ll try to explain better, thanks."
248,"I’m scared. I’m too scared to live, and I’m too scared to die.","

This is an awful feeling. It’s been going on for years, and nothing helps me. It’s hurts more because of my loneliness. No one really cares, I get ghosted or they just stop talking to me. It hurts too that society sees someone like me, (a self harmer for many years) as a freak.

I’m just trying to find the love of my life and be happy. But apparently that’s too much to ask. I’m not “worthy” enough To girls to try to build up courage to talk to. But other guys can just instantly get any girls number and it seems like I’m the only one who can’t love anyone. But those guys just want sex and nothing more. I’ve always wanted a real relationship, sometime to share your feelings with, to hold each other while the horrible world around you rages on. But I’m just seen as “thirsty” or “cringy”. 

I wouldn’t blame anyone who reads this if they didn’t try and help me, I understand truly I do. I’d be surprised if someone even made it this far. Because I know that I sound like the most typical, by the numbers “good” guy. But I don’t have really any other way to express my emotions other than cutting myself. It’s all built up, and I have no release anywhere in my life. Nothing helps😔. 

It’s really sad too, because I tried to kill myself when I was 17 and I was thrown into a hospital. It was awful. But at least it wasn’t long. I kept the wrist band I wore ever since, every now and then I gaze at it in remorse and ponder about how my life was so different back then. That was only 2 years ago though it feels like a lifetime. 

I just want love. Honest and wholesome love. 

If you read this thread, I thank you from the bottom of my aching heart. Thank you."
249,What mental illness is this when you want to hurt someone who hurt you first?,"Basically whenever someone hurts me, I want to hurt them back and it's very hard to control that urge. I feel very vengeful and want them to feel the pain they have caused me. I've seen that normal people just move on from it and get over it and say ""be the better person"", but I can't get over it and I always ruin everything because of this. I've never heard of this symptom before so what can it be?"

251,I feel lonely when I'm alone. But when I'm with a friends or a group of friends I feel so draining,"My friends are nice and fun to be around with. But i feel the need to be alone when i meet them. I just feel so irritated by them even if they don't do anything and i feel so sad and low even when something fun is going on. I just feel the need to be alone. 
 When I am actually alone, I feel lonely.
It's like when I'm with them, I don't feel lonely but I become so restless. When I'm alone, I feel so lonely but so peaceful at the same time. Either way, I don't feel any happiness. 

Why do I feel this way? What do I want exactly?"

253,Cutting off my toxic father at 30yo (vent/can you relate?),"I'm high (weed) with a lot on my mind, so I appologize ahead of time if this is a long one.. 

My parents were divorced before I was old enough to gaf. I am so very thankful for their separation because at least I got a chance to a experience dosages of a loving healthy household when I would visit my mother growing up. 

As far as I know, my grandfather (father's father) passed away in his sleep when my dad was a young kid and I honestly believe that has damaged him as a person. He used to beat the shit out of me and physically intimidate me as punishment growing up. Things like talking back to an adult, not saying ""yes sir"" ""no sir"", or getting sub par grades would bring a world of shit my way.. Once I remember I was about 8 years old and my dad hosted a small gathering for his friends. It was a nice summer day, no drama, just good music and vibes. His 1960s muscle car (his pride and joy) was sitting in front of the house in the driveway all day that day. Later that evening I get called into his bedroom where he told me that he knows about the scratch. I thought WHAT FUCKING SCRATCH?! I knew nothing about the scratch.. Nope, he wasnt trying to hear that, I got beat. Belts, slaps, and fists.. 

Trips to my mom's was always my escape.. I remember times I would cry when I would get dropped back off back home after a long weekend or holiday with her. My dad would yell at me for crying..

Around my 10th birthday, he introduced his hidden family to the family if that makes sence.. he had a 3year old daughter (my half sister) and a  girlfriend. I was a little weird about the situation, but overall ok with it. Through the years as I grew older, I started to really feel like the outcast of the household. I would continue to get beat and yelled at, while my half sister never recieved any of that treatment for punishment (I'm not saying I wish she did! But it made me feel singled out). I turned to drugs and alcohol in highschool as an escape. I'm ashamed today to say that I grew to resent HER for it.. we are estranged to this day actually. Weddings and funerals is all we ever really speak..

He beat me when I was 17 for not holding a door open for his gf. This time I ran away and I called the cops.. after several months of back and forwarth, my mom was awarded custody of me. Thank God.

.... I learned about a year ago from a ""feelings Doc"" that I have ADHD/ADD... All those bad grades as a kid, ""Not listening"", all that shit was something I had no control over. I'm in tears as I'm writing this.. 

Reminiscing on life is tough, but I'm so thankful for what I do have. Thank you all for hearing my story.

TL;DR 
Just a guy venting about life. Can anyone else relate?"
254,Should I be worried about myself,"Hey,

The last couple of months, i’ve been feeling my mental health has been deteriorating. When I dont have to do anything important, I sleep way too much and find it almost impossible to get out of sleep. I occasionally mildly wake up, however still not fully concious, and fall right back to sleep and start dreaming often quite intense dreams. However, I also experience quite severe sleep issues, especially the days before having to go to university, where I almost dont sleep at all. I am extremely irritable, and whenever I go out or meet with friends or go out in public in general, I want to snap at everyone and feel angry and feel very unease. I find the most simple tasks extremely daunting, and can’t collect the mental energy to do them. Just by going to university or the gym, already drags all my energy out for that day. I often feel anxious about other people, and have a very hard time trusting people outside of my family. Most things I usually enjoy seem extremely boring or uninteresting, except for the simple task of playing video games, which sometimes can make me feel slightly better. In addition to all of this, I feel paranoid, and often feel either people are malicious towards me, or judging me. It quite literally can make me feel sometimes, that I am going completely insane. I live in the Northern hemisphere, and right now it is very dark, and I did find some benefits when the sun is shining, to sit in my window and take it in, but it only mildly improves my day.

I’ve been experiencing these things, ever since I had a very chaotic end of a relationship with my BPD ex girlfriend. Since then, I started seeing someone new, but I am completely numb to show her any feelings or empathy. However, she still sticks through for some reason, but its very hard for me to show her any affection. I think also, recently i’ve had an exam period and got an internship, which also added a lot of stress to my life and made everything a little more chaotic.

I decided to be very self-reflective about this, since I have a brother that suffers from bipolar disorder type 2. I talk to him very often, and might talk with him about this soon, as he is very good at understanding such things just from his own experience and interest. I have been considering going to a proffessional maybe, but I would like to know if any of what i’m telling seems out of the ordinary for any of you, because I feel like I am suffering and can’t do what i’m supposed to do because of it... I am extremely afraid/paranoid that I might develop mental illness..."

They vary in strength but usually he trembles, gets hot and sometimes falls on the floor. This will last 2 to 3 minutes and the he enters a recovery phase which can vary depending on how strong the attack was. He was hospitalized in December of 2019 and was there for 22 days while they observed him. The diagnosis was anxiety specifically OCD and they gave him medication which as of today does not seem to be working. He is in the process of starting a new school that has doctors on its staff to look over the children that have medical needs like he currently does and we are hoping this will result in more clarity and some sort of solution. I would like advice on how we can help him more as personally I am not sure what really can be done other than comfort and support him. Also has anyone gone through a similar situation? if so has your child overcome or been able to better manage it and how? Thanks in advance for your time and information.

260,I knew I was fucked up but this is just ridiculous,"
(This is basically just venting, ignore if you wish)


I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, an eating disorder, borderline personality disorder, insomnia, and previous substance abuse. I’ve been told I had ADHD and schizophrenia but neither were true. I’ve been in psychosis, I’ve had multiple suicide attempts, and the symptoms I display for each of my disorders continuously intermingle with each other that sometimes it feels like even my therapists don’t know what is causing my issues. It’s like they are afraid to put me on any medications, like every therapist I go to doesn’t know what to do with me. My trauma list is too long and the scale of my symptoms are too grand that it’s like everyone just wants to admit me for something  and hope for the best. These people are supposed to be specialists and they either are not capable or don’t want to deal with a comorbid patient. I am not an experiment and I am not a lost cause, I just need genuine fucking help so I can live a manageable life and no matter what I try I just can’t find any."

262,Seeing things that aren’t there in glimpses and in my peripheral vision,"I’ve had this since I started puberty so going on 8 years but never this frequent or severe. Going off antidepressants has turned every psychological symptom I’ve ever experienced up five notches for me. I’ve been totally weaned off for a little over a week now, but I’m still seeing things.

It’s like my brain takes things I’m afraid of, or obsess over (my pets) and plants them in my peripheral vision. I see people running past, people sitting on furniture, people walking by, my animals walking past, all of which aren’t there. If I spend too much time looking into the shadows in low lighting weird transparent figures start to form that resemble ghosts. Last week I was trying to go to bed and my room was full of transparent ghosts.

These things used to happen to me maybe a couple times a week before, now they’re happening many times a day everyday. I can recall one incident from a year or two ago where I was sitting at the table facing the glass sliding doors. It was dark out so they basically turned to dim mirrors, and when I looked up I saw a giant misty figure hovering in the kitchen behind me. When I whipped around I saw it but only for a split second, and I was too scared to finish what I was eating.

I used to think these were all little, but legitimate paranormal experiences. Now I’m starting to think they’re minor hallucinations. Do they sound like hallucinations?"
263,"Lack of motivation and self-confidence, overly dependent on others","**Pre-submission apology**: Sorry for the super long backstory in the beginning.  I just wanted to show that the capacity for confidence and motivation are clearly within me somewhere.  I just can't find them at this time.  It was also therapeutic to vent for a while.

You can skip to the summary at the bottom if you just want to see the issues I'm dealing with.

&amp;nbsp;

Some backstory about myself, and where I **[32m]** believe my lack of motivation came from:

I've always been an introvert who preferred sitting in the corner of family gatherings, and most holidays I would only speak to 2-3 family members before grabbing a bit of food, and eventually trying to exit without being seen.

In 2018 I made the drastic decision to leave my part time job in the US to pursue teaching abroad.  I did almost all of the research myself (proving that the ability to help myself is in myself, just buried somewhere), registered for an intensive teaching course at my destination, saved up a comfortable amount of money, and took my first flight ever.  After about 2 weeks of living in my new country I started the teaching course.  It was 40+ hours a week for 4 weeks of classroom studies, self-reflective essays, exams, and 6 lessons that were to be taught by ourselves in front of 20-40 students.  As an introvert who barely even spoke to his own family, the thought of getting in front of a room of students for 50 minutes terrified me!

I was super eager to attend the course each day, even though it meant a lot of studying, and preparing our lessons.  When we got to our first practice lesson, I was extremely nervous.  Setting up all of my materials on the board/desk as the kids got into their seats, I was shaking...and if anyone had asked me a question I'm sure my voice would have cracked.  As soon as my examiner signaled from the back to begin, my nerves almost completely went away.  I'd never seen that confident side of myself before, and I'll take that feeling with my for the rest of my life.

At the end of the course, myself and my 10 classmates received our teaching certificates, and I actually had the 2nd highest overall scores.  The only one who scored higher was someone who already had half a decade of teaching experience.

Shortly after I got my certificate, my issues slowly began.  I started taking on individual students.  The lessons were acceptable, but I knew I needed to do more to help my students achieve their goals.  I would check Google, YouTube, ask for advice from other teachers...but I couldn't find anything that would help, and I gave up.  A few weeks later I would seek advice again, find nothing for me, and give up again.

Over the next year, I adapted my lessons in minor ways, not in the major ways I really wanted, but in general my lessons stayed the same.

During that time I slowly but surely lost my confidence.  With a lack of confidence, I stopped searching for new students because ""My lessons are not good enough right now"".  With a lack of new students, my income shrank.  With a shrinking income, my savings shrank.

And that brings me to today.  I've got about half a year of savings from the US remaining, but I need to get back my motivation and confidence before it's too late and I have to abandon my dream here.  I am legitimately happy with my new life here, and I would be devastated if I had to return to a part time job in the US.

&amp;nbsp;

**Quick summary of the issues I've got swirling around my head**:

1. **Lack of motivation**: Despite the fact that my savings are dwindling and I need to take on more students to increase my income, I don't take the time to properly scour the internet for ideas to expand my lessons

2. **Lack of self-confidence**: Stepping away from my career issues, my unhappiness has caused me to overeat and gain 5-10 lbs.  I know it's not much, but it's enough to make me self-conscious when I leave the house.  If I have to go to the store, I usually wait until it's dark out to avoid ""people looking at my overweight self"" - which is ridiculous.  I know people are just living their lives and they don't care.  But my brain keeps telling me they do.  Hell, I can't even muster the courage to *go walk* to improve my health because people will see me.

3. **Overly dependent on others**: For all intents and purposes, I am incapable of going to do most things by myself.  I can do necessary stuff, like going to the convenience store for food or supermarket for home supplies (assuming I am having a ""good confidence day"" - otherwise I just put it off 1, 2, 3+ days).  But going out to eat (I usually order delivery), shopping for clothes (I've needed a few new shirts for a while), walking around the park, etc. is impossible for me in my current mental state.

4. **Spend too much time on the internet/games**: This one has really wrecked my ability to focus on anything (including researching lesson ideas for more than 10 minutes without opening up Reddit or something else).  I've seen memes where someone will close Reddit, then mindlessly open Reddit again.  That's legitimately me sometimes, and I hate it.  I want to break away from the cycle of Reddit -&gt; YouTube -&gt; game 1 -&gt; game 2 -&gt; repeat

5. **Lack of self-control**: Some days I can eat an entire large pizza or a bunch of cookies/donuts/cake/etc.  Even on a good day when I limit myself to a normal-sized meal, if I get slightly hungry again later I will have the mentality of ""I should just get a big meal to fill myself up so I don't get hungry again later""

Thanks all I can think of for now.  If you read through my whole post, thank you!  If even a couple folks could offer me some advice I would be super grateful."
264,Hallucinations when looking at carpets?,"Hi, I posted it on /askreddit, but maybe here its better. Ill copy my post.

TLDR: I see lights moving in specific patterns when looking at carpets for a prolonged period of time. Its beyond my control, anyone knows something about this?

So hi everyone. Title sounds a little confusing, Ill try to explain this to my best.
Since I was a little kid (5yo? Now Im 26) whenever I stare at a carpet for like 10 seconds without blinking, I begin to see these flashing lights moving from left to right, from up to down, following the direction of this carpet's texture. 
More or less, its like Im looking, from above in the night, at a highway were thousands of little shiny cars move super fast trough the carpet. Its like a lights' party! 
Yeah it sounds crazy, doesnt it? I always remember having these phenomenoms. I remember spending all my church sundays looking at these lights on the (hiper mega giant) carpet of the church. Well that was hypnotic! Like thousands of lights going around trough the carpet (but mind, not casually, always following certain angles).
When I talked to other kids about this, or my parents, or friends growing up, no one understands whats going on and looked at me like I was weird (which I am) or crazy (which I dont think I am).
I called these hallucinations, but actually I dont believe they are. I never hallucinated for anything else in life exept for carpets.
My only explanation its that my brain, somehow, recognize sunconsciously some pattern I dont understand or dont see, and automatically tries to connect those patterns? Like when you have those ""games"" where u have to connect dots in a certain order to.obtain that particoular image.

Thanks for.reading all of.this, and sorry if I did some mistakes (or better, point them to me!) 
Im not english.
Btw thanks! And plz if u know something let me know!"
265,How can I focus more?," So I know this isn\`t a big deal,but I just can\`t pay attention. I\`m starting to get bad grades and it really sucks because I just can\`t help it.Often at school I\`m really tired even if I slept well and I don\`t even feel like I\`m in the same room as the other people. As if I\`m on autopilot and everything that happens to me isn\`t really happening to me.

  At home when I try just to relax  or sleep,my mind just makes me sick and some thoughts and memories just pop up in my head constantly.And the thing is that they are not even important. My brain obsesses over things like:\`\`Oh,that conversation was really awkward let\`s think about it for two hours.\`\`There are so many ideas and craps that I think of at the same time and It feels like I have 5 tvs turned on and I can\`t shut them.

 The only times when I\`m really all right is when I don\`t really participate in my own life like reading,drawing,writing and watching movies.

I just want and advice on how to concentrate better and not think about nonsensical shits all the time."

269,Is This Some Mental disorder?,Im 17 and at times I just really feel bad out of nowhere. Its like snapping out of happiness  and it gets really intense. and then later I become fine... I tend to hide it really well unless Im alone..I have body image issues plus been bullied about it and I'm  very sensitive..I have no idea what to do how to feel better I also self harmed to feel numb and I keep getting suicidal thoughts..do you think this is some mental disorder because I can't figure out and I can't help but hate myself when this happens. I've tried to tell it to my friends but they were like it's just negative thoughts don't dwell upon it and stuff...
270,I can't take it anymore (Vent and asking for some help),"I don't know where to start. My life just feels like crap overall. I am diagnosed with depression but I think there is much more like anxiety.

I am a student and am extremely busy. I'm always sooo tired and still have tons of homework when I get home.I would say there are aspects of school that I do like such as my favourite subjects but I feel like im losing enjoyment in that too. And my classmates barely help my situation. I've tried being very open with them but can't help but think that it looks like i'm looking for attention. I also cannot stand the culture surrounding mental illness in my class where it is trivialised and relentlessly joked about. There are people outright claiming they are mentally ill just for the ""lols"". I absolutely cannot stand them. I've tried my darnest to forgive them  and tell myself that they are just under educated about the topic but a lot of times I can't bring myself to do that. 

The worst of this however is that assholes and bullies(Usually the same people) get away with a lot of shit and are having thetime of their lives doing so while I know classmates who suffer at the hands of disfuncional families, overworking, stress and mental illness alike.(These people are sometimes the victims of the bullying). Its.just.so.unfair! I get that life is not fair sometimes but it's just been so long and I'm starting to lose all hope that things will get better.

School is also extremely fast paced, even more competetive and stressful. It's not just my school its the general school and parenting culture of my country.I'm cooped up in either a classroom or my room alsmost 24/7.

My home life isn't any better. I won't go into detail because this is getting long (you can ask if you are curious). but I don't trust any of them (Other that then dog) and feel incredibly tense and depressed around them. 

 I know that I get very worked up and breakdown when I get stuck at something, get very afraid when my name is called and get very disgusted at certain behaviours.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also like to point out my age (almost 14) so I fit perfectly into the ""14 year old white girls who listen to billie eilish"" meme/joke. This is a reason I've always felt that no one would beleive me. I'm not white though, I'm asian.

Anyway, thanks for reading I know its really long but if anyone can maybe give suggestions on what I could do to feel better of offer some help, i'm very open to anything. thanks..."

274,(Serious) Could I have a personality disorder?,"I'm 18F and I'm really concerned about losing my sanity. Does these anectodes resemble any particular PD? Or do I just have Med Student Syndrome?

* My dad probably had Munchausen's By Proxy or had a delusion about everyone else other than him was mentally ill. He would enforce SSRIs on me whenever I expressed a glimpse of emotion or did something slightly out of the norms. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 5, and repeatedly tried to run away since I was 11.
* My abuse wasn't taken seriously because I was upper-class and my dad used to lie about I'm delusional. I expressed the want to be poor since I was 6-7, and often role-played as an orphan. I faked being poor in university for attention. I was de facto expelled in the first semester for harassing other people and sabotaging lectures.
* I have a undiagnosed developmental disability and faced discrimination in the school enviroments. Due to it, I've always had the ""if you get slapped to the right cheek, slap the left"" attitude. My violent behavior was mistaken as a symptom of my condition and I took advantage of it.
* I sometimes obsessively repeat things I say a lot because I'm terrified of not making myself clear.
* I often have intrusive thoughts of harassing homeless kids, or stealing their money to give it to kids who are able go to school. (Like the reverse of what Robin Hood did).
* I often am very uncomfortable around poor people to the point I fear going to neighborhoods that are more ""ghetto"".
* I see myself a misunderstood villain to the point it becomes unhealthy.
* I have attempted suicide for attention with no intentions to die. I attempted suicide a few months ago by intentionally creating a gas leak and going to bed and survived it and acted like nothing happened afterwards."
275,Is This A Mental Disorder?,Hi I'm in my late teens  and at times I really feel sad out of nowhere. Its like snapping out of happiness because of no good reason.I hide it very well and when Im alone I get these panic attacks. I've got body image issues and also I've self harmed myself  and keep getting suicidal thoughts like I belong nowhere and stuff...I did talk about it to my to my friends but they were like its just negative thoughts and stuff..Every thing gets out of control..I dont even perform that well in school..Is this a mental disorder? How can I feel better cause I hate when this happens..
276,the suspense is killing me lol,"after a long time of struggling with my mental health I've had it and I want my life back.

I'm tomorrow sending in a letter basically saying I don't want to recieve any money from the state anymore because of a few reasons  
1. I'm not allowed to apply for jobs  
2. They've basically made it so that I can't live in my current apartment much longer because they've found me another apartment but can't seem to understand the money I get maybe only covers rent and nothing else.  
3. I'll only have this income until the summer because you need to reapply and that process can take months and if I get it denied idk abt going into debt because I'm forced to live in an apartment I don't have money for and can't leave because the state is like we own u.

I get both my rent and my food paid for now because I live here bc i was about to be homeless before now that I'm about to be homeless again. but the apartment is for like teens that's why they don't want me to live here any longer and want me to start paying.

This year could either end with me being homeless and wondering where tf i put all my furniture and my cat. Or it could end with me having a job and supporting myself and never being afraid of being tossed from city to city and feeling like just a diagnosis on a paper.

Problem is that whenever I'm like ""I want to get a job I want to be my own person again"" I'm being spoken to (by professionals) as if I don't understand I'm mentally ill and I'm 5 years old or something.

I have a really dumb plan but i think about this every day and it's the only think I can do because I feel like a prisoner? but they say im allowed to leave whenever i want but where would i go

a long vent"

278,straight up not having a good time,"I have decided that there is no way out - always knowing I would kill myself some day it's just so much worse now.

279,How much can an LCSW really help someone other than referring their client to a psychiatrist or specialized therapist?,"I have a family member that has substance abuse problems, insomnia, social anxiety,  chronic depression, OCD and most likely PTSD. They have seen two different LCSWs, which I believe has been a way to tell people that, yes they are seeing someone, but aren't looking to make any real change. 

In my experience with therapy, LCSWs are usually the people you talk to so they can open the doors to more specialized help going forward."
280,Was I abused?,"So I'm 18. I've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression for years now and whenever I've tried to figure out the cause I always link it to my childhood with my mother. Some people say I was abused, some people say I'm just whining and it's nothing...i dont know what to think. I just know that as a kid i was scared, alone and I felt worthless. I realise what i went through was not the worst thing a child has been through. Far from it, many kids get severely abused by their parents on an extreme scale and it's horrible. What I went through I dont even know how to interpret it. I lived with my mother and stepdad, and when I was around 7 my mum was going through alot of stress...not sure why. But she isnt the most stable person. Theres alot my mother has done when I lived with her as a kid so I'll name a few things she did and I want to know peoples opinions on it. 

So my mother liked to punish anything I did...and I mean anything from little petty things kids do to things you should punish a kid for, by sending me to my room and forcing me to sit with my back straight up against the wall and sit there all day, for multiple days on end. I was allowed toilet breaks and dinner. That was it. Other than that, I sat there all morning, afternoon and evening like that. No talking, reading, listening to music, playing with toys. Literally nothing. I wasnt even allowed to lay down or the time would be extended. I wasn't allowed to sleep until my set bedtime in the evening either. This would happen very often and each individual punishment of this could sometimes last weeks of sitting there. I got into the habit of talking to myself due to being so bored, and I'd spend the whole time mentally beating myself up and thinking I was not a good enough son. That was at 7, I still converse with myself at the age of 18 if I feel alone because of this. Is this abuse? Or am I just being a wimp? 


On fridays I'd have to polish, Hoover and tidy my room. Bear in mind I'm ranging from age 7 to 11. After everything was done, if there was but one speck of dust or one crumb on the floor or surfaces or cabinets...she slap me, shout at me, call me useless and tell me to repeat the cleaning process until it was done...sometimes I'd be there for the whole of a friday evening, trial and error to make the room perfect...and as a result for not managing to completely clean it perfectly, I'd be sent to my room as the usual punishment of doing nothing. 

My mum would often slap me alot anywhere on the body, I feel like alot of parents do this though...but with my other itd be for any petty things that kids do. I sulk or pull a little face, I get walloped round the head several times. It just made me scared more than anything. 


Often my mother would believe I did things and try to punish when in actuality I hadn't done anything wrong and she would practically interrogate me to tell the ""truth"" which she believed...when the truth was I hadn't done anything wrong. She would hit me, call me mentally retarded and verbally assault me until I told the ""truth""... when in actuality I'm lying that I've done something just so I can stop the hurting. 


Theres is a whole lot of other stuff my mother did to me combined with all this but I dont want to make this too long. Its already far too long...if you've read all of this. Thank you. It means alot to talk about this and get things of my chest."
281,Misdiagnosis,"Have you ever been misdiagnosed and if so how did you deal with it especially if you knew it wasn't going to go away?

I was diagnosed with atypical autism at 13.  
Borderline personality disorder at 18.  
Bipolar disorder at 19.

I think my borderline diagnosis was just depression/early symptoms of bipolar disorder. I believed 100% I had it tho but when my bipolar fully blossomed and especially after I got on mood stabilizers I have almost no symptoms of that.  
I've also always thought my autism diagnosis is actually social anxiety because I don't think they're that similar and it doesn't make sense that I have no difficulties with people at all unless I don't know them and the make me sweaty and anxious. I also wasn't involved in the entire diagnosis process and I was suffering from undiagnosed depression at the time so I wouldn't call my behaviour strange. My journal often said ""anxiety disorder/unspecified anxiety disorder"" without it really being more than a line in my journal that wasn't looked into. I've multiple times asked to know what my autistic symptoms are but I've only ever gotten that autism is a wide spectrum and some people have bigger symptoms than others but it doesnt answer my question.

I did get my autism diagnosis revaluated when I was 16 but the psychiatrist twisted everything I said and eventually told me I'm not even shy because he has worked with shy people I'm just autistic. Alright.

Problem is that I find that I so often get talked down to or get told I don't understand that I'm sick or that I need help or they feel the need to remind me theyre life long when I talk of my plans for the future. I also get told over and over and over about the option to go to a therapist for autistic people and talk about autistic problems sometimes I do think about saying yes so I can go and be like nope can't relate and hope they'll realize i'm not even autistic."
282,I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) ask me anything?,I have Borderline Personality Disorder also known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and I'd like to take this chance to answer any questions in relation to this very misunderstand mental health condition.
283,I feel too ashamed to see a professional about anything,"I’m pretty sure i am experiencing some abnormal amounts of anxiety. I haven’t slept over four hours at a time for like three weeks and I have nightmares all the time. I’ve had three panic attacks in the last week which never happened to me before. It was like I couldn’t breathe or control my heartbeat and it nearly made me throw up. It comes and goes but my stomach is almost always in knots and I rarely manage to relax. 
I feel ashamed to see anyone about it though. I feel like this is something I should deal with on my own. If this was any one I cared about instead of me I would immediately urge them to talk to someone professional, but I just can’t do it for myself. It makes me feel weak, or like I’m admitting defeat. I also hate talking to strangers about my problems. Even though I know it’s their job I just don’t even know if I could.

Maybe my family was reassuring me too much. No idea. However I feel like I've lost my memory and only the pain defines me. I've always been scared of becoming a complainer and now I am one.

Basically , problem started because my dad was going to to stay up last night and have a drink, hence which made me anxious as i feel like I can't go to bed untill everyone else has gone to bed, so that way I know that if something were to happen(i.e. if my dad collapsed or had a heart attack, my mum would be around to help him as opposed to him having a heart attack downstairs and no one finding out untill the next morning ) long story short: my dad gets upset and I get accused of ""stopping him from staying up to do his work"" and made out to be a nasty selfish person when it's the OCD which makes me feel like if I go to bed before my dad, that something will happen to him and I'll beat myself up emotionally about it for ages. Im tired of people not bothering to understand how my OCD works and people making all these assumptions about me which actually bear little truth a lot of the time"
286,Please help me,"I honestly feel like I'm a mistake. I am doing bad in school and am in danger of falling out, even though I try really hard to stay up.

And it's not like a suicide thing (although I do fantasize about suicide sometimes), it's just this feeling that something will happen to me and end my life young."
288,Had a very close friend abandon me in China today?,"Abandon may not be the right word, but I'm too troubled right now to look for the appropriate word.

A little backstory:

Came to China 4 years ago, with a girl that's supposed to be a very good friend. We came together on the same flight and lived together for 2 years before she had to move to another part of the city for work. We talk multiple times a week to check in on each other and meet up once in awhile as we are both pretty busy.

The event:

As you guys know, there's a serious virus strain going around in China and the rest of the world. We had both talked about our options and decided to remain here, so as not to get on a flight with possible carriers of the virus and not to infect our families, seeing as the virus can incubate for up to 14 days. Past few days been calling her, she doesn't answer nor return the calls, only for her to pick up 3 days ago  and tell me she's on her way to the airport to get on a flight back to our home country. She didn't tell me anything about looking at tickets or preparing to go home. Didn't even have the decency to call me up and tell me she's leaving.

I've been crying for the past few days, because my feelings are really hurt and I expected better. Am I wrong to be upset about this? Are my feelings valid? How do I cope?"
289,How to learn to trust again,"Throw away account to start with, sorry about that.

So I'd just like a little bit of advice if that's possible, thanks in advance to anyone who replies.

A few incidents while I was younger caused me to have trust issues among other things ( Generalised anxiety disorder, Social Anxiety, PTSD, Clinical depression, low self esteem )

What impacted me the most trust wise was being cheated on in relationships. I tried to write off earlier cases of this as I was a teenager and young people do stupid things.

However in my first ""serious"" relationship I thought things would be different. We were together for 3 years, my ex enrolled at a college 2.5 years into our relationship (UK college so no moving away, just extra qualifications to get into University).

I eventually found out through one of her friends that she had cheated on me with multiple different men, almost immediately after enrolling. I quickly ended the relationship because infidelity is a deal breaker for me.

Since the split I have socially retreated inwards, I haven't dated, made any new friends, I don't work due to chronic illnesses so I see no one in a day.

Our split was almost 8 years ago and I feel like I have stagnated ever since. I distrust everyone with a major emphasis on women and I want to try and get back into the real world again."
290,I hate myself,"'It is what it is.' I don't like this line. Not at all. I just don't like myself. I try to do something. I fail most of the times. Going back and forth with one thing is tiring. But I still try to do it. But when I complete this one thing, another thing just pops out of nowhere. Now I have to do that thing. It's frustrating. I just want a break. But then I feel like a quitter. Which I still am because I can't do shit. 
I am not good at anything. Just leading an average, monotonous, boring day to day life. Even though I'm pursuing what I like, I'm feeling this way. Idk why I quit tbh. Or feel this way . I guess because this has become a habit. 
Neither can I talk properly. Nor I talk much. So yay good for me because then I feel lonely because I just can't figure out what to do. Should I share what I'm feeling to someone? But why should they deal with my shit. I mean it would eventually become stressful for anyone to go through someone else's shit.
And I pull my hair. Ashamed to wear shorts or half-sleeve tees. Because I have pulled off most of my hair. And now I have patches. So even if it's warm outside, I wear full sleeves and jeans. 
Then I overthink. I'm lazy. My physical fitness has gone for a toss. I doubt myself most of the times even though I can do it. When people give me some nice comments about what I did, I feel that they're just saying it because they have to for some reason or I feel how do they so good in me when I can't see that.

These are I guess some of my flaws. Just wanted to let this out somehow."
291,are there any anti-anxiety/depressant medication that are not synergistic with abilify?,Right now im on escitalopram and abilify and I realized that im gaining a lot of weight due to their synergistic properties.

292,Need advice as an empath rooming with bipolar 1 best friend,"My best friend (20) since high school has bipolar 1 disorder, but it’s never really affected me (19) until we became roommates in college last semester. I’m an empath and have anxiety, and absorb the emotions of people around me. The past couple weeks she has been very manic and irritable, though typically not angry towards me. I feel so on edge and on the verge of tears from the emotional turbulence, even though it’s not directed at me. I went home to my family this weekend to take a breath, and don’t know what to do when I go back. I feel guilty for feeling this way because I know she can’t help her mania, and this also makes me wonder if I should even talk to her about it. The articles I’ve pulled up on living with bipolar are usually targeted towards married couples, and I’m not sure the same suggestions would necessarily hold in this situation. How should I address this with her while recognizing she can’t necessarily control it, if I even should?"
293,What causes a chemical imbalance in the brain?,We often hear that major depression is caused by the lack of serotonin. What causes somebody to stop producing serotonin?
294,Helpers also need help,"Trigger warning: First responder mental health  
In case there are helpers on here - first responders especially - please know you can ask for help.  There are various resources available in Canada for first responders.  If I'm allowed to, I will link you to [a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idINVnsuKe4) that lists various resources under the video available in your province or territory.  I made this music video in collaboration with local artists, first responders, family, and friends.  The video first starts by showing 3 different emergency responders (including dispatch), then the music changes and supporters come to help them get back to their feet.    


We first responders have a lot of difficulty asking for help.  We hide behind our roles so easily: if we are helping others then we must be ok.  Of course, that isn't always the case.  What we see and hear on a daily basis in our careers can be traumatic, on top of all of life's stressors.  So be kind to yourself.  We don't have to always be the person in control, the strong ones, the person who's ""put together"".  Sometimes, that could be a difficult task to ask for ourselves.    
Ask for help if you need.    
Be well."
295,Should I tell my husband how bad my depression is getting?,"I know that he will blame himself for it, even if I tell him it's not his fault. And I know he'll be excessively worried about me doing something stupid, if you know what I mean. 

It seems like a lot of cons and no pros. He already knows I'm depressed, just not how bad it is."
296,Overwhelming guilt for no reason?,"For most of my life, I’ve experienced random moments of overwhelming guilt in the pit of my stomach, for no known reason. The moments generally last 30 seconds to a few minutes at a time. I can never actually pinpoint the cause. I’ve dealt with anxiety and stressful situations my entire life, and they seem to come more frequently over the last few years. I find myself blaming hormones due to a tubal removal a few years back, but like I said, I’ve had these moments my whole life. When I get them, it’s like I’ve done something wrong, or my life is wrong, or something bad is gonna happen, even though it’s never actually tied to anything significant. My stomach gets nauseated for a bit, my heart kinda weakens, and I feel sad. It just comes from nowhere. Sometimes after sex, like I’ve done something dirty. (My husband and I have been together for 15 years). 
I don’t know what this feeling is or how to help it go away. I can say that if I had to live with that feeling all the time, day and night, I’d probably not want to continue. If there are people out there who feel this way all the time, they absolutely need someone’s help."
297,My worry of loss is making me not want to have kids,"Made a throwaway for this as I have fam and friends on reddit and I don’t want them finding out I’m pouring my heart out to internet strangers. Haha

So, I’m not a worrier. At all. I’m usually free and easy, not a care in the world etc. 

But every now and again I worry about losing the ones I love. It’s not an accident worry, just a niggling little thing that drifts into my mind every so often during quiet moments. 

Now my fiancée and I don’t want kids. We like our holidays and stuff and want to spend our money on us. But sometimes my fiancée sometimes just asks out of curiosity if I really don’t want children. And while the aforementioned reasons are my primary reasons for not wanting kids I also worry that if I had them I’d love them so much that I would be scared of losing them. 

Plus I’m 30 and I’m one of those that doesn’t really know what I want to do in life so I go from job to job and I don’t want to be a disappointment to kids. That adds to the worry. 

I was trying to think when it started and as best I can remember I can trace it back to about 5 years ago. I still lived at home back then and suddenly my mum decided she was leaving my dad. They had grown apart, normal stuff, but it came out of the blue and blindsided me (and my dad being the pretty content, happy go lucky guy that he is, got blindsided by it too).

This coincided with me moving out which left my dad rattling around in a big house on his own. Since then I’ve felt a lot of responsibility for my dad. He’s a pretty independent guy and seems quite happy in his own company but I personally don’t want him to be alone all day every day. Anyway, that’s where the worry started, I think. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, this just seems like a huge tangent. Haha anyway, TL:DR, I don’t want kids because of (amongst other more selfish reasons) my niggling fear of losing people I love combined with worrying I’m a disappointment"
298,I’m taking control of my own treatment. Moving back home.,"24F. Moving out of home caused me to become suicidal for the first time in my life. My mental (and physical) health was already in a bad place, but this pushed me over. I became actively suicidal for the first time (I fell out of love with life a long time ago.)

I’ve been in constant mental health treatment for 14 years. It hasn’t been that helpful, but I still pursued therapy and additional meds to try to adjust after this move. (I was already in therapy.)

My therapist about hospitalized me. The culmination of all these years in therapy was supposed to help me cope on my own, right? and I just suddenly put my foot down. I left her. I legitimately don’t know what will make me better, but I do know what will make me worse. Hospitalization **will make me worse**. Taking additional meds that make me sick **will make me worse** (part of the reason I don’t like life anymore is I live in constant pain and exhaustion from a health condition).

I honestly didn’t think my parents would take me back, but they did. I thought they’d say it was enabling me. They’re not to happy. *I’m not happy*...

But I felt *this* was at least a chance of saving my life... to go back to some physical environment that was comfortable (and had awesome therapy cats) and use it as a base to to keep figuring life out.

I know my therapist felt a legal obligation. I’m very glad she let me go, because I would have killed myself as soon as I got out. A health professional’s job is to “do no harm”, but it’s also to “relieve suffering”. I realized they couldn’t do that for me right now, and being on the edge of death, I needed that. So here I am. 

Lol if anyone even read this whole thing... thank you. Please post any thoughts. I do feel like I’m floundering. Still have a couple more weeks in this apartment..."
299,I desperately need advice for my father,"Hi everyone. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this (pls let me know if it’s not), but all advice and suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

The situation: For the past few years, my mother and I have noticed my father become increasingly dictative, controlling, and stubborn. He believes that every opinion and belief he has is absolutely right and everyone else who disagrees is wrong and not normal. He doesn’t consider other people’s opinions as valid, and any resistance to his opinion leads to him getting very angry, upset, and  yelling. My mom and I essentially have to agree with everything he says and thinks. Additionally, he wants to control and monitor every aspect of our lives, claiming he wants to ensure we are on the ‘right track’. He pretty much tries to micromanage everything. I am fine with letting him know what I’m up to, but the issue is that he gets upset if I spend time with friends or even if I am doing school work (I heavily prioritize my academics and spend a lot of time on them). He wants me to spend a majority of my time with him or doing chores around the home. Finally, the other condition is that he talks for extremely long periods of time usually either repeating the same thing over and over again with different wording or by branching off and talking about previous experiences. It’s very common for us to have to sit and listen to him talk for 3-4 hours straight about things he believes we did wrong. 

So my question is, do you all believe this has something to do with his mental health, and if so what could the condition be. I’m fairly certain this has to be some kind of mental health condition since it’s been getting worse over the years. Also, what would be the best way to get help for my father? There is no way we would be able to take him to a doctor or psychologist regarding the issue since he would never believe that anything is wrong with him and he would get extremely angry at us. 

Sorry for the long post, but we are in desperate need for some advice. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your time!"
300,Slow motion voices inside my head are driving me nuts,"For as long as I can remember, I sometimes hear certain sounds/voices inside my head in slow motion. An example for this, is a few weeks ago, I heard a very fast song, and afterwards it played inside my head, but in slow motion. The slow motion feeling is for some reason very uncomfortable and drives me crazy sometimes. Every time I think of that song right now, it plays in slow motion in my head, and then all thoughts I have after that, are in slow motion as well. Sometimes I have it with voices as well. I wanted to note that I have autism and OCD (im 17, female). I wondered if more people experienced these weird slow motion like sounds inside their heads.

I also sometimes hear voices inside my head when I am tired and about to fall asleep. Then I usually cannot hear what the voices are saying but sometimes I pick up a few words. The voices are almost always of people I know, like my parents or my friends."
301,Can someone point me in the right direction,"I want to at least have an idea of what's going on with my brain. Google symptoms isn't all to helpful, so I just want to be pointed in the right direction so I can see what I can do for myself. Any suggestions are welcome.

I have generally 3 mood states. They can swing between each other with or without reason.

My default is neutral. I'm apathetic about most things and things don't really bother me. I think this is my genuine personality. 

Next is a depressed mood. I'm way more pessimistic, skeptical, and cynical. I have almost no motivation and I'm just tired. I sleep more and feel guilty about it. I barely move or do anything. I get antisocial and I isolate myself. It usually devolves into suicidal thoughts and stays that way for a bit.

Lastly is really happy. It's almost the complete opposite of the depressive mood. I become trusting and motivated. I sleep less and try to stay up as late as possible (bc I dislike sleeping). I want to move and I get really social. I make more jokes and I try to talk with everyone. If no one is available, they're probably just busy. 

It's weird I can switch between those, and it's weird going from beyond sad to beyond happy in a few minutes, or vice versa. Neutral usually kicks in after I go to sleep, but my mood can swing to it too."
302,I’m having a hard time finding a therapist that’s willing to focus on the issues I’m having today and not fixate on my past trauma.,"10 years ago I had an extremely traumatic episode that led to me completely losing my sense of self and my grip on reality, eventually I was sedated by paramedics and placed in an involuntary hold for 3 days so I wouldn’t harm myself. After years of therapy I’ve moved past it. 

I live in a different country now and have some anxiety and numbness occasionally but nothing remotely similar to what happened to me before. Whenever I tell a therapist what happened they’re like a dog with a damn bone and will not even consider working with me in the now. It always comes back to what happened before. My therapist at home agrees with me that what happened was the cause of a traumatic event, not chronic illness and by all accounts I’ve recovered as much as a person could be expected to.

I’ve tried just not disclosing it but that feels disingenuous, and counterproductive to put up walls like that. 

I don’t accept that every bad spell in my life for the rest of my life has to be rooted in that one event and it’s driving me up the wall that that’s all anyone wants to focus on."
303,I'm proud of myself today!,"So despite my anxiety and depression, today I completed my first job as a freelancer. 

I've started my own business for PC repair and support and today I got my first customer and completed the job. 

It might not seem like much but this is a huge step in the right direction for me. 

I'm finally starting to see that maybe setting up my own business so I can take things at my own pace is going to be a good thing. I can work and take care of myself at the same time. 

One very happy customer and one very happy me."
304,How do you reason with a person who has an intellectual complex?,"I have a dear friend who unfortunately after a few beers can get very angry and defensive about his intelligence. He is a clever guy, but constantly and very seriously states that he is smarter than Elon Musk, Einstein etc... He refers to his college days of supposedly helping doctor's/physicist's with their mathematics even though he was studying renewable science. I am not doubting that he did those things but he keeps referring to himself as a genius and nobody sees him. When he says things like this he comes across as kind of delusional.


It is kind of jarring to hear these statements in such an aggressive and confident tone. 
I am not saying he cannot be a genius or anything like that but he wants to be made feel like the smartest person in the room everytime I see him, to which is draining our relationship.
I just want to have a couple beers and good conversation rather than having to cater to his beliefs.

Are there any techniques to veer someone from this type of thinking and aggression?"
305,Radical acceptance. Your thoughts?,What does this term mean to you?
306,"I want to be spiritual, but am afraid of being psychotic",
307,Venting,"My mental health has never been in control. I've been diagnosed, for sure, with anxiety and depression. I've also scored extremely high for unspecified mood disorders. I came off of my meds last June, which almost cost me my relationship (I went completely manic and had a very bad meltdown). 

Fast forward to now, I'm pregnant, 33 weeks. Still in the same relationship. And I just feel incompatible with the world. Being around people is getting harder, and I feel like a giant burden to my SO, and even my unborn child. He recently opened up about his own demons and admitted he wanted to sleep with other people, and the results of that talk were damaging at the very least. 

I am seeking therapy and actively talking to my OB about a game plan, as I know postpartum is probably going to wreak havoc on my mental health. I just hate myself and I hate my personality and a lot of times I wish I could just start over. There's a lot of times where I don't even want to speak anymore. I feel like I take all of these steps to get better, but in my soul, nothing helps. I still feel very empty and very very sad."
308,lost all enjoyment in life,"i dont enjoy anything anymore, not friends, not videogames, not movies or tv, not anything. my life is turning into hell.. ive enjoyed a game for 4 years running and it just.. sucks now. i see my friends but i dont want to talk to them. i cant do my maths homework properly because i cant get out of bed.  
my education and life is going downhill, outside of education i have nothing to do but sleep and discord sometimes, but thats becoming less so as well.   
what do i do? i dont have any ""parental figures"", as in i have biological parents, but theyre not my \*parents\*. i dont want them involved with any of this  
what do i do? i want to self harm again."
309,Supporting someone with Anhedonia,"Hey, as the title suggests, i just want some advice on supporting someone with Anhedonia (can’t experience joy etc) 

It’s someone i’m seeing, who’s backed off a little due to the present situation with the anhedonia and i was looking at ways to be better for her benefit. 

Thanks in advance!"
310,What's wrong with me?,"Whenever I listen to a song and the background is for example a different culture of a vast landscape I focus really hard on the image itself and end up feeling strange, strange as in emotional. It's  weird for me describe. I don't often feel like this it happens on random days, what does this mean and what causes it?

It's a somewhat good feeling. It's like I'm high but in my head I just get emotional whenever I look at landscape/culture pictures knowing I'll never get there"
311,"I feel like to live a better life is not a decision that you just make once, it's a choice that you have to keep making constantly and consistently everyday throughout the day...","My question is, how do you remember to consciously keep making that choice? How do you keep ""I'll take a break just this once"" from turning into just a spiral back into a bad lifestyle? How do you stay so focused all the time on living a better life, when it's kinda exhausting?

This has been a huge issue for me, because weeks of progress can disappear with just one day of weakness or laziness.

Just for context, I'm talking about keeping up a morning and night routine and meditating regularly, things like that, but I think the question applies to more general situations as well."
312,can’t focus on school cause it feels like the world’s ending,"it’s gonna sound silly but all the chaos going on since the start of this year (coronavirus in particular has had me spooked) has me unable to focus and put as much effort into my studies as I should be. A lot of the work I’ve had to do has felt meaningless for a while, but now it feels even more so. I leave assignments for the day they’re due pretty much all the time. I notice myself unable to take in information as efficiently as I usually do. I’ve had sort of a doomsday mentality pretty much ever since the start of this year. I’ve always had irrational fears of dying when I shouldn’t but now it almost feels like I’m actually preparing for death. I guess I just want to make the most out of my time in case something bad actually does happen this year."
313,I feel like i'm gonna freak out,"TW: talk of self harm/suicide (I think I put this here)


Hey there all, so I have a councillor I go to, and i'm gonna meet this Wednesday and I haven't gone in bit, gonna be back for the first time in like 2 months, anyway, so I wanna tell her about how my mom doesn't sleep in my house and hasn't for like 2+ years, she lives with her bf. My mom is my guardian, and i'm still a minor, i'm 17 atm, anyway I feel it would constitute neglect, cause the whole parental supervision thing is kinda important, like she comes down a good bit, but still if something were to happen who'd be there to help. Anyway, atm I feel kinda calm, kinda like I've accepted it, but I've thought about mentioning it for months and I'd get super stressed and depressed about it, so i'm not sure how i'm gonna act when I finally do say it, cause I feel like this is gonna drastically affect my life, I feel like I kinda have to do it though cause my life isn't going anywhere atm. My family might start to hate me which'll be fun, tbh I amn't great brother, I tend to be super disconnected, and they even make jokes about how unemotional and uncaring I am/come of, but they don't really dislike me atm, but if I messed up my family there's already a good foundation for them to not like me

Also so like when I was younger 14/15 I used to cut myself, I don't anymore, although at times I kinda bite my fingers, like i'll bite down decently strong, and it'll leave a mark for a bit, but I don't break skin, although I don't know if that's self harmey, or not. I've never really been suicidal though, I think about it sometimes, but its never felt like something I'd do. Btw, although I've never felt extremely suicidal, when I was 14/15 went to a psych place a few times, and they told my mom I was depressed and self harming I think, like do you think its a good idea to leave a depressed self harming teen all on his lonesome, idk... I don't really know what's gonna happen, but I might do something bad. the thing is I feel kinda weirdly calm, and a lil bit sad too, like its drastically different to past me who was super anxious. Idk, tbh the thing that's been in my mind a lot that seems the most likely maybe would be impulsive sex, lol, the thing is I've been feeling a lot more sexual, and I seem to have a person who wouldn't mind, but I feel like I'd regret it, like i'm never actually dated anyone or had sex before, so if I did this I'd feel like it'd mess with me for it be my first, also btw, if you're conceded about std/sti stuff, I got some protection, lol. 

But anyway, that's what's been on my mind, I kinda mentioned it on r/offmychest, but this subreddit seems like it might be kinda better"
314,So I guess this is kinda a vent but also and comments from people is welcome :),"Really long vent incoming but I actually have a question for people at the end

Recently I can’t stop thinking about how much time I’ve “wasted”. I’m in the UK btw and I started one year on a college/sixth form course not knowing what I was doing it for, I got too stressed out so changed it after about a year for  an art course thinking I’d like it more. I kinda didn’t and nearly quit it and swapped again for a health and social course as I think I’ve finally figured out what I actually want to do as a job (this course will get me onto a nursing degree). 

Basically I need to pass the course now up until around September as it will look better when I apply to change to the health and social course. The college is luckily being fairly helpful and helping me catch up and so far it’s going a bit better for me. The only problem is I can’t stop thinking about how I’ve wasted 2 years (the time it will now take to finish the health and social course when I start it) and all my friends will be going on the uni courses this year or next year while I’ll be like 20 when I start the nursing degree. 

Then I have to do 3 years of that too and I don’t even feel 100% about nursing as I’m always getting anxiety about if I’m making the right choice (almost irrational thoughts I think) and I just can’t shake this feeling that everything is kinda pointless to do and I’m not going anywhere in life but at the same time everything’s not worth it anyway. It’s weird and exhausting and I just feel really uncomfortable I guess all the time.

I’m also aware before anyone says, that in the long run 5 years of school courses is nothing to the rest of your life and also that the 2 years previously aren’t technically wasted as it took me a while to think about what courses I want to go on. Also because I’ve thought about it more I may end up liking my course and job(nursing is highly likely employable so I’d most likely get a job too) more than some of my friends who I don’t think know what they’re gonna do later with the course. 

Everything just feels empty sometimes and not worth it all together. Idk it’s really hard to explain. Another feeling I’ve had is like there’s something just “off” and you can’t place your finger on it. And it makes me really uncomfortable constantly. Also I know this seems like a strange way to relate this feeling to words but I remember when Michael from vsauce was talking about the uni bombers theory about how technology and the modern day life has come on So quickly that human evolution kinda can’t catch up and it causes some people to just not be able to cope with anything for seemingly no reason. That sounded mental when I wrote that down but seriously it’s kinda how I feel sometimes haha also I probably didn’t say that theory right I’m just remembering it off the top of my head.

There’s a lot of things that I’ve been thinking of doing differently this year. Go on holiday by myself(something that I have no clue about and stress over) also I didn’t find holidays relaxing  last time for no reason in particular so I don’t know what the problem was. I want to maybe take language classes too but I don’t know if I’ll be too stressed out with college to do that as well. I’ve never handled school well for some reason. I wasn’t even bullied or anything like that so I don’t know why I’m like that. All these thoughts really stress me out in themselves because i feel like I “have” to accomplish them even if I don’t like them because I know I’ll feel disappointed in myself if I don’t.

—End thoughts and question?—Anyway I’ve rambled my thoughts onto reddit probably for the first time😂 after this whole text I think I’ve actually had an interesting revelation going on. I wonder if this weird unexplained stress is actually anxiety or if it’s actually something like OCD over thoughts and things?? Idk if anyone will read this but if you do is this like me obsessing over and having intrusive thoughts idk if that’s what OCD is exactly so sorry if I’m offending anyone by thinking it is. 

I know my college said they could offer counselling if it would help me handle the class environment better so maybe if I did that I could ask their thoughts??"
315,Really not in a good place right now,"My dad and I were in the kitchen just now, joking around and insulting each other because that's our relationship. He was cutting vegetables and at one point he turned around and said ""I have a knife, kid, don't say that about my face."" He was joking, but it made me remember something. 6 years ago the school bully pulled a knife on me, and I haven't been the same since. I try not to think about it but so many things remind me of it. So yeah, right now my mental state is fucked. I hate this. I don't know how to deal with it. Honestly I'm not sure why I'm posting this but I am so there you have it."
316,Paranoia?,"I feel like I was seeing someone or something in the mirror of my car. I was scared to get out of my car cause I thought that person/thing was going to grab me once I got out.  I finally got myself inside my house but I'm afraid to go outside by myself since I feel like they'll grab me.

I'm also feeling like I'm in a simulation and that the person/thing is going to end my simulation which would pretty much kill me.

I was feeling fine this morning, so I dont know why I'm feeling like this. I called my campus crisis line and they told me to distract myself."

318,Don't know what to do anymore,"Since i've switched schools i thought that i have everything in control. Felt like i am moving on , forgetting about my past problems and insecurities. I was happy and content ,ready to reach my goals. 

But lately(last two weeks),i've felt broken more,like last year.I am really confused and tired.Cause i am back to square one.

I feel like i am slowly going crazy. I said that i feel healthy to my mom and she is happy. I don't want to upset parents anymore.

I was ill and had to stay at home,i felt so calm and comfortable completing assignments and studying without people bothering me. 
That's the reason why I don't want to go to school again,(because of communicating with people),even though i've socialized and belong to a group of friends. 

It's not for me.

I've been studying hard for 8 months and i can't give up now,i need to keep on doing it. And i know how much my parents work to afford my education, to help me pursue my dreams.How much they love me. But i just don't know what i can do to get rid of these worries.


 I am afraid to let them down,cause my feelings of anxiety and panic are taking over once more. I am afraid to lose control again.

That's the reason why i lost my sleep again.

Please share your experience and advice. I would love to hear your opinion on this problem. I hope that someone can reassure me that everything will be fine,help me somehow cope with it. I don't even have energy to write consistently right now,but i hope someone will understand me."
319,How can I revisit trauma?,"Here me out. It might sound kind of weird.
Sometimes when I'm around a specific person who is very close to me I feel some kind of weird sexuality but that should not be and I immediately focus on something else and feel discusting. And I wonder why this is. And I have a strange feeling that maybe something occured with this person, something very traumatic but I can't remember it. And I wonder if there is a technique how I can revisit the trauma. I don't know how to word it correct I hope you can understand what I'm trying to ask. I just feel so horrible."
320,"not being a ""normal"" person","i don't think i come across as ""normal"" by most people's standards.

yes, normal is subjective.

but then i find i don't click with many therapists since i'm not like a ""standard"" person.

for instance, lots of people my age are loud or dress in a given way. i don't. i'm not shy but then I just fade in. i don't lack confidence either, i just do my own thing. I also just dress in a hoodie, jeans, shoes/trainers/sneakers, and sometimes a cap. i don't do styles or fashions. so because i don't fit a standard in people's minds, i get told lots of shit.

it's actually pretty funny. it doesdn't offend me. it used to but not any more. 

i think it's because of the halo/horn effect. because i don't come across as ""typical"" then it clouds judgments. 

i guess the point here is 10% venting but 90% inspiration too. who cares if a person is ""normal"" or not? I think it's a common theme in self-esteem and mental issues, and provided a person's character doesn't hurt others, then be oneself.

it's funny, and in some ways sad, that people who go to a university for three/four years to study a degree, or even longer if they do a masters/PhD, to not understand how people function at a base level. for me, i just live to get to the same level as everybody else in life. some person with an undergrad or postgrad degree cannot prevent me."
321,How can I be more honest with a therapist?,"Hey everyone,

I've seen a lot of therapists throughout the years, but I struggle to be honest with them. I get very closed off because it's the only thing that's worked for me throughout my 'trauma' and I'm struggling to open up. This leads to my therapists always underestimating me, not that I'm trying to be dramatic or say that I'm much better at diagnosing myself than professionals, but I feel like they never quite understand what I'm going through because I fail to really tell them what it is I'm really feeling or doing. This leads to me just quitting therapy every time, things getting worse, and the cycle repeating itself over and over. Anyone have any tips on how to bypass my stupid instincts? Thanks"
322,I think my depression is getting worse,"I'm starting to not feel like myself anymore. I never really get angry and tend to keep my emotions under control, but yesterday I snapped at a co-worker.

323,Brother Is Losing His Mind (Need Advice),"Hello,

Don’t know if this is the correct forum to post this, but here I go.

Over the past 5 months my brother has been losing his mind. He is in his late 20’s. Symptoms / episodes are:

-He believes he has gone to other worlds where he has learned a lot and says we were there with him
-He believes our neighbors have hacked into his dog’s mind. He has a strong bond with the dog and believes they have hacked him through hacking the dog
-He freaks out if my parents let their dogs off the leash because they are breaking the rules and, by doing so, are hurting his spirituality
-He, at times, believes he and/or his dog are Jesus
-He had an episode where he screamed at my neighbors in the street because he believed they were trying to kill him and my dad (they are not - bewildered all of us)

His symptoms come in waves. They seem to heat up for a week and then he becomes normal again for 6 weeks. We don’t bring up his episodes to him when he is acting normal because we don’t want to agitate him / throw him back into that mindset. We brought him to a psychiatrist but don’t know how good she is at helping him. She diagnosed him with depression and gave him a low dose anti depressant. It helps out but he doesn’t seem to consistently take it. One other thing is that he doesn’t mention any of his episodes when he talks to the psychiatrist- he keeps it secret. The most he he has mentioned is his ‘third eye’. I think he might have  he schizophrenia but would like some advice from this forum. Let me know what are some good options in terms of getting him help / how I can better support him. In Southern California, in case any1 has recommendations. He also smokes weed a few times a week which I am trying to get him to stop."
324,I feel dead inside,"I want everything to stop, i don’t know whats wrong with me but i want everything to stop. I hate the voice in my head telling me to do or not to do things that I’m supposed to do, or telling me how to feel in situations. I don’t want to listen to the voice but I genuinely can’t help it. It’s always there.
I feel like i cant even handle my relationship anymore cause my boyfriend doesn’t understand why i feel certain ways. (Which i don’t want to feel it just happens)My emotions are all over the place, i get very happy over little things then i get very sad over little things, it doesn’t feel normal.

I hope atleast one person understands me if you do please speak to me i dont know whats wrong with me"

328,HELP! Mental breakdowns from overactive imagination,"Hi there!

I'm in need for a bit of advice so I thought I'd tell my story here and perhaps some of y'all could help me out with a wise word or two.

As long as I remember I've always had a very active imagination. I can't say I've always suffered because of it because it gave me a very interesting childhood, but it also had its huge downsides. I used to have terrible insomnia out of sheer fear because I would see creatures and people in my bedroom or sense their presence. My parents never believed me, rational people as they are, and honestly now, many years later I can't say I believe me either even though I remember many of those moments clear as day.

I used to have a hard time in kindergarten and middleschool since I would constantly be either tired from the previous night or dreaming and not paying attention. My teachers suspected ADHD but in a small community like the one I'm from it's not really a thing to just go and get diagnosed. You keep it under and deal with it. 

Anyways, I'm past that period now, 18 and finishing my senior year in high school. I could say things have gotten better since I don't have much trouble with sleeping about 80% of the nights and I've kind of learned to force myself to focus. The remaining 20% is what I'm here for because sometimes it gets really bad. I'm gonna describe my most recent episode (?) and let y'all be the judges.

I'm renting a room with my roommate near school and that day I got there a night before her so I knew I would be alone all night. Everything was fine for a while: i lit some candles, turned off the big lights and on the christmas lights and settled down to enjoy a book. Then, I realized that I needed to use the bathroom and that's when everything went south. On my way back I passed the two empty showers and after catching a quick glimpse at one's half-open door I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was right behind that door looking at me. Of course, having lived with this kind of stuff for 18 years I knew that it was probably just a feeling and I tried to calm myself down but I couldn't stop constantly looking over my shoulder the whole way back. I got to my door and almost ran the last few meters until i had safely closed it behind me but even despite that I could feel the panic bubble up. What if someone's already in my room. I looked at my closet and my hands started to shake. I quickly opened the door but nothing was there besides a sweater I had left there last week. I then turned back and started going towards my bed, then gasped and tripped over a chair trying to turn around. For about a second I was certain that in the reflection of the window I saw a very skinny woman stand behind me. By the time I got to my bed I wasn't even thinking clearly anymore and my brain's only remaining function was the fight or flight mechanism.  I curled up by the wall in the corner of my bed just staring blankly in front of me trying to not look at any dark spaces (especially the window) that could trigger a new wave of panic. I couldn't even close my eyes because I was certain that the monent I do that there will be someone standing next to me staring at me without me being aware and I couldn't risk it. I know that's never happened but i moments like this I always excuse these thoughts with ""there's a first time for everything"". 

Anyways, I eventually calmed down and even managed to go to sleep but stuff like this keeps happening and I don't know how to control it. I know it doesn't sound too bad written out like this but during the moment itsef it feels like my life is on line and this is the moment I die. Even writing it now keeps triggering those tiny panic attacks (for example I'm terrified of closing my laptop right now because my brain is certain that it will reveal a terrifying face or smth behind it). 

Has anyone had a similar experience or could direct me to someone who has? Anything helps, even if you're just guessing!

Thank you and so sorry for the long post!

329,SnapBack to depression and desires and lust?,"Hi.. my names Tanner.

I have an ex I’m partially fond of, this ex always meant a lot to me and had this child like wonder about everything. I checked there gram and found they had gotten with someone else and had moved into and gotten there own house....  I’m with someone of one year now whom I’m very very happy with, but for some reason seeing this has made me feel.. alone, like I’m missing out on something I should be apart of... i just don’t know what to do... any advice?"
330,this is hard,"i'm unwell. i am very stressed. and very anxious. i feel strange. i had a bad dream about my relationship. i am having a lot of bad feelings and thoughts. i'm dizzy. i'm tired. yesterday she said she feels like nothing was worth it. that hit me so hard. nothing was worth it? in the whole time you've been alive, nothing was worth it? nothing? i put so much work and energy and time and love into taking care of her. and i try so hard to be strong every day for her. even when i'm feeling at my worst. i still try my hardest to help her. and nothing was worth it? my head hurts. i'm dizzy. i haven't been taking my meds. i should be allowed to be selfish. i'm lightheaded and i'm tired. my body feels weak. i slept in today. i hate sleeping in. but i'm so tired. i need to go get an energy drink. maybe a few."
331,I hate how my mental state makes it hard to even do simple things like showering,This is a hush hush topic. I don't really see anyone talking about it. I hear that it's common but I've never felt comfortable talking to a therapist about it. It makes me feel so awful even though I look put together when I leave my house
332,The Loneliness Within is the Hardest Part,"How do you go on when that empty pit you feel continues to grow no matter how many times you reach out? How is it possible to connect when you feel the most alone when surrounded by people? How is it possible to find a way to be happy alone when alone is all you feel? 

This is a kind of poem, or journal... I know the only answer is to believe that you can. It feels like I have only been truly existing since this year... I recently increased the dose of my prescription and it feels like this person within who was hiding for so long is finally coming to the surface. But he is sad, and so, so tired. Sometimes he feels a sense of accomplishment and hope he never thought possible. Sometimes he lies in bed for entire days. He is raw and afraid. He feels life with a new sense, as if feeling it for the first time. He realizes how good happiness feels. And he realizes how terrifying hopelessness feels. And he is afraid, because the hopelessness feels like a familiar friend."
333,Can you develop Autism as an adult?,"I never had many issues growing up except for thinking a little differently, being quirky on some things (ex: I can't eat produce that have stickers on them), and being really good with shapes and patterns (ex: I can walk outside and find 20 four leaf clovers almost instantly, because they look like squares versus triangles).

Autism is being talked about a lot more since I was a kid, so maybe I just never noticed it, but as an adult I've been noticing other small signs. Like I can NOT handle loud noises, eye contact is uncomfortable, and I have trouble making and maintaining close friendships. I also miss social cues alllllll the time, mostly when people are kidding or joking with me.

I tried to research, but everything I've seen says it starts in the younger years. A diagnosis isn't necessarily important to me, but I feel like if I knew, it would help me understand myself a little better, as well as help myself not get so frustrated with myself over my weird quirks. Can it develop into early adulthood?"
334,Can I take action against this facility?,"I (17F) went to a counselor for the first time in August (was 16 at the time). Disclosed that I had intrusive suicidal thoughts, and she said I had to either agree to go to an inpatient facility, or she could call the police to take me there. I agreed, as I had no choice.

The place she sent me to was like a prison, suicidal and homicidal teens in the same unit, they took away things they said I could bring, strip-searched me upon arrival, and would strip-search everyone in the unit if there was a single marker missing. Allowed me one phone call to my parents only, and as soon as I started telling them about what was going one, someone came and took the phone away (listening from another phone?). Said I would have an hour of visiting time with my parents only, once a week, but I only got to see them for about 15 mins. The staff let us watch movies such as Suicide Squad and let us listen to uncensored rap music. They had us do coloring sheets about our feelings, and didn't offer any actual psychiatric support. During a ""group therapy"" session, we were asked what we'd want to know if we could know one thing. Someone said they wanted to know when a certain person would die, and the ""psychiatrist"" laughed and agreed. 

I now struggle with severe PTSD from being there and it has impacted so much. I'm far worse off now than I was before going there. Is there any sort of action I can take against them for this?"
335,Am I normal or is something wrong?,"I’m assuming this is all just hormones, and it probably doesn’t mean anything, but here we go.

Currently, I’m 14 years old. I’ve hated myself since 3rd grade. In 3rd grade, I was, to put it simply, fat. I used to look in the mirror and tell myself: “you’re fat and ugly. You’re fat and ugly. You should kill yourself.” every time I’d see knives I’d have the urge to take them and stab myself.


But that was in 3rd grade. Over the years, I still didn’t like myself that much, but I’m changing, of course. My physical appearance looks better than before, for sure, yet I still call myself fat and ugly when I’m not looking. I still have that idea stuck in my subconscious that I’m this disgusting creature and I don’t know why. 

I hate my own feelings the most. I call myself pathetic and worthless. I say that other people have it worse than me, that I don’t deserve to feel this way. I tell myself I deserve to suffer. But... I’m not suffering. I don’t even feel sad, I’ve just gotten used to the bullshit I spew to myself. Hell, if I’m calling it bullshit then nothing is wrong, right? I’m self-aware enough to know none of this is true, and yet.... I’ve accepted it. I can still feel happy sometimes. I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel sad. I just don’t feel sad. But I know I’m not numb.... I know what being numb feels like, and this isn’t it.

There was a few events more recently in my life that sparked a lot of these feelings for me.

Last year, a kid (who shall remain unnamed) got nudes out of me. He had been begging for some since january, and on valentine’s day night, I gave into his requests. I *knew* I shouldn’t have, but I’m just as dumb a kid as him. I ended up telling some people I shouldn’t have, and he got involved with the police a bit (he was 14, I was 13). He was scared out of his mind. 

Afterwards, I pitied him. I pitied him so much that I became *infatuated* with him. For a little over 4 months, I was madly in love with him, with no real reason why other than pity. There was an on-and-off  of him sending me nudes and me sending some in return. I felt used each and every time, but I kept coming back to him because just getting a message from him made me happy. Then again, just getting a message from him *also* shocked my body full of anxiety. 

Then, in july, I met *them*. My first ever partner. Only four days after I met them, they and I started dating. I’d finally escaped those feelings I had for that one kid! I felt so fucking happy. But even so, when I was with them, I was almost constantly anxious that they’d leave me, or that they didn’t love me, or that they would cheat on me. Not because of anything they did, no. They were actually quite reassuring and always very sweet to me. 

Until late november. They broke up with me.... And it honestly crushed me. I felt so lost, hurt, and hopeless. I loved them from the bottom of my heart. For a month, I cried. For the next month, I didn’t have the will to cry. I just tried to be there and support them as a friend, as currently they’re going through such a tough time figuring out their gender. 

Very recently, any time someone asks how *I’m* doing, I just say “decent.” because honestly, I *have* been feeling decent. Much better than before. I still don’t like myself, though.

I still tell myself things. Things that I’ve come to accept without hesitation or tears.

No one loves me. Out of 7.7 billion people, not a single one cares. I’m pathetic, worthless. I’m too god damn pathetic to even hurt myself! I don’t deserve to feel pained, yet I don’t deserve real happiness, either. I don’t deserve these emotions anymore. I shouldn’t still be in love, if I even am anymore. But at the same time, I’m so selfish for trying to get over them. I’m selfish for trying to better myself. Can’t I see that so many other people have it worse, and that they deserve more attention and care than I do? My “problems” mean nothing in comparison. My “problems” mean nothing without even having to be compared!

Maybe.

Just fucking *maybe*.

I need to grow up.

Grow up... Grow up... Grow up... Stop complaining and just *grow up.*"
336,Mood changes/Bipolar disorder?,"I'm diagnosed with a few mental disorders but my key problem is my depression. Since a few weeks I experience extreme mood changes every day! Most of the time I'm in a very good mood, I see almost everything in a positive way, I'm very creative, I'm laughing and talking very much and just enjoying life, although I have the feeling that my mind is exploding because I have so many thoughts and ideas. But at a moment's notice everything changes: I get depressed, I see everything in a negative way, I hate talking to other people and I'm tied to my bed because I feel so powerless. 
I'm very confused with those mood changes because I never had it before in such an extreme way. Are those mood changes just normal for the end of a depressive episode or does this sound like a bipolar disorder to you?"
337,I'm just hurting so much and i'm tired of hurting.,I have no one that cares about me and I don't blame them. I'm so alone. I just feel like i'm drowning in how bad everything feels and no one cares. I don't see a point in going on like this.
338,What if there’s never a good time?,"So, I’ve been struggling a lot recently. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, but I know that I’m suffering from Social Anxiety and I think it’s growing into depression, too. I’m scared that everything’s just going to get worse and I really don’t want to go down that path. I’ve tried all I can to help myself, but it’s not working. So I think I need to tell my mom about it finally since that’s the only way a can think of getting help. I’ve looked up how to tell her about my mental state, and a lot of videos and websites have said that you should find a good time to do it. But there’s never a good time for me. My mom works late and when she gets home she usually stays in her room for the rest of the night(we don’t eat dinner together). Plus, my anxiety and worries make it 10x harder."
339,Need advice regarding confidentiality (UK),"Hi. I'm worried about a friend who is talking about suicide a lot lately. She's 17 (18 in July) and has attempted suicide many times in the past (before we were close friends). Her closest attempt at 14 put her in hospital, where they weren't very supportive and basically told her that others have it way worse. She's been going through a lot lately and I've talked to her about getting help, but she says she doesn't want to until she's 18 as they'll tell her parents about it. Her parents are very unsupportive and emotionally abusive, and after her attempt at 14 her mum basically told her she should've tried harder.

It's been really bad lately. She told me that her suicide isn't a matter of if, but when, and she really needs emergency help. I was wondering whether she could be admitted into a hospital or something? I don't know how much she would like that idea, but maybe it would help. I'm a bit clueless about everything so if there are any better alternatives, please let me know. I just can't have her parents involved because they'll make everything so much worse for her.

So these are my questions:

* Can I (also 17) admit her into a hospital?
* Do her parents need to sign papers? Is there a way to avoid that?
* Could I or my parents or someone else over 18 sign the papers instead?
* Is there any way to get emergency help for suicide without getting parents involved?

Any help would be appreciated. I'm really scared for her."
340,Tired of being,"
If being honest, today is one of those days that everything feels off?  I've got a good life ahead, almost done with school and about To start working full hours and moving to my own apartment and so on, but sometimes out of no where I get these thoughts of emptiness inside me, almost like everything is not going well and things will never be well. Im tired of trying to accomplish things and way too tired to even start, what ever it may even be. Im tired of being that dood who feels insecure all the time and is constantly feeling lonely and sad, sure I go out there and meet People and being social etc but everything still feels so damn insignificant. Thats all... 

I just felt like sharing my thoughts to someone."
341,"I've read that empathy is an emotional feeling which allows us to understand other people's experiences from their frame of reference. I can do the latter in terms of seeing what other people have gone through and how they feel, but there's never an emotional reaction for me. Is that still empathy?","For more context, I generally don't feel any form of pain when others are hurt or in distress, and I don't even feel guilt when I know I'm the one causing said distress, much less regret or remorse. I also feel nothing towards dead people, although I have cried over my pets when they die. I have a conscience and moral code for what is right and wrong partially thanks to what my parents, teachers, and others have told me I should do, but when I violate said moral code, I don't usually respond quite as strongly as how I believe other people might. 

I'm NOT seeking validation by asking this question, but I am curious as to whether or not empathy can exist without emotion given how much I hear that it requires a visceral response.

I have also been diagnosed with social anxiety and generalized anxiety by my psychotherapist, but I wasn't specifically told that any of my emotions towards other people outside of stress/anxiety/fear could factor into either of those issues."
342,Not being able to name a single good thing about myself!,"I was doing this grounding exercise where eventually the exercise needed me to name one thing, just one thing, that I think is a good thing about myself. I almost went into a panic attack thinking about this. Right now I cannot name a single good thing about myself. I do not like the way I look, I have not exercised since 7 months. I have some work related obligations which are keeping me mentally occupied but since there are no real markers except the end of the year submission, I have been procrastinating all along and therefore hate myself for that too. My personal relationships are not going smooth either coz I am so consumed with worrying about work all the time. You get the sense: I am a hot mess and right now I feel so deep into it that I feel like there is nothing I can do to make it right. Nothing at all! I feel so alone because over the years my relationship with friends has also suffered. I am over sensitive and really something difficult to deal with for a long time. I almost feel bad for my partner for being stuck with me. 

I know these are not good thoughts or feelings but I am living with them. Moreover, when I try to analyze the situation in an objective manner it seems more and more true. I am clearly not well and it is such a problem for every one else around me to have to deal with my mood swings and sensitive behavior all the time. It makes sense that they gradually get tired of it and back away. 

I still can't think of a single good thing about myself. :("
343,How to get help,"TW: suicidal thoughts/self harm

I am 18 years old and after nearly 5 years of depression and self harm, I am ready to get myself help. Most people in my life don’t know, especially my family. Honestly, I don’t want my parents knowing that I cut myself and constantly map out my own suicide in my head. I also can’t imagine sitting down and having a serious conversation with them about my mental state because they don’t understand mental health. My boyfriend is very supportive and he thinks I should get help as soon as possible. I told him I want to wait, but I’m really just terrified. The problem is, without my parents I can’t afford therapy on my own. I really just want a diagnosis and medication so I can go to college in the fall without my mental struggles. 

My main question is, who do I talk to for help? Do I set up an appointment with my pediatrician so they can refer me to a psychiatrist? Do I find a psychiatrist on my own? I really don’t know how to go about this."
344,"If this is me, and I need help because no one understands. Where? Dear Lord. Where?","So what I made plans for tomorrow? So what, what I told you today?

Cuz damn I can't make up my mind, and maybe I just don't want to stay.


FUCK, where is my passion? Jesus Christ, where is my fight?

Maybe I had hope for tomorrow, but right now I can't see the sunrise.


I can barely see the me of the future, I can hardly hear myself cry.

The tomorrow I thought would be nearer, in my head seems only a lie.


The further I reach for an answer, less is more and I'm starting to fray.

I thought the sun would be brighter and I thought this would all go away.


The clouds in my head are just darker, and the banks of my heart overflow.

You act like you get it, but quit it.  Because don't act like you actually know.


You can't stop a river that rages, so park your ass at the dam.

Maybe stop and listen a minute, instead of offering all the shit that you can.


I'm errording apart at the seams, the precipice creeps dangerously nearer, and nothing is ever the same.

I slide frighteningly close to the edges, and I fall because I've made my own cage.


Sleep, the sleep, it could come quicker. And the sun it could set everyday.

A rainbow may shine in the darkess, but a dream is just a dream anyway.


My heart will always hurt harder, and tears will fall in each frame.  

It's been a picture I tried to master, in a life that was harder to tame.


Unhappy, unhappy is unhappy.  Change my ""attitude"" was all you could say.


Step back for a second and ponder. Christ,

please shut up your goddamn face.  It would never help me, or ANYONE, so swallow that fucking cliche."
345,"Feel horrible discomfort, stressed and thinking of stuff all the time. Thinking this might be just anxiety or is it possibly obsessive thoughts (or OCD?) over the same stuff on repeat??","I’ve been so stressed out just constantly with peaks of anxiety but after venting in the form of writing idk if it might just be me obsessing over the same thoughts and anxieties on loop sometimes going into “what if” scenarios but other times just thinking of thoughts that don’t really matter on repeat that make me stressed?? 

This probably doesn’t make sense because I’m writing this kinda late and I’m really stressed out for no reason😂 I know I’ve not explained this in depth but what are the differences for things like anxiety and OCD? Sorry if I’ve got OCD completely wrong btw"
346,"Cant win with people, everyone avoids me because of my mental health no matter what I do, accomplish or how much I improve my overall well being","I'm doing everything right - lost 70lbs since attending the gym 3 days a week since the beginning of 2019, managed to start saving while paying down student loans, I try to be social when I can, etc. Still, no one has time for me. I've gone a full year without being asked to hang out, I'm always messaging people first and no one seems to have any interest in me. No matter how much money I have or what I accomplish at the gym, it doesn't make a difference. I used to think there was something wrong with me and that damaged my mental health to the point where I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. So at this point in my life, it seems like I can only enjoy my life and be successful if I disengage and avoid people. Even worse with women, they all come off as dishonest and make me feel inferior so I dont even bother anymore. So at age 24 I have sort of just accepted things for what they are and have decided to focus on financial success and making gains at the gym over prioritising a social life and women. I'm a little optimistic I'll have those things one day but for now they are not my focus. Would you be able to live a life like mine?  

As a disclaimer, I should point out that my gym perseverance has helped with my mental health a lot and my perspective of things. I no longer feel inferior to anyone and don't let other peoples opinions of me that don't reflect the truth, don't reflect reality get to me. People can perceive me how they want but when I don't match up with their description they usually change their tune or face looking stupid I find. Thats how I rise above petty gossip and social cliques. With that being said, I also don't feel superior to anyone and try to have empathy for others when its warranted."
347,My wife has bipolar and recently started hallucinating again and I don't know how to handle it.,"My wife has recently been signed-off work as she is having a long depressive episode. Like last time, she is starting to hallucinate several times a day and at night. She hallucinates that there are people at the house dressed all in black trying to get in. She is adamant they are there, but they are not.  She is medicated and is taking everything she has been prescribed. Lithium, quetiapine and sertraline. 

We are off to see the doctor again tomorrow to try and get some help. 

I just don't know what to do when she does hallucinate, I want to be able to reassure her and help in whatever way I can. 

Thanks,"
348,ngl im not k," hey, im 20yo and just wanted to write in hope i find a solution by myself or stop thinking about it. (sry for my bad english tho)

i usually struggle with social anxiety and burnouts, maybe depression but i never went to a doctor to get a real diagnosis . i dont hate myself but i see no value in me, i draw but recently my art became shitty and messy, i had multiple projects but ended up destroyed. i often have panic attacks before sleeping, cry and then fall asleep of tiredness.

Recently, i lost one of my sketchbook which is like a part of my soul, there were a lot of memories and dear drawings in it. Another of my sketchbooks is at my best and only friend's house but since i had problems with his ex, she teared it up when she found it in his room and my friend is scared to bring it back to me due to the trauma she caused (because of her, i dont trust girls anymore or even people that seem nice at first, i always feel like they'll drop their mask and destroy me like she did). So now i kinda feel really vulnerable 'cause i thought i can forget about her after 2 years trying to forget what she did to me and my friend and maybe forgive her 'cause its useless to keep anger inside me but no. Now im writing 'cause just found out that my friend is into cocaine, and i think its not only occasionally, he used to smoke a lot of weed and now he found out coke can make u feel awake and alive. Im really worried that he gets deep into it 'cause it's not only coke but he also takes ecstasy and speed in parties. I feel shitty 'cause i thought i was bringing him a bit of support and love but guess not (i'll try to talk about it next time i see him, it's not easy since he lives in another city and rarely respond to my messages 'cause he's often busy or with people)

These last two years i cut bonds with barely all the people i know except my best friend and family and i dont feel like making new friends will bring me something good. I thought about going to a therapist, I went to three different psychologists but everytime i give too much informations about myself, i just stop seeing them, i do the same thing with people, it's pretty annoying 'cause i feel like a bad person lol. I'm just really worried about my friend who finally has his own appartement, his job and dreams, I think he suffers from depression but he's the kind of person to forget about himself, he hates taking care of himself or seeing he needs something or that people are worried about him, he thinks he doesnt matter and thats a waste of time to worry about him. For him, it's always people before himself.

But anyway, i just wanted to post that somewhere where people dont know me and thanks for taking the time to read me, yes i need therapy but its hard"
349,i'm having a really hard time,"i'm struggling. so bad. so bad. i'm drinking energy drinks. they taste good. i haven't had my meds for a couple days i think. i'm not sure. i've been taking them on and off. i just get so tired and fall asleep without remembering to take them sometimes. i'm having urges. i want to hit myself in the head a lot. i want to punch myself. i think about watching bread scoring videos to trigger myself. that's not good. this is really hard. i feel unloved. i put in so much work. i can't focus. i don't know where to start on all the things i have to do. i just want to cry. and hit. i don't want to sleep. i want to stay up all the time. which is odd. because if i'm hurting, why would i want to be awake to experience it? because i have all this shit to do. i don't have enough time in the day. i'm struggling so bad right now. things weren't like this before. things weren't so negative. things were different. i just want to be happy again. she's so important to me. i'm being dragged down by so much. i don't want to eat. i don't want to sleep. i have so much to do. where am i going? i want to leave and be by myself. but i have nowhere to go. i don't have money. that limits my options. this is so hard."
350,How do you continue when you realize yourself to be completely and absolutely alone in a place where you do not really like yourself at all?,"Not a reflection, but a serious question. My mental health and pattern of being over sensitive has managed to drive everyone in my life far away. No I find my self absolutely alone, with literally no one to call and talk about the absolute bat sh\*t disaster that is unfolding inside me. Has anyone else been here before? Any practical suggestions to navigate out of this?

PS: female, early 30s, I have family and all but they have too much other stuff to take care and this is not something that can be addressed there.e"
351,Lowering high serotonin,"So I have copper toxicity, which causes high serotonin and low dopamine. Mainly due to high copper levels and low zinc levels, among other things.

Sometimes my serotonin gets so high I get the “electrical shock” sensations I’ve found high serotonin gives me. For example, Busbar causes this issue really bad. I also know it’s high serotonin because when I take my anti psychotic in the evening they go away. And only seem to come on the next evening, and get worse until I take my antipsychotic. Then it goes away.
Raising my dose of my anti psychotic ISNT an option. 
What are natural means of lowering serotonin?
I’ve read shijiat will lowering it somewhere else on Reddit but can’t find any supporting studies online.

Does anybody know anything natural that will help!? Preferably that doesn’t lower dopamine as well
Thanks so much everyone !

If this is in the wrong place please let me know where to post it."
352,Personal Mental Health Blog,"Hi guys, I started a personal blog more so for a hobby and to have a place to write down my thoughts in hopes that maybe someone else would relate to my experiences. It's my first blog, so it's still a work-in-progress, but just wanted to create a space where people could hear my stories, feel connected, and share theirs with me if they wanted to. I'm a 23 year old graduate student studying Clinical Psychology and mental health awareness is a big thing to me. I've been through many different struggles some relatable some not so relatable, but it helps to have a space where I can put it all. If you wanted to check it out, give me feedback, or just chat feel free to visit it :) If this is considered a spam post or anything, feel free to delete it lol

353,Conflict between Actions and Words - Drunk Words are Sober Thoughts?,"Hey, I have been struggling with my mental health my entire life. I have unresolved trauma which is causing me to be angry and lash out at my friends and loved ones. It is to the point where I think i may lose all my friends and my boyfriend - my actions absolutely disgust me. My actions are, when drunk are becoming hateful and mean to almost anything, shutting down, and saying untrue things that come out of nowhere. On top of that, to be completely honest, I have a problem with alcohol as well. I have been using it to cope since a young age. I hide it pretty well but it's obvious in a social setting. I lose complete control and turn into this hateful and mean individual. The other 95% of the time, I have people magnetize towards me because I am a happy, genuine, and joy-filled individual. What makes me happiest in life is cheering up the whole world. Yet, drunk me is a completely different person. I have never had to come face-to-face with my problems because I was never in love. I have now met the love of my life, we are perfect together in absolutely every way. I could not ask for a better individual. He is so kind and patient that he never gets 'mad' about when I behave in this manner, but instead, he just says everything is fine. Everything is not fine to me. I am a 24 y/o who just moved back home after 4.5 years of University. When I first moved away for school, I was so excited to leave my home town,  I never planned on moving home. I then met the love of my life over the summer and everything changed for me. Summer was magical with him. When I went back for my final semester of school, I became incredibly confused because I missed him but also loved the city I was in. Now, I moved home and absolutely hate it. I am living with my parents, broke, and unhappy in every way. It seems like I am actively ruining the whole reason I came back. I am deeply in love with this man and he is sticking by me through this, yet I can't keep getting mad at him. I am going to open up to him about the trauma I did experience. I am tied to the hometown now because I also found a proper job and got re-hired at my summer serving gig which I will work at for the weekends to pay debt. I have all of these jobs lined up, yet, I feel like I no longer can live the reinvented life I had created for myself far away from my history and past transgressions and trauma. 

I know it's lengthy, but please, anyone, Thoughts?"
354,I tell my self I’m not a bad guy everyday in the mirror.,"Okay, for background I’m a guy who’s 16 years old, and I live in Ohio, USA. 

Every morning I wake up and just look in the mirror, and tell my self I’m not a bad guy. I don’t know why, I say the most offensive crap, laugh at videos of people dying online. I lie to my parents and people for personal gain, and I have stopped caring for what people say or think about me. 

In elementary and middle school I was bullied a lot, and I would get called names, get slapped, and humiliated at school. When I got home everyday, I wouldnt tell my parents, all they would do is call the school and complain but, that never really fix anything, just make the bullying worse. Home life wasn’t great either, parents were arguing, it would just be a constant argument everyday, yelling, hitting, and I’d cry and tell my parents to stop but then they’d get mad at me. Over the years I thought of horrible things to do to these people, these bullies, my mom always taught me to never hit anyone, and tell the teachers. But you know what they say in school, snitches get stitches, so I kept my mouth shut.

I have ADHD, and back then it was severe, I would crazy and weird things, and people would laugh at me, medicine never worked, and even had teachers ask me out loud in class if I took my ‘focus medicine’ yet. So I would do outlandish things, just to get people to like me. But as I grew older I realized they were laughing at me, not with me. I feel like all this just built up a shell, it’s hard for me to feel anything, love, empathy, remorse. My friends will tell me sad things happening with them but I have to pretend to feel bad for them, cause otherwise I wouldn’t react in no way. 

I say horrible things and make fun of all groups of people, obviously in a joking way, but these, emotions, and the way I perceive stuff ruins relationships I have with people. I watch shock videos and I don’t feel bad for the people getting hurt or killed in them. I don’t feel anything, I actively search for these just for the ‘shock factor’ of the video. I need help, I don’t know what to do."
355,I just had to vent. No need to read if you don't want to.,"Just for clarification I'm a 15M who lives in UK

Well tomorrow's Monday.
Or as my saying goes ""Another day another misery"".
I'm just going through days, reading/gaming at night and just feeling the same.
I gave up on people and myself.
When I tried to change my life for the better I fucked up.
The only thing that makes me feel is self harm.
Students are just jerks.
I feel like I can't trust anyone.
Whenever I trusted someone I got backstabed.
And now I have only 2 people I can have a conversation with...although I'm probably just irritating to them...
I'm just sicj of people being nice only to tell me I'm retarded behind my back.
I just don't care about them, about myself...about anything...at least I don't want to care about anything.
For some reason no matter how much I don't want to care I still do a bit...
Teachers ignore my problems and my mom just tells me to ignore the bullies and that I'm ""special"" or whatever that's suppose to mean.
I'm a failure as a student, as a son and as a person...
I hate myself/everything...
Why did I think moving to UK would help...why did I give myself hope...I just hate it...
I don't have anyone...I'm alone...no one would listen to me...
The only friends I had I list due fo my stupidity...I'm pathetic...
Gaming/anime/reading and music don't help...they feel...empty...my only hobbies...feel empty....
I have everything I ever wanted(games, etc)...and feel empty, sad and angry...
Well I'll see how it will turn out in 2 months...then I'll probably tell my mom about this...and make her probably sad...
Si can still laugh, smile and chuckle...but only for a couple of minutes...then it's back to the dull me....

Anyway, I just wanted to vent all of the things that make me feel this weird way. Thanks for reading.
(And I can't see a psychiatrist for no reason. Maybe in 2 months I'll tell my mom I should if these problems persist...)"
356,There’s something wrong with me,"I’ve always been a messed up person mentally. I’ve tried to commit suicide , self harmed , had eating disorders, have bipolar disorder, shit on of anxiety disorders, personality disorders , clinical depression and all I have to say is if you really get to know me you can see how unstable I am and how differently I can act everyday because of all the things counter acting with each other. With that being said I think this changes people in my life. Almost every single person in my life takes advantage of me in any sort of way. To be a mental crutch, do things for them, buy things , do things I don’t want to do so their not lonely. My last boyfriend used me as much as he could and he wasn’t always like that (although he was very abusive) . I’ve had best friends use me to the point where I snapped and never talked to them again. My parents constantly go to me for things they need  and expect me to be there immediately or else I get screamed at or punished. I have heavy trauma and I’m constantly in a ptsd environment because I’ve consistently been treated like this for 18 YEARS. A lot of people don’t know why I am the way I am ( paranoid , I have a lot of severe break downs throwing shit , breaking things , screaming , chaotic panic. Memory loss, not being to leave my bed for minutes hour days or weeks). I’ve tried to talk to people about but I can’t ever get it out when people ask there’s just so much shit I have been through it would take me hours to tell it all. I honestly don’t know how I have people in my life because I can’t but look at myself like a monster. It’s like someone new comes into my life to save me and they always just end up like everyone else because I made them like everyone else. It’s doesn’t matter how pure your intentions are in the beginning but somehow everyone in the end will find themselves using me , emotionally abusing me and straight up no good to be around each other. Does this happen to anyone else ?  Do I blame myself or the other around me , do I even blame anyone or just life ?"
357,i dont know what to do anymore,"I cant find a job or apprenticeship here in my area and i dont know why,all my relationships have fallen apart or just died out.

358,My mood swings are like January of 2020 for no reason. Need help. What can I do ?,"\*Cant post on r/needadvice cuz of karma\*

Hello, I’d like some help with answering my questions on what the f is happening with me for some last weeks.

I was always on this neutral mood, somewhere between happy-sad-angry, rarely getting some other feels. Month ago, somehing just gave a stop to this.

\*Side note, this is like the fourth time I’m asking for help on Reddit, everytime I asked for help, I got told to fuck off and that it’s my bussiness and me being a retard. Please, if you dont like me or this post, then dont comment, I will really appreciate that and I dont want to hear any negative thoughts on myself in fear it will just destroy my mood just like basically everything at the moment.\*

Yeah, neutral mood... For lets say, last 4 weeks, I just can't stop being sad, and I mean, I don't have a single reason to be sad. It was really confusing to me at the beginning, and I didn't know why. Yet, I'm still confused, but I do not even care why, I'm just ok with it. I was always a very active person, jumping around, talkative, extroverted af, but maaan, fuck. I just lie in bed barely moving, I can stare at one point for half a hour a somehow stay entertained by it. Even if I am hungry or thirsty, I can't get up, like wtf why would I do that? I just can't do anything. Food tastes bad, I can't do homework, I'm not entertained by ANYTHING, not even gaming can solve it, but guess what, staring blankly is a fun town party.

I am still being humorous and trying to keep optimistic about it, but I can't escape that sad mood, I cannot, I'm aware of it, but I cannot solve it, It's generated from thin air or somethin.

My mood swings are like rollercoaster. Sad, Angry, Sad, Happy for 10 min, Angry... and again, again

I just want my mood to be ok again, what can I do ?

This weekend, I have done some philosophy stuff, just because phone was my only friend and there were some juicy ytb videos.

Guess what? Gold mine, I was enthusiastic, happy, just like before, but even more. It was a really great time, but fast forward 2 days... ""Imma kms mood again.""

I'm sorry if this post is somehow scattered around, but I just type what I think about and I am really sleepy and want to get it done quickly.

I want go visit some psycho..something person to tell me what could it be or some tips on how to deal with it.

I struggle with some more personal stuff too and I do not want to talk about it here, but it's nothing serious, it's just that I have no one to talk to, I feel left out, maybe that's the main reason ? I get way more happy when someone talks to me. I just miss someone who would care for me for the most part I guess, but I'm not sure, still.

Do you have some experience with people just being sad and able to do nothing ? Please help, I am afraid of it getting even worse and I do not want that."

Thanks for your time!"
360,Wtf is wrong with me ? Why do i feel like my life is a living crisis ? I want to die but do I really? These questions fill my head 24/7. I need help.,
361,Social beings 🤔,"So having moved yet again I find myself back on square one. It's refreshing yet annoying. What's annoying is, this time around I'm staying in touch with the people I left and haven't exactly tried to seek for people here. Also this seems to be a tough crowd and I seem to be more pedantic about my company. I have always made friends like good friendship either with work friends or flatmates. Flatmates are but shite tbh like wil almost ignore. And haven't found work yet sooo... Yeah. Also uni people seem kinda hesitant hanging out 1 to 1, apologies if this sounds likw not a problem, problem. It's just I can see this aspect affecting me and not in the most positive manner, we are social beings afterall."
362,Can someone help md,I attempted suicide and everyone looked past it like it was nothing I’m so sad can someone let me know they care and treat me like a human even if they don’t mean it I hate having to do this but I need a reason to go on I’m shaking I’m so upset I can’t do thisssss
363,I bottle up everything to avoid losing people,"I used to have a great friend. We would talk about any and everything. No limits. No boundaries. 


Until last September when we split up. And now I refuse to tell people about the tiniest of problems I have. I just try to lighten up conversations and I make self-depreciating jokes. 


I want to tell people about how I'm struggling to maintain good mental health, but I'd rather just lie. I'm tired of losing friends. I can't keep introducing myself to new people if they keep disappearing so fast."
364,Should I ask for a new Therapist?,"I don’t want to go into too much detail but I’ve recently had my first session with a new counsellor. I was referred for talking therapy at the beginning of last year. I hadn’t received any documentation or had any correspondence from them until last week, despite repeatedly chasing them up. 

Prior to this appointment, I’d filled in two forms, to summarise how I’d been feeling for the last two weeks &amp; to determine if I had a good support network. First of all, she forcefully suggested I change the answers on the first form (about my feelings). I had considered all of my answers very carefully &amp; I was confident that it truly represented my feelings. She picked up on my answer to the last statement. “I feel like I would be better off dead or hurting myself in some way.” I had chosen “nearly every day.” I explained that I often struggle with suicidal thoughts (roughly every 2-3 days) &amp; I have considered how I would do so. She replied that, as I hadn’t made any plans to take my life &amp; there were preventative factors (such as me not wanting to leave family behind), I was not considered suicidal. 

She didn’t even glance at the second form. She handed me a third form entitled “How to keep myself safe if I’m feeling suicidal.” She could tell I was finding it difficult to fill in, but she just sat &amp; waited whilst I contemplated my answers. She didn’t offer any help, nor did she talk. There was complete silence, which was very uncomfortable. 

I didn’t want to disclose too much at the first appointment as it takes me a while to learn to trust anybody &amp; I wanted to try to summarise my mental health issues. Whilst I was enclosing some of the minor issues, she kept sighing (I imagine this was out of sympathy). I mentioned how my family can be rather toxic &amp; are very negative. I didn’t mention the verbal or physical abuse at home, or the constant worry I’m at risk. I would not feel comfortable talking about the more-in-depth struggles I face. I mentioned how I come from a broken family &amp; it was established that I have very low self-esteem. On multiple occasions, she told me I was “too sensitive,” &amp; “it’s all in (your) head.” 

At the end of the session, she demonstrated a couple of mindfulness techniques (such as slow breathing through the nose &amp; stretches I could try). She gave me another form to fill in, which asked me to “rate” my session. These questions were included:

“Have you been informed of the different talking therapies we offer?” 
“Have you been offered the talking therapy you feel is best for yourself?” 

At no point did she explain what options I had, nor did she make any suggestions as to a potential diagnosis, or even inform me of the next stage. All she said was “I’ll see you in two weeks.” 

I don’t have any friends to talk to about any of this, but my boyfriend &amp; colleagues are horrified. They say I need to log an official complaint before others have the same experience as me. 

I came out, in floods of tears, feeling suicidal. I can’t stop thinking about what she said. I’m constantly asking myself (&amp; my boyfriend) “am I too sensitive?” &amp; quoting that “it’s all in my head.” I can’t forget what she said. I am not a violent person, nor would I feel able to inflict any serious injuries on myself. I am really squeamish &amp; hate the sight (or thought) of blood. I wanted to smash my face in with a brick. I wanted to inflict enough damage for myself to die instantly. It took my boyfriend hours to console me. 

I’m absolutely devastated that I waited nearly 12 months for this session, to feel worse than I did (which I didn’t even think was possible) &amp; want to give up on trying to recover. What would you do if this happened to you?"
365,What gave you hope and strength when you didn’t have any left?,"I have always had hope that one day I’ll get better and even when I’ve had no strength left, I’ve always managed to tell myself that one day it won’t be this bad but a couple of weeks ago, something in me snapped and I have literally no hope left. I am exhausted and fed up of bouncing between the GP, the hospital, different medications and different therapies. I used to think it would take as long as it did but now I cannot even imagine staying another week if it means feeling like this. 

I’m so desperate. 

Please tell me some things that gave you hope when you physically had none. I need one thing to hold onto that I’m not able to then convince myself that I don’t deserve or it’s not meant. 

Please."
366,"I don't know where else to turn, my life is collapsing around me and I'm not ready to move on","A parent of mine was arrested for doing something awful, I've tried to suck it up and be there for everyone but my anxiety is breaking me apart. My education isn't stable because I'm homeschooled, nothing is stable, not even money or a place to live. I'm scared, no, I'm terrified of what's going to happen. I can't contain all of this. For some reason my physical health is declining now too, as well as my tolerance for anything going wrong. Sometimes I think how easy it would be to just fade away into the abyss, life loses all meaning once you start getting existential. I just wanna be a normal 15 year old without having to worry about all of this shit and being so 'special'."
367,I have never been mentally stable,"Hi

I have a decent life and a lot of good things in it. But when I think about it I have never truly been happy or totally okay. I have seen lots of therapists and tried so many ways to become happier. But at the end of the day I am very depressed. Some of it stems from a lot of negativity and issues within my family and a lot of it is from self hatred and low self esteem. I feel like I have tried all I can think of and I feel so very lost. I want to enjoy life while I am young and build real relationships but my depression gets in the way of all of that."
368,Anxiety medication,"Hello guys I am wondering if any of you have ever taken propranolol for anxiety?. And how it has helped or affected you? 
I am a little skeptical about taking medication due to it lowers your blood pressure. But my fear is that what if my blood pressure is normal and I’m experiencing some anxiety and I take this pills how  bad would affect me or it would won’t be that bad? I have never taken any kind of anxiety medications so I’m a little scared."
369,What should I have done about my mom's boyfriend?,"Ok I'll try to make this as short as possible. My parents always had a rough relationship, my dad would sometimes accuse my mom of being unfaithful but she never was. And well we're Mexican and we take accusations like this very seriously. Throughout my years I would at times not hang out with friends(I didn't have much friends to begin with) from school because I always had this nightmarish thought that one day I would come home and find my mom dead. And more so since my dad on two occasions had hit my mom and was afraid that one day he might go too far. So I would deprive myself of special moments just to ensure no harm would come to my mom. My mom believes that my dad has trust issues based on previous relationships. And so one day my mother began the divorce process with her lawyer, this was back in Sept of 2015. And so my mother began acting strange, she began locking herself up in her room and didn't want nobody to touch her phone. This is something she never did before until she began the divorce. I always told her that If she would one day file for divorce and find love in another man that she should make sure that he was a worthy man. She started working in Apr of 2015 in a food and beverage warehouse filled with mostly Hispanics, and I also had worked there with her for a few months while I was off from school in the summer, and knew the majority of the people there. So in December 2015 I was getting ready to go to Mexico for 1 month to spend the holidays there with family(Mom's side) my mom would meet me there in a few days and my dad would stay here with my young brother. But before I left I asked my mom what was going on with her, and asked If she was already seeing somebody. She denied it but I was positive she was already ""Seeing"" somebody and I was sure that it was somebody from her job, but I didn't have the proof and didn't want to seem like I was following in my father's footsteps. So on new years I finally peeked at her phone, and saw who she was texting. The guy is some Honduran who has a reputation of bedding women. When I met this guy at work  I would get an odd feeling from him, and well I don't trust the guy one bit and for good reason. So I was a bit drunk and confronted my mom about him in front of other family members and told her why I didn't trust the guy and why  she was falling for a nobody like him. Afterwards I apologized to everybody about the little debacle, and the next day my mom left because she had to return to the US because of work. When I returned 3 weeks later our once close relationship began deteriorating quickly. We barely spoke and she would at times take her anger out on me about things that i had no involvement in. I figured she was punishing me for not accepting her boyfriend. On one occasion I actually overheard a phone call between her and the guy and I kid you not he was telling my mom that I was crazy and that I am a threat to their happiness, and that she should kick me out the house. So basically he was filling my mom's head with lies. And I decided to give him a call one day that If he keeps filling my mom's head with lies that I would personally kick his ass, and that same day my mom threatened to have me locked up in jail I if laid a finger on him. I would at times talk with my grandmother(My mom's mom who was like a 2nd mother to me) on the phone, and tell her everything that was happening, and would advise me that I should just start accepting things as they were. But I refused because I wasn't about to let some opportunistic snake come into my mom's life just to have his way with her. Then in late Feb 2016 I was crying remembering what a close relationship my mother and I used to have, and well I made the mistake of posting about it on Facebook. I deleted it like 2 hours later but it was too late around that time and my grandmother informed my mom about it, and they were both livid. When my mom got home she gave me her phone and said that my grandmother wanted to talk to me. And well she called me a POS and told me that I can no longer count on them and hung up on me. I figured my mom had also been feeding my grandmother the same lies that she was being fed and In the following day my relatives started deleting me from their friends list on FB. I was literally alone, and had to nobody to go to. And for 2 years I was a walking pit of anger and depression. I still to this day can't believe everything that happened. The imbecile is no longer dating my mom because he cheated on her with a younger woman and impregnated her(Just as I had predicted), and my mom and I have tried to rebuild our relationship, and so have my relatives with me. But so far it's like trying to fix broken glass. Because of that guy I became an outcast and missed out on and lost SO much. Because of him I didn't get a chance to see my great grandfather(Whom I love very much and was never aware of what happened due to his health) once more before he died, because of him I missed out on seeing my baby cousin grow up and possibly sharing good memories with her. Because of him my family turned against me when all I wanted to do was to protect my mom. I have told a few people everything that happened and they've all said the same thing, that I should've kicked his a\*\*. What do you believe I should have done at the time?"
370,"I don't know how to cope (TW: MENTIONS OF RAPE, ABUSE, SUICIDE, AND DEATH)","Things in my life are both good and bad right now. Good because I'm in college and doing relatively well, I have a boyfriend that really cares about me and friends I can lean on. Bad because my mother is dying of stage 4 cancer, I was raped a few months ago, and on top of all of that I have an extensive history of extreme childhood trauma that I'm constantly battling with. 


Some days, I feel great and none of the bad things bother me. Other days I cannot function. I cope by drinking, smoking weed, vaping, and having sex. I am constantly looking for something to give me a hit of dopamine. 


I just want to feel okay. I want all these things in my life to disappear so I can be successful. Because right now I can barely get out of bed. The other day I almost took my life. Luckily I had people get me out of that. But I don't know how to tell my professors I'm struggling without seeming like I'm making excusses for not doing my work. I don't want to drop out but it's so very hard right now. I just don't know what to do anymore. Any advice on how to talk to professors would be appreciated. I'm also in disability services at my college so maybe they can help? I need to be better like, tomorrow so I can actually get school work done. Because I feel like a failure."
371,how do i know how bad my pain is,"since all I can do is decribe my pain to other people (emotional and phyical), how do I know if my pain is serious or if im just over reacting. I have anxiety but it tends to only have the symptoms of dissyness, nausa, heart plapatations, racing mind, and shortness of breath. that might sound like a lot but they rarely happen all at once and I never can tell if my anxiety is a normal amount or if im going through something.

I don't want to have my anxiety hold me back from doing homework and school work and other stuff but it frequently clouds my mind and common techniques to lower it such as positive thinking and breathing and mindfulness and phyical movment don't do nearly enough.

I cant tell what type of anxiety problem I have if I have one because it isn't hard hitting enough to be panic attacks (I think but I could just be pushing through the panic attacks) but it isn't consistent enough to be any other type of disorder.

I need a way to be able to compare my pain and anxiety so I know when to push my self and when to not. how to I get a reference for the amount of pain and anxiety im in?"
372,I don’t know where to begin...,"I’m somewhere in the Philippines. I grew up in an abusive household. My dad was an addict and home life was very unstable. I jumped from one school to another, and did not have problems until I was in college. My dad died when I was 14, and it was my mom who just raised me and my 3 siblings after that. She had depression, but managed to get through it with some help of social workers. I graduated with a SW degree, because she thought being exposed to people in particularly bad situations would help me get through my anxiety. This only made it worse though. After I graduated, I wasn’t able to get out of the house for about a year—fearing the worst of everything. I went through a very alcoholic stage for most of my college years, and never stayed sober when I graduated. I had trouble sleeping, and took strong opiates to calm my nerves every time I went out. My family had me checked, and a psychiatrist gave me anti-depressants and anti-epileptics to help me sleep. The meds doped me out, but I couldn’t function well. I quit medication and found a job. I was—in a way—happy. I found my fiancee now, and have a beautiful 6 month old baby. But every time I drink, I would black out. I would just wake up with a broken nose, broken things, because I had lost all senses when I was drunk. My fiancée told me I had attempted so many times to kill myself. I look happy, but deep down inside, I still can’t wait to die. I hurt my fiancée because of my rage when I was drunk. I am planning to stop my drinking, but is there anyone who can tell me what’s the best intervention to this? Thanks"

376,I dont know whats wrong,"for the past 3 months ive been feeling off, and I dont know whats wrong. I am also going to add a TW for ED's up front as well.

First, I dont want to self diagnos cuz thats dumb, but my problems are also not important enough for a therapist, ya know? Just want to write gibberish about my problems because idk

It all kinda started in november, im homeschooled and that month I started skipping math and lying to my parents about it. I also skipped a whole week of school , and started getting behind on my lessons. That intense procrasination has effected my school work to this day. But basically, i also started dieting and losing weight, but i dont have an ed but like idk im still in that headspace of ""your a piece of shit, just starve."" but i dont, cuz my parents basically force feed me now, and i always end up binging on food at like 11 pm anyways. But, in december i cried like evryday, and I came to the conclusion that everybody fucking hates me, and that im boring, and ya know, im the friend that ppl just bring along. I'm very insecure I guess. I was also SUPER LONELY cuz i hadnt been around ppl my age like 4 months prior to december. Now im with friends like 4 days a week. 

School just isnt working out, and I keep getting behind on work, i keep procrastinating. I legit started crying when i was trying to write an essay, like tf. and at night a feel like a weight on my chest and its so weird. also, so im not suicidal or anything, but i dont care if i die. if i were to be shot in the head at this instant i wouldnt care, but my hand would be no where near the trigger. I have happy outbursts, but then I just dont feel anything. During the day im fine, but at night i just crumble in a way. I know these arent very serious and its probably just teenage angst but idk im not going into super detail but I also dont know how to explain my emotions - even to myself. It's like my brain is hiding its emotions from itself, and when i cry is when it actually allows itself to look in the mirror and see its mess. During the day, im happy right? But i feel like im lying to myself, but there I am laughing! So, im not. my brain wants me to think i have a problem, i probably just want attention like i dont even know. i feel like shit, but maube im not pretending to be happy, but actually pretending to be sad? i dont know how im feeling, or if its fake, i dont think it is, but then i do. sorry for this mess, and a dumb teenagers ramblings"
377,I try so hard to be happy...but it’s not going great,I try lose weight people make comments I try to mentally get better it’s not good enough I try to stay positive and have a good mind set but I never had a good mind set to begin with at this point I’m not even trying for myself just for other people and to stop some of the negative comments even the ones that come from myself.... I know I don’t want to die I just want the pain to stop but at this point I’ll pay someone 2020 is definitely not my year already you know it’s bad when people are choosing the foot ball game over you I guess I just suck

381,"How to help a friend who refuses help, or how to not be their friend anymore?","This may be complicated, so bare with me. 

My (22F) friend (21F) is extremely mentally ill. Obviously I am not a doctor so this is completely my opinion after knowing them for nearly 2 years now. 

Here are some things they’ve done/said:
— Sent a picture of their self harm, then refused to let me or another close friend come over and take them to a drop in clinic
— Made consistent jokes about suicide (We’re both college students, and unfortunately this is a common thing to do however their “jokes” have a serious, morbid undertone)
— They recently told me their friend was gaslighting them, this is what they said about this: “just like telling me that I was too sick to do anything and that I needed to stop doing everything because I was too sick to function and that I needed to not go to classes and stop this meeting I have been waiting to have and would not have happened in the first place without me and telling me I need to throw it away bc im unwell and can’t handle it”
— They are constantly physically ill: pneumonia, mono, general cold, body or muscle issues, you name it. And they refuse to go to the doctor, even when they’ve been throwing up for more than 24 hours. When this ill, they will constantly text horrific updates that consist of “just threw up for the 3rd time in an hour but going to this meeting anyway”. When you tell them “hey maybe stay home” they claim that they can’t because xyz is important but will continue to complain about how much pain they’re in. 
— Speaking of illness/pain, they are always doing worse than you. If you text them about a crappy day you had, they one up you with their crappier day. Recently I told them I had food poisoning so I couldn’t hang out, and their response was “well I’ve had a fever for 4 hours”
— We’re both in school. They are always complaining about having too much to do or being behind, which is valid school is hard! Except they will say things like “I was asked to do this thing but I don’t have time and it’s not something I like” and then will proceed to do that thing and complain about it. They will go on and on about failing a class and be like “but I have an A right now”. If you’re overwhelmed with school, you can bet your ass they will tell you they’re more overwhelmed. 

I could go on but hopefully you get the picture. This of course does not account for their great qualities that made us friends in the first place. They do check in and see how I’m doing and have comforted me when I’ve been in a rough place. They can be fun to work on creative projects with. Lately though their declining mental health has made me distance myself from them. I won’t respond to texts where they are complaining, and they will continue to send me a barrage of messages complaining even when I don’t respond. The one time I’ve been firm with them about getting help, they blew up on me and said I made everything worse and I act too much like an entitled therapist and I needed to f off. I have tried more gentler approaches but honestly ya girl is tired and has to prioritize herself! 

My friend will not, on their own account, go to any sort of doctor, mental health or otherwise. I’ve always said they’d have to be kidnapped and taken there. But dear god they need SOMETHING. I completely understand that you can’t force anything on anyone, so reddit, what are you supposed to do when your friend needs help but refuses?

I am already distancing myself from them but I feel guilty when I get hit with an “I miss you” text. I’ve been only hanging out with them in small doses, in controllable situations. I know that this is a reason other folks aren’t friends with them and I’m one of maybe 2-3 close friends. Is it wrong if I just completely let them go?

When you had a friend like this, what happened? I want to hear all your stories, good, bad, and ugly. Thank you in advance."
382,New Here,"Hello, I am new to this community. I suffer from schizophrenia (more specifically schizoaffective disorder). I was told the specific branch I have is pretty rare. I was wondering if anyone here also suffers from schizophrenia or something similar and if you do, what do you do to cope? Sometimes the voice inside my head drives me insane and lead me to break. Also I feel that my disorder is progressively getting worse. Sometimes there are multiple voices which is something that started recently. I have started having nightmares every night and dread going to sleep. Also visual hallucinations have started as well, things out of my nightmares such as shadow men and spectres. I see these things while I'm awake. I want to stop this and learn how to cope better. Any advice is appreciated whether you suffer from the same things or not. Also any questions you have I will try my best to answer them. Thank you in advance."
383,My days off are more mentally unbearable than my work days.,"I hate my job, but at least it gives me something to do during the day and I can at least pretend to be a normal human being. My days off however, I'm left alone with my thoughts, bored out of my mind with nothing to do. My head hurt so fucking badly and I feel like my brain is trying to kill itself."
384,Why cant i cry,Why cant i just fucking cry o need to feel it i need to feel something
385,no social life,"im sick of this. high school is supposed to be one of the most social times of your life and sadly I’m stuck at home doing independent studies because of anxiety, depression, personality disorders, etc. I have no friends except my abusive ex which is kinda sad because I’m the guy and guys get made fun of when the girl is the stronger one in the relationship."
386,I feel nothing,I don’t feel depressed I don’t feel sad I don’t feel anything. It’s like being bored all the time and I don’t like it. Idk I just hate having to wake up in the morning and do the same thing every single day.
387,Deciding how to feel,"Not sure if this goes here but I am desperately reading help on how to feel, I got hurt by someone I knew, but who I thought I could trust. I instinctively blocked him on everything because I was very upset at the time, I still am upset honestly. I keep going back and forth with my emotions, not sure whether I can forgive him or not since I know I will have to face him eventually. I just want to make a decision on how I feel so I can let it be and stop thinking about it so much... any help on this is much appreciated thank you"
388,How do I get over chronic negative emotions and thoughts?,"I’m having the battle of my life right now. I’ve been chronically depressed since middle school (25 now). I’ve conquered depression many times, and have acquired a lot of mental health tools along the way. 

However, I’m at an all time low. Nothings working. Chronic negative emotions and thoughts are taking over my life. I’ve cried more these last few years than I have my entire life combined. I’ve had a chronic twitchy eye for about 3 years now. I am on empty. I’m trying my hardest to fight, but these negative emotions continue to overpower me more and more daily."
389,I feel like my older brothers life choices negatively impact my “image”,"So I have a history of OCD issues and maybe this is all in my head but I don’t think it is. So I’m a 21 year old male. My brother is 25. My brother is not working or going to school. He’s never had a job and attended community college for about a year. So it’s been over 5 years since he has done anything to try and advance in life. I’m not saying I’m doing everything right , but I am attending community college and worked for sometime in the campus bookstore. I’m starting an apprenticeship in barbering in April. That will be like a job. You get paid to learn and do everything else that goes along with it. Sometimes I feel like my brother makes other people think negatively about me as well. We are very alike in many ways. Personality, temperament, mannerisms, etc. I have friends who criticize him and how he chooses to live and often make comments about things I do. An example is that I haven’t worked at the campus bookstore since last summer so I don’t currently have a job. So since than friends and other people I’m around always ask why I don’t have a job. Usually this comes up after something about my brother. There are a lot of reasons this is such an issue for me. A few include what was stated earlier about us being very similar. Another thing is my ocd. Also, this my seem bizarre to a lot of you. But my brother and I are the last ones in our family with our last name. Our last name isn’t common like smith. So I feel like at least one of my brother and I need to succeed in life for our families “honor” for lack of a better term. Ik that sounds lame. What should i do to combat these thoughts, feelings and how to respond to people who put both my brother and I down despite being 2 different people no matter how similar we may seem."

392,Is life just distracting yourself?,"I struggle with MDD, have for years and can typically distract myself/cope. 

But I'm at the point where it doesn't work, or more I'm tired of having to distract myself to feel happy. 

So does it get better? Or will my whole life be just distracting myself and pretending to be happy?"
393,Boyfriend or Mental Health?,"I came in a very tough spot. I met my current boyfriend at school during our graduating years as thesismates. He know fully well what I was then and I would not deny that in those times I was in the middle of self-destructing and healing. A year before then I got cheated on, in an almost 4 year relationship. My anxiety and paranoia then, lead me to a series of conversations that my ex had with his new gf and a few of his friends that I trespassed (fb messenger hacked through gmail access), which resulted of harboring resentment, betrayal, and self-worth. My mind was clouded then and did some stuffs that was not within my control. My boyfriend was very supportive emotionally and had helped me get through some of the tough spots but his standing in life (him, coming from a lax and happy family) made me feel distant with most of my emotions, believing that he would never fully understand where I was coming from. He could only sympathize but never empathize. He doesnt know how hard it is for me to harbor so much baggage for so many years, including the ones that came from my childhood's dark side as the sexually abused kid. Everything led one thing after another, nothing has not been my choice yet accepted everything that happened then. Growing up, I just let people defile me and only God knows that I am not what I let myself to allow. I hated everything. I tried to keep a good face and try to be jolly like I once was, I know everyone know this sentiment that life's hard. We cant force ourselves to be happy when we're not really happy. Truly happy. I pursued my boyfriend thinking that he's my one escape. My way out. It was a good choice at first until its not. We're more than 2 years in the relationship and I've not been better. After getting hired, everything got worse. I've been miserable for the whole year I was hired. I cried myself to sleep for the few months because my childhood trauma got triggered by my boss who tried to seduce me and was very close to me. too close to my safe space. 

I love my boyfriend but my mental health at the moment has made me believe that I dont. After new year's eve, I've became distant. Weekly LDR. Sometimes we see each other 2 weeks afer. I clearly dont want to be in a LDR, I hate to be so anxious all the time that instead having that secure attachment that everything is fine between us, it just lead me to be unattached all the sudden. It seems to be that I've grown impatient. I want to be wed because sleeping together behind my parents back made me feel shitty to be in a relationship with my boyfriend. My parents dont mind my boyfriend and has even got a great liking to his personality. I want a place to stay together but I think I've been impatient that neither of us are leaving work. Its not that I want someone to sacrifice but both of us dont like our jobs now. I want to be elsewhere but its hard to start a living in a path that is different than my diploma.

Generally, I've grew tired of everything that we are as a whole. I find it pathetic to stay in a loop of unnecessary loop of emotions and I find him pathetic of staying stagnant. He was then toxic enough to always bring out the 'lets break up' card everytime we have a fight that I dont want to beg 'no' anymore. I find it hurtful, last night, that he brought up my trauma as an excuse of pointing something out. He has this habit of reiterating your own situation as a way  to make yourself think of others. Its like forcing you to wear someone else's shoes and pushing you to walk with them. Last night I was pointing out how his friend was wrong to damage his reputation to his friends just because he got his insurance from his co-worker instead of that friend, which was offered to him a year before that. I was trying to point that out but he got caught up at a certain word that made him feel like I'm accusing him of extroversion just because I worded it to 'always' as to go out with his coworkers. It wasnt the case but I apologized after correcting me. We were at a public place and we were arguing and I was so defensive that his way of correcting me made it seem like I'm attacking his personality. In networking, persuasion is the key to getting yourself a deal and that was the whole point, he was persuaded more by his coworker than his friend that he barely meets. He then pulled the break up card and I dont want any of his drama so I walked away. He apologized through text and I stated how I was hurt by his comment, "" I dont have to say sorry. If you were offended, that is because you are weak"" 

Instead of going through with it, he re-ignited the drama and neither of us backed down and argued some more. I was ready to let it go but he had to keep on arguing as if I didnt even understand him in the first place. I was so offended because I've trying to debate against his friend because of a self-righteous post and defend him but he's just attacking me. He then reminded me of my ex and tried to 'use' it as an example but it wasnt really a good example. It triggered my trauma and he unbagged everything I've been trying to forget, that I've been trying to move away from. Crying in public was never new to me. In this busy streets and all the traffic, I always cry in any public transportation when I breakdown. I let everything out and told him how I truly felt whenever he pull those kinds of stunts. In all honesty, whenever he brings up any of my weaknesses, any of my traumas, I question myself. I made him aware that I'm constantly questioning myself and any of his shenanigans were not helping at all. He may be hurt but his attacks was too critical for me to just let it be. He said that what he said was not true and truly knows that I'm a victim and I'm really hurt by my past but everything he tries to reverse psychology me, he couldnt. Why? Because I absorb that shit. He calls me a flirt, I agree I am. He tells me that I wanted everything that happened to me, then I agree that I am. He said he didnt mean to and said that I know that he knows that he doesnt believe that shit but I'm not emotionally stable enough to see things in his level. I'm too emotionally fragile to debate that I'm not what he tries to reason. 

I know he's a good soul and he didnt mean everything that he said but a part of me also wants to just let go. I dont know what to do because I'm quite conflicted if I should just compromise or if I should stop tolerating I'm not okay with. I really dont know where to post this because my mental health is only for me to deal with, I dont want him to stand like a therapist or something but I want to depend on him more. It feels like he would never comprehend something like that unless I give him something to comprehend to but I'm not that mean. I wont do what my ex did to me. I just dont know where to turn in to."

397,Is this method of treatment normal?,"Sorry about how long this'll be, I just needed to get this all out of me.

Location wise: Toronto, Canada.
So, in my final year of university study, I managed to build up the courage to go see a therapist (one at my university) for issues I had been dealing with since high school-I had a disastrous time trying to focus on anything, and if it was even slightly difficult I would begin to feel freaked out and I would defocus. Even when it was something I enjoyed and was passionate about I'd still have trouble keeping on top of things, though less so.

 I had a few appointments with them before they got me to meet with a psychologist for a few meetings. After these meetings, as well as a few tests and going over my educational history, he diagnosed me with ADHD, non-hyperactive, as well as anxiety and depression largely aggravated by the inability to focus and gave me documents to see a psychiatrist, to pass on to my family doctor. Apparently, after asking around at ten different psychs, six were fully booked, two never responded, and of the two remaining, one was well over an hour by bus for me to get to, while the other was much closer.

After a couple months waiting, I began to see this psychiatrist-I had been prescribed a very low dose of Concerta for the ADHD beforehand, which the psych agreed with. The psych also noted the severe anxiety, though continued to only prescribe ADHD meds, switching over to vyvanse, to see if it might help better. Whenever she asks me of my progress on looking into jobs and careers in my field of study, I admit that in the past month I hadn't made too much progress (this has been for the past couple of months now that I've been trying to search), as I tend to get anxious and overwhelmed-though when I brought up the idea of seeking a guidance counselor to help point me in the right direction, she said I shouldn't be looking for outs, and can't expect others to do the work for me. I don't tend to speak up much, so when I wanted to reply that I only wanted help figuring out an idea of where to go and what to look for, as I have never done this before and doing it from scratch was very overwhelming for me, I just...nodded. 

When I bring up my anxiety, she tends to say that it is largely a symptom of my ADHD, and if I only try harder I can break past it and that the medication is giving me the tools to do so, I just need to apply them, and that perhaps mindfulness can aid in this. Additionally, she has suggested that perhaps I should stop looking for jobs and careers in my field, and look for less intensive jobs elsewhere, perhaps at local community centres and such-in this case she described another patient of hers who wanted to be an actress, but her acting teacher told her straight up that she wasn't spectacularly beautiful enough to cut it in modern hollywood, and found her satisfaction in a desk job as an accountant. The psych also said directly that she probably knows more than I do about my field, as she apparently has two siblings in jobs in that field, and maybe also because my focus problems through university might have detracted from my overall knowledge? (I am guessing about this second one, as the sibling thing was the only reason she said she probably knew more about it than I did).

Overall after these months, she has mentioned that without any further progress on my part, she has nothing else to offer in terms of aid, and doesn't seem to want to continue our monthly meetings unless I make more tangible progress on finding a job and breaking past my anxiety. However, while my focus has been getting better slightly, I still struggle a lot with anxiety-and it feels more like the anxiety is the more major roadblock at this point rather than my ADHD, as I can't just ignore my anxiety to work past it. The ADHD meds may have given me tools, but it feels like I've been given a kids toy scoop and pail and asked to build an award winning sand sculpture. Hell, even in my social life, my anxiety crops up; when a friend of mine made a joke at the expense of my character in a tabletop game, I fixated on that for the rest of the night and got increasingly paranoid that no one actually liked me being there at the table, and just accepted that I was there. When I asked him about it later that night (albeit 'just wondering' what he thought of the character, nothing more direct) and he admitted he really liked them and apologized if I was hurt, I just said that it was cool and was good to hear, but in reality I was crying so hard because it felt so relieving to know he didn't actually hate me.


TL;DR, To cut an insanely long story short: I am a bit of a paranoid, anxious, critically unfocused individual. I have finally, after years of dealing with ADHD and anxiety and depression, started taking medication for the ADHD, but the anxiety continues unabated, and my psychiatrist seems to believe that if I just work harder at it, I'd be able to find my peace, albeit probably not in a career I initially wanted. From all of this, is this kind of psychiatry normal? Am I just *that* anxious? Or is something wrong here?"
398,Is it just me or are there not enough mental health success stories?,"I see so many posts trying to encourage those struggling with their mental health. They are great and have really encouraged me. Maybe it is just me but I feel like there aren’t quiet enough stories out there of those who have suffered and overcame. Maybe I’m just not looking in the right place?
I have struggled so much and I continue to fight my mental illness. The last couple of months have had a fair amount of struggles but I finally feel as though I have a strong grip on my mental stability. It is possible to overcome. 
Share with me your successes, big and small!"
399,I might be dying and the one person I ever loved can never know,"I am highly suspicious that I have cancer. My symptoms present almost text book with what cancer I think I might have. I know it is irresponsible of me to claim I do without any professional training or seeing a physician but I have no insurance or live in the country I have citizenship in. I am not making this post to seek advice on seeing a doctor or for pity but rather to vent my pain I am currently experiencing. I lost the man I loved 7 months ago and I will never hear from him again due to solely myself. I relied on him in every time of need and now that I realize that I may be leaving this world sooner than planned; I now have to face this revelation alone. I'm not sure if I am terrified or thankful this is happening either. The symptoms could get very bad (if my guess is correct) but also finally being free from all the pain I experience with my mental health sounds blissful. I want to reach out so badly just to hear his voice, even if it is just once, but I would never burden him with this pain and fear of me dying. If someone could offer any advice or coping strategies on how to be okay with keeping this to myself I would be very thankful."
400,I'm proud of you 💖,"No matter who you are, what you've done, or what condition you are in I am proud of you ❤️ if you are reading this it means you are still alive, congratulations ⭐ Thank you to the people who support others and thank you to the ones who are brave enough to talk about their problems. You are loved. I hope you all have a great year 💖🌻"
401,Does Anyone Just Hate Themselves?,"I hate how I look, how I talk, my body, I get straight A’s but I still feel dumber than everyone else. I hate my smile and my voice and my laugh. I hate my jawline and my face and my hair and my head shape. I hate everything about me. I just wish I could erase everything and make myself better. 
I don’t know why I feel like this. I just want to feel better. I want to love myself but I’m terrified if I talk to anyone they’ll lie to make me feel better or confirm everything I think about myself."
402,Is it bad that I do this?,"I tend to judge people by their looks only, and personality second.

When in class, for example, I will only go out of my way to talk to people who are more attractive than me. I will still be nice to the others, and talk to them, but I would never go out of my way to talk to them, and I view them as almost inferior, while I view the other more attractive person as superior.

This creates a weird loop for me. As I will be unable to talk to the attractive person, because I view them in such a superior position, and I see my own self as inferior in this case. While I dont want to talk to those who I think are inferior (uglier than me), because I view them with such inferiority.

I currently struggle with BDD, and due to this, I think I am able to overly judge everyone else (and thats what I think causes me to do this), just as I judge myself so harshly.

But I was wondering if anyone else does it as well, as I know it is such an awful thing to do."
403,Math is destroying me,"There are so many things to keep track of and there is a bunch of bullshit math makes up that only exists because humans think it possibly works. I have violent meltdowns from slamming on my keyboard, bashing my head into hard objects, shrieking, and repeating for my dog, even with help on math. How can I avoid math classes for good? It is making my mental health drop and I want to sometimes kill myself just to stop feeling slow."
404,Do I have depression?,"I find myself writing this as I am unable to sleep at nearly 4am and I need to wake for uni in about 3 hours, laying in bed with suicidal thoughts. I wasn’t sure if it was a normal thing but I realise I’m very unhappy with life in general. I’ve talked to a few people but not spoken to a doctor yet and this is actually my first ever Reddit post.

I was wondering what signs made you think you have depression or some other mental health issue, and how to distinguish between just a long-term depressed feeling and unhappiness with life and genuine depression.

Basically I’m wondering if I need to speak with a doctor or someone because I find it really extremely difficult to talk to either a parent or loved one about this (yet I’m able to talk to people online about it), as I frequently find myself crying for hours and having a headache because I don’t enjoy life or want to live anymore. I tried writing a list of everything that made me feel this way and showed a few people but it did t help.

P.S I’ve probably done a lot of things wrong with this post and I hope it’s the right place to post but I’m new so please go easy.

Thanks for reading"
405,Things are getting way better,"Before my Christmas break, I was extremely confident in myself, but some big tramazing events happened to me, and it really knocked me off my train. I felt weak, anxious and just overall exhausted 


But after many weeks, I'm starting to gain back my confidence! I'm still tired because I'm overworking myself, but I'm gaining my trust in myself. I've been talking and reflecting with myself, my therapist,my amazing boyfriend and everyone else in my support system. I'm learning that just because I'm sensitive doesnt mean I'm weak. I am strong 

Thanks❤"
406,Will I ever be normal again?,"Hi everyone, im a 16 year old who used to smoke quite a bit of weed... until 3 weeks ago I got too high. What happened when I got too high was I started dissociating and getting depersonalization and derealization and it really freaked me out and i had a panic attack. Since then, I have had just basically nonstop fear and anxiety and i dont even know what im scared of i guess im just scared that i will feel like this forever or that im going insane or something. Usually the dpdr happens in segments but the ""off"" feeling is more or less always there. Please someone let me know if i have permanently ruined my brain at 16 FUCKING YEARS OLD. i will never forgive myself if i have ruined my life because i wanted to get  high as a teenager. 


(And yes i have made several posts like this because my anxiety is off the charts and im needing constant reassurance. Ive just never felt like this so its all very new and scary to me.)"
407,Horrible intrusive thoughts involving homicide,"I keep getting these horrible thoughts of stabbing people I love. I never experienced any of these kind of violent thoughts until 3 days ago, and now I just can't get off of it. I'm horribly anxious that I'm going to act out these bad thoughts at some point. I feel like I'm resisting the urge to do it at times, even though I know that doing these actions would be horrible and I would feel awful and I would end up in prison and all of these bad things. I don't ever want to harm people I care about or anyone in general. I sit and get in these horrible anxious cycles where I will have a thought, realize how horrible it is and then just reject it and I'll just spiral down this rabbit hole. I'm feel like I'm a dangerous person and a psychopath even I know these things I'm thinking about are horrible and wrong and vile, but I can't get my mind off of it. What is wrong with me...please help :("
408,What makes someone emotionally unstable?,Mood swings? Impulsiveness? Anxiety and overthinking? Depression and self doubt?
409,Question about therapy.,"Hey, so to kick things off, I’m 14, having suicidal thoughts and I have been self harming for awhile... I was wondering what therapy would be like for someone my age. What all would they tell my parents? I know they’d have to tell them about me being suicidal but do they tell them everything? Can I request to not have my parents in the same room? I’m in the us btw. Thanks for your time."
410,What should I do/say?,"this pass week has been a complete disaster: I told my teachers about how I was feeling lately (told them about feeling less motivated to do work because of being laughed at behind my back and in front of my face by everyone in school for no reason other than the fact that I'm ugly and that a picture of me at my lowest point at a social gathering is somewhere online.) the teacher told the counselor, counselor asked how did I know the picture was there; told them that I saw two people who looked at it publicly and gave their names. Conselor called my parents saying that she didn't understand what was going on according to my claim and ask them to talk to me about it. Parents got mad because this isn't the first time conselor called about school and we got into a heated argument, resulting in me saying sensitive things that I thought about, one parent suggesting I be in special ed, the other refusing to help me with school and threatening me with mental institution and refused to speak with me after the fact. after that, no one talks to each other anymore at home, avoiding me at every turn. I thought about moving away with one parent but asking that one parent would just lead into a argument. I don't know what to do, I'm feeling suicidal and feel like I have no choice or control over every day decisions in fear ill anger one parent or get glared at by another. No one won't believe my story either since they think I'm being ""paranoid "". what should I do?"
411,How do I tell my parents I need help?,"For the past few years, I have struggled with some strong feelings of sadness for prolonged periods of time (6-8 months). I don’t like to call it depression because one of my best friends is diagnosed and I have seen her in far worse states than I have ever been. Recently, though, I have started to have suicidal thoughts, along with random lack of control in what I actually do and say to people (usually late at night). I have great supportive friends, but I feel like I should get professional help before I do anything to myself.

My problem is that I would need to tell my parents my situation in order for that to happen.   However, thinking of that makes me very nervous. I feel like they would worry too much about me or be too protective. Or they could go the opposite way and think that I am too weak. For reference, I am a closeted bisexual and would rather come out to my parents than tell them I am sad. Does anyone have any tips of getting over this speed bump? Thanks"
412,How do you grieve over that which wasn’t ever really real. Even if it felt so very real.,
413,I spend every day ‘knowing’ I’ll suddenly die,"I didn’t know where to write this, I need it off my chest, I’m not seeking advice or pity. I just don’t like keeping this in anymore. 

Everyone around me knows I’m extremely dramatic, it’s not on purpose but when something tiny happens to me it really can feel like the world is crashing down on me. 

I’ve been to the doctors a lot about my anxiety and I am on medication, I don’t even know if this is anxiety,  I’ve never experienced this before. For the past few months I get this random overwhelming feeling that I’m going to drop dead, it feels like I’m falling into my own body it’s the strangest feeling. I know how irrational it is but every single time I ‘know’ I’m about to die. I’ve developed this fear of fainting, I used to pass out a lot when I was quite young, I know it’s not a very scary experience and that I’ll be completely fine even if it does happen but it scares me so much now. 

It’s like my head is playing some sick joke that I always fall for “no this time you really are about to die” and plays out every possible way it could happen.  I don’t experience anxiety in a way I’m familiar with anymore, the other physical symptoms are so much stronger than the mental ones. I get hot and dizzy and nauseous and weak and it’s like someone’s punched me with all these symptoms and they come out of no where, they usually last less than a minute before it all goes away and I realise for the 10th time today I’m not about to die. 

I don’t think I’d be taken seriously if I told anyone since I am just so over the top about these things and people just assume I’m exaggerating. To me I never exaggerate, the pain I feel is as strong as I describe it, the worries I have really are as ridiculous as they are I feel them as real as I describe."
414,Self harm scars,"I have several cigarette burn s ads and small cut scars from self harm, some are years old and some are weeks old

I have a professional job and am 29

I wonder, how do people who don’t self harm perceive these when they see them?

I can’t always  cover them at work and I get so self conscious and sometimes I get super triggered just looking at them like I want to do it again.

But I’m so worried about what other people think they are and if they think I’m crazy.

Anyone got any feedback?"
415,Are there any resources to help someone who cannot financially afford to go to a hospital for suicidal thoughts but really feels like they need to?,"Getting to the point, I know I'm not the only person in this situation so maybe this could be helpful for me and others who are in the same boat.

I am very barely employed, been off of health insurance for a year and can't afford to pay the monthly premiums and since I started a new job (last job didn't offer benefits), it'll be a few months before I can even consider registering for benefits....I've not been doing so well and it's been in the back of my mind for a while that I'm running out of options, hopeless and what's worse is that my impulsivity is made worse due to adjusting to new sleep patterns and a general increase of stress.

I feel like I'm backed into a corner and I feel like I can't really take it anymore. Many nights I feel scared to be left alone and I find myself in my car, driving to gas stations just to avoid closets and ovens and and researching about ways and people who've been successful at it and it's getting to be too much. Are there any resources for people who'd like to voluntarily admit themselves into hospital but maybe can't afford the stay?

Even when I had insurance, I remember calling a representative who worked for the behavioral health claims department and realized that what I thought was covered was definitely not and only after paying several thousand dollars would I be able to get a treatment like this covered. I broke down and cried on the spot because I was in the process of an attempt when she'd called me back. I've come a long way from then (over a year ago) but unfortunately not in the opposite direction, I'm back and feeling like I'm about to fall to my knees in front of my suicidal thoughts and I need help. 

It feels stupid to even write this, someone who supposedly needs so much help but wont get it because....she can't afford it....well that's exactly what my situation is. It feels stupid to try to plan for a voluntary visit like I'm planning some fucking vacation but I'm not. I feel like I need something drastic...and if I do go and it does help, even a little, I don't want to be FUCKED afterwards by the bill but maybe that's just the name of the game....

If it's not and if anyone has insight into US-based services that help people in this situation, please let me know. Tired of fighting for myself....and eventually, not sure how eventual it is, I'll decide it's not worth it anymore."
416,I’m just a failure. I’m worthless and useless. I deserve nothing but to suffer. I wish I didn’t exist so those around me could just be happy.,
417,My first reddit post on mental health and how I dealt with it. Give it a read and tell me how you got over mental health issues/ helped someone else who was not happy get over their problems/ let me know if you are having trouble trying to get help and we can start a great conversation!,"In this post, I want to talk about the depression story I told nobody about because I was embarrassed about the fact that I was a victim to poor mental health. Don’t worry, there is a happy ending to this. It all started during my sophomore year in college. I was excited to finally take classes in my new major. I had finally declared I was going to major in Mechanical Engineering and this time I was sure it was what I wanted to do. The semester started off fine but I knew it would be challenging because of the classes I was taking plus the research and clubs I was a part of. I am the kind of person who thinks I am capable of doing a lot more than I can and I constantly push myself to do more because in my mind I am becoming a ‘better’ version of myself when I achieve more. Don’t get me wrong here now, achieving more is being better but I forgot at the time that quality is more important than quantity. I overloaded myself with schoolwork and all these other things that I found myself barely making it. But I didn’t want to give up on anything. I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of doing it all. At the same time my social life was literally plummeting to the ground like an asteroid plummeting towards a planet. It was going so bad because one, all my closest girl-friends got into relationships within a month and not that that made me angry or anything, I was genuinely happy for them but a few weeks before they got into their relationships, I confessed my feelings to one of my friends and that went nowhere because he wanted to be just friends. Secondly, on top of that there was so much drama going on in my friends circle because of another girl drama situation. So all our socializing time went in talking about boys and that seemed to bother me a lot because I just couldn’t care enough. This happened every day that semester. At the same time one of my group projects in a class was going terrible because I was blessed with the worst group ever. I had to do everything and no one seemed to care about the group project. To make things worse, I did not get an internship during the career fair that year, and being a career focused person nothing breaks me down more than that. During these months I found myself crying to bed almost every night. My roommates also saw how I would get extremely emotional at times and they tried to talk to me about it but there was something within me that just couldn’t seem to feel better. It was this negative energy that refused to leave my body and I carried it with me everywhere, all the time. Music would help for a couple minutes but then reality would hit back and that energy would surround me again. Thanksgiving break rolled around and I wanted to fix myself. I gave myself some time to heal by going to Chicago with my roommate to spend the holiday with her family and from there I told myself to find what was going on and to mend it. I happened to watch Deepika Padukone’s depression video on YouTube one evening and it hit, that was it I was feeling a lot of what she described. I quickly started googling depression, it’s causes, remedies and I even took a quiz to see how bad my depression was. I then called one of my roommates and told her I thought I had depression because it all made sense. I was feeling what most depressed people felt. Now not to say I am 100% sure I had depression but whatever it was, it was not great. I didn’t know what to do with all these things I just read about and self diagnosing myself with depression, but I wanted to fix it. So over the next few weeks I told myself to take each day as it came. The semester got over. Winter break came and went by and I spent most of it in my room listening to music, just glad I survived the previous semester as my parents fought like they usually did and they also made it worse by dragging me into their bullshit by making me their messenger. The next semester I decided to actually turn things around. And I did. The moment I realized that I wanted to make each day count and I wanted to be happy with who I was, things really did change. I gave myself a second chance at being happy and truly understanding the purpose of my life here. This didn’t mean everyday was perfect or that I never had a bad day. I had bad and hard days but I didn’t let that discourage me. I understood that everyday is a chance to improve and learn. I am going to make mistakes. In fact, I am going to make a lot of mistakes but I won’t let myself crash down any more. I did that once and I promised myself that I will respect myself and only pick myself up from there. That semester was my lowest GPA semester because I took 2 very hard engineering courses but I survived and I learned. Just because I didn’t get an A doesn’t mean I am a failure. At least I was healthy and genuinely happy. I had better relationships with the people around me and I also opened my mind to learning and enhancing my knowledge because for the longest time I relied on the education system to teach me everything but that semester onward I taught myself about literally any interesting thing that popped up in my mind. Watch videos, read articles, and just LEARN! Keeping up with this positive outlook also allowed me to try new things like rock climbing where I met a lot of new people and also helped me find a new passion. I also got my first internship that semester, which is a whole story itself about not giving up. I am happy to say that I am actually proud of who I became that semester. I really flipped my world upside down. So, I hope this encourages anyone going through a rough time to fix their problems and find happiness because I know you can do it and get there. Don't be afraid to seek help from anyone you trust."
418,How do i tell my boyfriend i have depression and anxiety,I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 8 months (we’re both 13) and i feel like i should tell him i have depression and anxiety. Especially because yesterday i was at his house and had a panic attack and he didn’t know what was happening or how to help. He just kinda hugged me while i cried and shook and couldn’t breath. I want him to know what i’m working through and how i feel and why i’m not always happy like i act at school. I want to tell him but i don’t want him to have to worry about me and he gets dragged down too.I care more about his mental health than mine and i’m not sure which is worse: him not knowing why i’m sad and down or him knowing that i’m struggling and thinking it’s his fault or always needing to worry. I know most people won’t be able to help me but if u can even one person that would be awesome. I just need to know if it’s worth it to tell him and if it is how to tell him.
419,lost a friend,"Hi first time poster, I recently lost a friend and would like someone to talk to about it if anyone is there xxx"
420,I’m too scared to get help and feel trapped,"as a bit of background i’ve(m14) been dealing with long periods of sadness, self harm, and frequent thoughts of suicide but it seems impossible to talk to anyone about it. i just want to talk to someone but every path is a dead end. i love my parents and i’m sure they love me but whenever i tried to talk to them about this they either shoot it down, or promise to get me help and then don’t ever follow up.


I can’t directly get a therapist because i can’t pay for one, i can’t talk to my parents, and any other adults that could help me (school counselors, doctors, etc...) would have to talk with my parents and they won’t do anything/ tell me i’m making it up


I feel like i’m just begging for attention but i promise i’m not i just want help, if anyone could give some advice it would be appreciated. Thanks"
421,Mental Breakdown need advice,I’m an 18 M in the U.S. who is in his last semester of high school. Tonight I had a mental breakdown and took a hammer and completely destroyed my room from doors to walls to trophies of mine. I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety for the last 4-5 years stemming from my mom dying when I was 12. I’ve been taking medication and been to regular therapy and intensive group therapy with some success. Currently I’m looking for a new therapist and have not seen one for a while. My dad has called family and want to take me to a mental hospital as he believes I want to hurt myself. I have never wanted to and do not plan on ever harming myself. I am not sure I want to go to a mental hospital this minute although I haven’t ruled it out. As a legal adult what authority do I have over what happens to me. Any advice is helpful.
422,lack of empathy with people irl,"Ok, so I'm able to feel empathy for people and animals like in documentaries n shit, but not for my friends irl? 

I only have a couple of friends, but anytime they vent to me I just don't care at all. I listen to them vent, but it's more because I don't want to be mean and ignore them than my caring about their problems??  I give them advice usually as a response to their vent, and it ends up with me getting annoyed because they won't listen to anything. 

is this a lack of empathy, or am I just selfish? ig me not wanting to be mean would not = lack of empathy necessarily, so it's probably just me being selfish? But is this even selfish?? I don't tell them about my problems because I know it's unfair to them to listen to me if I'm unwilling to listen to them? I'm not sure lmfaoo. 

is this a lack of empathy problem or what?"
423,Should i go to class today ? I don't know if it's my mental illness or laziness acting up,Sometimes I dont know if I'm being lazy or if it's my mental Illness I just don't wanna get dressed up and face people I've been absent for like a week ugh i just wanna sleep
424,Not totally feeling good after a therapy session,"I’m a 16 year old guy with OCD and rn I’m having a hard time.

Normally I feel way better after therapy but during this session it felt like my obsessions became more real. 

I was worrying about turning get and after talking about it during therapy it felt like it was slowly becoming true. I have no idea why! Guys I really"
425,I want to be over with it already,"I dont mean this in a depressing way, it's just general. But I should be more specific to be honest- I want my toxic friendship to be over.

The constant shit talking, telling me I've not got anxiety when I do, bragging over thinking she's 'rare', toxicity, arrogance, arguing and putting me down. I'm so over it. This bitch has been lurking over  me like a shadow for 4 years of my life telling me I've got ugly pimples every day or that my face is so chubby. The 'so I was hanging out with my friends' as if I give a fuck about her mentioning my past toxic friends that I gave up on? I'm 17 and I can make up my mind on this when I say she's done. I cant handle it anymore. It just adds to the anxiety and numbness. 

The thing is, I think she doesnt know that what she's doing is hurting me and I dont want to tell her because she's manipulative. How can I get rid of her?"
426,Personally I think smiling to hide your pain is one of the major reasons as to why people lash out at society or kill themselves.,"The whole ""smile to hide your pain"" is not healthy and I would even go further as to argue that it's a key reason as to why some people lash out at society or kill themselves (which god forbid) now sure there are many different reasons as to why one does something it's not just one reason but I feel this is one of them. Smiling to hide your pain keeps one from venting out their problems and not being honest to themselves and if one keeps on doing it, something is going to happen where they are provoked enough and the pain that they are suffering is gonna rear it's head out and they are gonna do something awful like hurt themselves or others. Now I'm not saying vent out your problems to everyone but talk to people you trust about your problems or find therapy, this could help you from doing something drastic (which I know is very obvious) but I think the whole sentiment of smiling through your pain is what causes alot of bad stuff to happen."
427,i’m sick of being me,i’m feeling really off today. my mood has been crazy today one minute i’m decent the next minute i’m angry the minute someone talks to me. i have been feeling really sad today and there are moments on and off when i want to just cry. tomorrow i have school and i’m really dreading it. i’m so tired of school. i’m already truant and my counselor has been proud of me for going to school everyday for two weeks in row. i feel like i’m on the verge of a break down and i really just need a break. even getting out of bed is exhausting. i’d rather lay in bed alone all day and do nothing. i had a shitty weekend when i was suppose to have fun. i’m over being me.
428,Getting cold while not taking Antidepressants,"I gone through a rough patch and slowly getting back to life. I used to get cold and thought infection when I am extremely stressed. I started taking Escitalopram for almost 8 weeks and things are far better. I felt better, so I haven't bought tablets, and missed it for last 5 days. But I started getting cold again. Should I continue taking tablets? I haven't got a chance to visit the doctor yet."
429,Kinda worried about my mental health,"Here’s what I know:

I’m a pathological liar, I lie so damn much. Too much. Exactly how it’s described too, I create fake stories, I’ve done this since kindergarten.

I have a empathy without sympathy. I run a lot of scams online, in which I’ve taken advantage of poor people and children, and don’t care. Only realty progressed when I was 13-14 or so.

I have depression + social anxiety, not really something I need to show evidence for. Started when I was 12 or so.

I compulsively have shouted things I’ve heard before. One time I was in a busy area, and shouted “Alex is a stupid *****”, just because before I heard it on a YouTube video. I did not consciously authorize this. It’s happen other times too. 

I see shadow figures all the time, and would full figures a lot when I was young (3-8).  I also would hear whispering and couldn’t find where they were coming from. I still hear them, but rarely, and they are incoherent gibberish now.

More Recently I hear pianos playing that aren’t there sometimes, only really now has this started... it’s not really that bad though because I can then play the pieces I hear and they are usually pretty good.

That’s all. Read the first sentences of each paragraph if you don’t want to read the whole thing."
430,Just need some confirmation/advice and had to vent...,"My mom and dad have had a rough relationship for quite awhile now. I can remember when I was around 8 years old my dad would “go see his friends” after work(10:30 p.m) which actually meant he was going to a strip joint for a couple hours. Now I’m 16 and he goes to nude spas and even has some of the girls on his contacts and I can see him text them sometimes. My family doesn’t have a lot of money to the point where we live in a dusty one bedroom basement . I sleep in the room, he sleeps on a bed outside the room, and my mom sleeps on the couch. I would say on average he spends $500 a month for these appointments which could be going to useful stuff like groceries or a better place to live. This has gotten me so mad to the point where I argue with him about it and every time I mention it he tries to bring up stuff he buys me like lunch or my ps4 too avoid the topic. My mom says that she “gave up” arguing with him a long time ago and gets mad when I bring it up when we’re together. 

Now, my mom also isn’t perfect. Back when my dad went to strip joints she knew and was ok with it. During this time she didn’t do anything bad and just stayed home with me when he went out. Now, she talks to a “friend” (which is actually her boyfriend) all the time on the phone and even puts earphones in so I don’t hear what he says. My mom talks to him every chance she gets even in the car with us all together and sometimes when they are talking I hear my mom call him babe and says I love you when she hangs up. They even do that cringy shit where you go “No you hangup first...no you hangup first”. It’s not even just that, she even goes out with him every week from when she finishes work (around 6 p.m) all the way till 1 in the morning. It breaks my heart because I know she’s doing stuff with him. I’ve seen her texts and photos she’s sent him because she’s so oblivious when she’s on her phone...
She knows I’ve seen these photos and texts and said “it’s a part of life, you’ll understand when you grow up” and I literally just laughed because I don’t know how to react to the fact that she doesn’t recognize the effects anything she and my dad have done in the past have on me. I literally cannot trust my parents anymore because all they have done is constantly lie to me about where my dad has been going and what’s she’s been doing with her friend. 

I literally don’t know what to do anymore and I feel like this is causing a horrible impact on my mental health because I’ve recently began to notice some signs of social anxiety within my daily life. I even have trust issues with my friends and never tell them anything too detailed or important about my life or even let them come over even though I’ve known them for 8 years. 

Can anyone who’s read this whole thing confirm that my home environment is what’s affecting my mental  health? 

Thank you to everyone that has read this whole thing. I appreciate you taking the time to actually read what I’ve written. Especially at this time where I feel like I have no one that will listen or care about what I’ve said.

Tl;dr : my parents have separate relationships but still live together. We all live in a one bedroom basement and sleep in separate beds. My dad has been spending a lot of money at nude spas and even communicates with the girls after his appointments to do who knows what. I’ve began to argue with him because the money he wastes can be going to better things like a better place to live or food. My mom on the other hand has a friend who is actually her boyfriend and talks with him on the phone every chance she gets. Even in the car with me and my dad calling him babe and saying I love you. She even goes out with him until midnight every week and is doing stuff with him because I’ve seen texts between her and him. She has even said “it’s a part of life, you’ll understand when you grow up.”and I literally just laughed because I don’t know how to react to the fact that she doesn’t recognize the effects anything she and my dad have done in the past have on me. 

I’ve recently started to see some signs of social anxiety within my daily life. I‘ve also been unable to trust my friends with anything too detailed about my life even though I’ve known them for so long.

I just wanted to know if my home environment can be causing a bad impact on my mental health and can somewhat confirm why I can’t trust people or am beginning to have social anxiety. 

Thank you all for your time and I would appreciate any confirmation or advice &lt;3"

I actually like the way i look. When I was skinny and when everybody was complimenting me on my body and how good I looked I couldn't wear anything that showed skin .

433,Not being able to drink is making me crazy,"I'm taking wellbutrin and abilify for bipolar depression and some undiagnosed thing that gives me the attention span of a gnat. They're really helping me feel normal, even good. But I REALLY miss being able to drink.

I'm in my 20's and the thing to do is go to bars, party with friends, etc. I've been fine not drinking for a few months, and the other day I tried sipping a beer and I got what felt like a hangover just minutes later. So not doing that again while on these meds.

Drinking (responsibly) and being buzzed (never blackout drunk haha) with friends was one of my favorite fun things to do and I'm really missing it lately. I'm also so much more relaxed and confident and funny buzzed. I miss that a lot too. Weed just doesn't hit the same. 

I guess I'm just venting but it really is getting me down lately. Makes me really consider stopping/switching meds, but this current cocktail is helping me feel the best I have in a while. I really miss buzzed me."

Im a 16 year old girl who is homeschooled and lives in America and i am just confused 

I know im not depressed im just sad alot im not even sure if i have anxiety i think im just over reacting to everything around which makes me also think i have paranoia because i dont trust anyone. I feel that i have some sort of trauma but im not sure my mother says i dont and i haven't been abused (not to my knowledge) i don't think anythkng trauma has really happened other than a fire when i was 4. have always had attention issues and my mom says me and my dad have add and me and my dad agree that i have dependent personality disorder but...do i?

I dont know how to feel about myself and all this stuff

I dont cut anymore because my friends  dont want me to but sometimes i accidentally just mindlessly play with knives or other dangerous stuff without thinking about the consequences

I dont think i have always been shy but i remember myself not talking to kids but only adults because adults cool

I have always had trust issues i dont really remember trusting anyone except for an ex but that was for something small

Idk how to feel i have people telling me theres something wrong and i have people (my parents and a close friend) telling me nothing is serious 

I constantly doubt how i feel and i bounce from ""im fine im just over reacting just shut up"" to ""i hate myself i should die i dont deserve food""

And should mention i have a horrible diet and i either rarely eat or i eat to much and most of it is junk food so telling my mother she would say this and i some what agree

I have no motivation to do anything and when i do i lose it when i start thinking of something else 

And i wont be able to get therapy because my mother has said no even if i payed for it... she says they will give me meds for issues that can be fixed at home. if i was put into school they would give me adhd meds. i hope that if i get to go to a really school (most likely not because i have no motivation to learn wven if i want to so i will always be dumb and in the 9th grade) i will get some form of help.

Idk why i made this...maybe to vent? Idk im sorry"
435,I often feel to old to live,"I'm 26 now and I wonder how long I have to play this game. I only life for my family. I never cared about anything and I don't want anything, but I don't have the mental energy to be interrogated about why I'm not interested in anything, so I pretend that I am. The only thing I look forward to is when it's all over. I don't have the motivation to unwrap all my mental problems and trauma in front of a therapist anymore, because it never changes how I feel. I just can't relate to the spark of interest in life that most people seem to have. It just feels like a job."
436,Has anyone else been really struggling with reality for the past couple years?,"That title probably wasn’t clear enough. 

I have terrible depression and anxiety, maybe even autism, I have never been able to afford to go to a doctor for a diagnosis or treatment... 

But until recently, one thing I did know was that no matter how screwed up my thinking was, there was a baseline for normal human behavior. Survival in society would require me to try to emulate that baseline human behavior. 

Normal humans knew the difference between right and wrong, a difference existed, hate and cruelty were bad, generosity and kindness were good, etc. That’s an oversimplification, maybe because I was never quite able to pinpoint what the normal baseline was. I’ve never been able to survive. 

Now, there doesn’t seem like there even is a normal anymore. It doesn’t seem like there is a truth or a reality anymore. Ask ten people which way is north and they’ll each tell you with unwavering conviction which direction is north, and their answers will all be different, and none of them will match a compass. 

I’m starting to think _no one_ has _anything_ figured out. And that would be comforting, except _they’re_ all surviving and thriving and happy and I am not. I can’t keep a job. I am living in poverty. I worry all the time. I can’t talk to people. I don’t relate to people at all. I can’t function in this mess. 

Has anyone else had this problem?

(On tip of all that, I 100% know this will get downvoted and _I just don’t get it_.)"
437,How to get through a long school day?,"I’m only on my 3rd week of the semester but I’m already burning out. There is one day in the week that I’m particularly dreading— Monday. On Monday, I am stuck at school for an entire 12 hours straight. I have morning classes, work on campus on break, and a night class. It’s an incredibly long day and I dread it every time it comes around, and when it does, I’m miserable and it goes on even longer. How do I get over this dread feeling?"
438,I’m sharing my suicide attempt experience in hopes that it will help someone,"Before I say anything else, ...if you find this post to be triggering, then please stop reading it and try to do something else that will help  you to  feel better. The last thing I want is for anyone to feel worse by reading this post because all I want is for people to feel good and not bad! But anyhow, I want to share my story to hopefully be able to help someone out there who is thinking about suicide so, here’s my story:


so I had been struggling with Suicide attempts for many years...but my most serious suicide attempt taught me some pretty big life lessons. It was December 2016, and I was going through a really weird depressive episode that lasted about 2 weeks. I had been prescribed an antipsychotic and I started having some pretty bad side effects. I was literally sleeping all day, every day. To the point where I had hardly any social contact with anyone else because I could not stop sleeping. I quit watching TV, I wasn’t on Facebook at all, and if I remember correctly...I was barely eating. I think I was only eating maybe one meal a day when it was dinner time and my parents were having to cook my food for me because I had no energy. I remember when I tried to take a bath because I literally didn’t have the energy to even stand up in the shower and I felt like I was dragging myself
Into the bath tub. And I just remember laying in the bath tub and crying because I felt so lonely. i felt so exhausted, and I lost total interest in all of my hobbies. It was incredibly frustrating because I had told the doctor I was seeing at the time that I wasn’t doing well at all and he just insisted that I keep taking the medication. And then my mom noticed how bad I was doing and she wanted me to stop taking it. And she even came with me to my appointment and she tried to tell him what was going on but he kept insisting that I keep taking it and that It was because “I wasn’t manic anymore” and that “this was the real me” and that I just needed to wait because I might start to feel better on the medication. me and my mom we’re pretty frustrated at that point because we both knew that I wasn’t doing well. so I felt stuck. and then not long after I saw my doctor, I pretty much lost it. The loneliness was driving me absolutely insane, and the depression was just killing me. I desperately wanted a way out, so I took a lot of Tylenol one night. I’m not a 100 percent sure how much I exactly took, but I think it was roughly around 50 pills, and Every single pill was 500 mg each. I remember being so sure that I wanted to die, but then later that night I changed my mind. I wanted to live. I remember feeling too scared to tell my mom about what happened, so I tried to get ahold of a family friend and luckily she answered me. She was so cool about it that she stayed on the phone with me while I told my mom. And to be honest, if that family friend had not picked up the phone, idk if I would have told my mom about what was going on that night. 
So anyhow, when I told my mom she took me to the hospital at 2 in the morning I think? And so there I am, laying in this hospital bed, and the doctor comes in and asks me how much I took and I told him that I thought I took about 50 pills and he had a concerned look on his face and said that I was probably going to have to go on dialysis because my liver and kidneys were failing. And it’s amazing how quickly I went from thinking “I wanna die so bad” to “it wasn’t worth it” it’s just amazing how my mind changed within an instant when he said that. So here I am, 19 years old, and not really knowing what my future was going to look like. I felt like my life was over at that point. But luckily the doctor came back after calling the poison control and they told him that because I had came into the ER soon enough, that I was probably going to be okay. So to make a long story short, I had a lot of blood work done. I was only in the ICU for 2 days and holy shit I had my blood drawn so many times I was so sick of it towards the end of my hospital stay. It kind of sucked to be honest. But they had to do it to check my liver enzymes because my liver enzymes were too high when I was first admitted. I had to have an IV to flush out all of that Tylenol crap out of my system, so that kind of sucked. And then I had to take a potassium pill because they found out through my blood work that my potassium was super low. So I had to take a giant horse pill to help with my potassium, and they had to put potassium in my IV....so yeah, my potassium was super, super low and might have been part of what was causing my depressive episode. And I also had to have this special medicine put in my IV to help reverse my liver failure but I can’t remember what it was called...anyhow, the experience was traumatizing for many different reasons. More reasons than I’m willing to list because there are so many reasons why it traumatized me. But one of the reasons why it was so traumatizing was because I felt like my life flashed before my eyes. I was facing the possibility of having to go on kidney and liver dialysis...I had no idea what my future held in those moments...and it was a life changing experience for me. 

It has been 3 years since that happened...and I am in a much better place. I quit seeing that dumbass doctor because he was a terrible listener and I felt like he didn’t take my concerns serious, and I moved on with my life. And I honestly feel like my life has much better since I last overdosed. Are there still days where I feel like I want to die? Yes, there are countless days where I feel like I’m in an utter hell and there is no escape. And in those moments I feel like I can’t do it, that I won’t survive and that I am a fool for thinking that my life could get better. But I have chosen to keep going,‘I have chosen to keep living this life. And I don’t even totally understand why I keep pushing through this depression, through this anxiety, through these suicidal thoughts, but I just keep doing it. And I feel like maybe it’s just out of the hope that one day I will be able to help someone else through they’re suicide attempts, through they’re pain, through they’re suffering, and if I can do that then I feel like my life has been worth living. Even though it’s so incredibly painful. I hope that my story will be able to help someone out there, somehow...because suicide attempts can put you at risk for life changing health complications. Please don’t do it, seek help, seek healing, just do whatever you can to keep going....💖"
439,Where's the line between actively suicidal and passively suicidal?,"I know being passively suicidal means you want to die but have no plans to act on it. But, how far do your plans have to go before you're considered actively suicidal?

If you know what method you'd use but have no plans to act, is that actively suicidal?

Are you actively suicidal if you have every detail planned but you're planning to kill yourself in a very long time? Does it matter if you're going to die in a week or in a year?

If you have stuff to kill yourself with but have no plans to actually do it, are you actively suicidal?

I just don't fully get how far things can go before you're considered actively suicidal. Can anyone tell me?"
440,"17M Never had a friend, but I want one. Don't know how to make one.","I have never texted, snapped, DM'd, facetimed or phoned anyone. I've never been to a party or gone out for dinner. I've never had a girlfriend or done much more than talk to a girl. I don't hang out with anyone, or talk outside school. I'm a loner and I'm getting tired of it.

I'm unbelievably lucky. I was born in the best city in Canada, if not the world, to an upper-middle-class family and go to a great school. I grew up in a great neighbourhood, and as a kid, I would spend hours outside with my only friend catching lizards in nets and jumping on his trampoline. When I started middle school we grew apart and stopped talking. Even though we still go to the same school, we don't know each other anymore. I only ever had him as a friend, and when I lost that friendship, I never made a new one. I don't want to be friends with him again, as it has been almost a decade, and we are not in the same place socially.

As a senior in high school, I am awfully lonely. I have a few people I talk to and sit with at lunch, but I am an outsider, and just tag along. I have a few people I chat to in school, but otherwise, I'm pretty much a loner. I'm not ugly and I don't have bad hygiene. I'm not socially awkward or cringy. I'm self-aware and take social cues. Every day I watch my peers grow older and experience all the teenager things, first love, first kiss, first girlfriend, first break up. I'm getting tired of seeing people enjoying life with their friends while I sit on the sidelines.

People in my grade are going to parties and hanging with friends. On Instagram, I see pictures of all the people in my school doing cool shit with their friend's: camping, fishing, swimming at the beach or skiing. Parties are practically live-streamed, and I'm writing this while my feed is overflowing with the latest pictures of the parties my peers are at. The people in my grade look amazing, they go to the gym they are fit and healthy. The girls look like models, and the guys look like adults. I'm by no means ugly, but definitely look young for my age, skinny and average height.

I don't think loneliness would have hurt this much before social media. Everything I see hurts. People wishing each other happy birthday on Instagram, while on my birthday I wake up to my school alarm and a text from mom. I see Snapchat stories of the girl I like snorting coke off a table, and boys shitting in the urinal. As stupid as all that is it sure beats being lonely. Trump is president, the forests are burning, oceans rising, and I'm about to die from god damned coronavirus because some idiots couldn't help but eat a bat because it's a trend. What good is there in the world because I can't find it.

I'm tired of sitting in my room on the weekend listening to Radiohead and wallowing in my loneliness, while across the city my peers are living it up. I try to put myself out there, I played soccer for the school, I run a club, I volunteer and get good grades apart from in English. I'm going to university next year for engineering. It is a big school in a big city. People tell me life will change in college, but I don't see how. In high school I'm surrounded by people my age, who are going through the exact same experiences I am. University is no different if I can't make friends now what is going to change.

I don't see the point anymore, I feel like I'm living for my family, not myself. People tell me to find god, but if god existed why the fuck would he make me like this. What is the point of waking up every morning to go to school or work just to die in 80 years, if I'm lucky? I used to only feel the loneliness mentally, it weighed on me like a brick every day, but now I'm feeling it physically. I wake up exhausted, I feel weak, I don't have an appetite and I can't sleep. I've realized that loneliness is more than emotion, it is a disease. I'm in a race to make a friend before the loneliness consumes me. I feel like I am racing against time, but I don't know the race track.

tl;dr how do i make a friend."
441,What Could I Possibly Have?,"Hello guys, this is my first time posting here.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how to start this post, but basically what I experience is a constant lack of stimulation. I often feel unsatisfied. I get bored very easily in my everyday life. I constantly seek something to stimulate myself, and have previously turned to alcohol and nicotine as a way to feed my brain this itch it has. I understand that even normal people have problems with nicotine and alcohol, but for some reason I feel like for me it's different. I wasn't addicted to the alcohol itself, I just enjoyed the ""buzz"" as it gave me that feeling of satisfaction. I don't even enjoy the flavor of alcohol itself at all, it tastes like shit (in my opinion). I always leave a messy room and hate doing things that I don't enjoy doing. I can't wash my dishes to save my life just because I'm so unmotivated to do so, to the point that I've gotten flies on a couple of occasions. I mean, a lot of people hate doing things like that, but I feel like it's harder for me than for most. 

I don't know if this is related, but I tend to pick at my gums quite a bit because it gives me a good feeling. As I child I would have these weird ""ticks,"" where I found have to repeat a phrase in my head or maybe line certain things up a certain way or else it will bother me. I believe this is a form of OCD, but I haven't been diagnosed with it so I can't say for sure. 

I don't do well in social situations if I don't know the other person/people very well, but I think this is at a normal level. 

I also have trouble sleeping at night without help from melatonin because my mind is always thinking about something. 

These issues haven't impacted my performance at school or at work too much. When I was at school I generally did pretty well, unless I just didn't feel like it, in the couple years that I didn't put as much effort I'd do pretty poorly. At work I do pretty well because they give us a lot of freedom so being allowed to use my phone throughout the day helps me pass the time when I'm really bored.

I can't come up with anything else at the moment, and if I can think of something later I can update this post. Any input is appreciated. I don't want to go see a doctor or medical professional yet because I still am not sure if this is a real problem or if I just need to toughen up, but sometimes being this unmotivated and under stimulated/dissatisfied with my days make me think it's something else.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel unsatisfied and unmotivated in daily life, I get bored very easily and can't clean my room/kitchen to save my life. I don't do too well in social situations and just feel an itch in my head that craves stimulation or excitement, to the point that I've abused nicotine and alcohol in the past, providing only temporary relief. Do I have an issue or do I just need to toughen up? Thank you for any input."
442,feeling cold when i'm sick,"lately i've noticed that i feel really cold when i am unwell. today i've been very cold. i've had to wear two jackets all day. recently, i had really bad anxiety. i felt cold then, too. even under blankets. is this a common physical response? does anyone else feel really cold when they're feeling ill?"
443,I wish we could just die.,"Hi all, I live in an area where there has just been a reported case of the coronavirus, and the paranoia has gotten to the point where the majority of my conversations surround it. All the talk and fear doesn't really scare me, but that's sort of the scary thing. I feel completely apathetic to the possibility that this could be a pandemic. Even if it's just a little scare, I found myself thinking how easy it would be to just die. And if it was a pandemic, I'd be able to die with all my family and friends. This mindset disgusts me that I would want these people to die with me, but at the same time... not? I've been having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I will have a future that will likely last many, many more years which I can't imagine being able to live through. I am somewhat scared of dying but I'm also scared of being alive. I don't know if I was able to convey my thoughts accurately, but I just wanted to get it off my chest without getting backlash from my family/friends.

**Rest assured, I do not intend to purposefully kill myself in any way.**"
444,"I find that I several times throughout the day, while I'm in my own head I'll remember something cringy I said or did and I'll often swear at myself. Anyone else do this and any way to overcome it?","If I see or hear something that brings back memories that I'm embarrassed about, I say things that probably aren't normal. Like a goddamn, 'I hate myself, I hate everyone, and if I'm pretty depressed, I'll say things like 'I'm going to kill myself.' Don't worry, I don't have any plans to do that, nor have I ever done any self harm, but it has become quite a negative habit, and is probably having a slight edge effect in a negative direction. Thanks for reading"
445,Is this trauma?,"This is not my first time here. I am extremely confused at my state of mind and I can't tell the difference between what is normal and what isn't anymore and I can't sleep because of the thoughts coming from this, hence I am here.

From the outside and as far as I can tell, I live a normal life, have good parents, do great at school, and I have okay friends, but my thoughts as far as I can tell aren't normal at all. I shake when I see blood and get nightmares when I sleep afterwards, my memory is insanely graphic, I feel like I am a spectator of my life meaning that I sometimes feel like I am not in control of the movements I make, my memories are fragmented in the sense that some memories feel like dreams, i feel like my memories are from months or years ago when they actually were a few weeks ago, time feels like its changing constantly, the world sometimes looks foggy or smaller than usual, I see hallucinations often both auditory and visually, life feels like it is set up as a game, I am never sure of how to express the severity of my feelings (meaning I don't know how bad my pain or sadness is), and so many other small things that happen occasionally.

A few days ago I learned that when I was 4, I lived with very alcoholic people. I also learned that at 5, I hit my head and lost my memory. Make of it what you will, but the thoughts I have now can't come from nowhere right? Is there a possibilty that I suffered some type of trauma when I was little which is why I am suffering this now? Is it normal to be feeling this?

I really hope someone has an answer, I feel like I am going insane in my own head and I can't understand why. If you don't know either, you could suggest what I should do, I'll be grateful for any help that I could get. I know reddit isn't the best place to ask for help but it's a great way for me to get my thoughts out there. I hope someone knows what I am dealing with"
446,I'm tired and feel like giving up.,"School has officially made me wonder if I'm smart enough to attend. Work seems to kick my butt and it feels like I have nothing to show for either. I'm always tired and emotionally drained. I have a wife I'm not doing good by and I just feel like crying every day after everything. I know this is probably super whiny, but I just feel like a giant dumb loser. I know no one will read this, but I'm so ready to throw in the towel for life."
447,I thought I was getting better but I’m just burying my problems,"I grew up with a very complicated family situation that caused my older sister to run away at age 19. Things have been better for me since then and once I started going to therapy I thought all my problems were over.

I was diagnosed with depression and ADD about half a year ago, and I wasn’t surprised. After talking things out with a nice old man I felt a new sense of purpose and drive that I hoped would drive me through my last year of high school.

This year I feel overall happier, my grades are better, and I get more sleep. However, I realized that not much has changed and things might have gotten worse. I spend most of my free time in bed or sleeping. Because of this, I hold off on projects until the last possible minute, I barely do any of the activities I used to enjoy anymore, and I can’t will myself to exercise. I just feel constantly sleepy and I’m living in the back of my head a lot of the time. I’ve learned to hate every part of my body, and I simply don’t try hard enough in school even though it’s my last shot at getting into a good college.  

I don’t know what to do at this point and I could never survive in college if I keep being like this. I smile and laugh but I had a horrible revelation that I no longer have a purpose for anything anymore and I just go through the motions as if I were fine."
448,Thoughts on “No one can me you feel inferior without your consent”?,"Anytime I hear this I think “am I just getting mentally raped everyday?”. I know I have depression and if I had any bit of self esteem, this quote would be reassuring. Maybe I am being mentally abused (mostly by myself) and allowing others to do the same because of giving in to emotional abuse when I was younger. This quote just feels like it will help you if it can but also will hurt you if it can."
449,How I wish I could be gone for eternity...,I've been feeling extremely hopeless and desperate for a very very long time now...its suffocating
450,For people with depression and/or any type of dissociative identity disorder. Howd you get help?,"Im gonna go into some detail. I feel like reality is fabricated all the time. I feel like reality shifts on me all the time, sometimes what i think, happens, even if the thought was unintentional. And itll seep its way into a lot of things in my life. Whether it was like mentioning something and it happening in a movie i watch later, or feeling somewhat ok and i can feel a bad thing happening soon and then it does. 

I also feel different throughout the day, like something in me flips a switch? Thats the best way i can describe it. I sometimes feel the switch and notice that i feel different or think differently. Sometimes i dont notice and im just on autopilot until someone mentions ""are you ok?"" Or ""yo, you good?"" And then ill realize something different is going on. Can anyone else relate?? 

I knew since late elementary/early Middleschool i felt off. I knew i was different than the kids around me and that hasnt changed now that im 21. In junior of highschool i had a random breakdown and was diagnosed with severe depression by my doctor that day. But ive only seen a therapist last year and it was only for a couple months (i had a lot going on). And it was helpful for the things i was looking help in for. But i feel like now i was asking the wrong questions. I feel like everyone (including family and best friends) are fake, even though im 99% sure they are genuinely good people and actually care for me. 

Just, i need help on how i can deal with all of these thoughts? Did medicine help any of you? Therapy? Mental health center whether it be voluntary or not?

Tl:dr
I feel like reality is fake, havent done much in getting help, life sucks, i need help."
451,I love you!,"Say no more, i freaking love you. I love your voice, your eyes, your face, your hair, i love YOU! People need tell this other people. 

I'm from Russia, you maybe from Korea, USA, Germany, nevermind what are you from! You got a black skin, small asian eyes or fat body? I don't give a shit, i love you whatever you looks like!

We are people who's live on the this goddam planet, we are different, and in this moment we are the same. You need to be friendly! You need to be kind!

I love everything.
I love everyone.
I love you."
452,Mental problems,"So, this all started in maybe 3rd grade, I’m 16 now, I’ve been diagnosed with ad-d, depression, and anxiety. Before all this happened, I was motivated to do anything, I’d go out and play almost every day, I’d clean, I’d do everything I possibly could. Then, everyday in third grade I would put myself down so much for the smallest things, i’d accuse myself that it was my fault my parents were fighting or it’s my fault that just anything remotely bad happened, I bottled up all my my emotions and wouldn’t let them out if it costed my life and repeated up until maybe fifth grade. Sixth grade came, I noticed I felt shitty every single day, I would constantly be feeling hopeless, drained of energy, just felt like I had no reason to be here, later in seventh grade I started cutting and thinking of ways to kill my self but I was to scare to do it, scared about what happens after death and I thought about how my family and friends would feel, now it’s more like a death wish where i don’t care if something caused me to die, the reason I started thinking this way was cause I just couldn’t take it anymore, it was a repeated thing everyday. Wake up instantly feeling sad and lonely, go to school, hang out with the 3 friends I had who sort of made me happy, go home, and lay in bed all day sad. I finally told my parents about it and they got me into a therapist but nothing he said helped at all. I decided to act like I was doing better emotion wise to get out of seeing him and it worked. I just continued bottling everything up. Ninth grade came along, everything from seventh grade stayed the same.  I got into one very very very toxic relationship, being cheated on, led on, left me for other people only for her to keep me on the side for a backup plan. A couple months after me and her broke up I started liking this one girl. She was very manipulative and used me for the attention and would always say she liked me and wanted to date when she noticed I seemed distant. Then I got into another manipulative relationship. After all that happened, I sort of lost my sympathy and care for people. I don’t feel the connection to friends and girls I date anymore, mentally I know I love them, but emotionally I don’t feel anything about them, I just emotionally feel them as another person. The only times I feel a connection to people is when I’m intoxicated. Now, I’m in tenth grade doing sort of betterI’ve lost all confidence to do anything, it’s a struggle cleaning cause I still feel so drained of energy, just not sad as much. The days I do feel sad, it’s like a small sad ? I don’t know how to explain it, it’s hard to put it in words. It sucks cause everyone thinks I’m lazy but I feel like it’s not but I could be wrong. I still don’t feel any connection to friends and relationships, family problems don’t make me sad now, I get shitted on cause the whole family could be crying over anything and I just sit there, unphased by any of it, usually in the past it would have made me sad cause I was a very caring person to anyone and everyone. Some days I’ll get a huge ego boost and think I’m beyond adorable and hate it. Earlier today I had my ex came all over and she started crying talking about how she wants me back and is scared of losing me and I didn’t even care about it, I didn’t feel sad or anything, only thing I knew to do was hug her and act fake sad so I don’t seem like a dick. I don’t mean to tell a sob story or anything, I just wanna point my problems out. I just want to know if anyone here has anything on what I can do to feel more motivated instead of just sitting around doing nothing, and get more energy so I don’t get bitched on for cleaning. And for the other parts about the sympathy and no personal connection to friends, I was wondering if anyone can tell me something to bring up with a doctor, like some kind of diagnosis to figure this out or fix it. I just sort of want the feeling of butterflies when I see or I’m around people I’m dating, the feeling of bonding and having a good time with a friend."
453,Has anyone here been to a mental hospital and had a terrible experience? Share your story.,"My time sucked. All autonomy taken away. Treated worse than prisoners, according to a kid there who had been in jail before.

They forced us to shower every day and use their shitty shampoo, no conditioner. 

My friend, a black girl that went there the same time as me, had her hair fall out from the mistreatment to it. She was literally forced to wash her hair every day, and use no conditioner, and a shampoo that smelled like fucking bathroom cleaner. Her mother apparently tried to give them the products, but it was ""against the policy"".

Another guy felt he was about to have a meltdown. He asked to go to his room to calm down but they wouldn't let him. (The rooms were locked during the day) So he starts screaming and the gigantic male nurse basically knocks this poor man, who was probably less than 120 pounds at around 5'10, and pulls down his pants in front of everyone, and sticks the gigantic needle into his butt cheek and leaves him on the floor.

They also took me off literally all of my medications and put me on lithium. Just lithium. I went insane from withdrawal and they used this as an excuse to keep me there until my grandma threatened to sue them.

I've been couple times but those are the most memorable."
454,"I really need help, please.","I don't know what to do.

My girlfriend is breaking down. I feel awful. She has a habit of fixating on everything bad in her life, and is now at risk of losing her job. She called me in tears and was saying how the last week has been hell, and how there was nothing good at all in her life. I tried getting her to tell me *something* good that happened today, or in the last week, to give her something good to hold onto. That didn't go so well... 

I tried a usual thing of mine and was giving some tough love by being a little harsh in my approach. It normally works really well with her, because the goal is to force her to take a different perspective by phrasing things as matter-of-fact as possible. It did not work at all this time, and I eventually had to end the call after over an hour. 


To give some context, she has been an incredibly toxic person in my life, and this last month I've really been feeling better and breaking free. I was intending to break up with her so that I don't have to have this horrible weight bringing me down all the time. I asked her for 4 days to just really focus on my schooling (which she agreed to), and she's still being as needy as can be, trying to call me every day. She is a massive dark cloud on my life, and I cannot stay with her any longer. I'm also not willing to keep listening to the same things she complains about every day, because I don't think it's healthy or constructive, and it's taken serious tolls on my own mental and even physical health. 

This is a person I have taken to therapy, which she lived and stuck with for over a year. I've helped her take the steps leading to promotions at the job she is currently losing. She held a management position for over a year. I've done everything I can with my own help, despite feeling that I am constantly beating my head against the same wall. I've made sure she knows what to do in case of suicidal thoughts, I check on with her to make sure she's doing okay, I have maintained a policy of complete transparency with her (up to this point where she does not know of my hope to end the relationship).

She's doing worse than ever, and still leaning on me for everything, saying she's completely unable to function without my help. I am literally the only person she tries to talk to, and the only person she wants to spend time with. And I cannot stay with her anymore. I don't know what to do. Our relationship actually started as what wouldn't have worked out, but she was talking about killing herself at the time, and that I was the only good thing that had come into her life. That went on for about 3 months before she eventually grew on me. This was over 4 years ago.

I'm having flashbacks to those moments, and while she's assured me that she doesn't think that way anymore, tonight makes me question it. And either way, I don't want to leave her feeling completely alone and that she has no one... But I honestly feel like she's been abusing me as a personal feel-good machine, and I can't keep going through that, and the cycle continues and spirals in my head and I just... Help. I need advice direly. I'm finally at the point where I can move on, but I feel like I'll be destroying her by doing it."
455,"My son is having severe mental issues, any advice please?","Good morning all.

My wife and I are at a loss what to do. Over the last 2 weeks my son is falling into a severe pattern of repeating himself and going extremely vacant trying to recall everything that is going on around him. He pretty much refuses to talk as he knows he has to repeat himself and he will reluctantly write his answers to our questions.

He keeps saying his brain is telling him to do it and he can’t stop himself, so he’s fully aware of what’s going on. If we interrupt one of these moments he screams the house down, then to remember it he screams again around 4 times. He is even repeating his walking around the house. When he snaps out of it he cries ‘help me’ which is the most distressing thing for a parent to see as we don’t know what to do.

The NHS have done an MRI and EEG and said that the results are normal, and he is due a CAMHS appointment in 2 weeks.

Basically he is deteriorating rapidly, especially over this weekend. We’re trying all sorts of things like keeping him busy with maths, putting headphones on him with music and even OCD talking that’s supposed to help him calm but nothing is working.

We both have to work and I fear one of us will have to quit to stay home and care for him.

He is 8 years old and is/was a very happy inquisitive young boy who laughs all the time.

Any advice on how we can help him would be greatly appreciated"
456,"I don't have friends, fun, I feel like I can't feel","Yesterday I had a dream were I ran away from home met people had fun and now I feel like my life is gonna come to nothing but having useless friends in middle school and doing nothing but sitting on my computer for days straight through my first years of high school, I dont know what I'm gonna do. I have no interests, I have no friends, I never get invited to partys, and no girl has ever liked me, I feel like I'm not getting to have the fun that every teenager gets to have, I don't have any plan for college, a job, friends, or anything. And I know that coming together to say that you have depression is one thing, but I feel as coming together to say that you have no friends or anything is completely different."
457,"Is it appropriate to go to a walk in clinic instead of a hospital for mental health, in order to get a prescription","For context I am a 20 year old woman living in Canada more specifically Ontario. Sorry for the lengths. I have struggled with mental illness my entire life, and have had various interactions with medical professionals because of this. I left home when I was 17, to go to university and because of a bad home environment, left to my own devices; I struggled to maintain my mental health. I tried to kill myself around February 2019, and went to the hospital. I was receiving care from that period (seeing a clinician, medication 60-80mg of Prozac I can’t seem to remember if I made it all the way up to 80mg, seeing a psychiatrist) I was doing better, then a traumatic incident occurred, as a result I missed an appointment. Then my anxiety makes me think, I don’t deserve treatment and I wasted everyone’s time and money because of OHIP. I think they all hate me, I waste their time, that I am a horrible person for taking up time and space. So I stopped going to not face the embarrassment and the traumatic incident that occurred made it difficult to even get out of bed, and eventually I ran out of medication even though I rationed it which was bad, but it made me be able to get out of bed sometimes. Then another incident occurred, and I was housing insecure for five months, finally I got a place. I want to start taking my medication again and take control of my mental health, but I have no clue how to get a prescriptions or any help again. I don’t want to go to the hospital, because they will force me to lay in a bed, and watch me to make sure I don’t kill myself. I have not had a primary care physicians in years, as well. I am sorry if this isn’t coherent. I am also taking a break from uni, if anyone is wondering why don’t I use university campus doctors."

460,My sister must have some mental health issues but doesn’t want to get treatment for it.,"My family and I have all been worried about my sister’s(F25) mental health, we guessed that she could be bipolar, or narcissistic or maybe some kind of adhd. The fact is she is unhappy, cannot keep a job, and keeping good relationship with her is really really hard because she keeps on not only pushing us away but she manipulates us, lie, try to create problems between us and is generally very difficult. I always forgive her because I believe there are things she cannot control (very strong emotions : anger/happiness/ excitement...) but the lies and the manipulation are hard to accept. She refuses to go to a psychiatrist because she refuses to believe she has issues. What can I do? I am getting to the point where I don’t have the patience to be supportive anymore"

463,"Would this be classified as a manic episode in the case of bipolar 1, or a hypomanic episode in the case of bipolar 2?","There are several questions you need to ask a patient before you can assess whether they have a bipolar disorder, and if they have either bipolar disorder 1 or bipolar disorder 2. The following I'm having trouble with, because I can't asses if I'm having manic episodes or hypomanic episodes (where manic fits with bipolar disorder 1 and hypomanic with bipolar disorder 2). The following are the questions that psychiatrist use to diagnose such a disorder:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Are there periods that last at least a few days in which you feel the opposite of being depressed, in which you work up or are happy and have much more energy than normal?

Answer: Yes

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If yes: Have you felt this way all day or most of the day during that period? Has this ever lasted at least a week and have you been admitted as a result? Have these periods ever seriously put you in trouble with friends or at home, at work or in other situations?

Answer: Yes, it's present during most of the day. It has been a week or longer, but I've never been admitted to the hospital as a result. These periods only ever put me in serious trouble in my romantic relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain that last bit, because I feel like if that criteria is met, it might well be bipolar disorder 1 and not 2.

I've had episodes where I would involve in reckless behaviour, sexually and substance abuse, I have episodes where I seem to fall in love with everyone I meet, only for those feelings to just disappear weeks after, when I re-enter the depressive state of the episodes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So would you classify it as a manic episode or a hypomanic episode?"
464,Depression from university,"Topped my high school only to find out it means shit all in uni, not exactly flunking, just feeling throughly mediocre.
Friends are all getting attached, while i never even held a hand before.
Not introverted or shy, just ugly.
I tot uni would be the thing to make me an adult, make me a ""man"", get attached, start feeling good about myself, but fuck man im halfway through and its still not happening for me."
465,Venting,"I'm just going to rant. 

I feel like I should express self more. Right now I guess I'm just trying to fit in. But I don't want to. I wanna be me. Usually I'll just wear jeans and a hoodie. Just basic shit no one can say anything about. But if I didn't care what people thought maybe I would wear a Lil peep hoodie, or just add more me to my outfits, to my room, to my social media.  Although, I have been getting much better at things like that tho so that's good. I don't even know why I care what people think cause honestly, no one would prob even say Anything negitve .

I feel like no one cares About me. There's times where I'm thinking clearly And I know that people do. But no matter what, I pick apart everything any body says or does and make it seem like everybody hates me.
As I stated before I know it's not true,but there's always the little voice in the back of my head that says no one cares.

There's a lot of stuff that has happened that I think doesn't bother me, but I also think it does. It's like the little problems bother me, but the stuff that's supposed to really matter doesnt(but maybe it does).



Music helps a TON. So do my closest friends, but again when I text them, there is always the little voice saying they don't like you or ur bothering them. Even though they say of the nicest things to me."
466,Doctor has it wrong.,"Ive been diagnosed with severe depression, I believe that is wrong, because I am feeling alright. I wanted to die like 4 days ago and I've little to no interest in activities, but I don't feel like it's depression. I am convinced i'm gonna get murdered by someone, I am always on edge, I am convinced my boyfriend is worried and sometimes I see things. I have delusions and hallucinations, I told her that but she didn't really listen and said it was just paranoia. I also have had weird thoughts, there was fish in the fish tank at this safe house and I wanted to kill them (I never, thankfully). I barely sleep or eat as well. (I am not self diagnosing myself) I think I have psychosis as on the nhs website (nhs is the national health service in the UK), I matched all the symptoms for it basically. I've been put on anti depressants but I really dont feel like I am depressed (I've been really badly depressed before)."
467,Can somebody please help me find out what happened to my brain in 2016?,"As a kid I always had felt like things made sense, that I could memorize and be aware of things. Up until one evening when I was about 16 years old literally everything changed. I was very stressed at the time but still so that I could make sense out of things. My relations to people made sense and everything was in order. Suddenly that evening in a matter of seconds while making a simple decision everything felt weird. I told my parents that something was up but they just assumed that was just overreacting. The reason why this is cause I was gonna have ADD pills exactly the next day. I tried to explain that I felt like something felt wrong but I still tried to keep it together. I felt like I was stuck in a mental void and couldn't think straight. I couldn't sleep for hours and the day later I got my ADD pills. What I noticed was that before I even took the pills that my usual thinking pattern was completely gone. So when I took my pills shortly a few days later my parents wanted me to stop cause I wasn't acting like I used to. I was okay with it though but was annoyed cause it was obviously not the ADD pills that made me this way. So I waited about a week to see if I could pull myself togheter after quiting my pills but I couldn't. My memory was all messed up and I felt sudden panic attacks everywhere I went. I never had a great relationship with my parents since I always used to be afraid of share my mind. But now everything felt different so I had no other option than to talk about how I felt so disconnected and how I could't put things in order. But they just told me that how I felt was due to my autism. I couldn't convince them anything. I didn't go to school for almost a year and they still only saw me as nothing more than an autistic child that had no awareness and never had. I even told them that I felt as if I lacked awareness but they just spoke behind my back and never trusted me. I did get some help though I have no idea what kind of help it was since my parents never told me. I got to speak my mind there but they spoke back to me like I just were making shit up like a spoiled child. They were nice to me though and I think that its my parents to blame for this since they probably told them all about my autism

So after about 2 years later I felt like I could handle things a bit better. I couldn't have relationships with people anymore though since the obvious reason that everyone though I was insane and the fact that I didn't feel like I could make sense of anything anymore.

Before I had no interest in mental health but ever since the ongoing confusion and unexpected panic attacks I didn't feel like doing anything other than finding out what is going on with me. I still have no clear results yet. The closest thing I have is that im experiencing some sort of dissociation. But that I have been going through a seizure seems even more relatable. If I told my parents about it they would get even more worried about my autism"
468,I need a break from life,"Last night I had a mental breakdown/panic attack/whatever the hell that was. I started crying and hyperventilating uncontrollably until I started to bite myself all over my arms and hands. I hadn’t self harmed in years. Then I put red face paint all over my face (which stained
my skin) and continued biting myself. I almost cut my hair off and was tempted to hit my head against the wall and drink the makeup remover I was using to get the paint off. I debated waking my mother up and telling her about it but I felt bad about making her miss sleep hours so I went to bed and slept 9 hours uninterrupted.

I don’t know what the hell happened there. But I know it’s all too much. For many months now I’ve been ferling anxious, depressed, with lots of intrusive thoughts and paranoia. I thought I was finally happy, having found an amazing boyfriend, good friends and a career I love. Now I just wanna isolate myself from everything. I’m not motivated to keep studying what I love because I’m not even sure I wanna keep going down that path after quitting everything to go do it. I have the most loving boyfriend but sometimes he irritates me so much and I don’t know if my standards are too high or too low but I feel like breaking up with him, go have meaningless sex that I know will mess me up and regret it for the rest of my life. I wanna destroy everything. I wanna live in a black bubble where nothing ever happens and I just exist in a parallel universe until I’m ready to come back. I hate myself. Everything makes me upset. I can’t see the joy in anything."
469,How to make the pain stop?,"My life has been really shit the past few months. 

Non stop conflict at home between me, my mom and my stepdad. Constantly being judged, feeling like I’m walking on eggshells around my parents. Both my parents are both physically and emotionally abusive, and have been for years. 

Last year I had exams coming up, but then I went to the hospital with a really bad case of both the flu and pneumonia.  I nearly died and had to be put in an induced coma. The flashbacks aren’t as bad as they used to be, but they are still there. 

Not even three weeks after this, I had exams. The stress just about broke me. On top of that, I had to talk two friends out of killing themselves during this time (One IRL friend, and one online friend), I empathized with them a lot, and felt all of their problems on top of my own. 

At this point I felt completely emotionally exhausted. I tried retreat into an RP sub on reddit, and that helped me cope with my life for a while. But then two of one of my characters closest friends died. And then, my other characters love interest had to die because the writer of that characters girlfriend was jealous of the characters relationship or some shit. I know it seems laughably insignificant, but I really identified with both of my characters and their friendships and romantic relationships were so wholesome and gave me a little hope for my own life, now that they are over it makes me feel depressed and physically ill whenever I think about it. 

Literally today, there was another huge fight with my parents. It started out as a friendly debate, but it got way out of hand. It ended with my stepdad kicking me and my mum out of the house, and even physically taking a swing at me (Though he thankfully missed) 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I fucking hate my life, and my main escape, RPing on reddit, just makes me even more depressed. I just want to die, I want to just stop existing and don’t have to worry about my pain anymore.

Is there any way to get rid of my emotions? I don’t want to feel anymore, I’m just so tired and I want the pain to stop."
470,My dad has schizophrenia and my mom has BPD - scared to say anything about experiencing symptoms of both,"The title is a mess, so let me try to explain. My dad is a diagnosed schizophrenic, to the point where he constantly thinks shit like Jesus Christ is a lizard (no joke), that I have actual superpowers, that dragons are going to take over the world, and that certain family members are trying to kill him. My mom, on the other hand, is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. As you can see, mental disorders seem to run in the family. 

Technically, I’ve only been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and PTSD. I was put on zoloft, which I took for 6 months and it did not help at all. I had a different therapist I saw for a short amount of time that would occasionally antagonize and tease me about how I was a “crazy borderline” and would label my psychotic episodes to “puberty” and “teenage angst”. He would tell me I have BPD and acknowledge my psychotic symptoms but he would refuse to diagnose me because I had just turned 17 at the time. 

After that, I refused to go back to therapy and treatments and I never told anyone that I really did have BPD and I definitely did not tell anyone that I had occasional psychotic episodes. Now, I’m going to turn 18 in weeks, and I haven’t been on any medication or reached out for help since, and I am at the absolute worst possible point for my mental health.


I keep a journal/record of everything I am capable of recognizing that is happening to me so I don’t feel like I’m going totally crazy: For the last two months I’ve been fighting with my head over suicidal idealizations and “voices”. I have this issue where when I get really bad anxiety (at work, late at night, when it’s dark) I can’t hear anything that’s happening around me  or people’s voices because all I can hear in my head is my own heartbeat. I try to avoid being around who I consider my friends because I can’t avoid getting really angry because it just feels like they’re only around me out of pity, and it’s like they’re all calling me crazy behind my back. I distance myself from my family because, as I see it, they’re only caring for me because they legally have to. I’ll have long periods that last days or weeks where I won’t get out of bed except to go to work. I dropped out of high school. I can’t remember anything about my life past fifth grade, even if a particular event that I experienced is told to me by family. My weight has dropped from 140 to the 98-105 range. I’ve experienced multiple brief psychotic episodes, and when I am recognizing reality, I’ve noticed that my typical psychotic symptoms that I have always had have gotten exceptionally worse. In the last 2-3 weeks I have been completely unable to recognize myself in the mirror. Usually I can recognize that I am looking at myself but that I just don’t look like myself, but I also think it’s someone else looking back at me and they are telepathically talking to me and I talk back to them. At certain times it’s like I have forgotten how to read, which can last whole days sometimes. When I’m at work I usually enter a manic state. When I go to sleep in a dark room I will have nightmares  (but I’m not entirely sure if I’m actually asleep or it’s just vivid hallucinations?) of people talking to me loudly, and I sometimes feel like they’re trying to kill me. When this happens I don’t act out physically, like I said I’m either asleep or some weird dissociative state but I’m not sure. Three days ago I had a psychotic episode and all I know/remember is that I ended up completely shaving my head (I ended up liking how it looks but it didn’t happen in a normal state). I am completely unable to recognize my emotions and feelings as my own, so I get really confused in situations where I’m supposed to express something like love, and I’ll end up just trying to fake myself through it, which usually makes me upset at myself. Last week I kept finding myself getting verbally aggressive or angry about my managers to my other coworkers for no reason and a couple of times to their face. 

It’s like I’ve been on the verge of psychosis or schizophrenia for the last 2 months but I’m not quite there, unless I’m actually having an episode. I can recognize when my hallucinations/delusions and behavioral/social behaviors are irregular; I just can’t stop them from happening. I know that something is wrong with me, and I can see that it has gotten significantly worse in this two month span in the last couple of weeks. What it feels like, to me, is that what I normally experience from my BPD has twisted my paranoia into just always being right on the border of psychosis. What I know is that I can’t recognize that the general paranoia and general disassociation and other things that I can attribute to my BPD aren’t necessarily real or deserving, but that I can recognize that the things that make me feel like I’m on the brink of psychosis (not recognizing myself, nightmare hallucinations, voices, etc) aren’t part of reality unless I am actually having a psychotic episode (even then, they don’t last long and I realize what’s happened later). 

I am scared. I am scared because I feel like I’m going to go crazy, and the recognition of my symptoms is the only thing that’s keeping me (partially) sane. I am scared because I can feel all of this getting worse. I am scared because I don’t want to get another toxic therapist who just makes everything even worse. I am scared because I know that, at least right now, I don’t deserve inpatient treatment, and that if I tell people what I’m experiencing they will want to take me away no matter what. I am scared because I don’t want to be diagnosed with schizophrenia or permanent psychosis because I know that’s not what’s happening to me, or I at least know I’m not there yet. I’m scared because, if I do reach out to help, what if I’m not able to explain what I’m experiencing and how I am feeling in the correct way so I just end up hurting myself? What if the people in my life end up thinking I’m crazy? But at the same time, I’m scared I’ll turn into a fusion of both my mom and my dad. 

How do I even find the right help for this? I know that my explanation is probably confusing, and I know it’s extremely complex and I’ve seen instances of people being given the wrong diagnosis because of it. I don’t know how to even go about finding the right psychologist to help me because so many of them aren’t experienced enough to be able to properly help me (which I know is true, because I’ve had some tell me that to my face and I’ve had others give me the wrong treatment before). I have been dealing with my BPD and on/off again psychotic symptoms since I was 13 years old. I have always been capable of managing it, and even if my BPD has destroyed so many friendships and relationships, caused me to self harm for years, saw me through multiple adolescent suicide attempts, a short lived xanax addiction, impulsive actions in school and home, it has never gotten so bad that I haven’t been able to bounce back. What I mean is that, at this moment in time, I am not at risk of harming myself or attempting suicide, I am not at risk to violent actions or to the possibility of harming others. I am still capable of recognizing reality and realizing that my actions that I described are not normal. But it’s never, ever, been this fucking bad. I have never in my life struggled so badly with my paranoia. I think I’ve had more psychotic episodes in these last two months than I’ve had my entire life. It is extremely difficult for me to be able to open up about what I’m experiencing, because I know the stigma surrounding my symptoms - and I’ve seen them at their worst in my own family. I am no stranger to schizophrenia and permanent psychosis. And I know what inpatient is, and I’ve witnessed firsthand of a friend being sent to inpatient because of psychosis. I know I’m not a psychologist, or an expert, and I know that I only understand what’s going on with me up to a certain point and really the professionals are the ones who make the final call. But at this moment in time, I’m not there yet. It took everything in me to be able to reach out for help,  but when I stopped being able to manage what I’m going through I knew I had no choice because I cannot let that happen to me. I am terrified of one day experiencing a psychotic episode like I sometimes do and just not being able to come out of it, and I won’t even be able to realize it. I need fucking help, because I don’t know what to do anymore, and I need this to stop. I’m almost a legal adult. Once I turn 18, if I keep getting worse like I have been, if I ever have an episode or act out in a place and people judge me to be insane or dangerous, I could get my entire life taken away from me. I have a good future ahead of me, I have a girlfriend that I love and is willing to love me regardless of all that’s wrong with me, and I cannot lose that for anything. I’m about to receive a promotion in a few weeks into a management position at my job, I’ve been thinking about taking classes to finish my diploma or get my GED. I have dreams and aspirations and I have a genuine want for a good future. And I see that if I don’t get help for all of this bullshit, if I don’t take control of my mind and I just keep getting worse like I have been to the point of no return, I could lose the things that matter most to me. And if I lose the things that define who I am, I’m afraid that I will not be able to come back from it. I don’t ever want to have to go through another suicide attempt. I know what psychosis feels like, and I don’t ever want to have to live with that for longer than just an episode. I want to be able to recognize myself again. I want the time I spend with my girlfriend and the time I spend at work around people that I call my friends to be “normal” again. I don’t want to hurt the people around me that I know I care about just because I’m incapable of controlling my head. I can’t live with hurting anyone else, because I have in the past. I can’t live with any more people thinking that I’m inhumane or dangerously impulsive or attention seeking or anything like that. I cannot go through another breakup because I let my BPD control my life. I cannot let myself give up on my aspirations like I did with high school. I’ll give myself credit, I have grown as a person, and I have improved on recognizing my symptoms and I’m way less suicidal than I’ve been in the past, and I’m able to stay more positive about bad situations. But with how bad everything has gotten recently; with everything that I’ve told you that is happening to me, some of which I’ve never experienced before, and the fact that I’ve never had to deal with it being so unbearable and constant.... I’m not able to control everything like I’ve been doing, like my improvements were for nothing. I can see my old self again reflected in an even worse version because I can’t bounce back at all, I just keep falling. Sure, my recognition of all of this accounts for something, and I think of as a good thing because it made me come to you, but it’s not making any of this any better. 

Like I said, I’m not a psychologist- obviously. And really, I can only understand myself to the best of my ability, and really I can only guess about where I’m headed. I only have the knowledge about BPD and schizophrenic symptoms and psychosis because of my experiences personally, from the research I’ve done in my own, and what I’ve witnessed from the people around me. I think I’ve read every scientific article and google pop up possible about all of this. That doesn’t make me you by any means because I know you could look me in the eyes and tell me I’m completely wrong about my understandings of my issues and I’d believe you. You have the power to send me to inpatient whether I agree with it or not, and I accept that fact. You could tell me that I’m the craziest person that’s ever walked through your doors, and that there’s no hope for me, and that I’m already crazy, and I wouldn’t get to disagree with you. But I’m smart. I’m suffering but that’s not all I’m doing, because I’m also taking the actions to understand myself. I don’t just keep a journal to remind me of my sanity, I keep the journal also so I can learn more about what I’m dealing with. My research isn’t incoherent or a part of any of my issues, it’s genuine and it’s thought out, it’s extensive and knowledgeable and unbiased, it’s based off of scientific fact and personal experiences. I was one of the top students throughout high school. I could have gone to an ivy if I had not dropped out. I don’t let my attempts to rationalize my mental health coincide with becoming a part of my issue. I deserve to be taken seriously because I didn’t walk in here having no clue what’s wrong with me. I’m dealing with psychosis in aspect but I’m not... I haven’t lost my touch with reality or sanity to the point that I’m past the point of outpatient yet. 

Please understand how difficult it was for me to come here. I had to push through the fear that whoever I ended up talking to wouldn’t or refuse to understand me. It would probably be easy to rationalize many reasons to disregard my explanations and declarations of not already being beyond that point. The things that I’ve admitted to are terrifying and to probably 99% of people, if I told them any of it with such brutal honesty like I’ve told you, if I told my grandma what I’m dealing with, i’d have already been sent away, lost my job, or whatever. 

You’re the expert. But, in my opinion at least, I believe that my interpretation of my issues should at least be taken into account. Whatever treatment you wish for me, I will accept, I won’t put up a fight or anything. But I’m not to that certain point yet. You’ve dealt with this kind of stuff more than me so really you’re the only one that truly knows what level I’m at, but.... i know it’s bad, what I’m dealing with is really bad, but I don’t need to be sent away yet. I truly believe that, obviously not on my own, that’s why I forced myself to come here, I can get back to where I was before these two months and, you know, improve even more. I struggle with trust immensely not just towards other but also myself in the form of self doubt. it used to be my biggest issue before all of this other stuff began. But I believe in myself and I think that should be recognized. I believe that this is reversible where I’m at now without having to be under supervision. 

I’m sorry, I’m ranting. I’m really struggling right now to be comfortable In this situation but I know I needed to come here. I never know if I’ve explained what I planned to in a way that makes sense. When I know I’m putting myself in a risky situation I try to plan ahead for these types of things, which is probably why I haven’t shut up and I probably should. I’m being honest here and it’s hard for me to be honest about what I’m dealing with. I’m so used to shoving it down inside and trying to figure it out myself, That I don’t properly know how to let another person help me with all of this. I just needed to get it out, so I know for my sake I did my best in advocating for myself. I know how much of a bad spot I’m in but I also don’t doubt my belief for a second that I’m too the point that I need to be sent away yet."
471,my body wants to hurt itself,"i keep feeling my body want to move. it wants to move to hurt itself. i'm getting restless. i want to hit myself. i'm keeping myself from punching my head. it's really hard. my arms are uncomfortable. i want to punch myself. i don't know why i want to punch myself so bad. back when i self harmed, i never really hit myself like that. i don't have a place i can be alone to hurt myself anyway. i'm scared that any moment i have alone, i'll be trying to not hurt myself. i can't help but think about it. the thoughts won't go away. this is very stressful for me. i haven't self harmed in three or so years now. i had to take naltrexone to stop cutting myself. i've been clean for so long. but i keep having urges to do it again. i'm so scared of a relapse. i'm scared because i don't know if it will be worse than before. i don't want to hurt myself again. but i really do. it feels like my only option to get my feelings out. this is really stressful. this is really stressing me out. i have anxiety. i have intrusive thoughts. i can't be by myself. i feel like it's going to happen. i don't mean to just give up. but it's starting to really take over my mind."
472,I feel like a failure even if I know I’ve succeeded.,"Example would be today, I came back home from a school exam, I passed it, so I should be happy, right? No, I cried uncontrollably the whole way home, I kept telling myself what a failure I am, that I’m dumb and should just harm myself. I was really emotional about it until I calmed down a while ago and realized my thoughts were not making sense at that moment. 

This thing keeps happening to me a lot, there were moments where I would pass an exam with flying colors and my first thoughts were “that’s not good enough, I must do better, I must have a retake” even though I basically had 100/100 I was really upset with myself. (I’m using school as example because I don’t do much else in life). 

And I really don’t know what to think about it or how to work on myself to solve these feelings. I’ve tried google searching but haven’t quite found anything that would match what I described. 

I definitely would appreciate an advice, if any of you have one, on how to approach this, what to search etc.

I did shared this with my GP, who I felt like dismissed this exact problem of mine, prescribed me antidepressants and said that I don’t need psychologist yet. And since she won’t give me a paper saying that I need a specialist(insurance covered) and because I don’t have the coin to go to one on my own, I am searching internet for help."

I need tips/ advice to how to stay motivated to continue life.

Right now I’m not suicidal however I’m starting to relapse to my eating disorder. My antidepressant have made me gain a lot of weight which is a real struggle and I can’t motivate myself to work out, I have zero energy, which makes me starve myself again because that’s the only way I know how to loose weight. 

I’m staring to slip in school as well, I have always had good grades with little effort but now the school demands more of me and I’m still a high achiever but can’t focus on studies at all.

477,Anxiety,"Lately my anxiety been getting so much worse. Ina. Nutshell here the story 
2015- my mom got really sick she refused to have an ambulance called until she couldn’t stand it despite me and my sister pleading with her to just go to the hospital
2015-2016- she was in and out of hospitals, my older sister and I were taking care of her. But it was mostly me since she was never home
During that time I was taken by cps because my sister was neglecting me and my mom had finally gone into a hospital
I spent a lot of time in a detention center just cause they had no where to put me 
I was living with a “friend” but her parents mainly her mom was mentally and emotionally abusive doing things like making jokes about a stealing problem I really struggled with, calling me a kleptomaniac, and a pyromaniac when I showed interest in a fire (I’d never been near fire my whole life so it was a brand new experience) and she would use my mom being a teacher as a way to guilt me when I couldn’t bring myself to go back to school and I’d hide out for a few weeks. Shed also come into the basement where I slept at outrageous times just to “talk to me” which would always end in her yelling at me. 
She’d make comments of how she didn’t want me near her son cause she thought I’d try to have sex with him (I was 15 he was 11-12) and she just was way too open about her sex life with me.
2017-my mom passed away and I was officially put into foster care where I went from home to home to home until I finally landed with my current foster mom . During that time I began to blame myself for her death due to me getting easily frustrated and walking out on my mom when she needed help. 
I’m completely aware I couldn’t have stopped her death and I was only a child but I still feel so horrible for how I treated her and how I didn’t help her when she needed it the most and I still blame myself for her dying in so much pain. 
I recently learned that my anxiety took its worst turn after I left the “friends” house and now it affects almost every aspect of my life and I hate it so much"
478,I can’t cope,"Don’t think I can cope anymore, I can’t work. I’ve tried to get back into work from home but I still can’t cope. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal again or able to work, how will I provide? I can’t expect my husband to just work. I keep thinking about killing myself so I don’t have to do it anymore. I don’t know what to do."
479,I hope everyone has a good day! I would like to ask you about something.,"I feel down in the dumps lately... even though I am followed up by a doctor and take medication i decided to go see my university's health counselor as well ( who also is a psychiatrist). I do not have full faith in my psychiatrist and  I would also like to hear the opinion of another specialist as well... I feel that it is like cheating though and also have a feeling that they will both conspire against me ( yeah bingo, I was diagnosed with psychosis :P). Any comment on my thoughts is well welcomed. Thanks a lot for reading my post. I again hope you have a good day!"
480,I am having a war inside me.,"I have never engaged in a relationship, nor have I fallen in love (I guess). Everytime I think about the subject, my heart beat rate rockets, I run short of breath and feel really dizzy.

This way, I think it is rather reasonable to think of me as philophobic, even though I got no love related traumas at all. Still, I am heterosexual and do find girls attractive, leading to near-constant philophobic crisis. Every damn thing makes me have a crisis (I have been having these since I watched the third season of Stranger Things, which pictures love with ease enough to almost persuade me). I wish my phobia to win, so that I can free myself from this hell. Any advice?"
481,Shall I stay or quit from my current job ?,"I kind of need an advice. I graduated on Summer 2019 from Computer Science. I got an offer job to the company I was doing internship. Even though I was emotionally overwhelmed I took the job. I was having many panic attacks in the summer, I couldn't sleep and I was worried and stress the whole time. I was thinking of quitting but I said that all these feelings was normal for a first job. So I forced myself to keep working. The environment here is pretty friendly and I have hour flexibility. I must work from the office.Apart from my stress, I also have social anxiety and it really bothers me that there are many people in the building. 

7 months have passed. I can sleep at night, I controll some of my stress, but there is still plenty of stress. I also don't have guidance of what im doing, cause im one of the few software developers here.

I'm having the thought of not renewing my contract on May 2020  and stay unemployed for couple months. Until I make up my mind and control my stress. I will try to code and learn things by myself. In about 5-6 months I will either apply for master or apply for other job.

But I don't know if all these thoughts are okay. Will it be helpful if I won't have a job for some time? Or is it a life skill to overcome my stress while I work?

I also started taking Zoloft those 2 days, I don't know if they make difference or change my mind in a couple of weeks. I will take gladly take advise or tip of any kind."
482,"Questions - mental health/illness ""gatekeeping""","I am aware of what it is, but I still don't get a few things, and I have no idea where else I can post/educate myself about it, so I thought of this reddit thread! Genuinely interested in people's perspectives/explanations on a few specific questions regarding MH gatekeeping:

1. Is it still ""gatekeeping"", if one is literally qualified to recognize and diagnose mental illnesses (or the likelihood of absence of them)?
2. If the answer is yes, are we saying that self-diagnosis of mental illness is always more valid than a qualified outsider's opinion?
3. Is it considered MH ""gatekeeping"" if someone literally doesn't meet the current DSM criteria for a specific disorder, and someone else simply acknowledges that fact?

Or ""that makes me so mad!"" Even though I don't have PTSD I have trauma of sorts. And I had a really bad experience trying to tell my friends ""That was really triggering for me"" back in high school (Idk what it was about but I definitely wasn't 100%). And they started laughing at me and calling me 'triggered' when I got upset and annoyed. 

I can only imagine what it's like for people with trauma disorders who have flashbacks to hear this being used so wrongly. 

I understand that trigger has other meanings like ""pull the trigger"" of a gun or something. I'm not pissed about that. I'm pissed that the word to explain my situation or my feelings has been taken away from and made into a joke. So I just tell my friends the meaning of the word and how it's properly used and why it upsets me and we're usually good from there.

497,"I'm about to turn 27. I suffer anxiety, depression and OCD. I have a fear of becoming elderly and a bigger fear of dying, I have been on anti depressants for 2 years and have tried multiple forms of therapy. I am mentally exhausted. What other options do I have?","I have felt this way since I was about 10 years old. I am an only child. I have recently decided to stop speaking to my father as he is a narcissist and refuses get any help for his own issues. Despite having opened up to my mother as much as possible I feel she will never truly understand as I know she doesn't feel the same way. 

I have tried psychotherapy, counselling and CBT over the years. I do not find meditation relaxing. I rarely drink alcohol. I smoke a little cannabis during the evenings and weekends to take the edge off but understand this is not the answer and have good control over this becoming a problem. I do not smoke cigarettes and keep in good physical shape. Other recreational drugs aren't very often at all these days now that I becoming older and my priorities are different. 

I am self employed as i've struggled to find enthusiasm and progress within a workplace. I enjoy doing what I do for a living and enjoy being busy as it keeps my mind distracted. But on the other side I feel like I spend way too much time in my own head compared to when I was I working in an office. I do not feel I will go back to office work as I have put a lot of work into building my business and feel i'm slowly starting to get somewhere which is an achievement for me as i've spent a lot of my life not knowing what I want to do. 

I live with my partner who is very understanding and am not afraid to open up to her despite her feeling different about life like my mother. She knows me inside out. I have been taking mirtazapine for 2 years now and have been on the same dose of 30mg for most of this. Although this helps me get to sleep at night. I no longer feel it has much extra benefit as an SSRI. I am currently in the process of being tested for autism so I am waiting for the result of it before I seek any changes to my medication. I have debated DMT at some point but it's a case of being in the right place at the right time. I know any drugs aren't the answer. 

I am not suicidal despite suffering intrusive thoughts in relation. I struggle year around but during winter my issues affect me on a deeper level. My grandma has not been well recently which I think has triggered this further along with my birthday which is within the next week. I have been in a bit of a hole since before christmas that I am struggling to get out of. 

I feel lost and don't know what to do. I feel like i've exhausted any coping mechanisms as my fears have now become a voice in the back of my head which repeat themselves like a broken record. It's both shattering and boring at the same time feeling this way. I'm tired of living like this. It is getting to the point where i'm becoming angry trying to focus on everyday tasks because of this and it saddens me when I shout at my partner and I don't want to be that way. But i'm struggling and I don't know what to do anymore. 

I can't remember the last time I felt truly happy despite everything positive going for me. I don't know what to do next. I have been trying to 'Get busy living' for a while now without much success and i'm just trying to find a coping mechanism to get through this finite life."
498,I don’t see myself as everyone who’s romantically involved with me sees me.,"I’ve spent years trying to fix things about myself, in some areas I succeeded and in others I just continue the toxic cycle. Yesterday night the woman whom I have been really good friends with for 7 years, and eventually turned romantic told me that she cannot do this thing with me and her anymore. I was confused because I didn’t realize until she explained in depth how inconsiderate, selfish of an asshole I am to her on occasion. She told me I’m verbally abusive and don’t even recognize it. The problem is I honestly didn’t see it, although I’ve heard this over and over again. 

I so badly do not want to be this person whom I have seen my father be to my mother and myself growing up, I vowed to be different but I don’t know what to do to change it. I’m losing a great woman because I consciously unaware and telling myself that my behavior isn’t damaging. I’m lost."
499,I need help.,"So I feel like there is a lot to say here. I guess a little background would help though. I have been diagnosed with several anxiety disorders, BPD, and a Bipolar Disorder. I’ve severally struggled with depression and pretty much everything that comes with those illnesses. In October 2019 it got so bad I was hospitalized. However, I was able to get on the right meds and was doing very well. A little more background though that I feel may play into my current condition. For several years, I was a heavy user of psychedelics with a very specific focus on LSD and Weed. I had several very scary and disturbing trips where I went into a full blown psychosis and thought I’d be stuck like that, but always pulled back. I know, I’m an idiot for indulging anyway. Okay, so final background piece. Within the last year I came to the realization that I am also transgender. It’s always been there, I was just in denial.  So now to the current problems. About 4 months ago, I was smoking and it triggered another psychotic episode. This time I couldn’t stop shaking and had a really intense connection with the “transgender” side of me, Maxine. However, that connection went from only when I smoke to everyday constantly. She almost acts like her own entity. I very unintentionally started referring to myself as “we.” She’s constantly pushing and prodding at my mind it fells like. I’ve also developed a really irritating twitch that gets triggered by certain things, but especially when thinking about anything related to Max. Loved ones are starting to get worried that I’ve developed some type of alter which I don’t really believe just cause the symptoms don’t match up. However, it almost feels like that sometimes. It’s starting to freak me out though and would really appreciate any advice or help. Also, yes I am seeing a psychiatrist, I just don’t see him for another two weeks. Thank you all so much."

501,How can I once again have feelings and emotions in my life?," 

I've been bullied when I was 15 for a period of almost a year when I mixed with some ""bad apples"". That plus rather often uses of Marijuana. This period ended for me when I was nearly 16 with an almost psychotic panic attack when after rather a heavy dose of THC I became very paranoid and almost schizophrenic for a whole day. The schizophrenic episode and paranoia significantly subsided the next morning but was still lingering maybe for a week. That was the last time I met with those ""friends"" and the last time I've had Marijuana. I'm now 21 years old.

I already skipped many hoops and overcame many scars since that period. The most profound healing effect in my life is also the most recent. Few books and journaling rather I am happy to say how I learned again how to love, hope, trust, have meaning and values to strive for, etc... I'm really grateful and happy for that.

But one problem still lingers, nevertheless. The void and emptiness and greyness how I feel about almost everything in life. In thought and mind, I think I have healed and improved - I know to love, I know to have hope, I know the joy life can offer... But I still don't feel these things... I am still periodically escaping from myself and life in general - into the world of consumption and escapism - to feel at least something, but most of the time to escape the feeling of emptiness and void. And maybe my constant escaping to the artificially vivid and bombastic world of the internet, youtube, video games left me desensitized to more subtle and simple real life which now looks to be uninteresting. Maybe my escapism is the cause, not the symptom.

To put it more metaphorically - I think I have healed my mind, but not yet my soul. It is still something but clearly not enough.

I've been ever since too analytical and intellectual - always locked within my head. Many times disregarding my feelings and emotions. But now there is no mind to blame, where the problem lies is apparent - I am emotionally numb, except when I can feel anxiety, dread, and frustration (from which I usually run from).

Whole life and existence feel very lackluster, grey, almost boring to me. Nothing really convinces me to engage and live it. And I know it is not true, I know I don't want to feel this way - but yet I do. Sometimes I have a moment of enlightenment and the world for a brief moment feels once again rich, playful, exciting and tolerable - with all of its sweetness and bitterness, Sometimes this ""enlightenment"" comes arrives almost on its own, sometimes - after I hear a great piece of music, watch beautiful cinema, etc... But, nevertheless, it always goes away in a short time.

I want to feel life, I want to have emotions once again. Because in this grey void of existing. Everything is such a toil when in most things I can't feel any joy or even fear - something to honestly strive for, something to run away from.

Please, help me, anything - I just want to feel alive again, not like a lifeless robot. What can I do?"

I don’t have scales but I’ve been seeing the doctor regularly who tells me I’ve been losing weight and I’m slightly underweight right now. The thing is I’m *trying to lose weight*, I just need ana‘s control..

Even if I did find a reason I wouldn’t know where to start or what to do.
Can anybody help?

I tried intuitively eating and listening to when my body is hungry and full but that doesn’t seem to be working well.."
503,Someone told me this got deleted?,"Please help me understand my mom...

My mom definitely has mental health issues that greatly affect the relationships she has with myself and my sister. The problem is that I don’t know what it is or how to deal with it. I will try my best to explain and hopefully find a way to start repairing our relationship. 

So, I’ve always known my mom to be an unpleasant person. She is rather pessimistic and takes things to extremes, starting arguments all the time. Growing up I saw this, and experienced it, but it wasn’t until a couple years ago when I entered my 20s that I really saw how manipulative her actions were. I looked back on my childhood and realized how often she would make my sister and I cry—- like 4 days out of the week at the age of 5 and on. My sister and I definitely are damaged from this and are overly emotional to the point that if someone raises their voice I think they’re mad at me, but honestly I am glad we turned out okay and ironic enough have a high level of optimism. 

Anyways, I have never not felt loved, but I so often feel loathed and disliked by my mom. She is someone I can count on and always takes care of me, but is not loving. I used to think she simply did not feel emotion and had a low level of emotional intelligence but some of her actions are very calculated and manipulative. She very much buys my love, getting me clothes or jewelry after we get into bad fights. She never acknowledges her fault or apologizes so instead she buys my forgiveness. That signals to me that she is aware of her actions and rather than comforting me when I’m balling my eyes out begging her to tell me what is wrong she gets angry. She then uses that as a reason to say that I am ungrateful and don’t appreciate her when another argument arises. She twists things in her head and creates scenarios in which she believes I did something wrong or am out to get her. I truly don’t know if she purposely does that or her mind is telling her things.

There’s been lots of time when I have said I’m done with it all. It’s so hard to tell always have to remind myself of my worth when she’s planted this idea in my head. Her actions are always emotional, and she’s said some horrible things over the years. It’s so confusing because my mom has raised my sister and I to be confident in social situations and drilled in a hard work ethic but thinks we rebel whenever we don’t agree with her. I love my mom but I don’t understand how a mom can do these things to her daughters. 

Thank you if you read for this long, it feels good just to say it all."
504,How do I coup with the fact that my brother is extremely unhealthy?,"I myself love fitness I started body building I eat lots of food protein drinks and supplements and my brother I'll be lucky to see him eat a bag of popcorn in a day he cant even manage to drink a small glass of milk and I've seen him go to the gym once in a while but the truth is that if he's not eating anything than he's wasting his time
 (its great that he's trying tho) which is why it drives me to tears thinking about him knowing he isn't going to feel healthy in his life and this has probably led to his diagnosis of depression and suicidal thoughts and he's getting plenty of help with that"
505,Am I going insane?,"I’m finding reality really fake and scary. I take LSD every now and again. The first 5 times was amazing and helped me deal with a lot going on in my life. I had one experience that has completely destroyed my concept of reality. Me and my close friend chose to drop some acid, not much half a tab. 

My state of mind was kind of in a bad way but not so much that I would notice if that makes sense. We took the acid and waited to be sailed away to this alternative reality we’ve been some many times before. This was different though about an hour in we experienced really intense telepathy. I had no control of my mind, it was like my friend was peeling back every layer of my memories but I could only focus on my negative ones. He saw my regrets, pain and biggest secrets, he saw how it shapes my personality and haunts me and so did I. I saw how these events in my life have become me I’m just a walking talking manifestation of these horrific memories. My mind felt like my friend was pulling out all of this hate from within me. My mind could only focus on negative, asking questions and giving answers that I don’t believe in, or at least I don’t think I do? I just don’t know who I am anymore. 

After a few hours my friend decided to go to a different room and leave me on my own. Which I was happy with. So I lay in bed closing my eyes and seeing all this mechanical machinery working away and as though it was trying to speak to me, the images of snakes and humanoid lizards. I also accessed my memory to another time I was tripping with some other close friends, it was very different this time I had forgotten a lot. I had already had the same telepathic experience with my other friends, I was told I’d be able to have this level of communication with many others if I deal with my problems so my mind isn’t so fucked. I could do that or forget. I chose to forget about everything last time. I distanced my self from those friends without knowing the reason. I repeated over and over to myself this time NOT to forget and that I would deal with my problems head on. 

Towards the end of the trip I realised something. Either me or my friend had to die that night. I was given a choice in my brain either my friend would murder me or my friend would committee suicide. If I wanted him to kill me all I had to do was ask for his help. This was the hardest choice I’ve ever made not because it was a hard choice but more so because it was so easy to choose for me to live. The next day was awkward as you’d imagine, I didn’t have any personality I was just a thing that was there. We’ve never spoken about this telepathic experience. 

I met up with him a few months later I was really nervous but glad to see him. We went to the pub had a really interesting fun conversations. But we somehow got round to taking acid again, it always seems to happen when we’re around wether we want to or not we take acid I don’t even remember taking it. The telepathy happened again straight away but instantly said to my friend I need to be on my own I’m sorry I don’t want my negative trip to effect yours. So I went to bed and had the similar kinds of visions and memories as last time with the same ending my friend dying and me living. 

The next day was awkward but fine and we went to the pub again and met these two middle aged women had a really good time and went back to ours and took acid with them. I know, but it’s like I’m not in control of it. It’s like the acid comes to me instead of me going to the acid but more likely I’m just really stupid. 

So this night was hellish haha. We went back to theirs did some Mandy and listened to music then the telepathy happened again, but it was more feelings based, I could see the energy coming of these woman I could see it all dance around my environment. It’s hard to explain how I got to this point because there is no words for it but I had this realisation at that point that everything in reality isn’t real and that I effect everything I am everything. It’s all just my imagination. Nothing is real. Everything I interact with is a lesson about myself acid just makes it obvious and these beings I’ve created become aware of it and all want to help me be better because they’re just as tired as me. I’m stuck in limbo.

I was laying on the couch whilst these two woman were laughing at me, my friend came over to me and said do you want to leave and at that point the women wanted me to stay it was like there was two devils on my shoulder my friend being an angel on the other. It was like choosing good from bad but I understood that these women weren’t evil I just saw them that way as I didn’t want to stay. It was my version of good and bad. I just need to do thing I actually want to do not what I think I want to do, not what I think these imaginary beings around me would like. They just want me to be happy. The just provide choices. 

We left the women and went back home. We stayed up and talked most of the night it really was like I was in the company of a higher spirit trying to teach me things about myself, but at the same time I had these deep unsettling feelings that he really wanted to hurt me. I was given the choice again that night I chose myself again but I didn’t sleep. I left the next morning that was a few months ago now we haven’t met up since we’ve exchanged a few texts on my b day him saying how much he appreciates me as a friend and I said the same back. I have a problem with believing it though I do truly love him and want him in my life but I just think deep down he wants to kill me or at least wants me to die but I chose me over him before I fell asleep those nights, so don’t we all deep down wants others to die along as it’s not us? Or do I just feel guilty? Does any of this even matter if nothing is real? 

I’ve been having flashbacks to the telepathy and some from of PTSD in my day to day life, I have multiple triggers and I have really bad thoughts that don't feel like mine, it seems to be getting more intense. I can also see past this reality sometimes where objects move unnaturally and I can see how fake everything is.  I don’t know if I’m going insane or if this is actually real and me talking about it is fucking everything up. I just need some people to come up to me and tell me this telepathy stuff is real in our normal voices so I can try and fucking deal with it because I don’t know if it’s real or I’m just schizo. 

Why should I even care if it is real though? Because nothing is. I guess because I have to live it.

506,I feel like ending my life is more of an option now,"I (24F) have been really struggling lately since starting a new job. I’ve struggled with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Since I was about 11-12 I’ve also experienced ups and downs in my mood. There are days/weeks where I feel panicky and really low, but then other days I can feel fine. 

When I feel really low and anxious (like the last 4 months since I started my job) I experience thoughts of self harm and suicide. Because I’m tired of feeling this way and just want out. Sometimes I act on the self harm urges. 

Yesterday I tested out a way of ending my life (not going to go into details of how) after feeling terrible all day. I’ve had thoughts about it over the past few years. I realised yesterday that it would’ve been effective if I’d wanted it to be. So now I feel like there is a realistic way out. Whereas before I thought I’d never be able to find a way to do it. 

That thought is both comforting and a relief, but also a bit scary. Right now I don’t feel like I’d do it because of the impact it’d have on others. But idk when I’m at my lowest points I don’t really care about that. So it feels a bit scary knowing I have a viable option now. 

This isn’t something I’d want to share with anyone irl. So wanted to share it here. I don’t know what for. I just wanted to tell someone I guess."
507,Getting into a psychiatrist,"Im almost 22 years old and I am finally to the point where I am ready to see a psychiatrist after 10 years of mental health problems. I cannot cope with my bipolar depression on my own anymore and have tried everything besides meds to this point

I dont have a primary care physician but is it possible to get into a psychiatrist without a referral?? or should i attempt to go to the mental health services at the nearest hospital? i dont wanna drive up the medical bills on my parents insurance and i think we have pretty good coverage but i dont know what to do"
508,Advice,"Growing up I dealt with a ton of anxiety and other mental health issues , so from an early age I knew something was wrong. I had trouble talking about my feelings or emotions out of fear of being judged by others or being told “it’s all in your head”. So like a lot of us I never sought out help or managed to figure out what was going on and I allowed it to get worse and worse. When my sister passed away everything that I had allowed to build up inside me just exploded into this cycle of depression , anxiety and drug abuse. I have never been the same since her death and I don’t think I have managed to cope with her loss in a healthy manner. It is a constant thought in my head every single day and if you add on top other everyday struggles that stem from preexisting mental health issues and drug abuse I’m just a complete wreck. This has affected me in everything from school and work to family and relationships. I know I need to kick the substance abuse and get it under control and I know I probably need to talk to a professional. Talking about it in person with others is really hard and I have to get over my social anxiety at some point. As I get older I know I must meet my obligations and responsibilities and be there for my family who have also suffered from the loss. Just wish I could cope in a healthier manner."
509,"Taking the medication, going to therapy, making positive life changes... So why do I still feel deeply sad all the time?","Hey everyone,

I hope this is okay to post here. I've had diagnosed depression, anxiety and PTSD for about half my life now. In the past few years I've built up a good support system (therapist, psychiatrist), found medication that works, and have made positive changes to my life (a good job, made more friends, developed some goals, etc.). For a short period I would have described myself as feeling content.

But now those deep-seated feelings of sadness have come back, and I don't know why. My life is not where I'd like it to be and I'm still around some of the stressors that caused my earlier depression (can't do anything about them but abide for now), but I've learned good coping and relationship skills and I think I've managed well. So why can't I figure out or explain why I'm feeling so sad again? It's so constant and persistent. I don't want to get bad again. What should I do?"
510,How do you stay entertained / happy during the long winter?,"I live in Washington. Winters here are not just long, but intensely grey. Some days we only get 8 hours of daylight, but even then it’s still dark and muggy out. It’s rained for over a month straight and has been so cold.. I’m feel like I’m running out of engaging things to do while waiting out the season. What are some things you do to stay happy and fight boredom during the winter months?"
511,Need advice on seeing a doctor for anxiety,"I’ve been battling anxiety/ocd/hypochondria for a long time and I’ve finally had enough. I am a college student and would like to see a doctor for my issues. My dad has anxiety though it’s different than mine and he takes xanax as needed and my mom takes a low dose of prozac. Neither of them have gotten their prescriptions from a psychiatrist but rather a general practitioner. I’m unaware of how I should go about making an appointment because the school clinic can only refer me to a psychiatrist. We also don’t have insurance so everything is coming out of pocket here. I’m just really nervous about the whole thing. 

Sorry if this post is confusing. Should I look up a local psychiatrist or try and make an appt with our ‘family’ doctor ?"
512,Can it be considered self harm if it isn’t physical?,"In the past I’ve had issues with self harm (cutting mostly) because I’ve lived most of my life feeling numb. It has been about 4 years since I have last cut because of the help of my therapist in girlfriend and I’m so thankful for that. 

But since then I do other stuff that could be “harmful” like drink way too much caffeine when I know I’m sensitive to it so I can feel something or purposefully read depressing books because I know they’ll make me depressed. Do you guys think I’ve just gone into another form of self harm?"
513,"Small, but proud accomplishments.","First off, this is one of my first posts on Reddit. I am a self proclaimed lurker, but I'm trying to fight how withdrawn I have been the past few months. So this is kind of a big step for me.

For the past few years I have been medicated. As much as I enjoy not feeling hopeless and not having panic attacks... I also feel like I just don't feel anything. This has made it incredibly easy to withdraw from life. My job, my friends, my family, and even my SO. It's something I have been more conscious about lately and have a lot of guilt over. 

After three days of laying in bed mindlessly streaming crap TV and wallowing in self guilt, I decided to get the F out of bed and do something. 

I finally filed my taxes.- This has been stressing me out for new good reason.

I registered to vote.- Something I horribly admit I have never done. The idea of standing in a line with a bunch of complete strangers for God knows how long is panic inducing. But it is something I feel passionate about and I can't keep avoiding.

I cleaned and reorganized our entire apartment.- Both my SO suffer from depression, anxiety, and PTSD. While our ups and downs aren't the same, sometimes we let a bit too much go in the passing of the waves.

I know as an adult that these are ""normal"" things that ""everyday"" people do with out an extra thought. For me this was tough, but I'm proud of myself and thought I would share."

517,Anxiety over contamination has been taking over my life.,"As long as I can remember I’ve been very anxious about germs and the cleanliness of certain things. My family always wrote my stress off and called my s hypochondriac, which wasn’t quite true. While I can find myself stressed thinking that I have a something seriously wrong with me, the point where I get so anxious that I can’t even complete my daily activities is when I become anxious about the contamination of things. If I see what I think is blood I have to wash my hands multiple times and change my clothes and I struggle to be in the areas that I now view as unclean. This happens even if I see my own blood and I know it’s my own blood- I still can’t help but feel contaminated and as though I’m at risk for catching a blood transmitted disease. 

I finally decided that I need to get help today when I opened a package that I know was completely sealed when I first opened it (I checked because it was something that I wasn’t comfortable using unless I was sure it was untampered with) and saw that there was small bit blood on the inside of the packaging (that you couldn’t reach unless you had opened it). I know that my cuticles has been bleeding yesterday when I first opened this package and so it’s almost certainly my blood, but I still when into panic, cleaning and thinking I need to go get tested for blood diseases.

518,Does this behavior sound like a mental illness?,"So, I am currently diagnosed with MDD, GAD and Social Anxiety. Since the time when I was diagnosed I started to look deeper into my past to see if I was ill my whole life. I did come to conclusion that I have had anxiety since I can remember. But some things from my past seem much weirder than just anxiety...

Here is a part of  my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ey94n2/can_i_get_empathy/fgg4lby?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) in r/socialskills:

&gt; I also had this weird thing that I would feel shame even in front of inanimate objects. I remember playing this browser game where you basically had to race on a skateboard and if you didn't finish on time there was a cartoony face of a ""coach"" that was unhappy/disappointed. For some reason I felt like he was judging me, like he was a real person. I also felt guilty in front of photos and drawings, when I was doing something that i considered not quite right. I felt like they were watching me, and especially if they were pictured in such a way that they were looking at me. I felt like they were forced to watch me do my sins (touching my pee pee or staying up late). It got to the point that I had to turn photos and drawing away and hide faces to feel comfortable. 

This would also happen with plush toys.

There was also this thing during break between lessons in 1st grade when I took off my pants  and underwear and  and danced on a table with my wee out because all 9 of my classmates asked me to and they wanted to see ""striptease"". I used to do a lot of very stupid and weird shit when I was a kid.

I do not think that this kind of behavior is even remotely normal in a sane kid. And you know what is the most puzzling? I was never stupid. I was constantly praised by parents and teachers for my intellect. My mom told me that when I first went to kindergarten I could already speak in sentences while other kids could barley say a word.  Teachers would keep telling my mom and me how creative, clever and smart I was. My grades have been almost straight As since my first day of school. My grades have become less impressive lately, now I have more Bs than before, but my productivity has most likely fallen because of severe depression and apathy. I never study outside of school and still manage to do better than most of my peers. Heck, you probably haven't even thought to this point that I am writing all of this in a non-native language of mine, English is the third language I speak freely.  To this day there are sometimes cases when teachers tell me something among the lines of ""You have such a great head, why are your actions so silly then?"". My current psychiatrist agrees and says that my actions don't match my intellect. He doesn't think that I have ADHD, according to him it is nearly impossible to succeed in education on such a level with this diagnosis. 

I am really worried that all this time there was something even more dark hiding in the back of my mind. Looking forward for your suggestions."

520,I haven’t gotten a full night’s sleep in ages because my mind won’t stop racing. What do I do?,"Title says it all.  I have a ton of stuff going on in my life right now, none of it bad, but all this activity just causes me to lie in bed with my thoughts racing every night, and it takes me at least 2 hours to fall asleep, sometimes more.  I can’t relax to go to sleep, and I just want the morning to come so I can get things done.  Any time one little thought pops into my head, I will agonize over it and the worst case scenarios.  The worst case scenarios never end up happening, but I will still agonize over them when I am laying in bed, even though nothing can be done in that moment.  This is really going to become an issue once I start working full time and have to wake up early every day, as I am in my last semester of university.  Right now, I wake up at 6am one day a week for a full work day, and doing that is not fun when your thoughts have kept you awake until after midnight, even though you shut the lights at 10:30pm.  Last year, I had the same issues during a stressful period, and I wrote down my thoughts in a journal, which helped slightly but not a lot.

Besides getting therapy, which I think I may need to look into, does anyone here have any suggestions as to how I can “put off” my thoughts and just get a good night’s sleep for once (8 hours)?  Rationalizing in my head doesn’t work, because I will be too “excited” to see the scenario play out that I just stay awake.  With meditation, I am willing to try it but I am afraid I won’t be able to let go of the thoughts during the exercise, or they’ll just come right back once I’m done.  Getting up and reading a low key book helps sometimes but not always, and I’d rather not rely on a sleeping pill, Melatonin or NyQuil.  Because I can be exhausted, but tossing and turning for easily an hour on a good night.  I hate it."

Now I know that if it gets worse I need to but atm I think theres other people with more pressing things then mine and I feel like I haven't really got the right to go yet?

523,I had a decent childhood- so why so many mental problems?,"I had a fairly normal childhood by most people's standards, but it seems I have similar mental problems to people who had a traumatic childhood. I was in an abusive relationship, so maybe that has to do with it? After I got divorced, I was basically involved with a string of unhealthy people. I do remember my dad being a little bit overly angry at times, so I'm not sure if I've blocked out things to cope? I'm pretty sure I saw him lunge at my mom before when I was little and did things you might consider abusive on rare occasions but I was fairly well adjusted until I got involved with my ex husband. Can just a little bit of childhood trauma cause all of this or was it the abusive relationship mostly? Trying to identify the root cause."

525,I feel alone,I (f/15) recently opened up to my friends about my physically abusive father. He has beaten and destroyed my mental health for as long as I can remember. They told me to go to the authorities so I could stop living at home with my father. I got in touch with the proper autorities and tried to get help. My friends said they would help me get trough it. So long story short. The authorities didnt believe me and basically just believed everything my father told them and now I have to go back home. Ive been kind of distant and quiet lately and my best friend has been ignoring me for 2 weeks now. My other friends dont seem to care and I have no one else. My mother is a suicidal wreck and my brother is on the spectrum and cant really understand what I am going through. I tried to get help from the school I go to and they talked to my parents and believed everything my father said and now they think i am a master manipulator or idek. I know everyone has their own stuff going on but I just wish I could rely on someone. I dont even have a proper home because I have been in boarding schools and moved to new countries every few years. Its kind of hard to stay positive rn.
526,Avoiding intrusive thoughts in the future,"Every once in a while, I go through a kind of rough period with my mental health. I've never been diagnosed with anything but the best way I can describe it is being slightly manic-depressive. Like I go through periods where I have a ton of energy and take on a lot of tasks (jobs, assignments at school when I was a student, etc.), don't sleep or eat much, and workout a lot. I inevitably crash and become depressed, unable to do keep the commitments I made while manic, sleeping and eating a lot, etc. 

When my depression has gotten bad in the past, I've had kind of intense thoughts that I should kill myself. When I was going through a hard time, it got to where I was thinking it all the time and it was really frustrating because I didn't actually want to commit suicide I was just thinking about it all the time, almost like someone else was in my head telling me to do it.

I've been better about not swinging too far to either side, so even when I'm feeling kind of manic I try not to do too much even though it feels like I can. This makes it easier to not go into a deeper depression. So I've been better about self-care and all that and haven't had suicidal thoughts. 

But, the reason I'm looking for advice is that the suicidal deaths of celebrities Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade got me really thinking about how you're never fully out of the woods. Like there are things I can't control and maybe events in my life could cause me to become really depressed and those thoughts could be a part of my life again. I guess I thought I could get to the point where my life is good so I wouldn't have to worry, but seeing that successful and well-liked people still losing mental-health battles made me kind of worried.

My life also hasn't been that stressful lately, I'm out of school and haven't fully transitioned to a career-type job. So I don't have a lot of work or responsibilities and in the past that has been a big part of what causes my problems. So while things are fine now, I want to prepare for when my mental health is tested.

So I'm wondering what other people have done to take care of themselves when things do get stressful to avoid having thoughts that make it hard to live your life. I also just feel like I don't open up about this kind of thing often and wanted a forum to talk about it.

Thank you!"
527,Confused about whether I do feel love or not; wondering if this is normal,"Once again, I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I'm sure it is. This post turned out longer than expected, so there's a TLDR at the end.

I don't think I've ever felt love the way people describe it. I don't think I've ever cared about someone very deeply. I have felt bad for people I like when bad things happened to them, but I've never had a selfless wish to care for someone. It's always thinking about what I can get in return. No matter how many good things I do for a woman I like, they always come from my desire to have her in my life as some sort of proof that I can succeed in life. I've been thinking about this and I really don't want to hurt my current date because I think she's by far the closest I've had to a woman who might actually stay with me. I think she might actually be able to love me, and I always find it hard to believe that I can be loved. I think I've never believed that.

Maybe I've just never gotten close enough to anyone for true love to develop, but then again, I don't think I feel love like that. I can't relate to how it's described. In a way, I believe that people describe it the wrong way to make it sound better, and a part of me believes I love my mom because I can take her needs into consideration, but I can't think of a time when I've considered anybody's needs in a non conscious, selfless way. It's always, ""if I don't do that, they're gonna bitch about it.""

Speaking of my mom, when my grandmother died, I only felt bad because just the idea of having to support her for god knows how long bored me to death. I don't understand grief fully and I don't know when I'm supposed/allowed to start telling jokes to lighten the mood. I hadn't seen my grandmother in years prior to her death, because I kept making up excuses not to see her. I didn't want to deal with the emotional tone that our conversation would have. I did not see her, and I never felt regret for that. I still don't. I also don't care about my mom whenever she starts talking about my grandmother and I feel bored and start drifting away in my own thoughts. So maybe what I feel is one-sided love, or whatever, if that makes sense? I pretended to care at my grandmother's funeral, but that funeral made me feel nothing but boredom, and I wanted to go home.

One of my mom's relatives (I can't remember what she was) died last year and I felt bored with that too. I supported her a bit more because I thought it was easier than when my grandmother died, but I felt bored at the funeral and I left the church and went to eat something to pass time.

Like I said in my other posts, I'm not looking for a diagnosis here, just anything that might help me with learning about myself. I have been seriously wondering why I have such a confusing way of caring. Sometimes I feel like I can understand people's emotions perfectly, and I feel like I'm great at reading them...and sometimes, I feel like I might have entirely different emotions and I might be actually clueless. I could be delusional, for all I know. All of this is making me feel very curious.

Also, my date's dog died yesterday. I was able to comfort her through text, I think I did well...but I honestly was sure I'd have no idea how to react if she told me that in person. I didn't care about her dog. I didn't care about her pain either, and that was a bit...terrifying. I've been emotionally involved with this person, so why can't I feel bad for her? I only felt bad for her for...I don't know...not knowing how little I care? I can't describe what that feels like. All I know is I couldn't feel her pain and it felt weird to comfort her when that wasn't sincere.

**TLDR**: I'm not sure if I feel love because I can't understand my loved ones' pain. Their bad moments are a chore to me. Whenever we have good moments, I get lost in these moments and feel like I might really love them. But when bad times come, I start to question whether I do love them. I cannot feel bad for them. I feel bad for me. It's all very confusing, I don't understand these emotions and I hope to understand this a little better."
528,Help me to rebuild this friendship,I have talked to my best friend about my depression for over 4 months. A couple of weeks ago she told me that she couldn‘t do that anymore because it stresses her too much and she doesn‘t know how to help me. We are still best friends but i think that our friendship is damaged because of how i treated her. Now i want to rebuild our relationship on healthy boundaries and without talking about my depression with her. Does anyone have any advice on how i can do that?
529,"Started a blog about gaming, depression &amp; other stuff"," Hello there,

so I basically started a blog called ""Gaming, Depression &amp; other stuff"" and yeah you guessed it, it's about gaming, depression &amp; other stuff.

[https://mrluukyysoftware.code.blog](https://mrluukyysoftware.code.blog/)

Those are very personal topics for me and I thought it's a good idea in a tough time to release some tension in this blog and say things I was never able to say in the past. Maybe I can even help people that struggle with mental health or are scared of ""coming out"" with it. That would be great actually!

I'm aware that I could improve the looks and the design but for now I just wanted to start. I plan to release a post once a week, just write down what's on my mind and see where this takes me.

I just want to share this blog in case anyone of you is interested in it. Feel free to share if you like it.

Thanks guys and have a nice day!

530,Mental health and music,"How is music affecting your mental health? 
I'm just asking because I'm curious. I'm noticing that I'm personally only listening to sad music but I like it. It's probably not healthy but it makes me feel comfortable in some way. It expresses how I feel and makes me feel understood. I can really dive into it and actually feel emotions which I'm otherwise not capable of because I'm pretty much emotionally numb all the time. 
It's a bit random but I'm curious to know what your experience with music and mental health is."
531,After six months it was bound to happen one day...,"It was bound to happen one day and today was the day. I had requested a therapy session today (Monday) because I had a rather crappy weekend. 

I should’ve known that what I sought support for resulted in it being a result of MY controlling behavior because in controlling everything I take the good with the bad. 

While I think the session time was nearly expired (45min), I abruptly ended the session with “I’m done” and left the room, closing the door behind me. I didn’t slam the door or raise my voice. I somewhat tried to compose myself after having cried and just left. His/Her response was “OK, see you next time.”

For those of you that have experienced similar, how was the ‘climate’ in the room during your next scheduled visit? Did the relationship/alliance seem strained?

Thanks in advance to clients/patients and therapists/counselors/psychiatrists alike that are willing to share their experiences."
532,Headaches,I have literally had a headache since June 2018. I know headaches are a symptom of depression but they haven’t gone away even though the other symptoms of depression have eased off recently. I am fed up with seeing doctors but am also fed up with having constant headaches. Nothing even seems to help anymore.. I think I will pay to see a Neurologist
533,I don’t know what to do,"So over the past few years it feels like I’m getting worst and more distant from reality and people. 

Nothing feels fun anymore and I can’t have an emotional connection with anyone, not even my parents or what were my closest friends. I can’t really distinguish what I’m feeling and it seems like what ever I feel in my head, something like anxiety, I don’t really feel but my mind observes it.

I don’t feel depressed I don’t feel anything. Any feeling there is such as like fear, it feels like a tiny light in the center of my head and my brain just numbs it and it goes away.

I have tried looking into this but have gotten no where and don’t have the insurance or money to go to a doctor or therapist, which led me to reddit (this is the first time ever using reddit).

But if anyone knows anything or has this same feeling and can help anything will help thank you."
534,Are these signs of anxiety?,Ever since I turned 16 I’ve suddenly began to be so focused on when to give eye contact or not. I never used to have this problem and would communicate with people normally but now when I’m having a conversation I kinda look around and sometimes lock eyes for a few seconds. When I do this I feel like the person is thinking I’m weird or nervous which makes me nervous to get into social interactions. I also feel so exhausted every time people are talking to me and I feel like I have to try so hard to react to whatever they’re saying. Could these be signs of anxiety? Or am I just going through a phase atm.
535,TW: Physical. My mom was telling my therapist a false narrative so I took her phone and she beat me up,"Sometimes I don't like telling people what I argue about with my mom about because it sounds stupid but there's always a deeper part behind the seemingly stupid argument. Example: she accused me of stealing her keys. This actually happened but it sounds small. What's bad about this is days prior, I fainted and she left me on the floor, later revealing that she did so because she thought I was faking. She's so quick to accuse me or think I'm lying and this is problematic for multiple reasons. 

Back to her beating me up, we had another argument last night. I had therapy this morning and wanted to miss. She kept telling my therapist the reason for me missing was over some silly dispute about her forgetting when my appointment was when that wasn't the case. She does this a lot, tells people reasons for me doing things that aren't true. I couldn't take it so I took her phone from her and she walked after me, angrily telling me to give it back and then she grabbed me and started hurting me. She punched me, tried to/did bite me, hit me with closed fists and we even ended up on the tile floor. She kept yelling that she's had it with me while punching me and hitting me and I didn't fight back because my only concern was her not saying things that weren't true. She later told my dad I was kicking her and that's why she punched me but if I did kick her, it was because she was on top of me and I was under her trying to get her off me. The fight didn't end until I lost my grasp on her phone. Lots of stuff happened after that and I think my therapist heard the fight but I'm not sure. I'm quite numb right now but I think I just wanted to vent this"
536,Suicide note,"I am leaving my suicide note here and I will be committing suicide in few days once I get back to city after visiting my parents. I will provide my fb timeline link the day I do it. 
Dear mom and dad, 

I am extremely sorry for putting you guys through all this and I do know the consequences you'll have to face from this from society and the people you know but at this moment I am tired really tired,  I struggled for like 5 or more years but never told anyone about this and that's my fault. 
And there's nothing you could have done better to stop me from this, there's noone to blame for this but myself - a failure.
I failed horribly in exams in University which I never had I am so so sorry. had I been given a chance I certainly would not have disappointed that would have been redemption but that was not possible.
You both are amazing parents and I love you guys so much.
My both sisters bhai loves you both, I am blessed to have sisters you, lil sister ada loves so much wish ada could have seen you the last time and said good bye... I hope you would be given chance to be yourself like your brothers which you totally deserve and ask dad to let you because that's always been my dream, I hope you would succeed more than your brothers, do kiss my cheeks when I arive home.
Brothes,
We never had good terms with each other but despite of that we are brothers, I love you all three.  'Youngest' despite of being a disabled you never let anyone feel like you actually were and I love you for that.
I wish you guys all the best but never bully anyone not even your brother learn from dad what type of person he's and look at you guys look at me,  I was such a disgrace but you guys are far better than me but still a lot of things to learn from dad.
And my friends and relatives, I am sorry If I ever hurt you and I apologize for that. 


Love

537,I want to understand what’s wrong with me. I am fine with strangers but not with friends,"Hello,

I have a peculiar issue. I’ll try to be as descriptive as possible. 

I am a guy, 25-30, employed, pretty average. 

My friends say that I used to be very social, energetic, funny and lively. I was always up to help anyone in my university and many appreciated my openness. Since the last year, they say that Ive turned into a very silent, always into my phone, always anxious and uptight person. 

The thing is, when I’m talking to strangers or new acquaintances, I am perfectly fine and almost always have something to talk about. But when I’m with my friends I barely talk or interact. I talk as much as I can but pretty soon I start looking into my phone for something or the other. 

This is seriously affecting my relationship with my friends and my girlfriend. My girlfriend says that me not being social and not enjoying my time when outside is a major issue for her. She says that she cannot be with someone who does not enjoy spending time with others. I am perfectly fine and have the best time when I’m with her. But my social anxiety/awkwardness combined with her frustration with her job and the cold weather where we live is taking a toll on her. I try to make things as good as possible, I cook her favorite dishes and help her with everything. But my issues and the situation I got myself in are really hurting her. I cannot lose her and I’m trying my best to be my old self. But she knows that I am just pretending and am not actually enjoying anything. 

I don’t know what happened to me, why I changed. I need your advise. Have I just turned into an asshole somehow - Someone who doesn’t care about their friends anymore ?Should I go to a therapist? What kinds of therapy are generally available? I just want to understand what’s the root cause here so that I can fix it. 

Thank you for reading."
538,Afraid of getting depression again during breakup,"In 2017 I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, as well as an unspecified anxiety disorder. It all started when I moved away to college (pretty sure it was caused by the big change). I didn’t understand it and didn’t know how to treat it. Fast forward to May 2019 and I am in the midst of my third hospitalization for suicidal ideation and planning. I had dropped out of school, became homeless (bad relationship with family. They thought being depressed meant I was crazy), living out of my car, tried 2 different medications that both hadn’t worked for me, 3 different therapists until my last one quit her job (because of her workplace, not me). 

When I was out of the hospital I stopped taking all medication - I had always hated the fact that I had to take medication to be normal. For the first time in two years I felt like my old self. I felt happy and bubbly and excited about life, aside from the few days or sometimes a week where I will feel depressed again. Overall I am happy. I got a new job in a new town and started seeing a guy. We even got a place together so that I was out of my car. All was good for a few months. Until he started beating me and emotionally abusing me. He has stopped beating me for the time being, I assume because he’s on probation and he’s worried about getting into trouble again. However, he is still extremely emotionally abusive and refuses to see it. 

I want the relationship to be over. I am not happy with him. However, I am terrified of depression. I don’t want it ever again. I work hard at avoiding triggers and at being strong. Really really hard. I am worried that if we break up I may go back to being depressed because of a) the big change, and b) I don’t have my family because they’re jackasses and I don’t have friends because he made me cut them off. When I came to this area I didn’t know anyone and he hasn’t let me take the chance to make friends. He’s literally all I have and I’m worried being alone will make things worse."
539,Psychosis,My meds seem to be making it worse I see and hear hallucinations and I feel numb all the time. I just got discharged  a couple days  ago  from the mental hospital and I'm already relapsising please help
540,Feeling left out.,"I live in a shared uni flat and i can hear the other girls share with chatting next door laughing and having a ball and here I am on my bed trying not to relapse because I'm feeling really left out. Like I get it, I'm always the one left out and they probably are only pretending to like me but it still hurts so bad. I'm so close to flipping out it's not even funny."
541,I posted this in r/depression but I feel like it would belong here as well. Just a little vent on how my life is going so far,
542,why am i so scared of friends not liking me/abandonment,"i have great, healthy friends that i get along with well. we hang out and text a lot so i have no real reason to feel this way. but im constantly scared that i did something wrong or that they just don’t like me any more. i think i just have a deep-rooted fear of abandonment but i don’t know where this comes from or how to deal with it"
543,Told my parents I am struggling in school because my mental health...they proceeded to ground me.,"I used to be a straight A student, but I have been struggling with BP2 and Depression for a while now. My parents refuse to put me on medicine or let me see a therapist. My grade in my honors class is a low D, even though I study. I just can’t pay attention or stay awake anymore in that class because I  can’t sleep because I am really sad at night. 

I sat down with my parents and said I needed help. I told them I didn’t have any motivation and just wanted them to do something to help me feel better. They started yelling at me saying shit like “You are in charge of your grade, not a “mental illness”. You are just faking it for attention. You don’t know what it’s like to actually be sad.” Etc etc.

I got up, went in my room, and then my dad’s girlfriend made me hand over my Xbox and PC and told me to get studying. I asked why, and she said “You asked us to help. Now you get bored enough and actually might give a shit.”

I tried to show her how—I already study. I made a shit ton of quizlets from the study guide. I took notes from the people that were awake in class. I read all the chapters from the textbook and took notes on my own time. I just don’t understand. Why am I like this? Why can’t I just be normal, have friends, be a straight A student like all these other people. It sucks so much."
544,Can someone help me? I don't know what I need,"My ex messaged me apologizing for her actions in our relationship that ended 5mo ago. I've been doing well mentally until this. Confident, content, doing things finally. We talked, she thought it was all good but then more stuff came back to me and I ranted. A lot. Contact is now cut again. It's like I'm back in the relationship: I'm suddenly anxious, depressed, suicidal and feel generally crazy again. It's the same old thoughts but they havent been thought of in ages and I'm scared I'm going to have to work through this once again."
545,is there anything i should know before my first assessment with camhs?,"not sure if this is the best sub but here! im 17 and was referred to camhs in july (was 16 then) for issues with anxiety, so obviously i am anxious about my assessment with them tomorrow, and was just wondering if theres anything i should know or prepare? the only thing i have done like this was when i had my appointment to get referred. thank you for any replies!"
546,im tired and i want this all to end,"im honestly speaking so tired right now, nothing matters and no matter what i do i still feel this same shitty cloud of dread above me wherever i go. i got really fucked over by a person i loved with all of my heart, my parents got divorced and i had to move away from my friends. my grades are going to hell, im losing weight, hair and sleep and im just so tired all the time. i get enjoyment only from gaming with my best friend, and im afraid thatll stop soon too. im just so tired and i honestly dont think this is a battle i can win."

548,Creating boundaries- Mentally ill caregiver of mentally ill sibling. Help?,"My sibling and I are both unemployed, dropped out of college, and living with our parents.
My sibling:
Has ADD and struggles with motivation
Does not help out around the house
Sleeps or stays in bed the majority of the day
Has suicidal ideations and neglects their health as a result
Is working with a non-profit and has taken on more responsibility (and pay), which improves their self-esteem
Feels that our parents belittle their efforts, thus lowering their self esteem
Me:
Autistic and has depression and anxiety, resulting in fatigue
Struggles to eat, cook, or buy groceries
Does the majority of the cooking for both myself and my sibling
Needs support from others or waits for another person’s involvement before acting
Grows irritated and frustrated when interacting with sibling due to fatigue
Feels the need to take care of sibling so they don’t starve to death

So my sibling is making strides when they finally leave the house, but their behavior at home (or lack thereof) creates a strain on me day-to-day. I can barely take care of myself, let alone another person. How do I balance the need to take care of myself and the want to take care of my sibling? How do I set boundaries with my sibling so that we can both heal from our mental illnesses? I greatly love my sibling and they mean the world to me. We have supported each other our whole lives in the absence of support from others. I care a lot about them and I don’t want to lose them, but I’m struggling enough as it is. What can I do?"
549,I Don’t Like Therapy So Let Me Die,"Maybe someone can explain this to me because I don’t understand it. People tell me you can’t get help if you don’t truly want it and I completely agree with that I even told a nurse who tried to help me after a I tried to kill myself for the 5th or so time that she couldn’t help me because I don’t want help and that is still true. But then most people get angry because they think I blame therapy for my recurrent problems but that’s not true I never blamed therapy for my Fucked up life, I just don’t like it but that’s for personal reasons. So if I don’t want help and you can’t help me because I’m not willing to get help, Then why stop me when I try to kill myself.!What is my death going to change in this world! Who am I that if die the world will never be the same. Maybe only 5 people know me and out of theirs 5 only 1 might actually be affected by my death. That’s the only reason I’m still here but you only live for someone else for so long. In my case, why not just let me die? I don’t want your help and I don’t need it so just let do me, it’s my life I’m an an adult it’s my choice what I want to do with my life even if it means ending it."
550,Convincing Yourself of something you may not have done,"Hi Everyone,

I was out drinking with some coworkers last Friday night. I remember specific conversations and talking to specific people - except for what I talked about with 2 people. 

I have convinced myself of something I had talked to them about (something that was told to me a long time ago that I would never tell them in the first place - no matter how drunk I was) 

I’m wondering if I’m adding a worst-case scenario conversation with them because I don’t really remember what we talked about OR if I really did tell them what I wouldn’t have had I been sober. I also could have dreamed it because I don’t remember their reaction to what I said.

Has anyone else convinced themselves that they talked to someone about something that they didn’t?

This is all very strange and I’ve been obsessing over the “Did I or didn’t I?”"
551,How much napping is too much napping?,"I nap A LOT even though I get a good amount of sleep usually between 6-8 hours sometimes more but i always find myself during the day needing to nap and it’s not usually just a quick 20 minutes power nap it’s a deep sleep that’s usually 2 hours or more and I often nap when I just can’t face anything so I’m wondering if this is normal or if I have a problem (I’m also 16 and I know teenagers nap a lot) 

TL:DR- I’m worried I’m napping too much"
552,Taking mental health days,"Struggling with mood swings, some days can leave me feeling extremely apathetic and tired. To the point where I could sit at a wall all day and not think a single thought. I don’t feel like I can concentrate properly, will definitely not enjoy my class the next day (my teacher is extremely stressful and rude) and feel extremely tired.

I understand the concept of mental health days, but I don’t feel like I deserve one because I’m not incredibly emotionally distressed, just exhausted for no real reason. If I really pushed myself, I know I could go to college, but part of me knows I’ll hate it there, so I’m unsure what to do. I want to skip, but am riddled with guilt - is it fair that I take a day off despite knowing I could still by push myself to go and work?"
553,Witnessed madness,"Hired a girl for an event (ceremony) as an assistant and saw her progressively fall in to something so strange and scary, that it has left me in an extremely uncomfortable state having reached home. 

I'm an event manager. We were at the event, she appears very normal but is a chatterbox and has very kiddish sensibilities. She had a couple of drinks which should have gotten her high but not what I witnessed. She started talking in tongues and shifted context and sentences, she lost the ability to form a sentence, starting a sentence and leaving it midway. She started talking about her mom over and over and how she was calling her (her phone was always ringing). Her mom seemed to have an insane amount of control and commanded her attention at the cost of the job for which she was called.

At first I began to take the issue seriously, like I would ask, hey what's the issue, why are u on the phone all the time. She would start saying something about her mom and her ex and I realized there was no end, it was a ramble and I began to become frustrated. 

By the time the event was getting over she was crying, calling people and constantly coming over to me and literally talking nonsense, like the words and sentences made no sense. I had to constantly keep her in the room or tell her to sit on a sofa but she would always get up and start giving me her phone with someone or the other on the line. I was extremely frustrated and finally had to tell her to leave the premises.

When I came out. She was sobbing on a chair in the parking of the place. At that point I was exhausted but I decided to drop her home. This is the thing that frightened me. Before we arrived at her place, she started to ask if I have met her mom three days ago. When I said no she said I had talked with her mom and met her, her mom knows who I am and so on. I dropped her home. 

This whole experience has left me feeling disturbed. I have seen evil, I have seen stupid but this was something that could not be negotiated with."
554,Why do I feel hollow when I’m not in danger,As the title implies I feel downright awful when I’m not putting myself I some sort of risk. It can be minor like waiting till the last minute to do something or it can be something as major as taking a joy ride or running from the police (not admitting I did that). When I’m not at risk I feel either nothing or deeply depressed. Why is this and what can I do?
555,Can I be a psychologist if I am prescribed antidepressants?,I am an aspiring psychology therapist but my mental health has been steadily declining to the point in which I'm considering antidepressants. Would this compromise my career?
556,I’m physically and mentally tired,I just want the pain to go away. I finally have my first therapy session in two weeks. I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it that long. I’m so tired.
557,Should I get help or am I just delusional?,"I'm 14 and for the past five years, I've been very depressive in mood and my ability to empathize with others each year has been getting worse to the point where I'm almost unable to express my emotions in real life. I constantly feel like everything is my fault and that the world would be better off without me. Every corner I turn, I feel like everyone is watching me and that every little giggle, whisper, or laugh is about me or how I look. No one has ever once in my life told me that I will never be good enough and I haven't been abused by my family. I grew up in a pretty positive environment but I really feel like it doesn't affect me positively at all. I think of suicide all the time every day and these thoughts always interrupt brief moments of happiness or pride and I go right back to criticizing myself again. I'm just this pessimistic lack of a person. I have no motivation and really believe I don't deserve life because I have done nothing to deserve anything. I don't wanna talk about this because I'm submissive to everyone. I do everything I'm told and no one takes me seriously. The one time I tried to get help, my lack of ability to express myself made even the doctor not take me seriously and it feels ridiculous. My parents, friends, and other people I sometimes try to ask for help never take me seriously. My mom think's I'm perfectly fine and I can't say anything to her because I'm scared she'll punish me in some way, even though she hasn't hit me as behaviorial punishment since I was six. I'm really scared and can't say it because I was taught that boys can't cry for my whole life. I know that isn't true and always have. 

I want someone to tell me if I do actually need help or am just delusional. And if possible, I want someone to tell me what it might be and whether or not I'm really mentally ill. Sorry for turning this into a bit of a vent."
558,Mental health and the negative impacts of a relationship,"Unfortunately my gfs mental health has deteriorated significantly in recently months. I am not familiar with how it feels to be her or the triggers of it. I would support her as much as I could be it is now having a negative impact on my happiness and emotional well being. Granted not as much as hers. I am not depressed by any means and have no illness but it is causing me to no longer see my relationship as happy or enjoyable. I love her but I'm struggle to find the strength to stay with her. And I think she knows this given she has indicated she might cause self harm if I leave her. Ideally we work through this but I'm in experienced and have no idea how to address the issue, I also feel I'm not trapped given the potential injury she my cause herself. What do I do?"
559,I’m sorry I’m a failure,"That’s it. I hope you all have the very best life you can have, don’t be like me. You all deserve the very best out of life. I’ve already messed up beyond the point of redemption, but you all have the opportunity for that very thing, so take it. Anyway, that’s all,
Sincerely, your resident fuck up."
560,Feeling like a complete loser!,"\#help # suggestions

Hey all, I don't know if asking this on this forum is right or not but I wanted to share my situation currently and wanted some opinions on it. I guess some of y'all might've experienced it in your life.

&amp;#x200B;

 So, I come from an average middle class family from India. I graduated high school in 2017 and started with college in Aug 2017. 

2 years into it, and I had to drop out in mid-2019 due to failing in a few subjects. It was a very hard situation for the whole family. But still, I got enrolled into another college and I'm pursuing another course currently which I'm confident about and love studying.

But now this year, all of my friends from my previous college will be graduating. Some of my other friends have already graduated and started working.

This is where my worry and trauma clicks in. In all this process, my parents have been immensely supportive to me but when I see how much financial problem I've created for my family, I feel guilty. I am ready to earn and learn and when I told about this to my parents, they strictly opposed it saying that for now, I should only focus on studies. What they say is right too but this guilt of not being able to do anything for my family eats me up inside everyday, every night.  


My parents never compared me with any other child but when people ask about my current situation, they have to answer it and they flinch in talking about it.   
In recent times, I've even stopped using any social media because I'm not happy about it. I've stopped attending parties and get-together because the questions of the people make me restless and speaking lie/ avoiding every time just doesn't help.  


I know that me graduating and working is the only way to stop all this but still..  
My daily routine has become like-

1. Wake up, fight life and study hard to get through. Avoid people, Avoid friends.
2. Crib and cry myself to sleep, cursing myself.  


Let me know your suggestions on this"

I've almost been to Juvenial Hall/Jail on multiple occasions. In the dark Kimberly tried to kill me after she got high on Spice. she reenacted a scene from Criminal Minds that she saw.

I refused and she started drinking heavily , I was her only friend, she had a BAD past as well. her behaviors changed drastically and I would have 2 watch her hurt herself, drink, walk around naked singing Kill Me Kill Me Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, and What Is Love, I watched her self harm and I tried 2 stop her, but whenever I tried to she would scream and give the gun to me again, she is currently (she's dead but awhile later) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, Autism, Skitzophrenia, and PTSD. She killed herself later on. When I was a patient in multiple of the placements/hospitals/lockdown treatment centers/rehabs/crisis centers/stabilization units etc etc. I would misbehave really badly, I would have protected sex, get in fights, extreme physcotic episodes, do drugs when it was not permitted, I'm used to doing worse crimes on the streets anyways.I got bullied 4 the 1st time inside of CHYC, last but yes least, DAMGEROUSLY CRAZY ME wants to tell u one more thing, when I was homeless, A boy named Timothy Sagaste (not real last name) lead me on and we got engaged after 6 months of dating cuz we were so close, I trusted him, we had a connection, but after leading me on for so long I thought things were TOO perfect, and I was right, after I got engaged to him, we had a romantic dinner &amp;; he told me that he was seeing someone else, that he pretendedthat he liked me, pretended our whole relationship everything about it, he told me he was breaking up with me and I Got heated and beat him up and tried to kill him but he finally grabbed the shotgun and knife out of my hands, Tied me to the bed and told me to ""Go Kill Yourself Sara, You DON'T DESERVE LOVE, U DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE, YOUR A MISTAKE , THAT'S WHY NO-ONE EVER LOVED YOU, YOUR AN UGLY SLUT TRASHY WHORE AND U NEED TO GO 2 HELL, UR A SHITTY MOM PAYING CHILD SUPPORT. I'M GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE AT UR FUNERAL AND GUESS WHAT HOE, IM GONNA LAUGH"" He went on and on , he us3d my life story and my past against me, after he was done , he took out his phone and video taped me afterward. and he shouted ""How Do U Like Me Now"" I Got up and grabbed my Medication bottles (Lithium, Adavan, Gabalentin, Abilify, Welbuitren, Zoloft, Vicodin, Seroquel, Norcos, Xanex, Rhresperdol, Atarax, Ambien, My Meth Needle, My Knifes, Guns, Cigarrette Lighters, and My Xprexa and ran into the bathroom, I took a whole bottle of each medication, I made slits in my arm, wrist, neck, I burned myself in the pussy and in my legs (just like how Blake did it) but I hurt myself 20 times worse than anybody ever had, I went physco and I shot myself up in both my arms with meth and heroin, I did the worst torture to myself worse than anybody ever had. I reenacted Blake, Luis ,and Juans torture , plus everyone who has ever tortured me, I did it worse. I put the gun to my head, I added more bullets and i pulled the trigger, I woke up in an ER, and they said I passed out before the bullet hit my head, so now I realize that I was lucky. God Bless everyone and everything, this is the FULL 20% of my 100% of my life story.

●2% MoreOf My Life Story 
TRIGGER WARNING!!! 
●2% MoreOf My Life Story TRIGGER WARNING!!! So here is my story. I've been thru hell all my life and I have attachment issues cuz of my past torture hell and trauma . I usually have an estimate of 5,6,7 breakdowns a day. I'm used to everything that it's sickening. I've always acted out dangerously and unsafely. Later on after my ex girlfriend Kimberly died I realized that she was the one that framed me for giving my illegally adopted son Anthony drugs and after the car accident , I saw Kim laughing and pointing at Me and later on before she hung herself... she said Anthony was never mine he was hers , and I would never be a mother, and that's why my mom always was a bitch to me. My mom NEVER would kick me out, or so I thought, after I came home from Foster Care she acted strange , not as bad as before. And she kicked me out then took me back in then kicked me out and so on and so forth. I was in LA getting fucked up and on one occasion 2 guys got me really drunk and I woke up In the bathroom and my pants were down and I was on my cycle and everyone saw, I went to the ER, and they said I got raped (again) in the period of my 12th time being homeless. I got raped over 20 times . I almost got killed multiple times, on one occasion I was walking and a van pulled up to the curb and they pointed a gun towards me and told me to get in, I did and they raped me in the back seat and they force fed me, gave me some meth and pointed the gun towards my head the whole way towards there house... they were master bating and would shove there dirty hands down my throat they forced me to have oral. When we got to there house they had a knife up to my throat and I screamed and then the rest was a blackout and I ended up on some strangers lawn . I go to Journey Tay in Spruce street in Corona, I constantly go to CSU and I have a physciatrist and a therapist, but I'm closed off and very touchy with everyone cus my social anxiety trust issues and past trauma. I know I'm broken damaged and helpless but I have a strong faith in God!!!! Anyways on 12/25/2018.. there was this boy approached me during Christmas Eve, and he acted completely fine and normal and caring and sweet and kind hearted and usually I can tell when somethings off. He led me into his trap, I gave him a kiss, and we laughed and. Hung out and we were texting over FaceBook messenger, he constantly asked where I lived and I started to connect with him. On Christmas Day after we opened Christmas gifts we went to Starbucks and he texted me and told me he was at Starbucks, I noticed him getting weird, he didn't look good at all.. he kept telling me about getting liquor , I mentioned it first , but I changed my mind and he wouldn't stop . We went to a Walmart where there was nobody there cus Of Christmas. We hung out . We were heading out and he spotted a soda machine, he asked me for a dollar and he put it in the soda machine and I asked where's mine, he said he had a dollar and I was putting mine back in my purse, I was recording with my iPod touch , and in a split of a second he grabbed my I touch and my wallet with over 400 dollars in it. pushed me and ran, it scared me cus it was out of nowhere. And I gave him my all. And I was hurt. And I still can't believe it's true , that all of that was an act, I thought it was for my movie cus we were making a movie , I got up and nobody cared, some people laughed, and I called the cops, not even the security or the costumers care, nobody cares. The cops showed up and she asked me questions, and I'm going to court and there doing an investigation . After that my PTSD got 20 times worse and I started acting out having more episodes and I felt alone. I had another physcotic break . I've been to court many times for many reasons : I spend most my holidays away, I spent mine at CSU, and I got worse, I started smoking hookah and I started cutting and popping my meds again, trying to overdose once again . And my behaviors and mental state of mind and insanity and physcotic episodes got worse. They still are. And I know I have support. I'm here for you all , stay strong. May God Be With You!!!!! ●Angelique/Ezxekyal ""Izzy"" Magdalinoz-Martinez ||Sara Nicole Pierce ||Br0k3n R0z3z ||Tyler Fiaskko-Alvaro||"
562,Why do I LIKE the idea that my intestines can suddenly burst into flames and kill me?," 

Okay I know this sounds weird, but I genuinely want some answers to this to help me understand it. A while ago I saw a YouTube documentary about a very rare medical condition called Spontaneous Human Combustion. The theory that was talked about most and made the most sense to explain the cases was that it's caused by spontaneous ignition of the flammable gasses in the intestine.

This made sense as most vicitms never smoked and no external source of ignition was proven, and in some cases a person burned to ash within 15 minutes.

For some reason I like the idea my intestines could suddenly produce the wrong chemicals, maybe produce a spark considering how many neurons are in the gut, maybe an enzyme reaction gone bad, and I'd burn up from the inside out and flames would roar out my mouth before I died."
563,Clarity &amp; Passing on Lent,"I thought Lent started today, 2/3/2020, it's starting the 26th.  I've been about fasting for about 10 years now, it's amazing.  I enjoy the challenge and have experienced a lot of health benefits from it.  It's not entirely the spiritual or religious aspects of it all.  A little dogma and religious practice shrouds the practice of fasting in numerous cultures.  For a time I may have found it bring me closer to God.  It really is something people that haven't experienced starvation should, if you have a PhD handy.  


Today I was anxious this morning if I was going to start a 31/41 day fast.  I fast regularly, 16:8/24:1, so breaking down to an prolonged fast, such as 31 or 41 days, even on one meal a day(OMAD), is a bit overwhelming.  I do not think I am on a caloric surplus as I may have been on in the past.  Anytime I start fasting more than 24hrs at most I break into some savage and painful hunger, particularly if I'm trying to be active. I  work in food as well, and that makes it extra tough.  The longest I've water fasted was 28 days, before having a gout attack. 

 Having Gout really bars you from fasting festivities but with medicine it's ok, in my experience.  I have Probenecid which is keeping me alive anymore, I guess.  I just recovered from food poisoning and a severe gout attack, 1 severe then a 2nd brief attack, over late December, all through January I was recovering from the arthritis.  

Dealing with the hunger is sometimes a matter of Vitamin B12 and Iron, to sate your bloodlust, and Hemoglobin needs.  You man eating lycanthropic hunger may cease if you get those in you from time to time.  I was donating whole blood and plasma regularly.  The animal really comes out in an starving alkaline exenguinated human, it's a hell of an experience being completely fucking ravenous and psychotic.   

I am still not an expert, I am not going to give a dottery guide on fasting when I am still winging it myself most of the time.  Vitamin B12 and Iron here, a little salt there, more supplements every couple days, a little charcoal to rinse out the entrails.  I'm going to live at least a few more decades and de-aged even.  I'm 33 now and had the body of a teenager by time it was over.   

I was fine not eating nothing and drinking rice grain vodka and a teaspoon of honey every now and again.  Can't drink on the gout medicine, it cause reactions like near death experiences.  It's not the end of the world, it's just the start of a shitty one without rice grain vodka.  


So when I get all hard and sober I usually have no problems getting into really fantastic shape.  Instead of going out looking for a girlfriend or braving drunk assholes I would go to the gym.  I was running 5-6 minute miles, totally fantastic shape.  I was a bit more motivated before the gout really started to ruin my life.  I was re-enlisting, got in super ridiculous shape, maxing the pt charts, started having gout attacks.  So that broke my spirits a little, I've gotten over it, not really though.  I was prepared for catastrophic failure in life, but, I can blame gout and the Devil and a litany of other cunts. 

You have to move on these days, the military does want some new fucked up generation of spooks floating around like the 'Nam generation.  Failure to adapt, they call it, they threaten you with prison time.  I don't know who these cunts are that are in the beaurocracy of things, they're not even real people.  They're like shitty humanbeings that are like cunts and I can't explain them in any greater detail.  

Anyway, got to figure out something else to do with myself.  I got all these hormones and vaste and amazing ego I spoil you all with.  I don't have the money or credentials to humor contracting agencies.  Low end security and bein a rent-a-cop is the only path I can see.  I'm not sayins low end security isn't honest work, the pay isn't the best but some of these companies can act as a stepping stone unless you are a typically incompetent fuck, like most of their staffing.  Regular checks, regular expectations, minimal danger, unless you like danger.  Some of the contracts I was prospecting were still serious, warhouse stuff.  You only have you to moralize yourself in some situations.  I haven't seen any security gaurds roughed up on the evening news, but, I still want an assault rifle, I miss the danger.  
  
I like danger.     
  
I calmed down a bit over the years, looking for less reckless and suicidal thrill seeking.  

It sucks, all these hormones and nothing to do with them.  Shitty fighter, to many tbi's to take up scrapping.  Martial Arts was a great outlet, I just don't want to get punched in the head ever again.  It was bad for quite a while after my last gauntlet a couple years ago.  At least try and go to the dojo and get your ass whipped, it will put things in perspective.  One thing I could sink my teeth into was HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) but that costs a literal god damn fortune and the studio's or branches are a bit hit or miss with the rep.  I'm not much for formal martial arts, it's an outlet though.   Anything besides street fighting with those hooligans out there.  

I'm not getting any younger, it sucks the most.  I'm 33, like 23, and 35 you're life is pretty much over in the US if you haven't got into Federal work or some other professions.    

Other than that I stay cooped up in the house anymore playing video games and until the arthritis passes.  Back on meds, eating, had to eat.  I ate half a pizza Saturday and half a pizza Sunday and a few other things, feeling much better.  Food is nutrience and shit, you need it for energy, I was running low on fuel for a while and am all fired up and ready to get back in the gym.  NOW - I wait for disaster, a gout flare or some thing.  Just winging it for now, charts and everything are great again.  
  
3 days lifting, 20 mins cardio/or at work, cardio 3 days a week.  (Squats, Chin/pull up, maybe bench, maybe dead lifts. 2 exercises people, can't be simpler.) That takes serious calories to be active.  Fasting doesn't really work while trying to have a full active routine like I do.  I eat twice a day, trying to cram in all those calories.  There's really no need to fast unless you want to cut the water.  Some people can stay in ""show shape"" and some people strive for it.  It's like low carb works but I like bread.  Low carb isn't the worse, I like pizza and just bread in general fills the void, abyss, of my stomach.



Cheers"
564,Riding the rollercoaster...,"Today I resigned from the best job I have ever had. It was a hard decision but it was an absolutely toxic workplace. I managed to stay for four months until I had a wake up call that it simply was not a good fit. My mental health was getting worse everyday... sleeping in until 5pm on my days off, lost all interest in everything. 

I didn't sleep last night; I stayed up with my child who was throwing up. I knew I couldn't call in. So while he was asleep, his grandmother watched him... I packed up my desk and left my keys and a resignation letter in my bosses mailbox. I feel some guilt; but I feel better not dreading going to work.

For the first time in months, I am cleaning my room: washing walls, cleaning up after myself. I'm sure once the mania wears off that I will regret the decision to leave my job. If not for any other reason than it paid great and I'm a single mother. I know I will feel like I have failed my child. I know I will feel like I have failed myself. 

I don't have anyone else to tell and have been lurking here for awhile too scared to say much. I feel like this is a safe place to get it off my chest so it doesn't weigh me down. Even if no one reads this... that's okay. I already feel more at peace."
565,Why does mental illness skip a generation sometimes?,"For example, having a parent with Bipolar disorder does not guarantee you the same fate, meaning that it can skip a generation. Does anybody know why it does that? Why does bipolar disorder skip a generation in some families and not others?"
566,You are loved I promise,"One of my good friends took his own life this day last year 2/feb/2019, and it never gets easier to deal with, everyday he crosses my mind and it’s never any easier to deal with no matter how many days it’s been. It still feels like a huge piece of me is missing. I still can’t actually believe this is real either.

I was at a friends birthday party the night he passed away and he was supposed to be there but cancelled last minute, had I known what he was going to do I would’ve found a way to go to him and stop it.

For anyone contemplating suicide, please don’t do it, everyone in this subreddit cares about you even if it feels like no one else in the world does, we’re a community here dedicated to helping each other. You’re a big part of someone’s life, people do love you and people will miss you I promise, the hardest part is not being able to help him or not being able to say goodbye. 

You are loved, you can get through what you’re going through"
567,People pretend to care about mental health,"Is it just me or does it feel like so many people SAY they are there for people with mental health struggles but then when it comes to ACTUALLY being empathetic to mental health needs they dont ""get it."" Here is some context... my family wanted to organise a game night. We set a date and everyone says they are down to do it but there is no time or place set to do it.

Fast forward to today... today is the day we set for the game night but there is no concrete plan which makes me anxious. Last night people asked about a time and place and no one responded with a concrete answer. So... it was making me too anxious to think about getting ditched with no plans in the end and i needed the predictability of my evening. Sooo,I cancelled myself going. Welllll... that caused some mayhem and people getting mad at me. So I went into detail about why i need concrete plans in my life and explained the anxiety it gives me... NO ONE replied. That really made me feel ""crazy"" like i just poured my heart out there and no one had the decency to say ANYTHING. Anyways, ive been nervous and anxious with a churning stomach all day now which ended up with me having hyperventilating panic attacks because i dont want to be thought of as ""crazy"" and outcasted. Thankfully my mom and my boyfriend are here for me but GOD DAMN IT, STOP STATING YOU CARE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING UNLESS YOU CAN PRACTISE WHAT YOU PREACH. Just because you dont ""get it"" doesn't mean its not real."
568,I don’t like taking drugs.,"I can’t function at all without adderall and caffeine. Like, I simply cease to continue operating. I can just sit completely still, beating myself up in my head for hours. I can’t get any homework done, that’s for sure. I have to chose: sleep, or don’t fail class. I tried sleep last week. I’m pretty sure it was the wrong answer, because nothing got done at all. What little I did get done, I failed to turn in. Just never uploaded the damn file. I ever remember uploading it, but I didn’t, I just made up that memory.

I feel like the miserable piece of shit I am when I’m not drugged is who I really am, and the mask of drugs is just a mask. I think that is probably actually true, but I can heal, I just can’t heal in my current living conditions and I have no faith that they will ever change. I don’t think I can change them, and no one can help me. No one cares. The only people who should care are the source of the problem.

But I haven’t had my evening energy drink yet so I’m sure I’ll be a different, fake person in about half an hour."
569,How do I help someone that doesn’t want to be helped?,"My friend is so obviously is struggling with things going on with himself, through self deprecating jokes, or stuff he will write on social media about being depressed; but whenever I ask if he ever wants to talk about it, he declines. He’s not been his fun self for months and it’s obvious to our other friends. We really want to help but don’t want to pry. I feel as if he calls out for help but then doesn’t accept it, and i am trying to respect that. But I don’t know what to do, there’s only so many times I can ask him if he’s ok, but as a friend I naturally do worry and would like to know what I can do."

572,Got Fantastic News,"I can't say exactly what it is but hubby had gone to the bank today (a normal thing) and they gave him really REALLY good (and totally unexpected) news. We are going to confirm it tomorrow (confirm it is rightfully ours) and then...gee whiz. I don't even have a clue what would be next lol.

Let's just say that some of our problems can be solved easily and that we will be able to breathe easier again.

Thought you guys would like to read some good news for once.

I am cautiously out-of-my-mind excited hahaha."
573,"I am depressed, and I feel alone.","I have many friends at school however recently a lot of my friends started dating, and it makes me feel lonely. I dont even know why I envy that, I dont feel like I envy it but I guess my emotions would beg to differ. I dont understand why I feel alone, or feel sad at all. I guess I just feel left out, but I dont know how to cope."
574,I believe I have schizophrenia,"For about a year now I have been progressively gotten worse, I cannot eat properly because I would believe what I was eating had something in it, I believed people were not real and just robotic and knew what to say to seem real, I have delusions that people can read my thoughts and are laughing at me. It prevents me from feeling alone I would always feel like someone is out there watching me,I would never open windows or doors because I believed it was a shield even though the thoughts would still be there. I feel like I am not in control of my own mind, it is for me like having a counsel in my head telling me what to do next, sometimes I would enter severe catatonic states and feel no urge to move. I never feel alone and it is extremely annoying. Sometimes I would hear faint calls or hollow sounds around my ears and hear people calling me when no one does.  [https://www.mentalhelp.net/schizophrenia/the-new-dsm-5/](https://www.mentalhelp.net/schizophrenia/the-new-dsm-5/)  This describes what I am going through. If i tell my parents about this they will tell me to pray or never believe me or probably think I am possessed. So I am unable to receive treatment PLEASE HELP!"
575,Ideas for daily practice for recovery?,"I'm recovering from depression and suicidal thoughts and I'm taking a class in which we need to perform a daily practice for our well being, like writing in a journal. The prompt is very open and can include anything from 15 minutes of yoga daily, to 15 minutes of writing, or a drawing once a day about how we feel. I've been trying to think of something better than just writing a journal entry every day since the prompt is so open for anything we want to do, does anyone have any ideas or things they do every day that help them? It also has to be 15 minutes give or take."
576,Is this something I should be concerned of?,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this and I apologise if this is not, but I need help to figure out if this is normal or something I should talk about with my therapist. Sorry if this text is messy or doesn't make sense, I tried to get everything in it.

So, I have been diagnosed with depression but so far it has got better as I've been in therapy for years now. But, now for the past 4 or so months, I've started to see, hear and experience shit. At first I thought that it was because I was tired, but no, it's not that and this has just got worse each month. Now for the past days I've seen people like visions in my room and I'm convinced that someone is trying to hurt me. I check my house throughoutly at least 3 times a day and if I see a car that I don't recognise on the road, my head says ""they are going to kill you, what do you do? take a knife, protect yourself"" and I get really paranoid. I always think that if someone drives too close to me that they are trying to hurt me and I should hurt them first so I stay safe and in public I sometimes get the intense feeling of not being safe and I start looking around for people who might be after me.

And the visions or whatever they are called, I've seen before. I was driving a month back and I almost did an emergency brake because I saw someone running to the road, but there was nobody there. My friend sat next to me and she didn't react nor see anything, but I was sure I saw someone. I then thought nothing of it, until this kept happening more and more. Yesterday I saw someone standing by my bed but when I quickly sat up and turned on the light as it was dark, there wasn't anyone. And these sometimes can be shadow like things or human shaped, quite convincing and real looking things. What I saw run to the road was shadow like, but it still looked like a person and was enough to make me almost stop to my tracks.

And just few minutes back, a deep man's voice whispered to me ""I'm going to kill you, hear that"" but there's nobody here. But I heard that. And I often hear other voices too, like somebody opening a door or walking in my house or somebody calling my name or talking about random shit. It always freaks me out and my thoughts start running and I slept with a knife for few nights as I was so convinced that I was unsafe.

So, my question is, is this normal? Because some part of me is like no, everybody has these thoughts. But other part of me says no, no they do not have this. And because of all of this, I really don't know what is real and what is not anymore. Someone may talk to me and it takes me a moment to think if I heard that in my head or if it happened for real or if a person I saw was real or not. I don't know what to think about this anymore and I'm embarrassed."
577,My obsessive fear of germs is ruining my life,"I'm only posting here because I'm desperate and just need to share my problems somewhere. I checked some other subreddits first but the rules seemed not to allow posts like this so here I am. I am 17 years old and my obsessive fear of germs has completely taken over my life. I know I have some sort of problem, but I don't know what. I don't want to self-diagnose myself but getting any kind of professional help seems so far out of reach. I am completely aware that my worries are irrational and people who know about them often tell me to ""stop"" or ""resist"" but it's really not that easy.

I've always had weird habits since I was a kid, but they were never anything concerning. mostly pulling up socks, hand washing, and cleaning my glasses constantly.There was a period of time when I had to lay out my headphone wires in a very specific way before going to bed, and I would get up during the night to go back and make sure these wires were exactly right. But those things seemed minor at the time and didn't really impact my daily life. However, as I became a teenager I started to become more fearful of germs and things got worse. It started off not so bad but has gotten progressively worse and worse over the last few years, and is currently the worst it's ever been.

My hands have become dry and cracked from over-washing. I feel the need to wash my hands after touching pretty much anything that was not sanitised immediately before.

I wash my hands both before and after going to the toilet. 

When I get changed, I have to wash my hands between putting on each piece of clothing, and when I put my pants on my feet cannot touch the edges. If they do, I have to try again with another pair of pants.

I will spit into the sink if ever I feel like germs have gotten into my mouth. I have become extremely paranoid about food safety and food poisoning. There are lots of foods that I flat out refuse to eat anymore and I will often leave a lot of food or spit it out if I take a bite and decide that something is wrong with it. This has had a negative effect on my diet because I'm eating way more pre-packaged foods than homemade food. Whenever I use a mug or cutlery I have to rinse it myself even though it is already clean (and if there are any marks on it I won't use it at all)

I feel like I am constantly focused on my hands. Thinking about what I am touching and how germy it is likely to be. My every action seems to be driven by this. It feels like I can't escape it. I hide this from my friends. I will be discreet or make excuses for things while I am in public because I don't want people to know what is actually going on. 

There is so much more than this but those were just some examples I could think of straight away.

I am so stressed and exhausted by the daily routines that I go through and my parents criticism only adds to the stress. They will often demand that I stop doing these things without realising how difficult it actually is for me. I don't do these things because I want to, or to purposefully be a nuisance, rather If I do not do these things I will become extremely stressed and anxious that something awful is going to happen, despite the fact that I KNOW you need some germs and that most of what I do won't make a difference at all. My parents recognise that I have a problem but expect me to deal with it all by myself. My mum has joked about having me see a therapist without realising that that is actually what I WANT and probably need, but I'm too embarrassed to ask for help. I'm trying to manage this at the same time as school and it's making me both mentally and physically exhausted. Things that would be simple tasks for anyone else are tedious and stressful for me. I don't know what to do."
578,A nightmare helped me?,"This is highly likely to be a pure coincidence. But it still spooked me real good.

I really enjoy my job. I do stress about a lot of things in life. Money, time, etc. But I dont hate my situation. Im not suffering from anything mental at the moment, I think? No anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

Monday - Friday, I wake up at 630. I always set an alarm on my phone because Im absolutely terrible at waking up when I need to. If I didnt set an alarm, I would end up sleeping till 9 or 10. Always, 100% of the time, no doubt in my mind that I will absolutely sleep in.

My phone battery has been failing lately. The charge was rather low before I went to sleep, but I didnt think anything of it.

I had a grotesque nightmare. Gory, Demonic, Horrific images, Innermost fears, the works. I never have nightmares. I couldnt begin to recall the last one I had, but this one was an absolute doozy.

I woke up in cold sweat. I could recall every moment of the dream, the last moment being some demon witch screaming in my face. Trying to ignore the horrible memory, I thought to myself that my alarm hadnt gone off yet, so I could lay there for a while. I picked up my phone to check the time when I noticed that it was totally dead. I started to panic because it could already be 730 or something. I turned my TV on and checked the time,

6:32am

I almost couldnt believe it.

As a professional sleeping-in guy I was awestruck that I just so happened to wake up at exactly the time I needed to. Its almost as if my brain did everything it could to wake me up in time for work.

Some side notes, I dont watch horror movies nor read books or any entertainment like such. Closest thing of that would be the twelve dozen Goosebumps novels I read in middle school, something like 10 years ago. I also put a ton of importance to my job. Im never late, as it means  a lot to me and I do not want to jeopardize my position."
579,Partner with self destructive tendencies,"My partner is on therapy (6+years) for severe trust issues and self destructive tendencies, the main focus being how he ruins his relationships almost intentionally when he's happy. He told me how's difficult it is for him in this period because he's happy and trying to make all this therapy work so hard, but he's fighting inside to this urge to destroy it.
I'm scared for our relationship and for him, I don't know how to support him without making things worse, so if you have some advice I'd be glad to hear it!"
580,Help with feeling depressed after psychosis.,"Hi, so 6 months ago I went through an episode of psychosis, which was a pretty horrible experience as you can imagine. I’m no longer paranoid or delusional but I sadly don’t feel the way that I felt before the episode. I now have issues with low energy, low motivation, anhedonia, apathy and low mood. I don’t have the same passion/zest/enthusiasm for life that I had before and I feel like I’ve lost my mojo to be honest. I have been off any medication (Olanzapine) for 2 months now so I would expect any withdrawal symptoms to be fading/have faded. I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone has any advice that could help/lifestyle changes that might help. I’m particularly interested in if anyone can think of any supplements that have helped them in similar situations?

TL;DR Had psychosis, now depressed. Please help!"
581,Is it possible to subconsciously starve yourself?,"For some reason these days I don’t eat at all? Sometimes I’ll just work throughout the entire day and even though my body feels hunger I forget about it and just don’t make myself eat. From the time I woke up which was 7am to 7pm (now) I just realized I haven’t ate the entire day and then I start to feel a deep pain in my stomach. My parents keep saying I’m losing weight but I don’t really see a difference at all, i just feel like I look the same. I am not intentionally starving myself but I also just keep forgetting to eat and that I’m hungry . What is this??? Why is this happening??"
582,Slowly turning into someone I hate,"I’m slowly turning into the kind of people I hate. I’m fat, I’m lazy, all I do is sit around and do nothing. I don’t know what to do anymore because I’m barely able to get hours at my work. My depression has been better, and I’ve been “recovering” but the sadness and emptiness I’ve felt from my depression has turned into anger."
583,Weekly Mental Health Help for Others. Who Wants Help?,"This is no trick or scam. I'm not asking for money. All I'm getting out of this is experience and helping others. I'm an advocate for Mental Health and pursuing a career in Councelling and volunteering to do this. Who wants to discuss openly their anxiety and depression troubles that are stopping them from their goals and are open to try new things, from an unbiased person, and want to know the life changing things I know?"
584,My boss said hes never heard of depression,"So im 24 and have been dealing with depression for probably 9 years now. I started my new job 3 months ago and last monday i caved and finally went to seek help for the first time. I took all last week off and got put on medication and havent been feeling good at all since i guess it take around 2 weeks to kick in. I tried going in to work again today and just had a breakdown, i called a crisis line and spoke with a lady for 40 mins. After that i went back to the hospital and they basically just assured me that it takes time to work. 

I called my boss here since ive just been texting him since last week and spoke with him. He doesnt sound upset but he is clearly annoyed and only really cares about his business running smoothly. I told him what was going on and he asked me what depression was and i explained it to him. He just kept saying he doesnt understand and asking me when ill be back since its make him and the others job harder. I dont think hes trying to be rude its just hes religious and doesnt understand it.

Has anyone else had to deal with something like this and how do i go about it? I have a doctors note saying i shoulsnt be working for another week here until the medication is in full effect."
585,i want to kms but cant afford to go to hospital but im scared and idk pls help,what should i do? im alone over an hour away from anyone who knows me i cant drive and i cant afford to go to the hospital and idk what to do. i have so much anger and sadness built up rn and no way to release it. im struggling so much and just any advice that isnt “u have so much to live for” or “ur not alone” would be much appreciated
586,Panic attack (?) except I punch myself,"This is a very new thing for me, and when it happens I have a hard time remembering details but I'll do my best to describe it.

I've been comparing this to some sort of panic attack, where I have pain in my chest, shortness of breath/hyperventilation, shaking, and just a general feeling of having no control over myself. Panic attacks aren't a new thing for me, as I've been struggling with anxiety for years. Lately though, these episodes will start like a panic attack, but the feeling is kind of different, very specific and hard to describe. I'll start having the attack, but I'll punch myself, the wall, or basically anything near or around me in the process, pretty hard to the point where I've bruised up my legs pretty good. Mostly it ends up being my legs or my arms, once or twice it was the wall. The first time it happened (about 3 days ago) it really freaked me out because I've never done anything like this before. It continued to happen several times a day and is still consistently happening. My boyfriend was with me for the first 2 days it happened, and he ended up having to pin me down or hold my hands behind my back to keep me from punching myself. 

Today was the first day that it happened without my boyfriend there, and it was significantly harder to control. I can sort of tell when it's going to happen because that very specific feeling comes on pretty fast. From there I'll sort of just sit there and focus super hard on tensing different muscles to distract myself from wanting to punch myself. It hasn't been working very well and both times I left more bruises. After it's over I feel like I just ran a few miles, it's very exhausting

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this? My guess is it's probably stemming from some anger I have built up over some things that have happened in the last few weeks. I've had pretty bad depression for a few years now, and it's been especially worse lately due to my cousin and 2 of my friends passing away in the span of 3 months. I've been wanting to tell my roommate, but I'm scared she'll think I'm crazy or tell someone who would end up getting me admitted. 

It's hard to convince myself that I'm not crazy or losing my mind. I've been trying to get in with my old therapist (the only therapist that has ever actually helped me) but I'm not able to get in until April. If anyone on here knows some good techniques to control something like this or why this might be happening all of a sudden I am all ears."
587,Maybe this is a better place to post I’m not entirely sure.,
588,🖤🥀🔥My Life Story; PART TWO🔥🥀🖤,"[Written On November 4th, 2019] 🥀🦋🖤I honestly havent eaten in 12 days, then yesterday i ate a peice of pie. I might lose people to this. I am idk. Its hard to explian. But even if u hate me im still here. Idk how much expkain it 

Heres some shit u can read. (u don't have to read this. TRIGGER WARNING)

 I sold myself, prostituted myself for about a year, and tortured myself while people tortured me 24/7 everyday. Msybe got raped 50 times a day. Tortured 200 times a day and i was there bitch. They didnt even pay me. Watch out and be careful hun I walked into Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Millers house, the 2nd out of the 3 foster homes i waz in, there was a 9 year old kid getting abused, like how they tied me to a tree and tortured me. They tourtured me so much on a 24/7 daily bases, worse than my bio dad. The 9 year olds name was Anthony Castillo-Martinez, he was autistic and had PTSD and ADHD, self harm, anger and suicidal issues. I got tortured for him, whenever Angela tried to torture him, i got in the way, any kind of abuse and torture and traumatic thing that coulda happened to me. It did. Finally i got a day pass out of the house. I got arrested and started doing criminal things, insane and dangerous things, i was walking on the side of the freeway, i came back, and i saw Angela and Jimmy fighting, Jimmy was tired of Angela torturing me and the other kids, Anthony was outside tied to the tree. I untied him and i stole him, i ran to LA, taking buses and trains, i found a motel, i tried to convince them to let us in, cuz i was technically homeless -again- they let us stay for 3 nights, I called up Kimberly, and she met us over there, Kimberly started torturing me worse and before. She set me up in the sex trade, i had 40 to 70 people a day, guys and girls, torture, abuse, rape, beat, drug me up. For money for us to live and take care of Anthony, she was the RingLeader, per say. I took care of Anthony as my own, Kimberly did absolutely nothing, nothing at all. She paid everyone to torture me,
i was a drug addict and alcoholic. Hardcore, and the more i was high and loaded, the less i felt, at this point in time, I didnt know that Kimberly was the head of all this, one of the guys who continuously tortured me, was trying to go after Anthony, and i stepped in front of him and took the torture, Anthony kept asking me if i was his real mom, i couldnt answer that question. I cried everynight. Jeremy Carlos Baraz came in and started yelling at Kimberly, i was curious, but as soon as i walked in, Jeremy had a gun up to her head, Kimberly told Jeremy to ""Go Shoot Izzy, i have nothing u want, she has meth and cocaine"", Jeremy told me to go to my room, when he left will all my drugs, Kimberly stormed into my room, i was sleeping on my floor like usual, so Anthony had a place to sleep. Kim told me that it was my fault, and ""i coulda got killed, and its all your fault"" she called some of her ""friends"" to come ""handle some business"" about 10 people came in, and they came in my room, and they started literally torturing me. They tied me to the bed, about 20 + more people came in, and they drugged me up, they beat me, tortured me jn every way possible, (later i found out that they filmed it, and it was Kimberlys idea) they raped me, but i was so used to it that i couldn't feel anything. I tried to scream, so they ducktaped my mouth, they said ""you speak, you die"" the more i resisted, 
i was a drug addict and alcoholic. Hardcore, and the more i was high and loaded, the less i felt, at this point in time, I didnt know that Kimberly was the head of all this, one of the guys who continuously tortured me, was trying to go after Anthony, and i stepped in front of him and took the torture, Anthony kept asking me if i was his real mom, i couldnt answer that question.

I tried to scream, so they ducktaped my mouth, they said ""you speak, you die"" the more i resisted,. the more i got tortured. They put a gun to my head, 4 people had a gun each, and two guns were pointed towards each side of my head. It came a daily thing, for weeks, my mom didnt know about anything, she still thought i was at the foster home i ran away from. Each day more and more people came. On the weekends i had more time with Anthony, but i took care of him as my own. Kimberly did shit. I almost died multiple times. But it was my job to protect and provide for Anthony. Kimberly was still my girlfriend, we were engaged. And if i left, all hell would break loose. So i stayed, stupid me. 

_________ **The kids in Angela/Andrea &amp;&amp; Jimmys Home; 

__Englasias ""Enji"" Moreno-Miller: Enji is a hard core drug addict and alcoholic. He got diagnosed with Bipolar, Anxiety and PTSD, hes Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Millers foster-son, Hes 20 years old, he sneaks drugs in the house. Andrea/Angela Miller still abuses him, doesnt matter if hes her son or not. Mainly cuz hes bisexual. They had a custody battle to who gets to mske Enji's life decisions. Jimmy hates when Andrea/Angela abuses Enji. *The Meaning Behind ""Enji"": Enji was a name i made up for him, because he hates the name Englasias cuz its what Andrea/Angela calls him when she abuses him. So i made up a nick name for him 

__Giovanni ""Gio"" Santiago: Giovanni is a 22 year old male. He got put into foster care, when he was 9, Angela/Andrea torturex him obsessivly. In all ways, but Jimmy payz her to do it. Gio has Schizophrenia, Anxiety. pTsd, depression, anorexia, borderline personality, and paranoid physcosis. Angela/Andrea tortures him for no reason, Gio is the oldest of all the people in the house, i usually step in and take the torture for Gio, me and Gio dated for 2 months, then broke up cuz of Andrea/Angelas stupid rules. I protect Gio, were really close, Jimmy abuses him sexually physically by mentally. *The Meaning Behind ""Gio"": Gio is the name i gave him, also know as Gizmo, when he and i were playing ""foster home"" even tho we were already in one lol. Gio Gio Giovanni, we were goofballs, rebels, and sassy queens. We had a lot of fun and were always there to eachother nonstop, and helped eachother, we became to close. Wayyy to close. Love u Gio Gio 
Giovanni. 

__Nancy ""Andrew"" Augustine: Nancy is a 15 year old trasngender female to male. So his pronouns are ""he/him/his"", he went into foster care a year after he was born, he got put into an orphanage. At the age of 2, Nancy was his birth name. And he hasnt gotten it legally changed so Angela/Andrea calls him a ""her"" and he hates it. Angela/Andrea rapes him, drugs him, force feeds him, and physically abuses him. I call him Andrew, and he told me its his ""preferred name"" he likes to sing and write. Me and him have sing offs, and we write songs stories and poems together. *The Meaning Behind ""Andrew"": Susan Augustine was born a female but then transitioned to male, Susan hated her name, but whenever Angela/Andrea kept abusing and torturing her, and kept using ""her/she/hers"" it triggered Andrew. So i asked ""which name do u preferr, Andrew or Susan"" i made him feel welcome and was always there for him, and i wanted to help him to the end, noatter the circumstances, i overhelped him. And i helped him get started with SSI, Mental Health Stuff, and getting a name change. And taking the torture from him and i took it for and instead of him. Andrea/Angela, hated me for it. But i did it anyways. Love u Andrew, he attempted suicide, overdosed on his meds, i found him and called 911, and he was rushd to the ER, he never came home after that. I miss u. :( 

__Monica ""Monee"" Palmer: Monica is a 18 year old female, she was a rebel, she was my best friend, and i helped and was there 4 her obsessivly. Jimmy raped her several times. Andrea beat and tortured her to death, and i hit Andrea over the head with a frying pan and i beat her and attempted to slice her throat, i took the torture for Monica, Ive never seen Jimmy that fuxked up before, he was on PCP, and so was i. Me and Andrea got into an altercation, it involved alcohol, PCP, a gun, glass, and a knife. Me and Andrea/Angela went at it. Jimmy recorded it, and i told everyone to get out of the house. Me and Andrea/Angela went one on one for hours. I pointed the gun towards her, and Monica saw, she was crying. I threw Andrea/Angela out a glass window, after she tortured me extra bad and she taped my mouth shut, she raped abused, tortured, drugged. Burned and almost killed me. Jimmy ran out of the house after i threw Andrea/Angela out the glass window. They never had a license to run a foster home. Monica hugged me and Jimmy was crying, bur not for his wife. For me and everything he did to me, and To Monica. *The Meaning Behind ""Monee"": Monee, is short for Monique, which is a name that her grandma gave her, Monica always kept that name, even after her grandma passed away, Monica grew up without parents, and was sent to live with her.
grandma. After she passed Monica moved in to Jimmy and Angela/Andrea Millers house, and shes been trying to escape, she attempted a lot, but was always brought back to there house.

 __Anthony ""Lil'Toni"" Castillo-Martinez (My Unbio Son, Who Got Taken From Me, I Risked My Life To Raise Him, I Raised Him As My Own) i met Anthony Castillo when he was 9, none of us knew who his real parents are, but i took him in as my own, i risked my life to take care and provide for him, i did all i could possibly do to help and care and be there to him, he was autistic and had PTSD and ADHD, self harm, anger and suicidal issues. I got tortured for him, whenever Angela tried to torture him, i got in the way, any kind of abuse and torture and traumatic thing that coulda happened to me. It did, whether i wanted it to or not, Anthony tried to kill himself after he couldn't find out who his real parents were, I found out Anthony used to live with his aunt and uncle, Sarah and George Castillo, they both gave him up to his previous foster mom, Cherri Martinez, cuz he was ""to hard to handle"", (i figured out that his favorite color was pink, and he loved teddy bears, i still have the pink teddy bear i bought when i was homeless for the 13th time, in memory of my time with Anthony) Cherri had mental health issues, and whenever she had blown out physical violent fights with her ex-husband, who lost custody over Anthony, Jose Martinez, Anthony would hide and try to leave, but Cherri was to attached to him, she wouldn't let him leave at all, i later found out that Sarah and George Castillo abused him so bad. And then gave him away, to Cherri Martinez, but to this day i never knew who his real parents are, i got tortured abused raped in all ways, and drugged and prostituted and almost killed so i had money to care, provide. Support, be there and help Anthony, we lived in a run down motel, i illegally stole Anthony from his 2nd foster home. Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Miller's house, after i left, 

 i came back to save him, he saw me getting tortured, i took care of him obsessivly, i raised him, and he called me ""mommy"" and i lost him after a car accident, with me, Kimberly, and Anthony, after it was over, they found drugs in a back seat, and it was me, him and Kimberly in a back seat. But i never gave him drugs, Kimberly and i had a custody battle. And she won, after she accused me of giving him drugs, and CPS took him away, i was broken up, Ricky, the drunk driver, got charged after they found out he was the driver in the car accident, Jeremy Carlos Baraz, who already had a home, after i intervened into his shooting scene, where i violated my probation, (one of my abusive torturers) knew about the whole Kimberly calling CPS, was a part of getting Anthony taken away, and abusing me situation, i confronted him about it, and i got violent towards him, after Kimberly killed herself in front of me, Jeremy admitted he was a part of taking away Anthony for the money cuz he ""had to survive"", he called the cops on me, I was on cacaine, meth, alcohol, Ativan, And other drugs, i almost died ""according to the doctors at the hospital"", and Jeremy called the cops and later told me what happened, and instead of me violating my probation i got sent to the mental hospital, (which im known for acting out, getting in restraints, and getting the ""bootyjuice"" shot); Anthony is now 14 years old, i cant tell u his birthday cuz it waz something he told me to never give out, i hope hes in a good home,

*The Meaning Behind ""Lil'Toni"": some nicknames i gave him were ""AngelEyezx"" ""Lil Bon Bon"" ""Lil'Toni"" ""Antonio"" ""Mooshi Mooshi"" ""Pain In The Ass"" ""Birdie'"" ""Soldier"" ""Lil One"" ""BroSkiiSkii"" ""MnM"" ""Child"" ""Lovebug"" ""Curious George"" ""Momo"" ""Anto"" ""A-Skii"" ""Ace"" ""Annnnnthony"" ""Smart One"" ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" ""Mamas Boy "" ""My Son"" ""Jay Jay"" ""Trouble Maker Jr"" ""Izzys Angel"" ""Lil Angel"" ""My Love"" ""My Sweetheart"" ""Mister"" ""Beautiful"" ""Lassie"" ""Strong One"" ""Smartass"",
*AngelEyezx: this nickname was made up by both of us, he had green eyes and i had a similar color and we would always compliment each other on our eye color, we were like twins, he said i was his angel, and i said he was mine, so we came up with this nick name.
*Lil Bon Bon: Anthony was short, well no shit. He was nine, and he loved cinamon rolls, he would always ask me to buy them, it was his favorite food. Even when i didnt have enough money to buy them, he knew what went on in that motel, he called it a motel, but it waz really a run down low star hotel, Anthony wasnt naive about what happened to me nearly everyday. But i called him that cuz he loved cinamon rolls. 
*Lil' Toni: waz one of the 1st nicknames i gave him, because i still consider him my little boy, even if he waz only 9 at the time.
*Antonio: He would have pillow fights with me, while listening to music. He came up with the name Antonio when we would roleplay in the pillow fights. 

*Lil' One: i would always call him that cuz he was my Lil One.
*BroSkiiSkii: i forgot how this one came about.
*MnM: he loved MnMs so i called him MnM
*Child: i call everyone child, but it started with  Anthony.
*Lovebug: i just called him this, cuz i thought it was cute.
*Curious George: he was always curious about alot of things. And was always curious about the next day and/or what would happen next.
*MoMo: MoMo was also a nickname that i just came up with.
*Anto: a nickname he came up with, he never told me what it meant tho.
*A-Skii: A, short for Anthony, well thats obvious, but i mixed it with BroSkii, to A-Skii.
*Ace: i always think that the Ace and The Joker are the most important cards in the deck, so i called him Ace, cuz he was the most important thing to me.
*Annnnnthony: i loved to joke around with him and make funny voices and stories and i always extended his name, when i was in a joking mood.
*Smart One: i used sarcasm a lot, and when he would smart off to me or Kimberly, i would always say ""hold on smart one"" i would laugh, he mostly smarted off to Kimberly and she wouldn't like it, i was overprotective over him and would literally do anything for him, so i would get hurt instead but him, Anthony never liked Kimberly, i think nobody did either. And it was obvious why.
*Sweet Child O Mine: he loved Guns N' Roses, and whenever we would sing that we would dedicate it to eachother.
*Mamas Boy: Anthony was a Mamas Boy, so that name was obvious.

*My Son: hes my son, but he would never leave my side, instead of me saying ""thats my boy"" i would say ""thats my son"" i was proud of him all of time, and i was proud to be his mom, not by blood, but by heart.
*Jay Jay: tbh i forgot how i came up with that one.
*Trouble Maker Jr: i was the original trouble maker, he would try to take after me. But i wouldn't.
*Izzys Angel: like Charlies Angels, i named him Izzys Angel, cuz hes my angel, duh. Lol.
*Lil Angel: hes my angel. Period.
*My Love: hes my love to infinity and beyond.
*My Sweetheart: hes my sweetheart, and always will be.
*Mister: ""what are u doing mister"" i always said that.
*Beautiful: he has a beautiful soul and heart.
*Lassie: he loved dogs, and anything that had to with dogs.
*Strong One: hes extremely strong. In every which way possible.
*Smartass: he would be smart to Kimberly or me, and i would say ""ok Smartass"".
But Lil Toni was my favourite one to call him.

*The Meaning Behind ""Tyler"": Tyler X or ""Ace X"" or ""XX"" Fiaskko-Alvaro, is one of my main alters. I have many alters and i live among many alternate universes. Mainly NXSP, or Not Xactly Secure Program, is where my mind is mainly centered, when i was 9 years old, i sae a man, or a shadow, with a knife, on my bed, when i was living in Fernbank, and he told me to look him in the eyes, and i did, and thats when he became my master, and he tortured me, i shoulda never looked him in the eyes, or i probably wouldn't have had the many mental illnesses u have now. But i ""raised hell"" as Liz Ramos, who i claimed was my name, especially when i went to ETS mental hospital when i was 12, i told them my name wasn't Sara (Sara is my legal name) that it was Liz. And i go by Izzy now, i took the last name Martinez, from Anthony. Even if its not my real last name. Tyler was my second alter, also being mind abused by Johnny ""JJ"" Garcia. 
 ____________________________ 

**About Angela/Andrea and Jimmy; 

[Angela/Andrea Miller]; Angela/Andrea Miller was born in prison, and almost aborted. Her parents were a religious couple, and her brother, Delacruz, would torture her behind their parents back, one day Angela hit her head against a brick wall, she woke up with no memory of anything, and couldnt remember her name, at all, she got diagnosed with ""Multiple Personality Disorder"" and became abusive and extremely torturous, she met Jimmy at a frat party, and they started doing drugs together, but Jimmy had no idea about her torturous side. She ""switched"" a lot, kinda the same situation as Dr J. And Mr Hide, but her good personality faded and Angela and Andrea became one personality. The extremely torturous personality. 

[Jimmy Miller]; Jimmy was always abusive, but never as abusive and his wife, Angela/Andrea Miller. Jimmys biological kids got put into foster care after being taken away by CPS, Jimmy grew up in an abusive single parent household, he was a wife beater and abused his kids. His dad was never around and his mom was addicted to crack cocaine and alcohol. Jimmy was a bully at school when he was in high school. Jimmy met Angela/Andrea Miller at a frat party. And they clicked as soon as they met, but still he had no idea about the ""real side"" of her, Jimmy offered to run a group home, which later lead to the foster home, but they never had a license to be foster parents, they took in Enji first, and thats how everything started. How i know this? I observed a lot. 

**About Anthony; Anthony is a 14 year old male. Who is my unbiological son, i bent over backwards for him, He got taken away after Kimberly Marie Olivarez, who is my deceased ex fiance, and Jeremy Carlos Baraz, who is my deceased ex friend. Both of them made a false accusation that i gave him drugs, which is false. And CPS took him away, he was 9 at the time, now hes 14. Hes turning 15 soon, and i miss him everyday. I raised him as my own. We never figured out who his real parents are. But he lived with his aunt and uncle Sarah and George Castillo, then with a foster family, With Cherri and Jose Martinez, then with Angela/Andrea and Jimmy Miller, where we were previously living, i left than came back for Anthony. I havnt seen him for years and idk where he is, i did my best to be a mother. And to take care of him, no Matter the circumstances. 

**My 4 Different Experiences W/ Anorexia; 
1st Time: 2012; Weight: 77lb. 
I would starve myself till i passed out, i would obsess over calories, including refusing to drink water, i would excersise to the point of passing out, they rushed me to the ER, and i got fed through a feeding tube, i weighed down to 77lb and still thought i was fat, my bones were showing, i couldnt function, longest without food was 10 days, i drank ensure and made myself throw it up. I went into treatment for Anorexia Nervosa, my mom still isnt aware to this day. 

2nd Time: 2015; Weight: 84lb. 
All i ate were saltine crackers, and i would starve myself up to 8 to 9 days, while in the process of doing that, i was in treatment, remember i didnt have a home from 2011 to 2018. So nobody was aware, i went down to skin and bone. I was homeless and bouncing from mental hospital, to treatment centers (unlocked/locked/involuntary/voluntary/short term/long term) the streets. And to rehabs, foster homes, group homes etc etc. I weighed myself everyday. People got concerned, and they admitted me to a mental hospital after i was on the side of the highway, and i kept blacking out, i was on a lot of drugs at that time. Meth mainly, and alcohol. I got taken to a mental hospital, and i couldn't leave till my tray was finished. And i had a 1:1 staff with me at all times to monitor my food intake, but i got past them, i didn't eat for a week, and they gave me the feeding tube again, and i had a huge hatred towards food. 

3rd Time: 2017; Weight 98lb.
I was in and out of placements and i starved myself for 6 days, then on the 7th i made it look like I ate. With my own methods. I was extremely insecure, and my mental illnesses got worse, people said i was skinny, but even at 98lb i still thought I was fat. I was sent to a treatment centre for eating disorders, and i still refused to eat, and i checked myself out. And then regretted it later. 

4th Time: 2019; Weight: Under 130lb.??
Its been since late March or early April. And is still active at this time, i basically hate food. Its been months new, and my weight has been rapidly decreasing, i starve myself from 4 to 6 days, and on the 6th day i eat something small.  Then i secretly throw it up, im not at an unhealthy weight, i exercise obsessivly and obsess over calories, i look in the mirror and i look fat, but everyone else saying that im Skinny, after the 5 to 6 days with no food, on day 7 i eat something small, then starve myself again, im blacking out more, and my mom wants me to go to  treatment, i hate food with a burning passion, and im taking diet pills, but im over 1 year clean from all drugs and alcohol, im obsessed with losing weight   and even after i lose to much. Its never low enough. 
🔥🦋🥀This Is My 4th Time Struggling With Anorexia Nervosa. Ive been starving myself for so long now, that its become so easy to just skip days with no food. Food is my enemy &amp; i hate food ' all food with a passion. Ive seeked treatment several times, ive gotten a feeding tube, and almost died several times. I count the calories and literally EVERYTHING. I excercise obsessivly. While i look in the mirror and see how fat i look, everyone else says i ""look sick"" and im ""skinnier then i realize""

589,Any advice for how to get a psychotic person to take meds?,"My mom is 68 years old and she’s had schizophrenia for pretty much her whole life.  She won’t take her meds.  She thinks she’s allergic to them.

This morning she texted me and asked me to come over and fix her house because it’s saying mean things to her.   I drove right over, and as far as I can tell she’s having a lot of auditory hallucinations.  She was watching music videos and kept asking me why they sounded so weird and why the people in the videos kept threatening her and telling her to get out of the house.  Also she said that when she opened her kitchen cabinets she could hear people having sex inside of them, and also that someone was using her computer to make child porn, somehow.  She didn’t want to go in her bedroom because the walls there were telling her “this is my house, you have to get out” or something like that.

I called the clinic where she sees a psychiatrist.  I spoke to a social worker there, who told me my mom missed her appointment last week.  She tried to talk to my mom on the phone but my mom wouldn’t talk to her.  I offered to bring my mom to the doctor to get her some medicine and she said no thanks.  She doesn’t think she’s psychotic, she thinks it’s a problem with her house or someone hacked her Netflix or something.  She said she was allergic to antipsychotic drugs.  I felt like there was nothing I could really do because she didn’t want to go to the doctor, didn’t want to take meds, and I can’t force her to.

Do any of you have any suggestions that could help?  I feel like the only option is waiting until it gets so bad that she’s completely incoherent and then having her involuntarily committed, but I know that’s not good for her.  I’d like to get her treatment ASAP but I can’t get her to agree to it."
590,What do I do????,"I feel like ive posted here before, but I think it's just some type of false deja vu.

I can't seem to get stuff off my chest when I need to, yet I get emotional when i'm alone in my own world. I face alot on the daily, from chronic asthma pains and clinical anxiety to taking AP classes in 8th grade, yes, 8th. I want to talk to a friend about my issues, but none of em are willing to listen, and the ones that are willing to help are out of my state, and can't really do much either. 

If I were to actually explain it to somebody, they'll hit me with ""MAN UP"", or something simular, and I can't stand it. I mess up on almost everything, and im a socially awkward person. People get mad at me over Catch 22s that I cant even tell them about, and its like I have to take responsibility over things that have NOTHING to do with me, which is why I hide my pains and issues from people. I'm literally screaming my lungs out and killing my brain cells because of my rage.

I usually play Dauntless and watch YouTube/Posts on Instagram/Reddit as a coping mechanism, because I can't really do anything else. I don't really have a life outside of a 24/7 online Coordinate Algebra course that's skuffed and being the oldest out of 4 children who consistently mess up and do things that trigger really bad thoughts, and actions that I don't intend on doing/thinking.

I decided to make QuickNotes on my phone to help me actually list the things going wrong and stuff, and i'm afraid to tell anybody because then I feel like i'm overexaggerating and being a faker about myself... I can conclude that nobody understands me and if I were to actually explain myself in a way where people could understand, they would literally shit on me.

Of course, i'm an intelligent person, but i'm also very slow in the head thanks to stress and anxiety. I can't do much in conversations without screwing the whole thing up and making the chat go dead, or screwing up IRL and having everyone doubt me. I'm very sensitive, and I remember things that hurt and zone out alot because of memories like those of which hurts.

Everyone always thinks im a cool chill person, when on the inside I feel as if my reactor core is overheating and is about to cause a major radiation overload... I have to hold in anger and intrusive thoughts of suicide/homocide, or urges to try and harm myself everyday, and I just want it to stop... I suffer PTSD from past events and my abusive father who is now on a restraining order for his craziness... 

Everyone keeps saying I need a therapist, but it's not that easy, if literally everyone who I can ask for help just doubts me and wont listen. I just want someone to give advice, or at least suggest some things to help. I'm not even trying to be a karma whore, or whatever, its not even funny. Really. I honestly don't even think anyone would understand..."
591,?????,"Over the past few days I've started hearing what seemed like noises or murmurs but now I can hear the odd word or sentence, and get so engrossed in listening to these noises I wont notice time going I think my mum can read my thoughts and I'm pretty sure she knows I know about it, but she wont say anything."
592,Sister is in hospital for breakdown. Psychosis/bipolar. Her roommates are bullying her to move out. I want to take legal action to get them kicked out of HER apartment,My sister is being bullied/harassed by her roommates for having mental health issues. they want her to leave the apartment but she’s been living there the longest and had them move in after her. They make her pay more for the room and scream at her for not doing dishes. I want to take action. Does anyone know any good articles or anything I can do for her ? She got so drunk the other night because her friends/roommates are being so evil to her and two guys followed her home and raped her.  I’m extremely distraught and just want to help her.
593,A question about compulsive thoughts.,I've recently been experiencing anxiety and depression that seems to be double what it usually is. I'm normally able to cope without meds but I have scheduled a doctor's visit tomorrow and I'm scared. I've started having these horrible thoughts that terrify me and I'm afraid one day O might act on those thoughts. Any body else experience something like this? I'm terrified of the night now because that's when the thoughts are the worst. I don't know if I'm crazy or it's normal. I've read that it happens to a lot of people but what if I'm in the margin that act on those thoughts? What do I say to my doctor? And I'm so scared the doc will give me meds that amplify all of these thoughts and make my depression and anxiety worse. Can someone help? Any tips appreciated.
594,I’m constantly mean to everyone and I can’t control it,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression, ocd, selective mutism, and general anxiety since I was 12. I’ve been to so many therapists and have been on so many medications to no avail. My dad tries to help it’s just there’s nothing that he can really do.

I dropped out halfway through freshman year because I kept getting panic attacks and just stopped going. I’m a sophomore now and I just started this homeschool program last week and it’s so stressful I can’t even get all my work done every day. I’ve tried 2 other programs before this so i’ll have to stick with it. It’s not even possible to do the amount of work they’re asking.

Well anyways i’m always telling my dad how I hate him and flipping him off. It’s a reflex or a habit at this point. It’s fucked up but it’s the only thing that calms my stress a bit. I know it’s horrible but it’s the only thing i’ve tried that works. I really should kill myself I don’t deserve to be alive. He’s all I have other than my brother, I have no friends. Me and my brother get along just fine though. 

He just went off on me and now i’m in my room crying. He should’ve gone off on me. It’s really making the suicidal thoughts worse. 

There’s not an hour that goes by where I don’t think of suicide. I have dreams about it but not good dreams. But i’m too scared to do it, i’m too scared to even self harm. 

Nothing brings me joy. And even the things that do like watching a movie I can’t do now because school is taking up all my time. 

I feel like I have something undiagnosed about me that’s making me so angry or maybe i’m just making excuses. I don’t feel mentally stable. I’m actually a bad person. And I don’t mean that in a “make me feel better” kind of way I just really am"
595,help me,"for anyone who's been to a mental hospital i need advice....is it actually beneficial and is it as bad as people make it out to be? 

i don't know if i should tell my therapist about cutting because it has gotten worse recently. i'm scared that if i do tell her i'll have to go to a mental hospital 

btw i live in cali and i'm 14"
596,Not sure how to start,"This feels really silly to say but I feel like I need to speak to a mental health professional and I’m not really sure what to say or where to start.  I know something has changed in my mental state but I have a very difficult time describing it. It’s like, I know something is wrong but I can’t quite nail down what the feeling is. I told a friend a while back that I need to make an appointment with a therapist but I haven’t taken any steps toward that so far. Then, I ran into her at a super bowl party yesterday and she asked me wether or not I had made that appointment yet. It really meant a lot that she remembered me saying that and cared enough to ask me about it. I really want to take the next step and talk to someone but I’m scared that I wont make any sense and they won’t be able to help me. Also, I’m active duty military and don’t want to speak to another military member. Maybe it’s just the stigma that comes with seeking help that I don’t want to be associated with.  Either way, I don’t know how to get help outside the military medicine system. Anyone got any stories of starting out with a psych and how they were helped or ideas about how to get started? I know that mental health is my responsibility and want to get help, I just don’t know what to say or where to start..."
597,Is my girlfriend having a psychosis episode?,"So about 2 weeks ago my girlfriend K, moved out of her house and didn’t tell anyone. She lived with her family and they did not see this coming. She didn’t tell me, and just texted me she needed some distance. I later found out she actually moved out. I tried texting her but no reply. 


Fast forward to today, they find out she was living with a teacher at a trade school she attended. This is a trade school that offers medical certifications, like the PCT she had just completed. And for whatever reason, she decided to move in with her old teacher. Her progress had just ended in the middle of January I believe. 


Her best friend picked her up and helped move her out of the apartment she was staying at. I don’t know how they found out of how they got her to come along, they are hesitant to share all the information. But she is currently under the care of her best friend.


Her friend is saying she is acting crazy, laughing a lot then crying a lot and then being completely calm. She said she doesn’t want to talk to anybody and doesn’t care about anybody. She said she was going to meet me tomorrow but I never agreed to that and they think she is going to try and go back to the teachers apartment. 


The cops couldn’t do anything since she is an adult and she decided to move in. I’m going to assume they didn’t find drugs when they went because apparently the cops went to the apartment with the best friend. 


This is NOT normal behavior for her. She is usually a very calm, catholic girl. Very sweet and just calm. 


Could this teacher have some sort of psychological ‘hold’ over my girlfriend K?? What could cause someone to ditch all their personal feelings and emotions and want to ‘hide away’ with them? 


My first theory was maybe she has a relationship with the teacher. The teacher is a female, and is older like probably in 40s If I had to guess. K is a virgin, and I don’t think she had experienced any sexual encounter before so that’s what made me think something like that is happening. 


Any insight on mental breakdowns and episodes of psychosis would be much appreciated because I am trying to help but her family is hesistant to let me."
598,Teenager with a small problem,"Hi guys so here’s the deal: the past few months I’ve just been feeling this wave of something I don’t really know how to explain. It’s like I’m sad but I tell myself there isn’t any reason to be sad and I’m just acting this way and Im not sad at all. And also I recently got a girlfriend that I think really likes me and I like her but I always think of these scenarios in my head where she’s cheating on me and It hurts a little when I think this way. And also I just feel like nobody likes me or something like I’m doing everything wrong. My creativity hasn’t been that great and I just have a funny but not good feeling constantly in my gut. I’m not hoping to the answer of all my problems guys, just advice I guess"
599,I feel like I'm going to cry in normal social situations and feel guilty even though I haven't done anything,Any ideas how to fix?
600,I'm scared of myself.,"I'm sorry ahead of time if this paragraph is too large or just a jumble of thoughts. I've been doing anything to stop thinking, so if this post keeps bouncing from one thing to another I apologize. I'm 19, 20 in November. Last year in May, I graduated. And with graduation as many know, people go their separate ways. They tend to, anyway. Back then I was worried, as well. I've never been good at dealing with stuff alone. When I do, my mind races to think of all the worst outcomes first. School allowed me to talk to people that cared about me, though. They were there for me when I needed them, and I was there for them in return. I still remember teachers pulling the old PDA card out whenever one of my friends would hold onto me if I was going through stuff. That got me through so much. I wasn't left to my own thoughts. Since graduation, I've only seen my closest friend in person once. I know they have their own lives, and I'm proud of them. But, whenever problems occur in my life now, I don't know what to do. I know it's pathetic. Even if I have people texting me to let me vent, that thought of me talking to someone through a screen constantly pops up in my mind. And even if they're talking to me through the phone, I feel alone. I've made it through the year though, till recently. Last week, I found out that my closest friend took her own life. Since then, I've constantly been on the verge of a breakdown. And no matter who I contact, no one is available to meet so I can talk. I've had to deal with this alone and my brain keeps telling me that it would be so much easier to not have to deal with all of this. To be free of stress. Of life. Those thoughts have always been in the back of my head, hell, I'm sure everyone's had them at some point. But they're getting louder now. And I want to listen to them so bad. I don't know what to do."
601,Stop romanticising Mental health and memes,"I hate these memes. I can literally make a generic meme about mental health and get  upvotes. Just do a comic saying  ''How does it feel in your head?'' - re: ''It feels like an apocalypse''.

And you'd get comments like ''OMG SO RELATABLE, THIS IS RELATABLE CONTENT''

''tHiS IS hOW I FeEl DAILY''

\- 400-700 Upvotes from the local reddit r/teenagers kids

Seriously i am sick and tired of clowns degrading themselves in the forms of ''memes'', yes we get it, your head is an apocalypse disaster that will continue to not only get worse but be paramount to what you're dealing with now. This whole culture of romanticising mental illness is pathetic. These are the same people who feel offended when someone makes a remark about their illness, but will laugh at a meme about how disposable and ''disastrous'' they are. i have no issues with general memes like ''when you feel the need to do a compulsion'', but what i hate is those memes that paint you as some beautiful tragedy

Why are we normalising low self worth and low self esteem? we don't want a society where everybody is a ''Doomer'', and as an excuse is just ''depressed''.

I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, BPD, a disability, and even have history of non S.I.B, i refuse to mention the full name to not trigger anyone as SH is a sensitive thing. But i just want people to realise not every trait has to be a meme"
602,The only reason people know me is because I was cool in 9th grade.,"So my school is split into different friend groups. The ""cool"" people that do drugs, the ""Uncool"" people that do drugs, The good kids that don't do drugs, the bad kids that don't do drugs, and the outcasts. 

I started out in the bad kids that don't do drugs group, which did not associate with the ""cool"" people that do drugs. I was part of the group from all of middle school until a field trip in grade nine where I alienated one of my best friends and was basically kicked out of the group. 

For some reason though I managed to instantly gain a bit of traction in the cool kids that do drugs group and gained notoriety throughout grade 9 since me being on drugs was apparently funny. 

However grade 10 rolled around, and I realized I didn't have any true friends in that group. Nobody that actually cared about how you felt. I did so well in grade nine because I started off that year with the support of friends. But this new year I had nobody to help me settle in. If there wasn't one of the three people I could actually talk to in a class I could talk to nobody. And not talking to anybody for the first two periods of the day broke me for the rest of the day. Since I had so much energy from just sitting there doing nothing I became anxious, I got social anxiety something I had never experienced before. I started bringing alcohol to school. Ans the result were amazing. I had friends again, drunk me didn't care about friend groups or anything. I felt free to talk to everyone. Nobody was unworthy of my attention so I always had people to talk to. 

Skip to grade eleven I started off the year same as before, coming to school drunk every day. As awesome as before. My parents searched my room because I said I had lost my calculator and they didn't want to buy a new one and figured they could find it themselves. They found multiple empty bottles of wine. I was planning to dispose of them the following day. I don't know why I didn't. Without alcohol's help I was more broken than before. I didn't have the strength of drunk me anymore and I didn't have any drugs because I was broke. Which meant my position in the ""cool"" kids that do drugs group was not going to be possible anymore. I started coming to school and pretending to be high. I told everyone I was still getting drunk at home just that I wasn't doing it at school anymore. But my anxiety was building like a fountain about to overflow, I could barely speak. Some days I can barely even move my legs.

Today it's been 6 months since I've done any drug. I'm still pretending. Today was the worst I ever felt. I was shaking in my chair. It took every ounce of mental strength to get myself to sand up and walk out of the classroom. I nearly fell a few times walking to mcdonalds for lunch. The anxiety is killing me. How can a human body have this much adrenaline."
603,Bad mental state,"Hey Reddit, 
I have recently over the past year developed this horible mental state where I'll subconsciously start telling myself to kill myself or self harm. Ive also been waking up to large scratches on my wrist. They are definitely made by me in my sleep no question about it. I have no real connections left in terms of friends and I don't want to worry my family as they have caught me self harming before and I don't want to worry them as I remember how sad it made them feel. I don't trust anyone irl to tell them so here I am making some dumb post on the internet at 2am to give me hope. I can't go to a therapist I'm only 17 and don't make that kind of money. I've tried seeing my school counceler but he was off no help. I don't want to slave away for the rest of my life working some shitty 9-5 job.  I'm not talented enough to do any of the stuff I enjoy professionaly. So I know the rest of my life will be a misery with some office job I don't even want that I only do because it pays well. I don't really have anyone so I thought I'd vent to Reddit. 
Thanks 
R"

605,Let the worst get the best of me again,"I have trouble coping with stress and anxiety, not just on a basic level but on an advanced level, that the stimulus will be the same, in most cases minor,  but my reaction will be disproportionately negative. It came to a head today when I snapped and got fired from my job over something minor. I haven't been able to hold a job for more than a year at a time before getting fired let go because it is only matter of time before my mental state decomposes and I turn into a confused, stressed, angry, person who feels helpless and either gives up or lashes out. I try but deep down inside there are too many problems I can't even really explain that place my life in cycle of failure, the worst in me will always over the best in me."
606,I don't know what's happening anymore?,"I'm a college student on the east coast and I don't even really know what happened. I was having a normal Monday. I just got back from my home state yesterday for some private matters and was looking forward to the week. But as today progressed, I just started feeling more and more shitty about myself?

I still don't really understand but I just started feeling like I forgot something and that something was just kind of broken? In me? And I don't understand it and it's making me freak out. I'm breathing heavily and I don't feel like myself. 

I've been struggling with some form of mental illness for years, but I'm not diagnosed so I can't say with certainty what it is, but every time it happens, it hits me like a sledgehammer. I'm just really scared I may do something stupid tonight because I feel weird and off and numb and I don't know what to do and I feel like reality itself is like closing in on me."
607,Is it okay or normal to get irritated and/or upset by many attempts at positive inspiration by others?,"I've found as times gone on and I see the same quotes or thoughts said at me time and time again I'm getting angry as soon as I see them, I dont take it as a personal attack and i dont hold it against the people saying them. I'm just finding that my brain is fed up of being told to try things I've tried or quotes and thoughts that my depressed logic can easily tear apart. I still appreciate the effort they are going to to improve the world around them and increase the positivity. But even though I truly appreciate it I cant stop the gut feeling and emotions that rise instead. Everyone seems to be surprised when I dont react happily towards positivity posts or hopeful quotes and I am wondering if it's another thing to add to the extensive list of things that are wrong with me and make me abnormal or if for one of the first times I'm experiencing emotion normally for once and that normality is what's causing me to struggle.

I appreciate any advice, truly and I am really sorry if this upsets anyone. Thankyou for reading this and good day."
608,Lost Years to Depression,"Hi all. I'm 19, and I know this is still young, but I feel such immense guilt for time I feel like I've wasted.  I was diagnosed with major depression and general anxiety when I was 12, and I've always been in a troubled family situation. I used to be so passionate, and I feel like I have so much wasted potential. I dropped all of my hobbies for quick pleasure (spending money, smoking weed, video games, SLEEP), I went from nearly straight A's in advanced classes to barely passing, I've had next to no social life and zero memories and accomplishments. I'm in a slightly more stable place in my life and I am looking to start seeking treatment and start ""becoming myself"" again by taking up hobbies, trying to be social, etc... but I feel so overwhelmed with guilt, shame and hopelessness over my past, that it's difficult to have the positive outlook I need. I don't feel able to move forward and I was wondering if anyone else had anything that helped them in a similar situation."
609,Fatherless Daughter syndrome / fear of abandonment,"It's taken me the better part of 22 years to realise how badly I've been affected by growing up with an absent father and my mum who used me as a crutch for her own issues.

 I've always felt different to my friends, and have never understood a real family dynamic. 

 I am an only child from a family with a drug addicted mother (who I have been told has attempted suicide several times in my lifetime and I believe to have a myriad of mental health problems). This is something I've always been used to and tried to ignore, as I believe you can't help where you come from but you can help where you go.. My form of rebellion growing up was to do as well as possible in school and avoid all forms of drugs.

As I get older I feel my self-esteem dropping and am realising how bad my relationships with men are... I have severe abandonment issues and I'm equally terrified of being with someone as I am of being alone. I have come to realise over time that this is most likely related to my lack of male role model in my childhood and subsequent familial issues. 

I find it incredibly hard to confide in people as I grew up being used to caring for my mother's emotional well-being, being her confidante for as long as I can remember and dealing with her extreme mood swings. She is not a bad parent, just someone that has been through a lot and made a few wrong turns; However, I have been left completely scarred by how I was bought up and scared to talk to people about how I feel in case I am burdening them with the pain that I have felt for most of my life. 

I am constantly so scared and I have no idea how to fix my issues, I'm terrified I'm going to end up alone because of the walls I have built around me to stop myself from feeling any more hurt. Men I am romantic with constantly tell me I am cold and that I close up very quickly - this hurts even more because I know that I'm really nothing like how I project myself to others. 

The only man I have ever felt a complete trust in my life is my best friend who has cared for me endlessly over the last two years. This is a relationship that confuses me as I've never felt love from a man without it having sexual connotations, and the more I think about it the more I worry I'm going to mess up this friendship by inevitably falling in love with the one person that truly cares about me. 

TLDR: Is there anyone else here feeling lost? 

How do I fix my relationship and attitude toward men  / increase my self-esteem and stop being so scared to open up to people?"
610,How Do You Tell If You're Bipolar?,"Hello. I (F16) have been experiencing a lot of mood swings and I just want to know if I could possibly be bipolar. 

Like I said, I've been having a lot of mood swings lately. In the beginning of December, I was extremely low and felt horrible everyday. (By then I haven't been to therapy for a week or two, and haven't been back since.) There wasn't really a real reason. To cope I c*t myself, and drank everyday. I reached out for help, and was told I felt bad because of that, my behavior. Which is probably true. However, I haven't been drinking regularly for over a week now and it's actually been great, except I still feel horrible. Sometimes I get very suddenly 'happy' and start getting so excited I feel the urge to cry, and then feel happy and sad at the same time in extreme. I don't know if this is 'normal' or sounds weird but it's been exhausting. 

A few days ago, I was having dinner with my family and my grandmother made a comment about something as little as me being on my phone and I completely lost it and went on this angry rant and shouted at her. I still feel really bad about it, I love her alot and would normally never do that but I completely lost control. 

In another instance, I was talking to a friend online and they said they were falling asleep. I was extremely happy, but then I just felt awful after they said it. He then eventually fell asleep which surprised me, and I just froze and started crying suddenly. I keep having these intense emotions over the smallest things. I'm sorry if this sounds stupid but I just really hate it and don't know what to do. 

I took some online tests and researched it, and found I have some symptoms but I'm still unsure, and wouldn't want to self diagnose but I'm just so exhausted and want to know what's going on. If it helps, my mother has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

I know it's much more than a few mood swings but I just feel horrible and put off by these sudden ups and downs.

I might just get a 'go see a therapist' but I'm just looking for honest opinions here, or some help. If you have a question I'll gladly answer. Thanks."
611,URGENT: How long should I wait before becoming concerned about a possibly suicidal friend not answering me?,"Cross posted in: r/depression_help (so far)

Hey, so my town has had a lot of tragedies lately. Including a teacher and a student in my class. My friend, let’s call her Oak, was relatively close to the student and was even on her way to where he was at when he died. She was also close to the teacher (as was I) and the teacher was the first adult she had ever told about her family. Oak’s family, mostly her father, is pretty bad. She swears he doesn’t hurt her, but I don’t know if I believe that. I know he hurts Oak’s mother. He drinks a lot too. That added on to all of this as well as her behavior the last couple weeks is really worrying me. She has a history of this type of thing, and I helped her get through it last time, but she isn’t talking to me. 

And other friends of hers are noticing too. One of them R, has also expressed a worry that Oak will hurt herself. Now that the kid in our class died a few days ago, (and Oak was bad before that), I am getting really worried. I have texted her to attempt to check up on her, you know, make sure she knows someone cares, but she hasn’t responded. I have asked R if they have talked to Oak, but I haven’t gotten a response either. 

How long until I should be really worried. Oak lives like 25 minutes away from me, which doesn’t seem like a lot, but it could be depending on the situation. Plus, I have parents that track me and would not approve of me driving over there, or even calling Oak’s parents, (which I think would be counterintuitive anyway). 

So, if I do take the risk, I need to know, in your opinion, how long until I should start panicking and calling...she’s my best friend, I don’t want to push her away, but I’ll never forgive myself if she hurts herself and I didn’t even try to help her.  Please. Any advice at all would be very helpful"
612,i need to see my psychiatrist but i really dislike her,"my depression has gotten really bad lately and i havent taken my medicine in almost a year now. i want to see my psychiatrist because while i still have a lot of medicine i want to make sure it would still work / not be too strong for me now. 

this psychiatrist is really frustrating to be with though. she literally forces a parent to be there the entire session while she asks questions (including answering questions related to past/current abuse). even if you and your parent say they want you to be alone with her she doesnt allow it.
she also gets mad at me when i stim or dont look her in the eyes. shes really condescending and belittled me when i mentioned not doing well in school. 

is it even legal for her to have virtually no confidentiality with patients? even as a minor i have right of privacy too, right? its really frustrating. we've tried changing but i guess smth abt our insurance wont work out."

These symptoms are very obvious and clearly noticeable when you get to know my gf properly:

1. She can’t think long term, abstractly, outside of the current moment. (For example, if I say something with a double meaning, she wouldn’t understand. She can’t understand standup comedy because the a lot of jokes are saying one thing but meaning something else entirely)

2. She is social on the surface but is incapable of forming deep human connection, even with me.

3. She can’t process emotions, be vulnerable and literally shuts down if you try to have an adult conversation about issues in our relationship. (I bring up a concern and how it makes me feel and its impact on her relationship and her response will be staring at me blank faced completely....she will never say anything nor ever bring it up later, so its as if im talking to a wall. When pressured to say something she visibly seems to have difficulty saying anything comforting or meaningful)

4. She can’t talk about any deep topics in life, nor focus on anything someone is saying for longer periods. She admits she may have intense adhd. She has never watched a movie at all, says she can’t focus on it...

5. She has to constantly be doing something non stop everyday. She can’t sit still and just relax or think about things.

6. She has literally can not comprehend much of the world and how it functions outside of her world. 

7. She says she has dyslexia but im not sure what that means in the real world...

8. Emotionally it seems she is stuck as a child and never grew up. 

9. She was raped when she was 6 and her parents weren’t around that much during her younger years.

I am confused about what to do. Many of her behaviour seems like relationship red flags to me and i often get very anxious and want to leave her. But then on the other hand she seems like there is something mentally wrong with her and I need to understand it a bit.

She doesn’t address my needs, doesnt flirt, doesn’t really know much of anything and i have to literally spell out and guide her in the relationship mostly to no avail. Socially and emotionally she seems ‘held back’.
On the surface, she seems super social, but ive come to realize its all super ficial....

She is very physical, likes physical activities and focuses more on sex than emotional connection....she actually cannot see what my concerns are...

I am confused and not sure what to do or think. She seemed completely normal."
614,Diagnosis after 30,Has anyone been diagnosed on the spectrum at an older age?  Lately I have been feeling like some of my mental health issues and idiosyncrasies align with some mild autism symptoms.  I have a therapy appointment scheduled but it feels kind of odd as a working mother to tell someone you think you may be autistic.  I say this as I sit in my locked closet mind you.
615,Concerning thoughts,"Sometimes I feel like I'm not the one thinking in my head, I get thoughts and fears that I shouldn't have and that are concerning me (such as ""kill your friends, they want to hurt you""). I don't even feel safe around people anymore because it keeps telling me they hate me and want me to die and that I should hurt them before they hurt me."
616,I thought I was getting better..,"I started improving. I started feeling happy. I turned back into myself. I thought it would last. But in only 3 weeks I find myself falling back into that hopeless me. I did get a bit better at fighting it, but it’s not good enough. I’m about to cry while typing this, as pathetic as that may seem. I’m back to feeling crappy about myself. I guess that never went away, but I just feel it at a different degree. Like right now I feel like a really crap human being. I felt like I was going to throw up early due to worry about something small. I’m back to not wanting to be here. I’m not stronger than this. I feel like I’m about to break down. I can’t even tell anyone because they probably won’t believe me since I’ve been doing better. It’s not like I want attention, I just want to be happy. For real. Even when I did feel good recently, my messed up self was still in me. It was as if it would poke it’s way out sometimes, but I’d be able to push it back down. Though it’s still there. I just don’t think I can push it down this time."
617,"I ruined my own life last year, life has never been the same since.","So I posted a stupid comment last year on Facebook post (23/m), we all make mistakes. but this one 183 people commented horrible things before I could properly edit my comment. Not that it would've mattered. 

I was bullied, insulted and humiliated

with ocd, of those 183 nasty replies/comments, I often wonder whom was the prettiest girl who said the meanest thing to me. 

I fantasize about getting into a fight with her. 

Not a physical one. but about me uttering threats. 
Not death threats, suicide threats. Only to and about myself and not anyone else. 

since I deleted the comment, I fail to remember a single name nor appearance of anyone who commented, they might as well have all been anonymous."
618,"Having a real bad time recently, what should I do?","Hello Reddit, I’m a male college student and have recently fallen into what I think is some temporary depression. This semester I’m taking a heavier course load than normal while also working a job and an internship. Over break I was a little bit worried but I reassured myself that I’ll step up to the plate like I’ve always done in the past. The semester has been going on for about a month now and during the week I find myself going through the motions, doing the bare minimum(even less sometimes), handing in assignments late, and generally having an awful time. The things that normally bring me joy throughout the day no longer do so and I find myself in a constant state of pain. All I can do is lay down and watch TV in my free time now unless I’m with friends or drinking/smoking. I’ve felt this way in the past but never for over a day or 2. I know I’ve shown signs of seasonal depression in the past but this is a new level. What should I do, Reddit? 
Also as a lil background info I’ve been diagnosed with mild ADHD and I drink and smoke relatively often but I don’t consider myself dependent on any substances"
619,How do I know which type of professional help I need?,"Hello, I’ve needed mental help for years and the very few times that I’ve deemed myself worthy enough to get help have been bad experiences. The first time I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed Prozac  and tried to scam me out of the money that my insurance was supposed to cover. The second time I saw a counselor who I felt wasn’t really equipped with the knowledge to truly help me and I genuinely felt like she didn’t know what to say to me. I was very confused about that.

I understand that mental health is not something that you can fix in one 45 min session, so I wanted to know if I’m just going to the wrong people. 

I have depression, childhood trauma, social anxiety, and unhealthy eating habits along with a sense of impending doom. 
I’m tired of trying to fix my mind on my own. But at the same time I want effective meetings if I am to invest time and money on a professional.
Can I get some guidance ?"
620,i need help,i’m just sad for no reason and i’ve been like this for the past few weeks and i feel like i’m in a hole that i can’t get out of. does anyone know what that is?
621,Ghosted for the second time,"He ghosted me out of nowhere, no explanation. It hurt really bad and I’ve been sad since. I reached out many times but he blocked me. Saturday I reached out from a new number and he responded. He said he was sorry he was going through a hard time he felt bad what he did. I asked him if there was anything I did to cause it he said no he was just in a bad space and wanted to be alone and I could be mad at him he’d understand. I’m not one to hold a grudge I was just happy to have my friend back. I said to him just let me know if there was anything that bothered you that may have caused a rift he said something about not venting as much about work maybe and I said I’d never do it again anyway, and that if it made him sad I was sorry he said no no it’s fine. (it’s strictly platonic he’s gay.) Anyway we talked for a while he said he unblocked me off everything which he did. He added me on fb. He added me back on almost everything. That was Saturday. Today is Monday. I text him and no response. I don’t wanna be pushy because I don’t want to push him away... I get on fb and he deleted me. What the f?! What would you do? Why would he make up with me? I texted him Saturday from another number saying how I loved him and missed him and wanted our friendship back he said he felt the same way. We didn’t talk yesterday, last we left off the conversation was good. I’m soooooo confused wtf?? I honestly was so happy and feeling so good I had changes happening in my life that made me hopeful. I was coming out of my depression. I’m not mentally ok now. This is painful"
622,How sad is too sad?,"Ok so I’m a 16 y/o girl, and a jr in a highly competitive high school. I’m constantly battling the stresses of keeping my grades up and comparing myself to my friends and my siblings as well as worrying about my weight, feeling completely insecure, wishing I would have a boyfriend but knowing I’m too ugly, and wanting to have fun but feeling too suffocated by homework and studying. It has decently become a routine for me and my friends to be genuinely frustrated and sad in a bad mood all day at least 3 times a week, crying actual tears throughout the day and crying ourselves to sleep. But I’m not sad alllll of the time so I dind myself asking, how sad is too sad to be okay ? Is it just due to the fact that I’m a teenage girl w hormones trying to figure out who I am ? Is the education system today putting wayyy to much pressure on teenagers? Or may there actually be a problem?"
623,Filling Other's Buckets. Does Mine Need to be Full First?,"One of the strongest predictors of success in mental health counseling is the Therapeutic Alliance which includes three aspects: 

Agreed upon Goals

Agreed upon Tasks

Warm/Caring Relationship

Students and mental health workers often focus most on the importance of the Relationship, saying that before they can do the work of mental health counseling, they first need to build a relationship. This would be an example of a “step-wise” process. Think of a flight of stairs where we usually take one step at a time – Step 1 comes first, then Step 2, then Step 3. 

The idea that the relationship must be built prior to doing the work of mental health counseling strikes me as inconsistent on two levels. 

First, research shows that the relationship alone is not a great predictor of success. 

Second, having practiced mental health therapy since 1993 - I have no idea how a step-wise process would even unfold. Would I sit and gaze in the client’s eyes and bond? Review their family photo albums? Go to a bar with them? Play checkers? Any idea I can muster developing a relationship FIRST and then WORKING seem inefficient and creepy – probably leading me to lose my license! 

motivational interviewing, motivational interviewing training

&amp;#x200B;

The work of therapy happens in a PARALLEL not STEP-WISE process. As we help clients clarify their goals and identify credible plans, the relationship strengthens. And, as the relationship improves clients trust more and share more, allowing for further clarification of goals and development of credible plans. The process is like a feedback loop that happens in a parallel fashion. 

Life is also like this. I tend to disagree, for example, that we cannot get into a relationship until we are healed. Or, we cannot fill others buckets until our bucket is full. It is with people, that we learn to heal ourselves – not in isolation (of course, not all people are worthy of our trust and not all people can help us heal ourselves). Further, we fill our bucket by filling other people’s buckets. The idea that relationships develop in a parallel with meeting needs is encouraging because we can immediately do things that help other people. We don’t have to wait on the sideline.

624,I wish my mom could've aborted me,"I just realised this- I WASN'T MEANT TO BE HERE. I AM A MISTAKE CREATED BY A HORRIBLE PAIR  WHO WEREN'T MEANT FOR ONE ANOTHER . I AM  HERE BY  MISTAKE.
My parents got divorced when i was only 3yrs old...my father was an abusive man...my mom ended up with that fucker by  mistake..i wasn't meant to be conceived...ive only made my mom's life harder: I suffer from a mental disorder because of what I've been thru in my childhood...that woman deserved  to have a better offspring...that fucker conceived her with me...it wasn't her mistake...she chose to let that man's offspring develop inside her ....only to have an asshole like me....we argue so much. We don't get along at all... she is conservative and narrow minded...im a young adult and I don't agree with anything....im not able to achieve my goals because of my plummeting mental health..
SHE DESERVES TO HAVE SOMEONE BETTER THAN ME."
625,My empathy is declining. Why am I like this?,"Before, whenever my friends are feeling bad or sad, I can easily empathize with them. But now, I just don't feel anything like that anymore. They have also noticed this and told me. I wonder why I can't empathize with people anymore?"
626,Running out of time.,"This isn't a cry for help, don't call anyone for me just listen (no i'm not gonna harm myself.)

I feel like i'm drowning in my own hallucinations and i'm running out of time to please others and putting a fake smile on so no one can worry about me. i don't even know how i'm even here and i'm trying to figure out what my next move is, do i just sleep this depression off or ramble to myself for 4 hours till i pass out since insomnia is a bitch to handle, or spam call the only person who cares but end up coming off as abusive and controlling so it's best to leave her alone. this isn't meant to be mean or hateful but i need to vent and this is the only place i can since i'm extremely shy and not a very talkative guy. i think i'll pick the first option of just sleep till 10AM and be late for school and have some excuse for it, i don't wanna harm or anything like that but i'm just lacking the world inside my head if that's even making sense. i guess it's lights out, headphones in and stare at the ceiling for hours, sleep good everybody."
627,How to be the best version of yourself/how to be likeable?,"Sometimes I feel like if I should just never talk, I don't know why but I feel like I always say the wrong things and make people feel bad or uncomfortable. Maybe I should never get close to people, I just weird them out.  I act like I deserve to be treated right and I act like I'm smart and all but I am the most stubborn, dumb, and arrogant person. I wish I could be the most optimal person I can be, make everyone happy, but I feel like I am loud and I hurt people. I constantly seek to feel validated and important, and that is my biggest flaw. Gosh- even this is an example of me trying to feel validated and important. I'm not surprised."
628,"Biting fingers, how to stop this","I have been biting my fingernails/finger tips for years. Tried to stop biting my fingernails, keeping them cut extremely short, filing them every morning, but now I only bite the skin around my nails, and one thumb knuckle. Every time I touch things it hurts. I have bandaids on several fingers because I bit my skin so far it is bright red/bleeding. Keeping my nails done/painting only stops me from biting the nails, but now my fingers are super callused from me biting them, which of course makes me want to bite them more. One time I stopped for months when I got my nails professionally done, but trying that again, I bit off the acrylic. Once I bite one, I have to bite them all or it drives me crazy. 

Any time I feel an uneven surface, rough surface, or uneven shape in general, I immediately bite it off. So much worse when I'm nervous. Watching shows, even stopping while eating to do so. My psychiatrist doesn't say anything, just noting it down as a symptom I guess. I have been diagnosed with adhd, GAD, PTSD (not related to finger biting). Basically just ADHD and anxiety. 

Sigh what is wrong with me."
629,How to cope,"So my job just changed my shifts and now I'll be working an extra 2 and a half hours a week and getting about $150 less in my paycheck due to it and they are also talking of removing my Sunday shifts with another $150 a week less I'll be earning. I use to earn $1100 a week 3 years ago at the same job and soon I'll be earning $600 whilst also doing more hours 6 feel so powerless and frankly like a slave or a pawn on a chess board. I can't leave this work I need at least 600 a week every week to pay for my house and food, fuel etc (not bills) and yet I hate knowing I use to earn 400 more than what I will be 3 years ago. How do I mentally get through this? I just want to break shit I'm so angry with them."
630,School is making my mental health really bad,"The title basically says it all, no one really cares about this, right now I am crying because I have to go back to school tomorrow, I told my friends that school makes me feel really bad and you know what they said? “You don’t have motives, they don’t bully you but I mean it’s tough I guess” 
When they tell me that I just feel like shit, like I’m just being petty about school but no, I know I’m not, teachers make us do so much work and I don’t even learn, I’m a ver smart person honestly. I wouldn’t consider this to be product of me being lazy or stuff, I like learning, I genuinely love when I can do a math problem and another one after that. But the school environment is just bad for me, I’m constantly googling stuff about everything to learn more about stuff around (honestly I fucking wish that were a lie lmao). I know there’s probably not a solution for this but I just want to vent and talk to someone that understands me and won’t just tell me to ignore it and that I can’t feel like this"
631,How can I stop panicking over the coronavirus?,"I am checking my phone for updates 24/7 and it is interfering with my interactions with people. This kind of stuff has scared me since I was little with the bird flu outbreak. I am a young adult and in good health. I would *likely* be ok if it got here thinking about it rationally (I think) but I still am thinking about it constantly. I worry about my friends, family, life, etc. When I heard about the first death outside of the US I was literally shaking. How can I stop this from taking over my life? Is there anything I can do or anyone that can relate with having this kind of fear?"

635,Divorce as a kid,"My parents divorced when my brother and I were a young age. My parents had joint custody over us and when my brother was 17 he stopped going over to my dad's (I do not want to share his story). Back in October, I believe, I left too because of the fights he had with his girlfriend and occasional times he came home drunk. As a 17 year-old now, I experience mental issues such as depression, anxiety, and adhd. I started experiencing adhd as far back as 5th grade. Depression and anxiety followed when I was 16. My question is that is this normal for someone to go through as someone who lived through a divorce, and will it ever go away?"

This episode explores a recent article on how it's possible to study human depression using rats and mice! Would love your feedback!,"https://youtu.be/vG1lL8xfT8U

Is it possible to study major depressive disorder, a uniquely human mental-health
disorder, using knowledge gleaned from experiments in rats and mice? This is a hotly
debated topic by scientists and non-scientists alike. In this episode, recent
Neuroscience PhD graduate, Dr. Stephen Daniels, joins us to speak about his recently
published manuscript that addresses these controversial concepts, entitled ""Reverse
Translation of Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms: A Framework for the Behavioural
Phenotyping of Putative Biomarkers"", published in The Journal of Affective Disorders
[2020 Feb; 263(15): 353-366] / DOI: 10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.108.

Highlights

• Reverse translation of biomarkers of depression.

• Basic bio-behavioural functions in humans and animals.

• Battery of tests in animals to study clinical biomarkers.

Abstract

Background
Reverse translating putative biomarkers of depression from patients to animals is
complex because Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogenous condition. This review proposes an approach to reverse translation based on relating relevant
bio-behavioural functions in laboratory rodents to MDD symptoms.

Methods
This systematic review outlines symptom clusters assessed by psychometric tests of
MDD and antidepressant treatment response including the Montgomery–Åsberg
Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck
Depression Inventory. Symptoms were related to relevant behavioural assays in
laboratory rodents.

Results
The resulting battery of tests includes passive coping, anxiety-like behaviours, sleep,
caloric intake, cognition, psychomotor functions, hedonic reactivity and aversive
learning. These assays are discussed alongside relevant clinical symptoms of MDD, providing a framework through which reverse translation of a biomarker can be
interpreted.

Limitations
Certain aspects of MDD may not be quantified by tests in laboratory rodents, and their biological significance may not always be of clinical relevance.

Conclusions
Using this reverse translation approach, it is possible to clarify the functional significance of a putative biomarker in rodents and hence translate its contribution to specific clinical symptoms, or clusters of symptoms.

638,My mental 180 – a very long rant,"I struggled immensely in 2019. 
That isn’t to say that my life was easy beforehand, but I *was* resilient. 
I was the type of person who could trudge through hell and back, turn my emotions on and off. I genuinely believed that depression was something I had control over. Anxiety was something I had control over. Panic attacks could be avoided and I could keep everything under control so long as I tried hard enough. I squirmed at the idea of my friends taking anti depressants. I gave tough-love advice. I thought that working 110 hours a week meant I was conquering my sadness. I thought chasing after men who would clearly never loved me would eventually bring me happiness. At least I never thought money could make me happy. And going into 2019 I was making a lot of it – more than I knew what to do with. The more I had the less I wanted it. 
My first payment towards my student loans I paid it off in full. The next month I paid off 3 years worth of credit card debt. The same month I bought a new (used) car so I could travel with my work gear. 
After that everything I made went to paying it forward. The thing was, I knew I wasn’t very good, but I couldn’t help but believe the things I believed. So the only way I could sleep at night was to give everything I had to the people around me. Thousands of dollars to get my friends on their feet. We had all just graduated college. Thousands on Christmas for my family. I would buy everyone in the office breakfast every morning and once a week I would walk downtown and talk to the men sleeping on the streets that night and go buy them warm food. I thought if I continued to do this everything would balance out. I wouldn’t be so sad anymore if everyone around me was happy. 
To this day I don’t regret it – but it didn’t work out the way I thought it would. 

In March of 2019 I lost my grandma – my best friend. Five years prior to that I’d lost my mom, her daughter. Those two were my world. 

I figured because I saw it coming and got to say goodbye, however short, it would be easier this time around. I have never been so wrong. 

It took a few weeks to chip away at me bit by bit but eventually it broke me, and for the first time in my life I stayed broken. I couldn’t for the life of me get myself back on my feet. My ability to **control** slipped right through my fingers and the more I tried to grasp at it the more fleeting it became. 
It started to take things from me. My work, my concentration, my time, my money, my motivation. 
My depression became *Depression* , anxiety became *Anxiety* , panic became *Panic* . 
I lost all control. I was bound and confined by unexplainable urges and emotions, completely and totally. I would sleep on the floor and in the closet. I would think of a hundred ways to die. Eventually the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning was the promise to myself that if I got out of bed I could go find a way to kill my self. 
I got a puppy instead. 
And it worked. I still had 8 diagnoses brooding over me, but I couldn’t kill my self. I wanted to just the same, but who would feed him in the morning? 
It hasn’t even been a year since things got bad, but it feels like a lifetime. 
Everything I thought I knew has been balled up and dunked in the trash. I understand more now that I’ve felt it myself. 
I’m unemployed now. The stress of my workplace just broke my brain one day. All of the medical and mental health professionals I see want me to consider disability. It isn’t any stigma attached to it (which is prevalent where I am) that is stopping me, but rather, admitting to myself that this is more than just a hiatus is still a struggle to me. 
My money had run out before I even left. My dog got sick and it cost nearly $17,000 to get him better. Worth every penny and not everyone will understand. How do you tell someone that, selfishly, a dog was your lifeline. If he dies I die. He deserves, in my eyes, to live regardless of the price. 
By the time he’s old and grey I will be better, and resilient enough to let him go on his own time. 
So we live a really simple life right now. I’ve isolated myself almost completely. It is easier to process my day when my day is simple and undisputed. I ration what money I had left before I stopped working, the bills are piling up but I think I can make it work. I take my medication at morning and at night. I’ve been working on feeding myself two meals a day. I have passions and I have hobbies and the cocktail I’m on means I’m not depressed anymore, barely anxious. 
This week I’ll be going to my first PTSD group session at the hospital. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that this isn’t going away next week. 
My dog is, as usual, as happy as could be. 
I’m really trying to be better. God, it’s a lot of work. I hate that I’m not alone in that struggle. I hate that there are so many people going through the same or worse. 
I hate how hard people have to fight for the chance to not even be happy, but just to.. not suffer. 
I really hope you’re all going to keep pushing forward."
639,Going to kill myself and needed somewhere to post before I go ahead with it.,"So I am really only making this post for context incase anyone opens up my reddit account after I am dead. There are alot of things that have lead to me shooting myself in the head and people are very aware of those things. I want to also apologize to my girlfriend, her kids, my mom and close friends. I know what I did was selfish but it better for everyone if I am gone. It doesnt seem like it now but it is. The note if you havent found it yet is on my computer titled note that should explain in detail what lead to this for more context. I'm sorry for everything I am."
640,Really on edge,"I’ve just taken the GenoMind test that will check to see genealogical indicators for medications that won’t work, to put it in basic terms. I’ve been on Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Concerta, Rispridal, Lithium, Zoloft, Focalin, Vyvanse, Intuniv, Celexa, and Prozac. Oh whoops, forgot about strattera. Anyways, lately I’ve been really on edge because I’m not on anything and I’m doing surprisingly ok. But I know I’ll wash out at the end of the semester and completely lose it. Sooner, if things don’t go well. Not sure how to process everything happening. Haven’t felt much of any emotions lately."
641,It hit me that I’m still alive,"I just broke down crying in bed, I’m not sure whether they were tears of joy or sadness or something else. It hit me that I’m soon to turn 18 and I did not believe I would be alive by 16 still. I don’t know what I’m feeling, but I’m alive."
642,How should I help my ex-stepmom,"My dad and stepmom recently got divorced. I’m concerned for my stepmoms mental health, I’d rather be depressed than have her be depressed. She’s kind of a bitch sometimes, but she’s the first person I’ve admitted to cutting my wrist. I know she hasn’t taken the divorce very well, they were married for about 2 years. I know she loves me, and I love her, however, I haven’t seen her in about a month, and we haven’t texted. She broken down crying in front of me once, real crying (believe me, I know when someone’s fake crying because my biological mom is a narcissistic). I’ve been through this before too, just not because of a divorce. I know I tend to cheer her up, but since I’m still a minor I can’t control whether I am with her or not. She’s invited me to her house when my dad is working so she can watch me, but I feel really weird because she’s dating someone else and he lives in the house with her. I don’t know what to do, or how to help her. I’ve been in the same boat as her, but I have my ways of coping."
643,Isolation? Social Media?,"Recently, I’ve been experiencing numerous of breakdowns and it seems to never stop coming even with the help of anti depressants and therapy. I feel awfully alone. A few days ago, I had to end a connection with someone I really clicked with but the relationship was too toxic so we mutually agreed to cut all forms of connection we have with each other and that’s been hurting me the most on top of dealing with this anxiety. I’m thinking of just abandoning my social media until I regain confidence to talk to others but I feel like I’ll be isolating myself again. There’s just a small number of people who do try their best to contact me and I appreciate them for that. I hate this feeling of guilt where I feel responsible for making the effort for any of my friendships or relationship to be validated. Idk. There’s so much to deal with and I just want to be alone. Advice?"
644,"Grad school has killed my drive, my work ethic and my spirit.","I'm a grad student and prior to starting I always struggled with mental health, from the time I was 7. From body dysmorphia, anorexia, anxiety (and especially social anxiety), hitting myself, depression and being suicidal, the 22 years haven't been easy. However, my anxiety always would impact me enough to feel the need to work hard when I was badly impacted. Granted this wasn't healthy, it's was never efficient and it was always self punishing. But eventually I learned how to somewhat cope with these traits and at least get outside help when I needed to. Until graduate school, the past 2.5 have been especially bad (it's 3 year program).

Now I want to stress I understand grad school is no picnic for anyone, ever. And I am not trying to say anyone's experience isn't bad. But when I say grad school has been hard, I don't just mean academically. I mean structurally. Like I ended up joining a 20+ student group to sue to the school because the advisers were constantly lying to us about what was actually required and claimed certain students failed classes, when they didn't (because no an administrator can't just decide a b is fail because they want it that way). This actually resulted in some students getting their tuition money back.

I took three classes, almost 4 except thank goodness I postponed one of them. I never needed to take because an adviser was concerned they wouldn't have enough students in them and lied and said they were required. And some of you are wondering isn't there a curriculum sheet? Yes and no. We did have a curriculum sheet but we switched after our first year from quarters to semesters. The advisers lied to us about what classes equated to each other so they could fill classes for the next two years. This action almost cost every student their financial aid.

Which wouldn't be so bad, except all of those classes sucked and taught me and my classmates absolutely nothing for our careers. One classes I was supposed to learn about principles of design and we learned about communism, another we were supposed to learn about eco-friendly design and we learned about film. Another classes we learned about geography when were supposed to learn about design. 

This program has made me feel like an absolute joke. It's full time with expectation that you do not work. But I feel like I have learned nothing but have felt like I had to stay because I got a full ride scholarship (although in retrospect I should have left anyways but mental illness has made me feel like there was no option). Many professors also give feedback in the form of never ever telling you that your work is good enough. It's meant to motivate students to push them to their limits, but it makes me feel like everything is hopeless and that I suck at everything. You can fix everything a professor says to fix down to a T and then show it to them and if there is still time left before the due date they'll tell you they hate all the edits and to redo it. And many times this makes the final project a jumbled mess of trash that has been changed to for the sake of being changed. I've see this happen so many times. 

Even right now I need an elective to be approved (despite it being on the approved elective list) and my adviser is ignoring the approval because the elective topic isn't something she likes (which it's my elective she shouldn't get to say ""no this isn't the field I want you to go into""). 

I still do my work, especially in group projects, because if one thing has happened is that we've bonded as a grad cohort and I can at least get myself to work to support my teammates (luckily this is most of my work). But I have no idea how to recover from this and my therapist doesn't even seem to know what to say anymore. I feel completely unprepared to graduate and terrified I will never get a job. 

Does anyone have any similar experiences? How do I get back up from this? Is there a type of therapy anyone can recommend? Historically CBT has been very very very very very very very ineffective for me (with all the 8 different therapists I tried it with) but EMDR has been great and acceptance/avoidance has been ok. My brain feels fuzzy most of the time, I cry every Sunday night because I'm so afraid of school, I can't keep my vision straight during classes, my health has declined drastically (within the past year I'd had two surgeries), I make simple mistakes all the time I never used to make, and my memory has become absolute trash. Please help."
645,I have to many thoughts...,"I have so many things going on that would just go away if I wasn't in the equation. Functioning while having these thoughts is just draining. I go to work, come home, do homework and watch TV. I have few people that contact me. I am a waste but only matter to those who need to money. My son only wants to be home for the playstation and his room. He never hangs out with me (no he's not a teenager, yet). He doesn't notice if I run an errand. I just don't want to exist."
646,Feeling numb after someone has abused you,"I made a post earlier about how my mom beat me up. It's now the end of the day and I feel numb. After taking a nap, the adrenaline is gone and I am in more pain physically. Emotionally, I've stopped feeling. I've felt emotionally numb before but this time is different. I've been spanked before but I've never been beaten up by a parent before. A part of me was relieved earlier in a sick sort of way because her true colors/feelings were revealed to an extent. 

Today was an off day for me (no class) so I was excited to study, relax, and catch up on some homework. I haven't been able to do any of that. To be honest, I question if I can call what happened earlier abuse. To me, abuse seems like a very strong word and my mom has now only done this to me once. I tried to find a different word to use in the title of this post but I couldn't."
647,Emotional numbness,"How do you deal with it?
I have been depressed for 2 years and now I feel nothingness. Often, I feel irritated or sad. Sometimes, I feel even angry. I don’t exactly remember how does happiness feel. Life now seems pretty bald and empty. Can’t stick to anything I try. It has been like this for while and it feels like it’s getting worse.
If you experienced anything like that could you share your advices / experiences? Cheers"
648,Somethings wrong with me and I can’t get proper help,"So I’m f19 and I’m from Untied States of America.
Please delete this if unfit to be here.  
So I just want to say, I have been in therapy for YEARS. Two years ago was the first time since 12 I’ve been out of therapy. Insurance won’t cover therapy anymore and if I still wanted to continue, I would have to pay out of pocket for each session which would be 80-100 dollars a week. Something I don’t have.

I don’t know what’s exactly wrong with me. I feel absolutely crazy and I don’t know what to do. I wish I had someone to vent to that was unbiased of my situation. 

I am so so obsessive. Especially over attention and getting it from men. 
I constantly want to be looked at and make my male friends jealous and I hate that I do this because I have an amazing boyfriend that is so supportive and sweet and caring and I feel awful that I’m lowkey flirting behind his back. I wish I can stop it but I literally cannot. 

And I feel like I’m gonna stalk my ex also. 

 So, there’s a lot of history between he and I and we broke up around 2017. I haven’t talked to him until maybe late 2019 and asked if he wanted to be friends again. Some stuff happened (unrelated to our past relationship) and he blocked me. Kinda of made me crazy. But I ignored everything I could. Until I found out he hasn’t blocked me on insta. His insta is private but I was thinking of messaging him and asking if we wanted to be friends again. I haven’t done it yet; but today I learned that he has formed a new band and they’re playing live shows. I was thinking of taking a friend to one of his shows and acting like I didn’t know he was playing. I feel insane and absolutely disgusting. I just want his attention and I cannot believe I am considering such lengths. But I feel so so crazy about it. About him. I still really love him and care for him immensely. I know we couldn’t ever be in a relationship and last long and I’ve accepted that. I just want him in my life. Idk maybe I’m just overthinking stuff and this isn’t as crazy as I’m making it out to be. I feel so confused and distraught especially right now."
649,Not exactly sure what to do (vent/advice),"Ok how do I put this. 

A little context, this is in regards to one of my friend groups, specifically the group of friends I play DnD with. I’m the youngest in the group (20F), and on top of that, I also have ADHD, which leads to me interrupting ppl often, and I’m particularly verbose (as you can probably tell). Also, semi-related, but I’m going through a depressive episode since like last March. 

So a couple months ago, I was playing Overwatch with a couple of these friends, and later asked one of them if I was annoying them in some manner (I hate being annoying, it’s killed friendships before). He replied that I have a tendency to start talking about myself and my own POV about stuff, while not listening to others. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, when talking to a couple ppl in the same friend group over voice chat, I interrupted one three times in about a minute (dick move on my part), and they chastised me about how in our upcoming arc I need to work on taking a backseat. Just last Saturday my friend and DM mentioned the same thing. 

Now, I know, objectively, they’re right. I’m rather self centered and oblivious to the world around me, and talk over people a lot. 

But I keep fucking spiraling. RSD kicked me in the teeth both times my friends approached me in the past couple weeks, which isn’t helping either, and I just feel like I keep acting more and more like a selfish jerk and hurting my friends, when I don’t want to do anything of the sort. I’m terrified of taking advantage of my friends or hurting them because I lashed out, and I have a feeling I have already. And I don’t want to get kicked from my campaign or anger my friends or anything. 

It’s gotten to the point where I am semi-seriously considering either taking a break from the campaign for a few weeks for their sake, dropping the campaign altogether, or just. Cutting off contact with most of my friends (not just that group, some other friend groups) and isolating myself. Because hey, you can’t keep interrupting ppl and hurting them if you’re not *around* them. And I *don’t* to drop the campaign, as not only is it the highlight of my week but I *also* know that if I leave it completely, not having that uniting subject means I’ll lose that whole group of friends. It just feels like dropping the campaign would be better for the rest of the group. 

I started going to one of my campus psychologists last week (I’m in college, duh) and I’m on meds for ADHD, but they have a tendency to increase my anxiety and that doesn’t help at all. 

I guess this turned into more of a vent post than asking for advice, and god knows I’ve left a lot out, but. If anyone has some reassuring advice I’d really appreciate it. One thing my DM said I should do is work on my teamwork skills/be a team player more, and to be quite honest I’m not exactly sure how to do that. If anyone has any words, I’d appreciate it. 

Thank you."
650,I'm falling apart,"About 2 years back I was going to kill myself but my dad pulling in the driveway prevented me from doing it. I was ready that day, I truly did not want to live anymore. I continued pushing on but there hasn't been a day that has passed where I haven't thought about killing myself. I feel so depressed and out of touch with everyone. I'm 18 now and I go to school with a smile trying to make everyone I see laugh. I'm so scared one day I'm gonna be overwhelmed with that feeling I got 2 years ago and kill myself. I don't wanna tell my parents because there struggling with there own problems. I never told anyone how I'm really feeling. I don't wanna seem weak to my family because they have been through more than me. I don't know what to do."
651,Is it normal to miss your depression and anxiety?,"I know this sounds crazy because mental illness really sucks and nobody wants to feel the pain it can bring, so why do I “miss” my depression when it’s gone away for a bit? As stupid as it might sound, I kind of feel lost without it lingering if that makes sense. But of course when I’m going through rough patches where it’s kicking my a$$, I want to get rid of it. (Btw i AM diagnosed by a trained professional)"
652,I sound like someone i hate,"I worked with someone i didn't like (hated)  for three years and our voices are similar. So sometimes when i talk I  obsessively think about him and i get depressed and angry, and it's very annoying. Is there a way to change your voice or think about it less?"
653,I live with my toxic adult brother and he tries talking to me when I have headphones on.,"I mean how silly is that. I obviously am doing stuff.

Yesterday he was drunk and I told him I’m not dealing with him, walk into another room and shut the door, and he followed me in it.

He also goes on about ‘his house’ and he’s just a tenant like me.

Anyway does anyone have a checklist on how to interact with him? I mean like if he does X, I should do Y. I already tell him not dealing with him and leave the room, etc."
654,Anyone else just casually want to die?,"So I realized the other day I want to die but like not in a way that would ever cause me to commit suicide.  More so just like if a car were to hit me at like 100 mph while I'm crossing the street I wouldn't hurry to get out of the way.  I'm turning 19 in March and don't know when this thought process started for me but i ""feel"" like it's been an on off thing since I was 15."

658,Feeling a lot of feelings,"I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, among other mental health illnesses. But today, I think I’m close to a mental breakdown, not only had I organised a nice dinner with my sister (twin) who then told me she doesn’t want to go out with me cause she has a phone call with a friend whom she saw yesterday; I thought we were super close, we’re twins after all. But she obviously thinks differently and for the past year I’ve seen just how opposite we are to each other and it’s really starting to affect me. I’ve been seeing my psychiatrist, I will again see them tomorrow, and they’ve told me to implement self care, I don’t know what that is or how to do it. They also suggested making sure I was getting as much social interactions with friends as possible and this I’m struggling with as well, all my friends aren’t at uni, and work full time so I don’t see them. And I want all of these things, the self care, the friends, the social stuff but I’m at breaking point with everybody around me. I don’t want people to feel like they have to be there for me cause I’m mentally unwell, I want people to be there for me because they want to be. It’s hard. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense I’m just all over the place and I’m not sure what to do about any of it. I can’t confide in my mum because, telling her there isn’t much she can do cause she doesn’t understand fully what I’m going through, and telling her about my problems with my twin won’t really matter. I just don’t know what to do anymore..."
659,Social anxiety is killing me,"So I keep running into these situsations where Im out here going from place to place In school asking about classes and endup somewhere else simply because Im too disturbed by the idea of walking into a class full of People knowing that the Talk would take somewhere berween 1-5 mins.

Sure I've read that putting yourself into these types of situsations will help as the time goes on, and that alot of the People don't even care as you're out there onfront of them talking to someone else.

I’m on meds and going to therapy, but I can’t seem to shake it. Please does anyone have any advice or know how to help"
661,Having trouble grounding myself right now,Having a panic episode and I just can't ground myself right now
662,It's fine,"Does anyone else ever feel like their anxiety increases when someone asks if they're okay? Like on one hand it's like wow someone cares but on the other hand the fear of judgement settles in? The fear that ya you may open but but how could they possibly understand the amount of panic emotion set off by perhaps what would be to others, ""small""? I guess there's a lot more to this but ya."
663,what does it mean when the room feels like its getting bigger?,"I’ve been experiencing this since i was about 5 years old all the way till i was like around 10. I’m 16 now and haven’t really experienced it much anymore. It almost always happened while i was laying down in bed with the room pitch black. A lot of times it happened after not being able to fall asleep after over an hour. Sometimes it happened when i just woke up randomly in the middle of the night and couldn’t go back to sleep. It started with a weird feeling in my body like something was off or not right. Then it felt like the room and everything in it was getting bigger (sometimes smaller). A lot of times it felt like things were getting thicker and distance also changed too. It felt like my arm was farther away from me then it actually was. Its hard to explain but it was very unpleasant. When i turned the lights on however, everything would turn back to normal. But when i turned them back off, the distortion would continue. Another thing that sometimes accompanied this physical distortion was audio distortion. Whenever somebody would talk or even whisper, it felt like they were yelling at me or talking to me in a very very angry or mad tone even though i knew they weren’t. Things also sounded way louder. All these things often made me cry and I just begged for it to stop. Sometimes however wasn’t as extreme. It would just be a slight distortion of my surroundings with no audio changing. Thats mostly what happens now, if it happens at all which is kind of rare now."
664,Nortriptyline effects are starting to really fuck me off.,"Can't lift weight anymore.  I'm 20m on 150mg nortriptyline, 60mg ritalin, and lithium daily.  I can't get my heart rate above 175 bpm anymore, I can't even squat my bodyweight without going feint, and I get such bad lactic acid.

Rip deadlifts, that's not happening anymore, rip squats, rip back day, rip dreams of benching my bodyweight.  Looks like I just have to live like a fat 50 year old now...

Fucking sucks.  Gym is my only pleasurable activity, qnd I can't do it now.  So much build up energy with no release....  I can't even run ffs.

Do I have to stop taking these meds or is there a workaround?  Nothing has worked yet, and I have another semester of uni coming up that I really don't want to drop, but I can't see these meds working if this is what I have tk deal with.

Such a fucking joke honestly.  Wish I was just a cokehead instead, at least that would be fun for a while...."
665,I failed the same subject TWICE!,"Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Seriously considering running away from home right now. Any suggestion? Lol"
666,I feel like I’m losing touch with reality,"It started with a bad acid trip just over a year ago, I had a panic attack and thought I triggered a mental illness, the idea that i had essentially ruined my life has left me in despair. I deal with depersonalizations almost everyday in short episodes. I feel uneasy around most people including my parents. Intrusive thoughts don’t help (although they’ve subsided). Life has been fucking tough. I’m starting to see a therapist now. But I need advice from someone who’s been through it all, how do I cope with all of this"
667,"I'm not going anywhere but down, I need to talk","I don't know what to do, I'm 17 I'm still in school. I failed 11 out of my 14 subjects last year, the only reason I passed was because my parents noticed I had nothing done and forced me through the compulsory classes, but they ended up doing most of the work there.

But at this point school is the least of my worries, I don't know how I'm going to keep on going. I've lost any pleasure in anything I used to find fun and now I spend all my time staring at walls wondering why I suck so much. Ever since my recent suicide attempt things like the word happy, trains, or even just smiling will trigger my depression, as if I wasn't sad enough already without it. I used to ghost my friends all the time, I just couldn't handle socializing for too long, and if school wasn't keeping us together I would never see them again. It's not like I don't like them it's just what happens whenever I get into a relationship. My most recent ghosting was 4-5 months ago and I still haven't seen them since, it's like I sent myself to solitary confinement.

Life seems meaningless because even if I manage to get past all this, proceed to complete school and have a somewhat successful life, it will still be empty. I can't get hobbies and I can't have fun, I won't give myself any me time because I never do anything with it, I'll be empty like always.

But the reason I've come here isn't to vent out, I just need someone to talk to just to pass the time and get me through the day. Just be aware that I will eventually ghost you so please don't take it personally."
668,"I don't know what is wrong with me, but something is horribly wrong...","Hi /mentalhealth, I am not quite sure where to start with this post, but I feel like there is something extremely wrong with me mentally. I feel I am psychopathic and a pathological liar among other things. 

Here's some context - Ever since I was about 6-7 years old, I have been somewhat abused by my mother, both verbally and physically. Verbal abuse, objects thrown at me, punches, kicks, you name it. When I was in first grade, I picked up on a lot of swear words from my mother and at school, but I never was necessarily a bad kid behaviorally at school. I began to get physically violent with my siblings and my mother at about the same time as this. I would throw things at people, yell, scream, jump up and down, etc. One day, I was in an argument/ fight with my mother, and she was hitting me while I was on the floor. I proceeded to kick her leg in which the skin ripped open. For context, my mom has 'schleroderma', not really sure how to spell it, which means her skin is really brittle and thin among other things. After this, my behavior began to worsen at home, and over time I got in more and more fights, arguments, etc. This all started to somewhat stop when I was 14, when I entered high school. But from then on, I've been a general piece of garbage -- a manipulator, a pathological liar etc. I had also become extremely socially awkward, to the point I could hardly talk to anyone without knowing them for a while/ being comfortable with them. I stole money from my parents, opened credit accounts in their name(s), etc. I got in fights with my sister which ended in her beating my ass. I started seeing a psychiatrist when I was 15 and to this day I lie to him about my wellbeing. 

I am 17 at the time of this post, 18 in about a month and a half. I genuinely hate myself but at the same time I don't care about where life takes me; I use people and I am a general asshole. I have been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, and ADD. I'm not sure if any of that is true since I lied during the evaluations. 

I also spent thousands of my own, hard earned dollars from a job I feel like I can barely hold down last year on electronics which I usually end up selling after about a week for much less. I have trouble holding onto money so I used to steal money from my parents to get more. I do not do that anymore but I feel like I'm a completely different person that what I display at home, but those home aspects are finally seeping out into my everyday life, making everyone think I'm crazy. Maybe I am, who knows. 

I am very intelligent both on the streets and in the books, and I believe I may be a genuine psychopath. I have sold others belongings and lied to countless people. I also think about suicide a lot, if I were dead I would have no one to fuck over. I DO feel emotion, but only if the event procuring it affects my day to day life. I just don't know what to do anymore. Please for the love of God, what do I have, and what should I genuinely do?"
669,I think Part of my brain doesn’t work.,"Nothing ever feels necessary. I always go through life and everything has always felt logical. The facial movement everyone makes is just... movement.

I’m starting to lose motivation to make emotion, and it’s starting to make me depressed I think.

670,Is there any way I can get holistic treatment?,"Me and my doctor have tried Ketamine injection and some other ADs, but to no effect, and now he’s disengaging from me, which I find unacceptable. I shouldn’t have to keep living with disabling fatigue, numbness, tingling and physical imbalance. It’s likely a somatic condition. Is there any way I can get treatment that attacks the cause of these symptoms, rather than focusing on individual symptoms? I think that’s what I need. Sadly my doctor is too busy with other patients and I haven’t even got a formal assessment. I need a doctor who could really try to help me out."
671,I had my first panic attack around April. It’s becoming more frequent and draining,"Each time my crying gets louder, breathing gets faster, chest gets heavier—it feels like it’s caving in on itself. I was a quiet crier before this. I don’t know what shifted. I don’t know what triggers it.

Today specifically scared the shit out of me. Suicidal ideation never coincided as intensely. I felt a deep urge to make whatever rash decision.

I’m not sure if this is relevant but I’ve been having trouble keeping it together in public as well. I’ve been crying at work, on the sidewalk. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

It’s like I’m alone in my own little world."

675,Journaling to feel better?,"Does anyone here journal for mental health? What benefits do you see? I used to journal so much as a teenager, now I’m 30 and I feel my life is out of control. When I say out of control I mean internally, on the outside I’m sure everything appears as it should. Id say the downward spiral started 7-8 years ago and has gotten worse. I’m extremely irritable, and have recently been on a path to change this. I have been meditating regularly, though not long. I’m inconsistent with workouts, and I’ve read so many times the benefits of journaling. 
But every time I sit down to write, I have no clue what to write about/ where to start. Are there any prompts you have, or things you try and cover each time you write? Any insight is greatly appreciated!"
676,"Venting, need some help.","I can't keep doing this. 
I am sitting by myself in a dark quiet livingroom.. it happened again, I did it again. 
I called in sick from work with some wild story.. because I couldn't find the energy or motivation to even get dressed. I am throwing my life away like this and I don't know why. As I have no friends or anyone I can open up to I will use the anonymity of the internet to vent.

It's happening more frequently again, and I've used every wild excuse and lie I can think of. I can't keep going on like this it needs to stop! But I don't know how. It's like some days.. from the second I open my eyes I feel it in my chest, and this voice in my head, my mind starts rolling through every previous excuse I used to get out of work trying to come up with anything. I then proceed to feel like a piece of shit the entire day and be completely unproductive. Usually I sit on the couch for hours just staring at my phone with all lights out eventhough I have a ton of work. 

It's coming to a point where I'm afraid I will be called into the office and be questioned about it all. My work is great, I get to stay with my lovely boyfriend (who doesn't know about me calling off work frequently btw) and have the opportunity to pass my final nursing exams in 2 months. So I should be feeling great.. But some days I feel to paralyzed, anxious and unmotivated to do anything at all.

I just want to sleep all day. I've seen a lot of psychologists and my latest one was actually helping but she got a new job and relocated. I'm hesitant to see a new psych because I just don't think talking about it helps. They don't say much and I'm not ready to actively make a change in my life. I dont know what to do and I sound stupid for not wanting help.

There seems to be more concern with making others look bad than making themselves look good. 

I'm also working opposite shifts of a guy that refuses to do every part of his job, what's worse is that the management here is so lazy that they refuse to do anything about it. I catch him lying on paperwork daily, yet when I point it out to my superiors I get told he didn't  do it. They seem almost willfully ignorant. 

It's becoming hard to deal with the stress here, I can only find so many stress and anger management techniques. Yet every adjustment I make to myself seems to be met in kind with pushing my limits even further. I've stood my ground and spoke to my superiors about how badly this affects my daily life, but I tend to get the same placating language that everyone else gets, without any real changes ever being made. 

I know I need to leave this job, but I need some ways to deal with this until I can find something different."
679,Is this still sadism I don’t get entertained seeing someone hurt physically but i get entertained by causing someone emotional distress I mostly do this at work when am bored I tell them that there shit at there job and make them do jobs they don’t like to do then I like to watchtherefaceexpressions,
680,Arguments,Not sure if this belongs here or where. But I keep having arguments with myself all normal about conversations I know I’m going to have or news I’m going to have to give people. 99.9% of the time it’s all okay and I get wound out over nothing. But it doesn’t stop me feeling like shit and worthless then it takes a day to get over it. When it happens I try and limit human contact as I know it’s just in my head and there no no point in passing my episode onto anyone else
681,Anyone finds sadness addicting?,Anyone feel like life is repetetive and there is nothing to do?I feel like everyday is just a repeat of the same old thing but for some reason I also like this feeling of loneliness and sadness not sure how to explain but it feels nice at the same time its choking?It feels like I constantly have a mask up and I cant really show anyone whatbI really think or feel and thats probably because no-one gives a shit maybe I've become addicted to it as a way to cope and sometimes i wonder what its like after death I mean after all whats there to look forward to in life if you are already bored of everything
682,This is clearly something but I dont know what it is?,"My kid is 9. He can be the sweetest, or the not so sweetest kid ever, but he's like living with a little jekyl/hyde. The best way to describe it, would be a light switch analogy:

He listens well, very sweet, nice kid for a few days, sometimes as long as a few weeks... and like someone hit a switch, he's suddenly rude, obnoxious, cant control himself, very little emotional regulation, throwing things in tantrum, scratching/hitting/kicking, fights everything no matter what, for a few days or weeks, and then like someone hit a switch, back to being the sweet kid.

He just had about 2 or 3 weeks of really good behaviour, but the switch has been flipped and for the last 3 days he's been extremely difficult.

I desperately want to get him in to see mental health, but I get the ""the doctor needs to send a referal"" and then, ""the referral has been sent, now wait for nine to nine thousand months for an appointment "".

I KNOW there is something, and if I could figure it out, I could make it better. But I cant figure it out. Does anyone recognize these symptoms? Suggestions?"
683,Need help ASAP.,Hey guys I’m kind of new to this. Soo I’ve been living with this girl for almost a year. And about maybe 3 months ago. Her Grandma Left to Dominican Republic to take care some business. And we been watching her 3 year old Toy poodle mix. Named Bella. I love her I do. But when me and my girlfriend get into an argument the dog shakes and pees. I kind of already know why... for a while I used to Attack the dog from whipping it with its leash to Almost drowning it while bathing her Because she peed on the bed. I’m not no type of animal abuser because I’ve grown around dogs and cats. Hell at one point I used to work with dogs from the shelter so I know a scared and abused dog when I see one. So anyway Bella used to be so loving and kind and even tho she still kind of is.. I feel like she only likes me because she’s scared of me. I know I sound crazy and shit but I want to know what can I do to make her like me again. And go crazy for me everytime she sees me. I get so mad though. Like When my girl will leave the room. She would run after her. I’ll Try to Calm her but all she do is shake.  I’ve dealt with seeing my mom be abused.. but I was never the type and still feel I’m not the type I don’t know where all this rage comes from. I was always loved as a child. I’m 24 years old now... so I feel like if I was gonna become an abuser it would’ve happened already. I just want the damn dog to like me again. I do love her. I just Get so mad sometimes I take it out on her. Then she’ll look at me with those Eyes like “really nigga..” I just want it to end I do care about Bella and my girl. We just argue tooo much and since I’ve already attacked Bella I’m kind of already used to it and I do feel some type of power omg I sound like a monster but I’m not. I love animals I used to take care of them and loved it. So for this to be happening I just don’t know what’s wrong.. it happens like all the time it’s not a one time thing I wish it was or actually never happened at all. But it just keeps happening I keep telling myself it’s not gonna happen again. But from me attacking my girl to her dog I don’t know what’s going on with me. I see a therapist but I just don’t feel comfortable telling her about me hitting a dog..I just want Bella to like me again. She don’t like treats..so I can’t give her any of those.  I don’t wanna be judged I just want to know how I can get Bella to like me again. The way she used too...
684,Feeling empty again.,"Hi,

I have not been feeling well deep inside as of late, I feel a void somewhere inside me that I can't pinpoint. I'm the usually stronger vessel, problems or difficulties never really got me down, but here I am now unable to help myself.

I usually feel this before during teenage years but not to a very extent.

To give you all a gist of what I've been going through here are some threads:

Note that I'm a recently married man and a recently turned Christian

Now I'm actually on the verge of giving up on marriage:

Here's what my wife had been doing, although I've been seeing improvements as of late, but I still can't seem to get a hold of myself and I couldn't feel at home with her anymore.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bb4i8z/26m\_dont\_know\_what\_else\_to\_do\_wife\_27f\_has\_been/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bb4i8z/26m_dont_know_what_else_to_do_wife_27f_has_been/)  
I ended up posting on r/phr4r of possibly hooking up to get a quick fix.

Why do I think I need help now\*\*? - I just cried while taking a bath, I feel trapped.\*\*

I told my wife I want us to have a marriage counseling but she brushes it off and she keeps on telling me that I have the problem, I should have myself check.

Sorry for the long post and thank you for taking your time to check my thread."
685,I’m seeing a doctor today. Need some advice!,"So, in order to get a proper therapist, I need a referral from my family doctor. However, I have no clue what to say to him or how to explain my problems... I’m having a hard time thinking of explanations or descriptions in general. I don’t know what I’m supposed to say! Does anyone have any advice or experience with this?"
686,Will medication really help me?,"Hey, r/mentalhealth. 

My whole life I've struggled to focus. Reading, writing, gaming, socializing, all of it. I've read entire books and have been completely unable to tell you details about the book just a few days later. I've started hundreds of writing projects and games and books without finishing them. I have conversations with people and have to mentally remind myself to concentrate on what they're saying, only to miss what they're saying because I'm reminding myself to focus. Novice googling tells me these are textbook signs of ADHD. 

To give a little bit more background, I'm currently finishing up just over a decade of service in the Navy's nuclear power program. One of the drawbacks of the program is that any sign of mental instability or mental health issue is met with removal from the program. Makes enough sense, right? You don't want people struggling with mental health issues running nuclear reactors. 

The problem here is that people in this program HAVE these issues, they just don't report them. They do their best to cope because the second the blow the whistle and try to get medication, the Navy processes them out of the ""pipeline"", so to speak, to put them in a different job. 

All this just to say that I haven't gotten help yet because I don't want to lose my job. But I get out in December, so it will soon not be a problem anymore.

Now I'm no medical professional, but I know that, if properly evaluated and diagnosed, people are often prescribed medication for ADHD. I've heard time and time again that their lives are dramatically changed for the better afterward. 

My question is this: is this realistic? Is it worth it to go through the process of getting a therapist to evaluate me, get prescribed some long-titled jumble of chemicals, and start taking it? I'm not knocking the legitimacy of medicine at all, but I'm skeptical about it. Miracles don't exist, and I'd rather not go through the money loss, pain, and wasted time to get something that isn't going to help that much or at all.

Any help or advice you can give me is greatly appreciated."
687,Weight obsessed.. but only half the time? —can’t stop convincing myself I’m too fat for love,
688,Switching between feeling confident and “too fat for love” -hurting my relationships and my heart,"(Weight related) 
Not sure if this belongs here but in elementary/high school I struggled with my weight and would fast/purge to stay where I was. In grade eleven I developed some health issues and within a few months lost about fifty pounds and weighed less than I had since before puberty started but I still felt fat. Looking back I’m miserable I was so unhappy with my body bc I’ll likely never look that good again. Surprisingly, I usually don’t feel as horrible about my body these days despite the fact that since getting better I gained the fifty pounds back (ofc), plus twenty more... 
I feel like one day I’m sexy and confident and the next I’m verging on suicidal and decide I’m going to stop eating to lose weight and that my bf CANNOT see me naked, this makes actually losing weight SO HARD because I flop back and forth between liking how I look and hating myself. 
My bf is really into art and fashion culture etc and with that he follows a lot of anime style art, Japanese fashion companies, and beautiful girls on social media. Whenever I see this or even just when I’m left alone to remember I feel AWFUL and convince myself he could never like or be attracted to me because I don’t look like that (I’m chubby and white and don’t have nice clothes) and then again spiral into needing to lose weight. I don’t want to feel like this because my bf has never said negative things to me about my appearance and everything he has said that I’ve taken badly has (I can admit) been me twisting his words or taking them the wrong way. But regardless, it puts strain on our relationship for me to feel he thinks those things about me and that I need to be skinny to make him love me.. 

Why am I so back and forth?! I don’t want to hate my appearance but at least if I did consistently it would be MUCH easier to decide I’m going to lose weight and not change my mind two days later! Any advice on how to stabilize my self image and/or how to not convince myself I don’t need to lose weight right after starting"
689,I feel happy most of the time but spiral almost every time I’m alone,"This is just a vent but I left university this semester and won’t be starting at a new school until September so I really need to find a job but have no motivation and so much anxiety; but I’m trying. 
I have gone to the mall almost every weekday this month where I just walk around for hours while my bf (also my roommate) is in class because EVERY TIME I’m left alone I end up having a breakdown and convincing myself that he doesn’t like me and thinks I’m fat and ugly etc etc which ofc makes it worse :( 
Idk why this happens because he has never told me I’m any of those things but I also don’t know what I’m supposed to do about it. As soon as my bf left I, seemingly without even thinking, went onto his twitter to see who he was following. He follows a lot of Japanese models/fashion companies/anime art accounts on his social media and it makes me feel SO AWFUL bc I don’t look like that (I’m plus sized and white) and have convinced myself completely that he won’t ever find me attractive unless I’m skinny skinny skinny. What am I supposed to do? In my head the only options are to rapidly lose weight or break up because I can’t handle feeling so awful so often
I want to be able to be in my house without my head flooding with (probably irrational) thoughts"
690,Volunteers when they help for their selfish needs,"
Can you relate to this?

 I like to help people alot in whatever way that is and one of those ways is to volunteer... 

(mental health in this case) 
I have noticed way too many people who volunteer hardly know what they are raising awarness for OR either dont give a shit about the suicidal patient and would gladly hand over the knife just so they can pretend they helped to calm them down.
It's so upsetting and they get praised. I know some who are bullies and they pretned to help and then laugh behind their backs its ridiculous"

In fact, he told me that I might be diagnosed with some sort of depression disorder, but meds wouldn't be needed. I feel empty all the time.

699,"I'm so slow at doing so many things: it's an handicap, others dislike me for this and I'm scared of life.","26F from the EU (pardon my awkward English).

I am slow (and perfectionist) at anything that has to do with cleaning: taking a shower, washing the dishes, cleaning myself when I go to the toilet, washing and preparing vegetables. Common things that needs to be done every day or so.

I'm also slow at eating, for some reason. First few bites, when I'm hungry, I'm fast as anyone else. Then I have to stop for a bit (because I feel full), take another bite, stop again, take another bite, and so on until I'm done. I'm **always** the last one to finish eating when I'm in a group of people, **by far**.

I'll describe my issue in more details in the following paragraphs, that you can of course skip.  
**WARNING**: it's quite long, and may be **disgusting** to read for many of you (especially because I'm a girl and you probably can't imagine a girl like this lmao)

| -------------------------**DESCRIPTION START**\---------------------------- |

Because I'm so slow with cleaning activities, I try to do them as least as possible. If I'm home alone all week, I shower once (only wash my armpits if they smell). If I have to go to work, I shower only on Wednesday and Sunday (armpits every day especially during summer).  
When I was 14-15, I had medical problems because of the fact that (for several years) I had been trying to go to the bathroom as least as I could. I ended up having a [fecalith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecalith) in my intestine, causing me some serious pain. To get rid of it I had to take medicines and do enemas (**horrible**). After this experience, I understood that I couldn't continue like that, and started going more often.

But **why** does it take me so long to do this stuff, you may wonder.  
I feel like I have to, uhm, use lots of toilet paper to clean over there. I, uhm, ""iterate"" the process many times. For the 'big one': after cleaning as usual, I also clean *the hole* with wet paper (not all wet, just the center). I do this until basically I see no dirt on it. Takes quite some time...  
You see, in my country we have [bidets](https://www.deghishop.it/files/deghi_Files/Foto/1160595_5.JPG) in every bathroom. I use it only before sex (amazingly, I'm in a relationship lol) or (sometimes) when I'm on my period. And, of course, I ""use"" it to dampen the toilet paper as I said before; that's my main use lol Speaking of periods... that's when I **really** waste tons of time in the bathroom lol Like, even **an hour**, if I can.  
If this wasn't disgusting enough for you to read, consider this: to ""properly"" clean my privates, when I was a teen, I realized I had to clean my pubic hair too, right? Well, by doing that, with toilet paper, I accidentally developed a form of [trichotillomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania). Recently I started to completely shave my privates, just to stop wasting time doing this...

Let's talk about showers now (less disgusting, I promise). I used to be in the shower for 45 minutes. I looked up if other people do this, and it seems like everyone who does this, it's because they **like** being in the shower for that much time, they find it relaxing, etc. (many masturbate in there lmao)  
This is **NOT** my case, in fact I hate it, as I said, because it takes so much time for me.  
Now I can manage to take a shower in 30-35 minutes, but if I need to shave it's, of course, even more.

Many times I've been asked why it takes so long for me, what the hell I do there. Well, I don't know how **you** can take a shower in 5 minutes.  
Here's what I usually do: 1) Wash with water. 2) Apply shampoo on hair (until I can feel lots of lather) and soap (liquid, ofc) on my face (rubbing carefully every spot, like behind the ear). 3) Wash (or I can't see because of soap in my eyes lol). 4) Apply soap mostly everywhere else. 5) Wash. 6) Soap on armpits and feet. 7) Wash. 8) Armpits + privates. 9) Finally, last wash.  
(When I was even slower, I used to apply shampoo twice and have like three more ""wash"" steps).  
I feel like, if I don't do like this, I don't clean properly. It's ironic because, in a way, I want to clean myself very well, but at the same time most people shower way more often than me (every day). But it seems I'm unable to this cleaning stuff differently, once I go about doing it :|  
Taking into account the time pre-shower and post-shower, I need about 1 hour and 20 minutes to have a shower. More, if I need to shave.

As for washing dishes, similarly, if you wash some dishes in 5 minutes, it would probably take me half an hour. Again, I have my personal ""technique"".  
1) Wash the dishes with water, preferably until you can't **see** any dirt on them. 2) Rub them carefully (not quickly) with the sponge (with liquid soap on it, ofc). 3) Wash.  
Why do I try to remove visible dirt before using the sponge? Because otherwise, I feel, the sponge would take the dirt and move it on the dishes while supposedly cleaning them. Doesn't feel right to me.

To be honest, when I see dishes/flatware at other houses, sometimes I can see a little dirt on them (I have very good eyesight.. unfortunately lol). So these people are faster than me, but I guess their method is not as good as mine and/or they do it too quickly.

| -------------------------**DESCRIPTION END**\---------------------------- |

Why is it an **handicap**? Because it eats lots of my time, of course. Other people, in a day, can work for 8 hours (9 including lunch break), take care of their life and have some time every day to do something they like, such as playing a videogame for 2 hours. **I can't**. Because of this, living on my own and working is **awful**, it's like prison. I can only work and survive. This is why I'm **scared of life**, at least adult life. And having kids? I can't even imagine how could I do everything I need to do if I had kids. Impossible for me.

Why do **other people dislike me** for this? Well, even if I try to explain them (in much less detail lol) why it takes so much time for me to do things, they don't seem to fully understand. They seem to think that I like being slow, because it's more relaxing or I don't even try to be faster. I also find it hard to be on time for appointments, of course. When I'm with my family I hate doing stuff like washing the dishes, and from their point of view I am just lazy and selfish.

Even going to therapy is difficult, because it takes time! And money :| At the moment, I would have to use my mother's money to do it, and even if she can afford it and would gladly help me with this (she's a psychologist herself and thinks I need therapy really bad lol), I don't want to do it, especially considering that there's no guarantee that it's going to work. I think I need a therapy that goes really deep, until the thing(s) that makes me feel the need to do things the way I do them.. are gone. I don't think cognitive behavioral therapy would work. I've seen three therapists in the past, by the way (one was 'free', paid by the state). For reasons, I stopped seeing them after a while (two of them were particularly bad). I don't know if I'll go to other therapists, maybe. But it certainly feels like another burden for me.

I don't know why I'm posting this. Just to vent, I guess. Sorry for such a long post. Anyone else has/had similar issues? I've never seen anyone like this."
700,Anxiety/panic,"It’s been about 4 and a half years since I feel like my brain broke. I got on an airplane (had been flying my whole life) and it terrified me. I had a terrible panic attack and I haven’t been the same since. It was out of the blue. 

Now I’ve had very consistent rumination, telling myself I can’t do things, and having fear really limit my life day in and day out. I didn’t use to be like this

Has anyone had this happen where an experience seemed to cultivate an anxiety disorder and how did you get over it? Thanks."
701,I don't know what to feel/do despite having all the concerns that caused me to relapse were resolved.,"I've been depressed and recently, there were signs of relapse. I'm doing better today but due to the fluctuations, people around me aren't sure if I'd be, overall, mentally okay.

Now the higher ups from my work who found out about my recent relapse and self hurt tendencies were suggesting if I should take few months off of work. Tbh, I don't want to take a medical leave because idk what I'd be doing if I took a break. Also, work distracts me from overthinking, especially when I'm extremely focused with it although they mentioned that it contributes to my stress when deadlines are coming due.

I impliedly told them I don't want that option so I was told to reduce my load. Now I know they do it out of concern but I feel incompetent due to the load reduction - that I can't finish my own work and they would rather have me distribute some of it to others. They were persistent so I agreed but the reduction should be based off what I'm willing to give up doing - i.e. fairly insignificant load reduction.

To give a heads up on what makes me feel like relapsing, I think it is due to the following factors:

1. Talking with people whose mental health is worse than mine - For example, receiving texts from my best friend that she wants to die, hearing others cuss while engaging in conversations with me, etc. I realized that this has a huge impact on my then declining mental health as I'm taking in all their emotions. I guess this was the reason why my psychiatrist didn't want me to join a depression support group during my worst relapse since hearing their experiences will worsen my suicidal tendencies. As at date, those kinds of conversations stopped.
2. I have a suspended (because guys were harassing me, to say the least) other reddit account where I post some nsfw stuff. I started posting only this January 2nd/3rd week on this one subreddit (mainly audios) and I got top 1, 2, and 15 post of the month on all 3 of my posts per my last checking before my account was suspended. It made me feel like I was in uni all over again where I felt pressured and stressed out thinking what would others say if I won't do well. I got ridiculed in uni when my grades weren't always the highest so I worked harder to be consistently at the top, or at least within that range. Now with this subreddit, because I got top posts on all my posts, I felt the same pressure. And it was affecting my focus in everything - I was paranoid that I won't be enough and people won't like me if I won't make a top post. Getting suspended is a blessing in disguise since I had time to breathe and realize that I shouldn't be worried over a popularity of some reddit posts.
3. In line with number 2, I've been stressing myself out to obtain donation funds to be donated for mental health organization who I haven't chosen yet. I panicked that I won't reach my goal of $1k (net of any charges) because it doesn't make sense to me why anyone would support me and my cause and advocacy (mental health awareness), considering that the general public lacks concern for mental health. I put immense pressure to myself and I set myself up for failure. I'm 23 and it's the only thing I think I can do to help people volunteering in spreading mental health awareness. Fortunately now and after the 2 weeks of posting on that audio subreddit, I got a few people and have a gross amount of $992 for donation (to be deducted by $120 for charges and fees - i.e. $870 net).

Now the thing is, I feel 'okay' now since those cases that makes me relapse were, in essence, partly resolved. But when they (work people) told me to try working less - working is something I'm very much committed to do and I'm willing to work 24+ hours of shift with or without paid overtimes -, it just left an unexplainable feeling inside of me. I just don't understand myself and all I know is I don't want to feel pitiful. I know I'm not making sense. I just can't explain what I'm feeling rn.

To summarize it all... I'm ""tired"" and don't understand my head/brain... again. I don't know what to feel/do.

Sorry you read up to this point..."
702,Best ways to deal with anxiety/depression ?,For some time I’ve been extremely aware of how my mental health has been influences my everyday. I’m currently uninsured and unfortunately cannot get the medication needed. Everyday i’m stuck with the feeling of overthinking and over analyzing situations which often makes my heart rate soar. I want to know what over the counter or alternative medications can I use to help cope with what i’m dealing with ?
703,Prozac,I will begin taking Prozac today and I’m very anxious about starting. I’ve heard so many bad things about it and am having a hard time justifying taking it or any other antidepressant. I absolutely have to do something to help stabilize my brain. So I’m looking for stories on what it has done to improve your life or what negative side effects I should look for in case it is not the one for me.
704,Horrible College habits,"(posting in multiple Reddits)

After going to college for 6 years, i would imagine i would be able to break my atrocious studying habits. However, that is not the case. I am 23, have Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, I have seen over 10 therapists, undergone different forms of therapy for the last 10 years,  and gone to 3 group therapists, have been prescribed countless number of medications. Right now, i am taking the most important classes of my life that are training me for a specific career that is sustainable. But that doesn't change anything, nor motivates me to want to change anything. If anything, it seems that my bad school habits have gotten worse. This is what i have done, and still am doing to this day

\-I goof off during lectures and barely take notes. I rely solely on the slides posted online

\-I create a structured, fair schedule, but never EVER follow it. (For example, i had an exam today and all the answers were on the slides. But instead of studying last night like i planned, I watched 2 hours of TV and went to bed late, and showed up to class late... again)

\-Now the only way to push myself to study, even a little bit, requires me to have some sort of youtube video or twitch stream on at the same time (I always have to multitask)

\-I focus more on my hobbies and joy more than school.

\-Changing settings doesnt stop me from not paying attention or motivate me to study. I once sat in a library with my assignments in front of me, but i didn't do anything for almost 3 hours.

\-I avoid pressure in anyway, which is why I don't do work I'm supposed to. Because pressure makes me want to commit suicide

\-I try to form study groups with students, but am unable to offer anything because i never studied the lectures.

\-Even without technology in the classroom, i just sit back and daydream for hours.

\-It seems that actively and desperately seeking answers for my life dilemmas are all im really skilled at,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seriously at a loss, and am unsure what to do. I think i'm a lost cause, because i can't break any of these bad habits. Failing would not only be costly, but also not going to school would make my parents kick me out. I have everything i could ever need to succeed in school, but I abuse, or don't use any of them."
705,Why do I feel this way about my recent therapy sessions?,"I had a therapy review today and it left me in a really poor mental state and is weighing heavy on my heart.

For a backstory: I am 22. I recently met with a therapists who considered that I may have C-PTSD instead of BPD. However, my current therapist didn't acknowledge this so at the moment I am in MBT with BPD individuals. I am in the art psychotherapy stage and I recently completed my group psychoeducational phase. During this 13 week phase, I missed three sessions due to physical health reasons (I have a rare brain condition) and due to PTSD (I was stuck in bed with bed-wetting, not eating, only laying there in darkness due to flashbacks to my rape)

I had a review a couple of weeks ago at the end of the group psychoeducational phase during a severe low, where I ended up crying about something traumatic to the point where my therapist had to schedule another appointment for me, a check-up of sorts. I felt really upset after this session as my therapist didn't really engage with what I was saying, sort of just said ""hmm"" and asked me things which I found condescending, etc. In brief, I was discussing a past sexual assault, and I also ended up apologising repeatedly for the deep shame in missing three psychotherapy sessions. I told him about episodes of psychosis that I suffer from, which the therapist who diagnosed me with C-PTSD found severe, but my current therapist replied that everyone suffers from psychosis at some point in our lives so it's just a normal occurrence. I told him about the psychosis because it's part of why I have such a strong reaction to flashbacks - the bedwetting, not eating, and not getting out of bed to go to appointments is all due to the psychosis. He didn't acknowledge this.

When we scheduled this follow-up, I had to ask to reschedule it as I had a rough experience. I was still upset after the last appointment and the way we left things made me prone to high anxiety and flashbacks. This day, my uncle was staying over, and as I was getting ready for therapy in my living room, he closed the living room door and pinned me down hard for 30 minutes - reading some sort of religious prayer on me as he thought I had a demon in me (he doesn't believe in mental illnesses). This experience was so extremely traumatic and I believed I was about to be raped again. Eventually my uncle finished holding me down and praying over me. I ran to the bathroom and cried. I asked my sister to call my therapist's receptionist and tell them what had happened. I didn't leave the bathroom for hours.

After this, I stopped eating out of distress. I lost 5kg before my next appointment. Losing weight is not good for me as it causes low intracranial pressure headaches related to my brain condition. In addition, there was an issue in dispensing my antidepressants so I was without them for 6 days - causing sweats, self harm and paranoia. I asked if my therapist could call me and he said he didn't offer services like that. Due to this, I had to cancel my appointment one last time.

Today I finally got to see him. In the last week, I managed to get back on track with my life - I got my antidepressants, have taken up swimming, started yoga and self care. I told him how well I was doing now and apologised for the state I was in in our last session. He asked why I cancelled both of those appointments, and I described in detail about the incident with my uncle and how it made me feel. Then later I described in detail the impact of it on my eating, my anti-depressant situation, etc. He didn't seem to respond at all to it except to ask for further details. It hurts a lot when I open up and the person on the other side doesn't acknowledge the incident or how painful it is. He quickly moved on to the next topic - attendance.

My therapist asked me how others in the group must feel when I miss sessions. I spoke of how attachment is harmed and how the sense of community is disrupted when I missed group psychotherapy sessions. He sort of reiterated that and said that it could prevent others from moving forward. I apologised for any harm I may have caused to anybody in the group. I also apologised to him for my poor attendance, but I had already apologised deeply in the last session so I thought he understood by now.

He asked me at some point about what I will do about my physical illness and how it may disrupt therapy. It's a permanent disability but it felt like he wanted me to say that it would be solved? I said I will have a surgery some time in the next few months regarding my intracranial pressure and so that I may lose weight safely without it causing these low pressure headaches. This is true, but I am still on the waitlist. I told him it may not be preventable and with a disability like mine, I may need some days off. He didn't really like that.

I asked if he believed that my spot should go to someone else, which he ignored. I apologised again for my absences. I explained how ever since \`I was sexually assaulted as a child, I have had a difficult time with attending anything regularly (school or work), and that I am now taking a much more active role in caring for myself. He didn't acknowledge the CSA but kept reiterating the impact on the group when someone doesn't attend. I apologised one last time and told him that I understand if he doesn't believe that I should begin the next phase due to my absences. He said that, instead, I will need to take a 6 week break to sort out my physical health and get my surgery and I will begin the next phase afterwards (an 18 month phase).

I asked if the time could be reduced as I really would benefit from it but he repeated that the group dynamics would be disrupted if I take time off for my surgery during this time. I am not sure I can promise that my physical health will be stable for 18 months at any point in my life, and I don't know WHEN my surgery will be. I thanked him for his time and I began crying as soon as I left.

I had a severe panic attack and thought of killing myself by running into the motorway or jumping from the bridge above the motorway. I felt like I kept opening up and I do believe my absences were due to serious circumstances, but it was as if I was being told off for them due to the impact on OTHERS rather than discussing how I may manage them alongside the sessions. I felt so much guilt, as if my issues were not valid but just a disturbance to others. This is how my family treats me also, so I just felt so suffocated. I feel so rough, I don't think I can return to him but I keep telling myself that the next phase would involve another therapist so it would be different.

The only thing that prevented me from harming myself was to smoke plenty of cigarettes and shop for thread so I could begin a crafting project when I reached home. I kept trying to actively distract myself. I called my boyfriend, I didn't tell him what happened because I'm sure I was overreacting to criticism and, if a therapist couldn't, I don't think anyone could understand me. So he distracted me by talking about football and I just listened to him as I walked home with my thread.

I want to know, if I'm doing something wrong. Do I come across as too desperate for help? What should I change? I need help so that I don't ruin my last chance at recovery. I'm going to try my hardest to make every appointment, including periods where I am physically unwell because it's just a couple of hours of sitting with a group. But I wanted to know how I could improve myself as a patient in addition to this?

I hide a lot of my emotions around him otherwise because I feel only pain when I share things with him, and I feel like he doesn't believe me maybe? I also don't find any relief."
706,Hypnotherapy?,Has anyone tried this method for bad anxiety? Did it work and would you recommend it?
707,How do I overcome fear about getting help? Advice or encouragement would mean so much to me,"I’ve struggled with my mental health since I was in elementary school but my mom was not open to me getting help so when I started university in September of 2017 I spent a few months hyping myself up and saw a councillor on campus. The school councillors only work with people short term so as per their recommendation I allowed them to refer me to a therapist I could see more long term as well as seeing a dr and then psychologist (also on campus). 
The only problem is that the “referral” they gave me was a short list of therapists in the city and I called the one they recommended specifically after several hours of panicking and working myself up to it and my call is answered and I’m told she isn’t accepting new clients... great.. 
I contact a few more people through the list: all full and full waiting list :( 

Through this set back I continued to see the school psychologist and dr alternate weeks while I was put on antidepressants for anxiety mostly (I don’t know if that’s my biggest problem but it’s what she helped me with). 

Whenever I had to see the doctor I left feeling work and like my feelings weren’t valid. I felt like she put words in my mouth and thought I was there for attention which made me feel like a terrible person or like I was imagining what I’ve been going through. Every time I saw the psychiatrist she would ask me if I had found a therapist yet bc I “need to get on that” and I know she was right. I was trying as best as I could but it’s so hard for me to talk to new people and especially hard to reach out when I was expecting to be turned down and scared they would be like the doctor.

Eventually the psychiatrist discussed it with me and convinced me to sign up for academic accommodations and made me an appointment to do so with the doctor. I went for that appointment and the dr more of less said I wasn’t “bad enough” to get accommodations. This felt like a huge setback and after what I’d call a “breakdown” I cancelled all upcoming appointments and stopped taking my medication. Looking back I can tell it did help and maybe I shouldn’t have stopped but I couldn’t keep seeing that dr and I couldn’t find someone to talk to like I was being told I had to. 

I go through short spurts (like this) where I’m able to tell I really just need to find someone to talk to but I don’t know how. I surf the Internet and find people nearby but I don’t know who I’m supposed to reach out to because they all specialize in different things and I don’t have a single clue what my goals are or what I need help with. 
How do I find someone when they all treat/work with different stuff I don’t know what is wrong with me? How do I do this when the only phone calls I’ll answer are my boyfriends and moms because I have so much phone anxiety? I don’t even know how to overcome my fears of not being worthy of therapy or being turned away to even look into help most days. 
I guess I would just like some advice on how I can overcome these fears and not let setbacks derail the process for me. I’m scared because if I manage to find someone to have an initial appointment with and they tell me I don’t need to be seeing them or that we aren’t a good fit I will never try again but I don’t know; maybe I don’t need help and I just feel like I do"
708,I am starting treatment for PTSD next week,"Went to go see a social worker and specialist yesterday, and am going to be starting treatment for the PTSD diagnosis I was given. I’m really nervous about it, and a bit apprehensive. My childhood abuse isn’t something I have ever talked about face to face, nor do I really want to. Any advice?"
709,What should i do?,"I constantly want to stab/shoot/kill somebody for no reason and im scared of myself because of it + im having lots of anxiety problems

I dont even know where they came from, when im in school i get annoyed by these little things and i really want to punch somebodys teeth after that.

I know i need help but i am scared of asking for it and im not good at talking to people"
710,Today,"Heads up this might be dark and I am working on this with a licensed therapist. I need to confess.

I am incredibly insecure. I worship validation from others, especially in the form of online messaging/ texting. 

Recently I started messaging with someone and we talked about mental health right off the bat. This personal lives locally although we only have one mutual friend and we have never met. They began responding to me with one word so I stopped messaging. 

Then Saturday I got so obsessed with the thought that this person hates me so I messaged how are you? No reply. I messaged again saying my anxiety was kicking in and I was worried they hate me, I wanted to know if we were cool. No reply. The next day I say hey I know you’re probably just busy and this has nothing to do with me but it would mean a lot to know you aren’t mad at Me. I won’t send anything else but I’m just having a hard time not worrying. I checked the conversation later that day to see id been blocked.

I am driving myself insane with guilt for bothering this person. I am now so fearful they are talking about me to others.

I know this is of my own making and I must face the consequences of my actions. 

I feel like a complete waste of a human being today."
711,MY memory has become terrible.,"I used to listen to an audiobook in the evening and next day write detailed notes from previous day's session.

713,"If you are a man who has experienced female-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV), please complete this questionnaire!"," I am currently conducting a piece of undergraduate research through Keele University; this research aims to explore male experiences and perceptions of female-perpetrated intimate partner violence (IPV), and masculinity. 

This questionnaire looking for **men who have experienced female-perpetrated IPV**.

IPV can take a number of forms such as physical violence (e.g. hitting), undermining (e.g. being told you’re useless), sexual violence (e.g. sexual coercion), or other controlling behaviour (e.g. isolating from family). 

Unfortunately, not a lot is known about the experiences of men who have experienced IPV, which means there is not a lot of understanding and resources to help. 

If you man who has experienced IPV by a female partner, please complete this questionnaire:

714,Do a lot of people have the mental illness gene but don’t have a mental illness?,"If you have a parent with a genetic mental illness but don’t have the illness yourself, you are probably a carrier of the gene. For instance, my mom has a diagnosed anxiety disorder. It’s so bad that it interferes with her everyday life. She struggled to hold down a job for years. Since I’m her child, I probably have the ‘anxiety gene’ although I probably will never have develop anxiety during my lifetime."
715,Anxiety/Panic Attacks,"I’ve been managing to control my anxiety for the past year and having very few panic attacks, but recently in the past week I’ve been having a few really big ones, I’ve not told my manager about them cause they’ve not affected me at work yet (I’m a barista) but I’m terrified that I will eventually have one on shift and no one will realise or be able to help."
716,What discourages you from looking for a therapist?,I was looking at statistics and found out 56% of people with mental heath illness don't seek treatment. Why do you think this is? Anyone have experience with this?
717,Journaling?,"Journaling to feel better?

Does anyone here journal for mental health? What benefits do you see? I used to journal so much as a teenager, now I’m 30 and I feel my life is out of control. When I say out of control I mean internally, on the outside I’m sure everything appears as it should. Id say the downward spiral started 7-8 years ago and has gotten worse. I’m extremely irritable, and have recently been on a path to change this. I have been meditating regularly, though not long. I’m inconsistent with workouts, and I’ve read so many times the benefits of journaling. 
But every time I sit down to write, I have no clue what to write about/ where to start. Are there any prompts you have, or things you try and cover each time you write? Any insight is greatly appreciated!"

719,Just a little update with my moods. - My feelings right now in general.,"Well hello again, I've posted about being sad some days before, well, I'd like to update that post.

Since then, I've actually got someone psycho..something that could talk with me, but she's having some personal stuff right now and she can't assist me now, so I'll just take that pressure off me here, thanks to anyone reading this post, I'd like to thank you for taking your time and caring about me, since I just got no one so close that I feel I could talk too.

As I thought that things were actually going for the better, I just feel worse every day for some reason.

Every move outside the range of 2m away from my bed is just making me uncomfortable, I mean really really much, I'm just asking other people to do stuff for me, basically all-day stuff.

I'd like to go out and just talk with friends, but I ain't even trying now, 'cause I'm scared they would just shit talk me or completely ignore my presence, since that's what I mostly feel like when I'm with them.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not socially anxious, keep that in mind.

Yesterday, I was just annoying my friend and we were watching reddit memes, and Windows being faggit as always kept spamming my friend with some notifications.

He clicked it and it opened his e-mail client, in which I accidentally saw some ""depression, anxiety, stress test results"" and he acted embarassed. That was okay, he's always promoted by others as the sad one, I care about him, he mostly just yells at me to fuck off whenever I get near to him, but I try to make him somehow feel less anxious by hugging him, cause I know he is hella anxious.

Well I took the test, just for fun I thought and actually got some interesting results.

 [https://www.depression-anxiety-stress-test.org/](https://www.depression-anxiety-stress-test.org/) 

That is the site I took it on, I don't know if the site is trustful, I didn't check it.

My results: ""Depression: 28 score / With 9 score being the average person""

""Anxiety: 4 score / With 7 score being the average person""

""Stress: 26 score / With 14 score being the average person""

You can take the test yourself to see your results if you want to. I know that it isn't scientifically accurate, but I like getting atleast some feedback.

I've also stopped eating, like totally, I can eat two slices of bread a day and be full for the rest of day, I just can't get myself to ear more.

I've tried to meditate, and I did for I think 30 minutes, felt like 5 minutes tbh. Well, didn't work either, I was hella angry after the ""meditation"" with just ""Fuck everyone and everything"" life motto. Also don't know why.

My trying to talk with people just faded away too, I don't even want to talk with the closest people. I just feel irritated by them not caring and just not being careful enough about me, I've started having that philosophy of ""If they don't care, I do not too"" and just being really angry and aggressive at them.

I think that they care but I just feel like they don't and I hate this feeling.

My free time consists of ONLY lying in bed and headphones on, nothing more. I am also a metal person, I don't think that it is a bad thing. I also don't know why, but through the music I just feel understood and like I'm being cared about. I've also started looping **Korn - Can you hear me** in my head, over and over again, with these weird vibes just flowing through me I feel understood and just relating to it.

&gt; Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost  
And I may never come back again  
And while my heart keeps holding on  
I know I'll never be the same again .

This is the main reason I like the song, I just relate to this at the moment so hard.

I think I have also problems with my identity, I feel like I've been switching my patterns of acting and feeling everyday. Could it be the Borderline Personality Disorder ? I think it is called like that.

Even when dreaming or meditating, I am unable to imagine other people, I just can not, because if I do, I get weird feelings and snap out of it.

Last night I took 3 hours to fall asleep, worsening every day.

I've been practicing some spirituality lately, and I've also tried some stuff to feel less sad, but same as always, nothing works.

I like to stand up for other people, I like to lead other people when they can't, I like to help people if they need some help no matter the time/energy cost for me, I would sacrifice myself for other people if we had to choose, I really would, cause if I lead in that situation, I take it as my duty to get behind for my group's victory. And now when I am down, why won't anyone do the same for me ? I keep annoying them and asking for just staying and talking with me, but no one wants to, I've been asking for help too, but I get mostly just some generous one-lines with them leaving afterwards. Did I fuck up ? Have I somehow brought this on myself ? I have no idea, sadly. And lately ? I can't even move for myself.

I get that they may not have time but seeing them playing games just after leaving me just makes me feel like I fucked up and insane amounts of hatred.

I would like to talk to people that care about me.

I feel empty, without energy, just nothing, pure void.

I just don't laugh that much anymore, I've lost my taste for humour.

What do you think?

I just feel lost.

Just lost.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've read it all the way, please comment, I just wan't to get some feed back or attention, even if you don't care, which you probably don't, but still, please.  I don't know about anything, I don't know if I even want help I just don't want anything anymore. I just wanna be left alone, without stuff to do, to just exist, 'cause I don't even see the  point in even trying to accomplish something anymore, the universe is going to be destroyed completely in many years, why would I even try then? This post feels like attention seeking, I don't know if it is, you judge me, just like everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you hear me? 'Cause I'm lost."
720,"If you really and truely have depression, u will have it until the day you die.","If you know what it actually feels like, if you know the reasoning behind it, even if you don’t, but if u really deeply are touched in the brain with depression.

721,Update,"So... in school I had a homework where I had to speak/sing because its music and I didn't have the confidence to do it, I got a detention which I wasn't to sad about. My mum was fine too which was great.


Here's something else that has nothing to do with what I said much.  So I draw on my hand when I'm stressed and my hand was covered by the end of today/ whenever this was posted!"
722,What's wrong with me? (Brain damage or what????),"This is a throw away account (my friends don't know about my suicide attempt)

I'm 16F (shy girl who doesn't talk often)
Since I entered the high school a year ago I went from straight A student to F, D and C student.  I daydreamed all day, couldn't focus in class (daydreamed or just blankly stared somewhere), forgetting things, getting distracted easily, forgetting to drink, eat go to the bathroom, not being able to sleep and couldn't make myself do anything. The only thing that saved me for failing a year in school was my hyperfocus (on studying sometimes) and my symptoms weren't so severe and some of then weren't daily at that time. Then I tried to commit suicide by hanging, my symptoms stayed the same for 8 months but not after I entered sophomore year. Now my symptoms are daily  and got worse. Here are new ones: 
I have often headaches, when i read i skip most of the text because for some reason i just have to skip the text (idk why) or i read the words physically but can't understand them but at same time can (idk how to explain), my hyperfocus is gone so i'm failing most of my classes in school, got more lazy, started to move constantly in class (feet,legs,toes, fingers,hands,scribbling or bouncing my body back and forth), i have constant brain fogs, when i want to do something i get distracted by something (usually daydreams) forget about it and never actually do it also there is  probably more things but i can't remember right now.

so do i have a brain damage from my suicide attempt???? but then again the symptoms started before that and stayed the same for 8 months after that."
723,balding is killing me,"hello guys, first of all I'm sorry for the potential english mistakes I'm going to make, I'm French.

I think it's the best place to talk about this, since this sub is mainly dedicated to self acceptance and overcoming baldness ( yes I used this word because almost nobody shaved his head by choice and it's mainly a constraint).

Despite any genetic predisposition, I think I'm balding, even though I'm only 21. I became self conscious about it a year from now. My hair has always been an issue, I was bullied in school because of my gingerness, so in order to avoid this complex I dyed my hair during high school. I know it wasn't a long term solution but I found it satisfying while I was doing it. At that time I needed to build some social confidence by making a lot of friends, getting my first girlfriends etc. Hence when I considered that I had accomplished all those social steps ( second year of college), I came back to my natural hair color. nobody noticed it because my hair became auburn or dark blond, and I was not a real ""ginger"" anymore. I was really satisfied to have overcome this huge insecurity, and I felt released at this time.

however 6 months later, I started noticing some thinning and some recession, and since then I became totally obsessed about it ( you what I'm talking about, all those pathetic situation where you know the exact Norwood stage of all the male you see everyday, the mirror issues and obsession etc). Indeed I definitely don't want to become bald, I want to enjoy my youth by being attractive which I finally succeed at, and successful but balding will very likely prevent me from doing it. Ironically, my life is objectively great, I have real friends that I can rely on, a great girlfriend, and wonderful parents. Furthermore, I'm doing extraordinarily great in law school since I have the best results among 300 students, and I'm valedictorian, so this allows me to apply to the best business law masters. Nonetheless, balding is destroying me, and I don't really have hope in the future, I'm starting to feel totally depressed and I have really dark thoughts. I hate the way I feel on a daily basis, I really can't stand it anymore, and I don't want to handle it aswell.

I guess some of you have gone trough this, so how did you manage it ?"
724,Should my Hubby take this further? (Work related),"After a challenging and stress related couple of weeks at work, countless mentioning his worries to management and  numerous requests for some holiday time denied,my hubby reached the point of no return and decided he needed to contact the GP, he was immediately signed off for 2 weeks as he is so run down. (He’s also unable to take breaks at work so said he had a dodgy stomach to get a minutes break yesterday) On letting his employer know he was answered with 3 quick succession messages which read “10 days with stress!” “So no upset stomach then?” “Drop it off we will deal with it” (his sick note) 
This added 3 fold to his anxiety and almost made him physically sick! I think this is disgusting and even more so when somebody is struggling with their mental health!!

Whenever my BPD flares up and I either want to cry my eyes out or watch the world burn, my cats are there for me, oblivious to my struggles. They just look at me with their big eyes, stretch themselves out as far as they can and plop down on my lap. And it calms me down so much, just sitting in silence giving ear scratches and listening to their purrs.

I have 5 total now, 3 of my own and 2 fosters. It makes me so happy coming home to all of them.

What is the thing for you that you can always count on, no matter your state of mind? Is it a person, a movie, a song, or a game? A special place in your area you like to go to?"

Self harm, depression and a bit of a mention of suicidal feelings


I feel so depressed. It all started last night. I don't know what happened. I was in such a good mood all weekend and now? I don't know. I'm so lonely. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm sick as well and I just. I don't know. I don't know what I'm feeling.

My partner, the only person I can talk to about anything in my life, has been ghosting me for about four hours, not including the time in school I spent hiding in the library from people. I don't think we've had a conversation that wasn't broken up over hours of them just ignoring me and occasionally sending me one message in response to mine in about a week. I feel so lonely and tired. I just want to sleep. But my back really hurts and I have things to do and I just cant. I have so much to do but I don't have the motivation to even get out of bed.

It's only fucking Tuesday.

I know this feeling. From years ago, from the worst year in my life. When I first started self harming, when life was just unbearable. Except now I also have mental issues to deal with on top of that. On top of my partners issues. On top of the overwhelming feeling that I'm not ill enough to deserve attention. I have never told any of this to anyone. I have never been to therapy. I have never told anyone about my self harm (willingly). I haven't felt like this in two years. And it's going to be so much harder this time round. I'm not suicidal, but I'm just scared I might become like that. Because if this goes on for much longer I'm scared it will get unbearable. It's already getting close. I'm just so scared.

I'm always on my phone because I always need a distraction. I always need something to do with my hands and I'm not satisfied just watching a video without absent mindedly scrolling through reddit at the same time. I want to talk to my partner. Just talk to them. Not even about any of this I just want them to pay attention. We used to talk all the time. I don't know what's happened and im just terrified that somethings happened to our relationship or I've done something wrong or something.

I mean I know I've done something wrong. Like hide from them and not want to go out to their house because leaving scares me. But ill just figure it out. I've gone past a point of no return in terms of seeking help. There's just too much for me to have to talk about. I can't do it. Because then I'll have to talk to my mum and I don't want to talk to my parents about my mental health. I just don't. So I'm going to have to wait until I'm medically independant in four years to get therapy. I can do that.

I just feel so scared right now."
728,idk how i got fucked uo,"my parents were good like they might’ve messed up sometimes but nothing major they told me they loved me and i can’t think of anything i would have done differently.  i never really got bullied except for like literally twice and it was nothing major either time. i’ve pretty much always had close friends like i feel lile all the things that tend to lead to mental health problems don’t apply to me. the only thing i have against me is genetics, and like is that all it takes."
729,My first time,"So I finally broke down and made an appointment for counseling. I’m nervous, but I’m tired of hiding behind a fake smile. I’m not happy like I used to be."
730,I’m traumatised 7 months on from when it happened any advice with coping would be appreciated.,My dog is my best friend. One day a family member took him for a walk and let him off of a lead near a road. I was sat at home when I heard a loud knock on the door. I rushed to the door opened it and here was my dog with blood all over his face and body. I still picture his face like this daily. I sometimes don’t sleep because of this. Luckily he’s still alive and well but I still can’t get over that day. Any coping strategies would be appreciated. Thankyou.
731,No amount of sleep seems to be enough lately,"I wish I didn't have to be at work today. I wish I didn't have to go to class tonight. I just want to rest. Sometimes doing all of this is just exhausting and my lack of motivation alarms me because I know I need to get things done which gives me anxiety and it's a cycle. This post is pointless, but I thought maybe typing it out might help.. thanks.."
732,How to approach therapy? (and maybe a dumb question),"Hello, I feel like I don’t know what I’m talking about so also excuse me if anything doesn’t make sense. TLDR at the bottom.

I’ve never had a consistent therapist. When I was about 16 my mother brought me to two different counselors for a few appointments each, but with both of them I found myself unable to open up as I’d put on a happy face when going out in public and could barely remember the details of an emotional breakdown the night before to talk about it.

I’m a sophomore in college and I’m trying again because I feel like my ability to handle emotions and thoughts has gotten worse. I don’t want to get into the details, but I often feel like I’m crazy and there’s something wrong with me and that’s why I don’t really have close friends and I feel like everyone is doing better than me. When I’m at home for holidays I feel empty. I’ve seen a therapist at the health center three times, and I’m currently looking to find someone off campus.

I have a question that I’m afraid to ask anyone, so please be gentle as I ask here. My family has always been weird about doctors, like even if they’re sick they don’t want to go and I’m afraid that trait has rubbed off on me and I don’t know how to handle physical health let alone mental health. I don’t know what’s normal and I just feel like my brain is broken sometimes. Friends have told me I have traits that would suggest anxiety, and my parents can pinpoint a time in my childhood where they think I was depressed, which is a time that still strongly affects me regarding friendships to this day. 

I was just wondering, if I’m looking for someone to consider diagnosing me (even if it turns out I’m 100% normal just crazy with a bad personality idk), do I have to ask about that? Is that taboo, or will it be weird like I’m trying to hard to have something I don’t? Will a therapist hear what I have to say until they think I should be diagnosed? Or would I need to see a psychiatrist or something? I don’t understand how the people around me have connected with a mental health professional and have these prescriptions and don’t feel anxious all the time.

**TLDR; I'm new to therapy. Is it weird to want to know if I feel like this because I have a mental disorder or something? Is it okay to ask a therapist about whether they might give a diagnosis or do they usually just do that eventually as they see fit?**"
733,Always joked about being schizophrenic... Yet that may be the reality,"Don't really know why I'm writing this. Guess I just want a ranting space to spill out my thoughts and feelings. 

I've always dealt with mental health issues; and while I'm not full blown crazy yet I've dealt with moments that have been becoming more frequent over the years. (I know that I shouldn't call it crazy; but you guys get what I mean) Anxiety, extreme paranoia, occasional hallucinations (generally caused by just waking up from sleeping; or the paranoia) random panic attacks, suicidal idealization, depression, disassociation episodes, alienation, autistic tendencies (autism is also prevalent in my family) irritability, and vegetable salad. 

I recently took a psych avail that my mom the psychologist let me take... And I tested really high for possible schizophrenia. When this happened, my mom revealed that my grandfather (who I've known is severely bipolar) is also schizophrenic; and so is several members of her extended family.   
She wants to get me tested now, now that its not a joke... But I'm really hoping its not the case. I want to have a family some day with my fiance; and I don't ever want any of them to be hurt by something I can't control like my mom was by her dad."

735,"I'm alone, please let me vent to the endless void","I don't really have anyone to talk to, but I have things I wish I could say.

&amp;#x200B;

I take bipolar medication to help me deal with high levels of depression and anxiety, and it supposedly helps keep my ADHD in check as well. When I was younger I had obsessive compulsive tendencies, though those have become more manageable as I've grown up. I have low self confidence. I struggle to pick up on social ques and often don't understand how to respond to people's emotions. I work in a small retail store and when customer's make jokes or imply things I often don't know what they mean, though I have learned to fake empathy and normality for the sake of trying to blend in with people, and to keep my job. Perhaps it's my anxiety forcing me to find a reason, but I'm starting to feel like I must have be on the autistic spectrum or something like that, why else would I feel so alone, other than the real possibility that my mental disorders have left me emotionally stunted in the ways I interact with other people. I'm miserable, and I wish I had someone I could tell that to without feeling embarrassed, shameful, or scared that they might say something shitty to me or give me unwanted advice and then mad because they went and said something shitty or gave me some stupid advice. I'm grateful for my few friends, but it feels like most people just aren't equipped to deal with someone miserable in a way that won't make them more miserable, so I don't want to open up.

&amp;#x200B;

And so here I am in the endless void of the internet, in a moment of melodrama in my seemingly endless misery. I have never vented to the internet before, this will be new to me. I hope that if anyone reads this that at least someone finds in entertaining."
736,Trouble being able to seek help,"I suppose this may need a bit of context. So I was raised in a space where mental health was very often belittled and stigmatized. And as a result I started repressing any and all mental health issues that I experienced and never was able to seek help. 
I'm now no longer in that environment and have slowly started accepting that I probably need to seek help. The issue is that now whenever I try to speak to anyone about my mental health (be it a friend or a therapist) I immediately shut down and feel an extreme sense of shame, as well as have the feeling that my problems are not significant enough or worth wasting peoples time over. 
Has anyone else had such a feeling. How did you manage to get over it?"
737,"I think I'm a stalker, and I feel disgusted about myself!","I'm in love about this guy I met online. I'm a blogger, and he blogs too. We had few flirty chats, and as times goes on, I fall in love. And I haven't even seen his face. But who cares, right?

It was like September when I finally been able to get a photo of him. He's not handsome, to be honest. But it never changed the way I feel about him. His flaws made me even love him more. But darn, reality-wise, I think the feeling is not mutual. I know it. But we did have flirty chats before which made me think I can have a chance on him. 

Then he changed. Literally, every messages I send him is considered ""spam"". I never felt so low in life, and I pity myself. There was a time when I just keep sending him messages without a reply. I feel so pathetic, that I started deleting these messages for me to cover up my desperation. I'm crazy over this person. 

We still chat though. Like casual things. No longer flirt or anything personal. Something like ""got new phone"" or ""your website is down"" etc. He changed. To me, he became a mystery I need to find and solve. 

I know his location through Facebook and he mentioned it before. But not specific. Note that I am overseas. This guys is somewhere in the Central Europe. I'm in the Pacific. 

Now, one day, I Google search his location and last name and found a street view of a very familiar place. So I looked at his photos from previous smartphone reviews (yes, I save those kind of photos), and It's the same place. He also mentioned some details like his mom owns a cafe below their house. And so I confirmed it is his home. 

Hours later, I am crying because I realized, perhaps I am a stalker. I'm disgusted about what I did, and I can't literally find any reason for my behavior. I love him, and I won't cause any harm to him. I'm just curious about him. But again, I think it's stalking. Also, I feel so incapable without him. I have severe depression, by the way, and him entering my life is one of the best things ever. But he changed. 

Why do guys always make you fall in love with them, and leave you halfway through? I don't understand it. I am crying as I write this, so forgive if it's hard to understand. I literally out of my self. Thanks guys."
738,Daughters Eval is Tomorrow,"(this post may not be in the correct subreddit.  I apologise in advance.)

BACKSTORY:
There was an incident that had happened recently when my daughter was home from school for feeling ill.  I was at work and she was with her Grandma and Uncle.  My daughter had her phone and was texting her friends and counselor about wanting to inflict self harm upon herself and commit suicide.  Her counselor called 911.  The police showed up and naturally DCF did too.  After reports, statements, etc. were completed, my daughter was given the option to go our local mental health center for outpatient intervention.  So, she chose to go.  It was a 3 hour deal.

My family has had a few run-ins with DCF.  I'm not going to go into much detail, but the cases were found unsubstantial and closed.  I will share this though, during the past couple of times of having the pleasure of DCF snooping around, my daughter told the workers how she wanted to be placed into foster care.

My daughter has seen a couple of therapists in the past, but her and them didn't really connect.  Since therapy has been inconsistent and that it's extremely hard to find a therapist who accepts state health insurance, she was never given the proper tools to help her go through the motions of her emotions in a...idk what kind of way hopefully somebody will have the word that I'm looking for though.  Maybe constructive?

She can be super super dramatic.  She's been through a lot of trauma growing up (she's still growing; she's an early aged teen).  Instead of my daughter using logic when she gets emotional she goes off of her feelings.  When she loses control, her thoughts and what she says become negative about herself and others.  Of course, they're all lies, but in the moment she doesn't realize this.  My daughter talks down on herself by saying she's stupid, she's always mean, and that she's not good enough.  She says how she doesn't want to live in this world anymore.  She feels that everyone hates her and how nobody cares about her.  Nobody loves her either.  She says things, like, ""I wish DCF would come and take me away"", ""I wish I was in foster care instead of living with this stupid family"", and ""I want to be placed into a mental home"".  Common teen, right?  Maybe, but more than likely not.  It's truly heartbreaking to know at more times than others she feels alone.  It's so hard to convince her that she's loved very much by not only me, but by her close family members too.  I understand so much of what/how she's feeling.  In my early twenties, I was diagnosed with manic depression and anxiety.  Depression is unfortunately inherent.  she more than likely has this disease too.

FAST FORWARD:

My daughter is going to be taking a mental health evaluation tomorrow so that not only her therapist, but her case manager and psychiatrist can help her further.  The process supposedly lasts roughly for about three hours.  I know that my daughter will be given a questionnaire to fill out.  Can anyone give me some examples of what the questions may ask?  Also, does anyone else know what other tests they may be giving her?

FYI:
I'm not going to coerce my child or sway her in any kind of way by telling her how to answer these questions.  I will tell her to be honest about her choices.  This way I can help her see that her answers will have a huge impact on the results.  I want her to know that a lot of the questions will probably be asking about her feelings.  I feel like once she reads one that she'll answer it by going off of her feelings instead of using logic.  I just don't know how to approach her without her thinking that I'm the enemy.  I'm extremely worried about how her answers may result in us having another encounter with DCF.  I'm even more terrified how they may take her because her answers will be negative.

I'm at a loss.  My kid doesn't know how to think logically when she's going through mental pain, so if she answers a question about self-harm, living in the safety of her own home, and/or about abuse with a negative answer, then DCF would more likely get involved. And all I want to do is prevent this.

Edit:
She's such a sweet, empathic, and intelligent young woman.  She is definitely her own individual.  I'm not putting her on a pedestal just because I'm her parent.  She truly is all of these things.

Edit:
I wish I was able to teach her how to address her feelings more in a logically way early on.  I just recently became consciously aware myself about why I've struggled with the same problems that are an everyday occurrence in her life today."
739,"Please help, am I considered in early stages of mental illness?","Made an alternate account avoiding emarressment.

Lately when I'm alone, I've been acting super weird and abnormal.

I know all aint healthy, so I thought of opening it up and look forward to what conclusion I'd get to.


 Now I do have some theories:

1.Those are ways of depleting my excess energy
2.Or to cope with my anxiety about studies and social life.
3.Mental illness starting to fire up
4.I'm a straight out dipshit"

'Crazy' is such a judgmental word but I feel as if it is the only way to properly describe it.
 I always wonder what is wrong with me? I've been to therapy before and yet I still don't even understand what is wrong with me. It doesn't help that I am unable, in a way, to even actually understand my mental health issues.

Is anyone out there like me?

741,"Here is a poem, I wrote about my experience, being Jesus Christ in a psych ward."," Rounded shower rails, bounded by a belief. Grief for mankind, Blind to the truth, but please, let my words sooth you. Rounded everything – bringing sorrow – as I know there's nothing, to hang myself, on tomorrow. “Lord, we need a favor,” they tell me. “Take this, it'll help.” They place things, in my hand. I had a revelation, when I took my medication. A symphony took place, gave me dignity. “But can't you, see?” I would ask, my fellow patients. “I'm Jesus,” “What?” They would soon reply. “I tried to commit suicide, I almost died, I lost my pride.” I wish I had been able to tell them. I wish, my belief didn't, get in the way of someone's recovery. I wish I could, have told the girl with scars on her wrists, “My love, let my forgiveness, like sweet, sweet honey on your lips,” this is where I am quick on my feet, and repeat my symphony. “Like the sound of a symphony, to your ears, like holy water on your skin.” She with her medication, such elation. Then there was me, unable to find my medication or my occupation. I had forgotten, whilst experiencing the pain, they were coursing through my veins. And then they said, “lights out,” and it was lights out. And they gave you your medication. “I know what you want,” they would tell, me. “And you know what we want.” “But I have, told you all I know, what could it be?” I ask them. “Information, information!” I was the puppet, them the puppeteer. I hung, head first, from the string. I am and was just one, of a number of guests, that you will drop after running a couple of tests. Let's talk, about pills, and religious thrills. My nurse, and doctor, say I'm not to be believed. And the cure, for me, isn't diet nor drugs or pills. I've simply broken, through a wall, undergoing a new routine to banish all my ills...After all, I had too, I was Christ on the psych ward. Was I like, him? Demon too many, angel to a thousand."

So anyway he's been leaving rude comments about me, or just pisses me, wherever he can. He calls me a g\*psy, puts sellotape in my hair, during IT classes, he lowers my seat giving me a heart attack. Whatever he can, just to crush my soul.

I'm a really shy person, I have lack of self esteem, because I don't really have many true friends, as most of them just want to use, that I'm a grade A student, to help them not fail or whatever. So I felt pretty proud about me standing up about myself, to say that I had enough, and that he should leave me alone. And it worked, for like 2 days, then everything went back to ""normal"".

Telling teachers is worthless, and I don't really want to be in a bad relationship with him, as I feel that would make the bullying more cruel.

I did the stupidest fucking thing I could've ever done, I helped someone in need. I cosigned for a new vehicle for my wife's sister, she needed a new vehicle badly for her 2 kids and hers had the transmission blow and zero coverage from the provider. Long story short I cosigned, she stopped paying it and moved completelt.outnif state 1 year later leaving the vehicle behind. So I was stuck with it unable to afford a lawyer to fight it. 7 years, $465 monthly payment, my wife became very Ill after the birth of our daughter in 2014, I was working full time minimum wage at the time, we had very little money to say the least. All we could afford was the rent and barely make the 465 payment. I went bankrupt, bank seized my 2nd vehicle my wife used to get back and forth to work so she lost her job after nobody would help us get her a ride, my credit cars debt was over the top. Leta fast forward to right now, I'm working a better full time job, the vehicle is almost paid off only 2 paymets left, we have a nice large 2 bedroom beautiful apartment, we can afford food instead of relying on catholic charities for every meal, my wife's health is recovered. Yet...I dont care..I dont feel any sort if relief or happiness, I cant cry joyfully knowing this 7 year nightmare.of grinding and clawing and working nonstop to pray we catch up is mere weeks from being done. My wife is confused she thought I'd be flying over the moon to bensine with this but I only feel tired. I feel drained, I feel burned out and ready to physically and emotionally collapse. The betrayal was enough to begin with but the initial emotion of fighting through and weathering this storm is nonexistent.

756,Question,Hi I have a problem I was diagnosed with bi polar stage 2 with depression and anxiety . plus ADHD well the thing is I can’t figure out something I’ve had a known drug problem .off and on since I was 16 I started treatment for my bi polar and anxiety and ect .when I was 22 and every doctor knew about my substance abuse problem and still treated me anyway for the disorders . and I would relapse then go back into recovery off and on but recovery last the most close to a year .now I’m 7 months sober I’m happy about that part but the thing is I’m untreated for my bi polar not by choice. But by the choice of my pysch doctor because she told me I needed rehab and that she doesn’t believe I’m really bi polar . So she stopped treating me then after that I gave it some thought and got sober . Was going to go to rehab but I figure if I can not get sober or even stay sober what is rehab really going to do . Cause once your out of rehab you could still relapsed . So I was reading that the doctor is supposed to give you a dual diagnosis because of the bi polar and my substance abuse . Was wondering if that is corrected and also if that is corrected why and how come no one ever diagnosed me with a substance abuse disorder and help treat me for that also .
757,Breaking up with my Fitbit,"So I’ve been toying with the idea of ditching my Fitbit for a while, and today I’ve decided to take it off and leave it off for a few days/weeks. 

It sounds so trivial but I have a history of obsessive behaviours, in particular with my weight, calories, gym visits etc. And since then I’ve stepped completely away from scales and calorie counting but I’m finding my Fitbit just gives me different kind of numbers to punish myself over? Especially since my resting heart rate has been high since I’ve had a stressful few weeks. 

Has anyone else found their fitness trackers have done more harm than good to their mental health?"
758,How to cope after talking about trauma in therapy?,"I'm working with a new therapist and I just left my appointment. She asked me to tell her about a particular traumatic event today that happened a few years ago. I described the event in detail and it was, to say the least, intense. I'm pretty shaken up right now. To anyone else who has been through this, how do you deal with it after you have to relive the experience? I'm feeling really anxious and uneasy even though I know in my rational mind that I'm not in any danger now."
759,This is the only place I can vent,"This is the only place I can vent, I spent 20 mins scrolling through messenger to see if there was anyone I felt comfortable talking to. There's not. I just don't want to burden people who 1) love me or 2) are indifferent to me. So here you go, strangers.

I want to die. I don't actively want to kill myself, though I've entertained the notion and felt... relieved? I guess? When I thought about death. But I just wouldn't do it because honestly I'm scared of screwing up and ending up unable to even try again. 

I feel like I can't explain the turmoil in my head. It's so hard in there. I just cry, and scream, but when someone asks what's wrong, I just say I feel bad. I literally can't explain it better than that. I don't feel bad. I don't feel sad. I'm just tired of trying and trying and trying. I'm tired of being strong. I'm sick of being myself. I want to go to sleep and never wake up.

Counseling doesn't work for me. They just regurgitate my own thoughts back at me and it's like yeah?? I know what I'm thinking but could you... I dunno... help? Therapy worked wonders but I cant afford it anymore. I'm 12 weeks pregnant and everything seems so big and scary and I feel so tiny and unimaginably unimportant. 

I just wish I could die, already. Just some freak accident, so my family isn't as sad as they would be if I did it to myself, on purpose. I don't even feel like a human.. just a ball of mental illnesses and emotions. 

I experience life like.. a video game. Like I know I should be experiencing things first hand, dealing with life, but I can't. I'm just a tiny person behind a keyboard in my own head, mashing buttons, trying to make ends meet. Everything is a simulation, I'm not real and I don't want to be here anymore."
760,Where can I turn for help when my issue will infuriate my SO?,"Forgive me, this is my first post.

I am a middle-aged male that is married w/children. I have been married nearly 2 decades. My wife is amazing, she's good at everything she does and is type A personality and get things done. I am a shy type, I try to be a comedian and do so in all occasions. I make light of most things but inside I feel pretty alone. I have a few friends that I communicate with online only.

**Backstory**

Not that this excuses anything but I was abused as a child by a family member, I think. I'm not 100% sure which one but I'm 85% certain. Ever since then I have been sexually driven. Even at 8 years old I remember playing 'doctor' with my female cousin of basically the same age.  My early teen years I felt REALLY horrible about myself. I wanted to die as early as 14 or 15 years old. I thought about where and how.

Fast forward to my late teen years I was sexually active with my GF, we had a child but didn't end up together. I got married, and shortly after, I was unfaithful. Things were REALLY difficult our first year. Not that THAT was an excuse to do it but it was hell. She stayed with me. It was a painful 7+ years after that trying to crawl out from that shadowy hell I had placed myself in.

Few kids later, I did it again. She stayed with me but told me it was for the kids. As you could imagine, it was plain brutal after that. She went through her grieving process as one would do. She told me how horrible I was. What a piece of shit I am. That I was the worst person she knew. All true. I am still the worst person I know personally. We went to therapy together and individually. I got on antidepressants and have been on them for the past 8+ years. They kind of work. But lately, not sure if it's the medicine or my age but my libido has kind of gone downhill. I can't keep it up for more than 5 minutes so our sex life is gone, as well. We haven't done it for a couple of years now which on top of everything else makes me feel like less of a man that I felt before. 

If all of this wasn't bad enough, I think, well, I KNOW that I need help. Both medically and mentally. So after all of that BS I have an issue with extreme obsession with women I meet and get to know. Another female I interact with is on my mind constantly. Nothing would happen between us because the feeling isn't mutual, I'm sure. And I don't want it to happen. I know I'm a f\*\*\* up and I don't know where to turn. My friends that I talk to can't really help me. I don't spend any time with anyone other than my family. I literally never spend time with anyone but my family. Ever. I'm only away from them while at work and I can't go to my wife because my character flaws would only enrage her, and rightfully so. I feel my antidepressants aren't helping me any longer because my despair has returned despite adding another medication to my daily routine.

I feel stuck. I don't want to be attracted to other women. I don't want to be obsessed with other women. (It's not all women but I am such a lowly creature the thought does cross my mind to try something with any of them.)

Where can I go from here? How can I get help? How can I change my mental state when I've felt this way for 30 years?"
761,Dad abused much mom,"I don’t know what to think at this point. My mom was abused by my dad this morning. I always thought of my dad and a smart and nice dude, but my parents have hated each other for really long. This morning i was asleep but awake, and I overheard my mom crying and my dad saying “shut the fuck up.” My mom used to have mental problems but they got better if that has to do with anything. I didn’t think much of it as it was really subtle and I thought that I just misheard. But today, she talked to me and told me not to tell anyone, and I agreed to. This is what happened according to my mom: My mom texted my dad something that probably got him mad, as they have been fighting for the last couple days (I’ll explain that later) and 20 minutes later, while my mom was making coffee, my dad comes down and just slaps my mom and she falls to the ground. He just repeatedly kicks her then leaves. My mom was bleeding just a bit, but nothing major happened to her. What made me the most upset was that I really looked up to my dad and this is what I hear from my mom, and I know that she wouldn’t lie to me like that. Before this all happened, about 2 nights later, they got in a huge fight and my dad was acting chill because maybe he wanted us to think that he was the victim. But I guess he just let it all out. Please someone tell me what to do I feel like my life is just going down"
762,My parents wont let me move out and living far away from school is destroying my mental health.,Living far away from school and taking multiple busses is taking a huge toll on my mental health and I don’t think I can take it anymore. Everyday one of my busses is late so have to wait another hour in the cold. Everyday I have to deal with huge amounts of stress. Everyday I have to decline hanging out with my friends cause I’m gonna have to pay for the busses then. I don’t wanna ask my parents for money either because they think they can just buy me out of my problems.  Everyday I have to study for hours keeping up with my school and keeping my grades up. Everything is just too much at this point. I wanna run away or just kill myself. I still have at least two years of this constant pain.  Everyone I know has a great life where they go out with friends and don’t stress while I’m struggling to keep everything together. My parents don’t help me at all but rather just shout at me. I wanna end this misery right now.
763,Does anyone else pretend to be fictional character in their head?,"This might be seen as cringey, but, please don't be mean to me.

I've been wondering, is this a part of a mental illness, or do I have nothing to worry about?

So, I've been doing this for as long as I remember, tbh. Like, I used to pretend to be my barbies and stuff. In like 1st grade, I used to write ""Alvin"" on my papers (I loved Alvin and the Chipmunks lmao). This kind of all just seemed like normal kid stuff. When I was about 10 years old, I started to roleplay One Direction, (Yes, this is very cringey, I know, I'm not proud of it, but I thought I would throw it in there anyway). And, obviously, I would pretend to be them in my head. And as I started getting into anime I started doing this with a lot of the characters. Up to 60+ characters across all the fandoms I've been in, excluding 1D. 

So, I'll talk about how it feels now.

I do it with characters, usually the ones that I think are the coolest, or even the ones that I feel like I personally relate to the most. I'm quite honestly almost always in this state of mind, unless I'm talking to my friends or family. Other then that, I'm always just kind of a character in my head, or multiple characters. Even back in highschool when I did this, I would be pretending to be them, like working on my math assignments and stuff. 

I want to say it doesn't interfere with my personal life that much, because I always slip back into my own mind when I talk to other people, like it doesn't affect the way I act personally. I never show it on the outside. Like ever. It actually interfered more with my personal life when I was younger. Its like I can just control it better, now, and that I can keep it to myself easier. 

But its obvious that it interfere's with my life a lot. Its pretty much, as long as I'm not talking to someone, I'm always in this state if mind. It doesn't matter if I'm eating, or if I'm walking around in a store. As long as I don't have to talk, I do this. Its honestly only when I'm talking when I'm not doing this. 

Questions are welcome, and I'd love to hear others stories if they have a similar story.

(For reference, I'm a 17 year old female.)

So my question is, is this something I need to worry about? And is this a specific mental disorder? I've looked into things like DID and stuff, but none of those seem to fit the bill.

To be honest, I think I'm just weird, lol. But, I want to make sure its not a serious mental issue."
764,CAN YOU OD ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS??,Okay its not me but a friend told me he took 12 antidepressants last night. I'm sure that is enough to either kill or be a severe shock yet he went to work today all fine. He told us he blacked out and woke up in a hospital and they just let him go. Can someone confirm this bc we are worried but it doesnt sound plausible
765,What do you guys think this is?,"Hi guys so im 16 years old and i used to smoked a lot of weed but about 3 weeks ago i smoked too much and i had a bad panic attack which caused dpdr. Since then, ive been pretty dissociated and i have had one other panic attack where i thought i was going insane. Well, last night i had yet another panic attack and the usual ringing in my ears (tinnitus) sounded different and scary kinda like a bunch of jumbled sounds coming together and if i focused long enough it started to sound like unintelligible voices. I tried going to bed but when i finally fell asleep i had a very bad and weird dream where all i remember from it was a voice saying ""im you"" and then i said something like ""i wanna kill myself"" (even though i dont) and the voice in the dream said ""dont do that thing"" and then i immediately woke up. Thats all i remember from the dream.  I have bad anxiety and depression and now im almost convinced i have schizophrenia or psychosis or something and its really scaring me the ringing in my ears still sounds weird and ive been focused on it all day. Im going to see a psychiatrist most likely this weekend but until then does anyone have any clue what this could be? Am i going crazy? Do i have schizophrenia? Psychosis? Is this just severe depression and anxiety?"
766,My therapist had to report my mom to CPS and I'm scared,Update to my post(s) from yesterday. I went to go see my usual school therapist because I couldn't focus and couldn't stop thinking about the situation. She explained that she was worried and had to report it even though it only happened once. I'm scared to go through that process. I don't want to cause drama in my family

768,how to cope with being blamed for a suicide attempt (tw),"basically, i was  friends with this boy because he was dating my best friend, so after they broke up i didnt see him a whole lot and neither did our friend group. he often told me that this was the reason for his depression, suicide attempts and self harm. he would find me when i was in town and work himself up into severe panic attacks (crying ,screaming, hallucinating) in the town centre, would call me when he ran away from home, send me pictures of him about to jump off of a ledge, send unsolicited pictures of his self harm and call me whilst he was doing it (which was triggering as I had struggled with it in the past

eventually his mental health improved and we lost most contact (we have a lot of mutual friends so i still see him at parties sometimes). he never thanked me and i still really struggle with it a year today. i pushed my emotions away after it had ended and it feels almost like a distant memory, but that scares me.

sorry for the rant, but if anyone has tips on how to come with guilt/anger/sadness regarding this i would appreciate it :)"
769,how to fake smile,"I've always been great at lying, and Ive used it my whole life both in good and bad ways, but now it's harder and harder to put on a smile and go to school. I just can't, it's impossible. does anyone have some tricks to help with this?"
770,OD from pills without doctor prescription,"So last summer I took like 10 paracetamol pills, which made me throw up and just be sick for two days. I knew from the start that 10 wasn't enought to die, so how many do you think would made OD? Maybe 30?? I'm petit and weigh 41Kg 

The thing is I read online it can leave you with serious liver injuries even in the need of a transplant. I wanna make sure that doesn't happen, in that case I don't die and even stay with more problems lol

A girl in my college died from pills that caused a pulmonary edema, do you know what mix or pills that might be? Tks"
771,I don't know what i'm thinking,"I've been seeing therapist, doctors, etc. But to no avail, not on their part, i don't think, but mine. The problem is that I don't know what i'm thinking, it's like i have no thoughts or feelings. I know they exist, but i can't ""read"" them, as if they're off in the distance where they shouldn't be. Like there's something blocking me from them. Oddly this ""block"" also takes away my talents at things, like i can't do anything anymore like i used to, i was once great at art, but now i draw like a child. I feel like a shell of a human, but i don't know what's causing all of this, and neither do they because i can't tell them anything because...well i don't know what i'm thinking. Testing says i have severe depression and moderate anxiety (but doesn't specify what kind), but the meds don't help (these issues started before i tried meds), and i don't see how this explains what i'm going through. I don't know what's causing this, sometimes i think it's that i have absolutely no motivation, but im not sure, all i know is i want this to end. Any ideas?"
772,I need to know what’s wrong,"Ok so I’m a 21 year old guy from the USA idk if this is relevant probably isn’t but any who. 

I’ve always had depression an anxiety long as I can remember in school I just said I was shy I’d purposely pretend to be sick to try and skip days giving a speech and such the thought of speaking in front of others was terrifying. My depression has got worse and worse over time I’m at a place where I don’t care what happens to me anymore my anxiety is even worse than before when I get around people I begin to sweat and feel like I’m going to throw up theses are all the simple things. A few days ago I started having really vivid dreams so vivid was like it actually happened I woke up and could taste what I had tasted in my dream in my mouth was disgusting and I was freaked out. I’ll see black objects move past me I’ve dismissed it pretty much as my eyes playing tricks on me but it’s made me so paranoid how could I have possibly tasted that ? Why am I seeing black objects move.. I took a shower the other night to calm my mind then it felt like I couldn’t breathe I panicked trying to catch my breath but couldn’t it stopped I left the bathroom my heart beat was racing fast I waited around 30mins was still racing reset of night I was paranoid and felt sick I finally had enough went to the ER for the filling sick thing an not being able to breath suddenly and fast heart beat they hooked me up to a EKG took blood and did ex rays everything came back normal they gave me medication to keep me from throwing up. Said they found nothing wrong maybe was a viral infection I said nothing about anything else they sent me home the entire car ride back I could feel my heart racing but idk If it was real or not.. last night I kept hearing someone talking and no one was there I just turned up the tv an ignored it.. today I wasn’t as paranoid I went for a walk stopped to get a drink and idk why but I looked up at this tree something just felt weird I looks down at the ground and the ground looked like it was sliding away.. the tree looked like it was moving farther away idk why I knew it wasn’t inside but it looked like it I shook my head and continued with my walk I fear I’m going mad or idk what’s wrong with me..  and no I don’t do drugs and I don’t take any medications.."
773,How to help someone with acute psychosis.,"My boyfriend is currently in another round of acute psychosis. He thinks he is satan, thinks he is god chosen one sometimes and is anti satan. He could be talking normal to me, then increasingly gets more angry and starts to verbally attack me and say mean and hurtful things. How do I handle this?? It's my place, and I cant just kick him out, its cold but there are times I am afraid for my safety though he never gets physical with me, just more verbal which in my opinion hurts more. He legit thinks he is having a spirtual awakening, purging all the evil from the world all while ""channeling"" dead people. I woke up the other night to him doing ""black magic"" aka him dancing around the living room table with candles going"

775,"Fuck you, mother","Today, my mom fucking called me mentally retarded.  I had just gotten home and told my mom I was sick, with influenza of course.  As I was sick, I didn't want to spread the virus I had or possibly injure myself at the weight training I was supposed to do (today's leg day), so I told my mom I don't think I should go today, and she said ""okay"".  However, when it was already 30 minutes too late to leave for the gym, she just randomly got her fat ass up from her chair and said, ""let's go"".  This had happened before, but last time my mother hadn't fucking listened either.  She pushed me off my chair and spouted the usual shit out of her mouth, her useless empty threats.  Whenever this bitch is fucking sick, she tells me not to ask her for anything, letting herself do less work (even though I never ask the bitch for anything), but whenever I'm fucking sick, she makes me do at least three times the work at home compared to what I do in SCHOOL within two days,  I already have enough homework as an IB student, so I'm gonna ignore her for now.  If it happens again I genuinely don't think that bitch will wake up the day after.

TL;DR - I'm sick, my mother is an asshole and a hypocrite, next time she does this shit I will kill her."
776,Got forcibly withdrawn out of my university,"I've had problems with depression and social anxiety for about 8 years now and its starting to get out of control. 

My family comes from the extreme poverty in southern U.S. and I was the first to graduate highschool and go to college back in 2015. I just got kicked out of my university during my final semester and must pay $5,000 back in finacial aid before returning.

Since 2015 my mental health has steadily declined. This is even reflected in my grades when looking at my academic transcript over the years. I don't even feel like the same person I was back then. I tried going to my university for help back in 2017, but they weren't very helpful. I don't have insurance to get proffesional help. 

Right now, I feel like a failure. I'm too afraid to ask for help and I don't know who to ask for help. My mom has plunged herself into debt she'll never be able to pay off, all so she could take out loans to help me pay tuition over the years. I've also run up so many credit cards and personal loans trying to take care of bills and family back home. After all of this, I have no transportation, no job, no degree and negative money. I have completed 118 out of 133 credit hours towards my degree with nothing to show for it, I can't even access my academic transcript because of the money I owe my university.  I'm being evicted from my housing and will have to move back in with mom, along with the 8 other family members currently living with her, in her 2 bedroom 1 bath trailer.

My plan is too work and save up for the rest of this year. Hopefully, I can finish up classes next year after paying off what I owe. I just feel like giving up. I have lost faith in my ability to be responsible and focused. I've wasted my mom's money. I'm in so much debt. All of my friends have moved away and are starting exciting jobs, buying their first cras, and moving to exciting places, while I will be back home sleeping on my mom's couch for the next year. I didn't expect this post to be this long-winded, thanks for reading."

I go to school, I work, I volunteer, I exercise more now but still miserable. i dont have friends anymore, im ugly so no girls will talk to me and i’m dumb. I wish i can smoke pot again and all that but now i have to quit because im applying to union jobs and shit. I really hate my life, im angry depressed and just feel like i cant move on without because then the rest of my life i feel like would be working and not enjoying anything because everyone wants you to work out, be rich, study, work 24/7 and watch sports.

780,Got rejected from a job interview again,"Through this past year, I’ve been working on getting my mental health together so I can get a job once I graduate (in a few months). I started applying  to jobs intermittently  since last April. I wasn’t able to do this full time because it gives me a lot of anxiety to set myself up to scrutiny this way. 

Last week was my second telephonic interview after a long time, and the interviewer seemed to enjoy the conversation. He told me I was qualified, that my work was impressive and gave me his email and phone number to follow up with him. Today I receive an email that they’ve gone a different way. I woke up to this news, and I felt deeply hurt and vulnerable. 

I’m an international student and have been worried about finding a job in the US. I don’t have much time since my visa will run out and I don’t even know what I’m doing wrong at this point. I have a masters degree, 5 years of work experience across different industries and I will be graduating magna cum laude.

781,"My friend is suicidal, please help","I've been trying to help my friend with mental issues for about a year now, I managed to get her to stop cutting for about 6 months and things were looking up until about a month ago. She's been diagnosed with depression and has dealt with bullying and verbal abuse from her parents since she was young. I'm the only person she's told this much information to, including other friends, counselors, parents, etc. About a month ago she started cutting again, not regularly but every 2 weeks or so. I'm frustrated that she hides from her problems and tries to ignore them, relying on outside help. Yesterday I made a bad decision and I reached out to one of her previous bullies to try and understand what happened. I didn't gain any information from the bully, the only real result was that she got angry, had a panic attack, and refused to talk to me. I didn't learn until today that she tried to kill herself twice last night. She resumed talking to me today, but she's still angry and I know that I've broken her trust. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid I'm going to make things worse, I'm talking to a counselor tomorrow but in the meantime, I want to hear what Reddit thinks. Any advice is appreciated, I really just don't know what to do."
782,Male with Gender Dysphoria advice needed,"Hello everyone, 

This is a throwaway just because it’s kind of a sensitive subject for me. I (M24) have had a strong sense of gender dysphoria since I was a young child. I have a done a great job of suppressing these feelings but now it’s becoming increasingly difficult.

I have a few problems with dealing with this. I have trust issues and have a hard time vocalizing my feelings with other people. My family is very conservative and that scares me into suppressing these feelings. I have pretty much kept this a deep dark secret my entire life, I was thinking about telling my ex in college but I’m just too scared. 

Should I talk to a therapist and is there a way to not have these feelings without transitioning? It’s not that I don’t want to (it would be a dream come true) I just don’t know if I could ever show myself again to friends or family. 

Any advice on my situation would be truly appreciated. Thank you all."

784,I just want to get something off my chest… Sorry...,"Hi. I am Pretty sure noone will actually read through this, but I've been struggeling for so long. Why is this such a Long process? 

I haven't been well for quite some time. I am 21 now but in 7th grade I started distancing myself from social life. My 'friends' left me hanging over and over again, so I decided to cut my ties to them but never really returned to socialising, mainly because I was known as the 'strange girl'. I was an easy pick, though I would no say I was hardcore bullied. I remember in 9th grade I asked a boy to a dance and he said he wasn't sure if he would be going. The next day my whole grade knew and made fun of me for weeks about how I could have asked someone out who was sooo out of my league. Anyways, the Internet and books were already my best friends by then and mostly I would be sitting or laying in bed.

Fast Forward when I started studying at uni. Over the last 12-18 months I have been spiralling downwards. I feel so overwhelmed, my grades just suck, I keep failing everything I touch. Sometimes I canot breathe or just burst into Tears. I hate myself for my failures. 

It got really bad when I decided to get a tattoo. As soon as it was done I hated having it on my body. I was just so stupid. And it is not small at all either. I spent two weeks in bed crying at my parents' (I had holidays by then). My parents sent me to our primary care physician because they are convinced my behaviour had to do with my thyroid (I have Hashimoto). My doctor said I was so tired and irritated all the time due to my condition and low iron. Once I was on the right medication everything would be fine. I already felt ignored that first visit but was putting my hope in these two pills per day. That was back in July/early August. 

Spoiler alert: I did not feel better. I learnt that I had failed more than half of my exams and it got Pretty bad again. Over the last Semester I were barely able to pull myself out of bed. I went to lectures, but that was pretty much all I could do. The rest of the time I spent in bed watching something on my conputer. I feel like a lazy loser who cannot get their shit together, but even showering is hard sometimes. If I don't have to go out, I mostly don't do it. I tried out online consultation, but where I live they courses and the only one my insurance would pay for did not help at all (it also was only for 12 weeks). I did not feel better at all after that. In those 12 weeks I also started dressing more muted (I used to war statement shirts proudly, had Nintendo legging I wore whenever they were clean, etc.), dyed my hair Brown from having them in bright colours since 2015 (blue, green, pink; name it, I wore it) and I took out most of my piercings. The piercings came last. The last straw for that was my grandmother, who, on christmas, did not even say hello to me but said she still could not stand to see my septum piercing.

My doctor checked my blood a few weeks after she first prescribed me my meds and said my values were fine, so I went back again to complain about my other symptoms that just got worse and not better. Then only she gave me the adress for a psychological consultation center. They had a 5-6 week waiting period but over Christmas it was more like 8 weeks. So by then I had already gone on for 6 months at the lowest I ever felt. I just want to be in bed all day and feel so, so guilty for pulling my family into this, since I spend basically all my time off with them. 

I had my consultation with the center last week, but as I said, they only do consultations, which is more of a short term solution. But with that woman I felt understood for the first time. In those 45min I was able to cry and she actually came up with a game plan on what I could do to get a long term fix for what I feel. She gave me whole printed out pages with psychiatrists and said one of them offered emergeny appointments in the mornings (that was not what the receptionist told me, but I got a cancellation spot on Feb. 24, which is far better than the 6 months waiting list). I also have a follow up Appointment with the woman from the center.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know where I was going with this, so I will just stop right here. 

If you have the time and energy, maybe you could leave some kind words or encouragement. I don't know if I deserve it, because I feel like an imposter most of the time, like I am a whiny white girl complaining about her o so bad life. 

So, yeah. Sorry for the rant."
785,I miss my dad...,"Nothing happened to him or anything, I just really miss him. He is the calmest person I know, he has this pleasantly soothing voice that can make anything better. I've never heard him yell or watch him get angry out of spite, and he's just who I've always wanted to be.
I miss his blanket of calm. I miss having someone who actually cares about me and my mental health enough to check in. I miss being loved by him just as I am, regardless of what I do or what other people will see of me. I miss just being in his presence and knowing that I don't have to worry about anything when I'm around him.
I'm in a whole other continent, studying a course that stresses me out, and alone. And I just really miss him right now."
786,RAPID mood changes,"I’m a 25 year Old male for the record. 

Every single day, I’ll be sitting at work, or wherever, thinking. I’m always thinking. My thoughts alternate between “Wow, I’m doing great, my life is headed down a great path” (it feels like a warm blanket is wrapped around me and everything is great) and “oh my god I’m worthless and I don’t know what I’m doing with my life” (existential panic).

When I say my thoughts alternate, I mean in seconds to minutes, not days or even hours. 

I’m on medication for anxiety already (lexapro) and ADHD (adderall, which I genuinely need), I Exercise heavily, eat healthy, I don’t drink or anything. 

I can’t seem to figure out what is causing these feelings. Have you experienced something similar before? What did you do? Its so stressful to be constantly on edge going between panic and relaxation all day."
787,There's no problems but my brain has enough anxiety for 20 people.,"I took a short break just staying at home a couple days, and that was obviously a mistake. The moment I went to a public place it was like walking into a hurricane. It was so hard to keep my jaw from shaking. Eventually it became numb. Every time I lost concentration I could feel my body getting ready to flail around like a drug addict in withdrawal. This is the worst it's ever been. I can only imagine what drinking a coffee would be like. This feels more like a medical condition than a simple problem of anxiety."
788,I'm in pain,"Hi friend,  


I'm a neurotypical..recently my life has turned out for the worse.... a year ago my brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It has been a tough year. My girlfriend helped me a lot in hard times but she has BPD and can have uncontrollable anger in which she can say horrible things (not against me, but they're scary).  I don't know what to do anymore, I've been crying all day and dreading a future where my kids might get that disease or that she might lash out at them or even worse, act on the things she says in her episodes. I don't want to lose my future with her she is lovely and kind..what do I do? I feel like i want to die, i'm not suicidal i just dread my current existence"

Currently im a medical marijuana patient.  However, smoking doesnt take the pain away as much as u may think it does.  The pain patches only do so much.

Can anyone help assist me further on what I should do?"

791,[Help] What to do with my life and how to be happy...,"Greetings fellow redditors. 

I have a small issue and seeking for help. 

Well, let's begin with a small description of myself. I am quite young (23 atm), finished my bachelor studies and currently looking forward to finishing my masters, both of them in finance. Last year I passed CFA lvl1. I would characterise myself as being a cheerful person, hard working, always there to help others, partially perfectionist, and sometimes an introvert. I have a really good job, have my wedding already set up, a place to live, something to strive for. 

However, even if all aforementioned seems as the description of a happy man, recently I am quite lost in my thoughts, I always doubt that I am happy, and if I chose the correct path in life, career wise. When I am in public I would say that I have a mask and all my friends even my close relatives think I am the happiest and most realised person. The only person that knows my struggle is my fiancee.

I tried to diagnose myself, but did not fully succeed, I identified some culprits on my side, which I do not know how to get rid of. I compare myself with people around me, and I see them as being happy, more realized, finding their dream job, while seeing myself as really unhappy. I am lost on what I want to do with my life, and I sometimes feel that I am wasting precious time of my life by not getting better or by not having an impact in this world. I partially like what I am doing at the moment, however I am 100% sure that this is not what will make me get up with pleasure for a new day in 1 year from now. I want to get better and I do stuff just to prove myself that I can succeed, this being sometimes my primary motivation. This year I am thinking of taking CFA lvl2, and my motivation is that I want to prove that I can do it and I would see the time studying for it, not as being lost.

I just do not know where to go from this point on, and especially the part with me seeing myself unhappy, has a really big impact on my mental health. I would say that I started being depressive, and even sometimes I went to the extent of drowning my issues in alcohol, which I know is a really bad habit, and thanks to my fiancee I don't do that anymore.

My fiancee recommended I see a psychotherapist, but I went once and didn't have a good experience, so I have doubts, in addition to this, I was raised in a way, that men should take care of their problems by themselves (at the moment my perception changed, no matter the gender, we all have issues which we cannot solve by ourselves).

Any advice you might have, is more than welcome!"
792,I'm such a cold person that it's starting to scare me.,"I seem to be detached from normal emotion to some degree. My attachments to people are almost entirely pragmatic. I'm absolutely certain that I could cut out anyone from my life, and wouldn't really miss them. My relationships are usually fairly surface-level, and I move on almost immediately after a breakup, even if I thought I was in love. I've lost four grandparents and lost a close friend to suicide, and felt very little in response to any of those (aside from feeling guilty and paranoid that I'd played a part in her suicide by having drifted apart from her a year before she died). I have never killed an animal, but I'm not really sad if an animal dies. I don't understand the point of pets in general, they just seem like a financial burden that constantly demands attention.

I'd never intentionally hurt anybody, but I seem to have an issue with emotional attachment to people. I experience empathy, but only seemingly from a logical perspective. The end result is good enough, I guess, since I come across as a relatively successful person who tries to be kind to others. But sometimes I don't feel like a normal human being. 

One thing that might play a part is my self-esteem. It seems to oscillate from very high to very low, and I tend to hold myself to impossible standards. I'm constantly focused on either self-improvement or beating myself up for not meeting my standards. It could get in the way of emotional attachment to others, but that seems like a pretty dubious link to me. Does anyone have any insight on what might be happening, and how I could possibly fix the issue? Thanks. 

This isn't an alt account, so I'll be deleting this in a few hours, just fyi."
793,What’s wrong with me? Am I crazy?,"
I’d like to start off by saying this is going to be a long post. There are several things I am concerned/confused about. First, ever since I was a child I’ve gotten this feeling like someone or something is watching/following me and intends to kill or harm me and I’ll get the chills and very strong anxiety. It has never been a huge issue, more like an annoyance especially recently since I got a new job in a wastewater plant working nights. It’s not always a person that I’m afraid is following me but sometimes a “creature”.  I don’t always believe they are following me or mean me harm but sometimes I just think people are watching me and judging me, either negatively or that they want to have sex with me or even be me. Now the second thing. Ive always had trouble processing my emotions. I can feel very “excited” about something good but it just won’t come out physically. And I’ve always felt all of my emotions are extreme, if something happens that would be a minor aggravation for most it usually makes me extremely angry. Same for the good emotions too. If I am happy it’s like my happiness is so extreme it’s going to make me explode, or if I love something or someone it’s the same way, EXTREMELY strong like the feeling is so intense that it’s trying to get out but can’t. I tend to over exaggerate my place in people’s lives because of this as well. Any advice or opinions would be great!!"

795,First appointment tomorrow,"I have my first therapy appointment tomorrow and I’m terrified that I’m not going to have anything to talk about. I’ve spent four years wanting to get counseling but now that it’s finally happening, I’m scared that there’s not actually anything wrong with me and I’ve just been faking it, even to myself. What if they think there’s nothing wrong with me at all and I’m wasting their time? The spiraling is brutal. 

Sorry, just had to rant."
796,Don't mind me; I'm just venting---,"~~just need to get this off my chest~~

I've known that something has been ""off"" (if you will) with me for about two years now. I have very little self-esteem, attach my worth to what other think of me, and have social anxiety so bad it's become a major issue; ex I can't talk to teachers for help/go get materials needed to complete an assignment.

In December of last year I finally, finally came to my mother and told her that I needed to see a therapist and that it wasn't up for debate. Since then, I feel like she's trying to stop me. 

She's ""read"" articles online about how me spending so much time on my computer has made me have social anxiety, but says she can't re-find these articles to let me read them. She constantly makes me want to ""rethink"" why I ""feel like I have issues"". She keeps indirectly claiming that the only reason I feel like I have issues is because my friends also have issues. She has suggested that I was suggested that I might have social anxiety and that's why I think I have it. She's also pulled the ""just get over it"" card.

I'm just really frustrated because I've been told that I should not be afraid to seek help, but when I do I get this. 

Thanks for reading- praying that you're having a better day."

I got kicked out of my school for being very mean and disrespectful, I went to another school for a year and did really well there no trouble at all. They suggested I should go back to my home town school and I liked the idea with being back with my friends so I said yes and got back to my home town school, the first 2 of months we're good but then I started getting very mad at my special Ed teacher, I forgot to mention that I have severe anxiety and Asperger's. But back on topic I didn't like my special Ed teacher and I keep on getting in trouble. Im about to have a angry outburst one of these days and walk out of the school and I don't know what to do, my grandma threatened to kick me out the house and put me into the system and be put in to a pysch ward, ive been to one before when I got kicked out of school and it went horrible I had a bunch of angry outburst and got restrained about 12 times during a 3 weeks period, I broke 2 metal heaters cutting my foot and sock open and hit staff. It didn't help at all maybe made stuff worse. I'm just trying to get some suggestions for what I should do"

I create people. not as in OC's or Personalities that I take on, but rather people. as in I will make multiple social media accounts for that one person and pretend to be them, sometimes going into detail and even intertwining them with my own life. this usually happens in my manic episodes and I currently have 4 characters that are active. more that are not. I'm going to the doctors on the 7th and will tell them everything. however, I do live in Russia and psychology is deemed taboo here. any advice would be welcome"

But for real, when people pour out responses to you in support, give tidbits (even if they don’t work for you), make you feel less alone just because they respond..... Please respond to them in some way. 

While you’re putting yourself out there in your post, they are putting themselves out there in their response. We all need to see the give and take more often. Some level of acknowledgement is just sort of, well, I don’t know...kind?"
803,My friend is actively suicidal but I'm also severely depressed and I don't know what to do,"I love my friend dearly and they're like a sibling to me, but I just don't know what to do. They've struggled with mental health problems since they were young and, as far as I know, they have attempted multiple times in the past 5 years. I've only known them for two years, but they're very dear to me. The only problem is I just... don't know how to handle it. 

I have my own set of mental health problems from depression to a personality disorder, and while I truly want to help them and I don't know how I would live with myself if they killed themselves, its beginning to be too much. I've been on the verge of a breakdown for the past three weeks (to the point where I gave myself an intestinal problems), but I have no reason to be like this. My home life is normal, I have a therapist I routinely see, and I'm on medication. On the other hand, my friend has basically had their dreams crushed and burned right in front of them, on top of already existing trauma. They already had a severely rough childhood and I'm one of the few people who knows the details about it, so there's already some pressure on me. They snap at me sometimes but apologize immediately after, and routinely deny anything positive I say about them or a future that involves them.

I want to be their friend. I want to support them. I love them very much! I'm just too mentally unstable myself to be able to balance their issues on top of mine. How do I put some distance between us/express to them that I can't hand it without making it seem like I don't care about them?"
804,"[Serious] My mom needs therapy, and I am under 18. How do I get our family to a family therapist?","**I would like to preface this by saying that she is an extremely caring mother, and loves me to this day. I  live with a foster sister, and her and I both suffer from mental illness, along with my dad. I am an only child. We live in Canada.**

My mom doesn't know when to stop pushing her point. It has gotten to the point where our house is becoming rather dysfunctional due to the daily arguments, and the meltdowns that it causes me to have. The issue has been going on for about three and a half years now. 

Through all my years in therapy, I have learned important strategies for stressful situations (I have Aspergers, ADHD, and GAD), and use a few main coping mechanisms in such situations that involve other people. Mainly,

1. Asking the person doing the thing that is causing me anxiety/stress to stop,
2. Exiting the stressful situation,
3. Asking the person politely to speak in a respectful tone, and
4. Doing my best to listen to the person and be reasonable with them.

The problem is, none of these work with my mom. It often starts off like this; she comes to me asking about some non-specific thing and interrupts whatever I am doing. I don't respond, as I am pre-occupied, and she asks again. Most of the time, I give her a response along the range of *""sure""* or, *""no thanks""* but it's the more complex questions that cause a problem. She comes up to me and says something, and then asks if I understand. I say I do, and she says *""what was it that I said?"".* I tell her there is no need to ask that. Generally, her response to this is to repeat the initial request over and over again and cut me off when I try to respond. When I finally get frustrated and tell her to stop, she tells me not to say that, and continues, often until I am so stressed I have to leave the situation.

The other instance is when she comes right up to me and was already mad about something earlier. She begins to yell about how I haven't done something right, or how I need to do something *immediately,* and when I tell her we should discuss it when both of us are calmer, she gets blooming mad. I have to drop whatever I am doing to deal with this situation, often having to interrupt conversations with friends or stop doing homework to cave to her. *These outbursts are often about homework.* She continues until I am in a ball crying on the floor because I have no idea how to deal with the stress.

Finally, the last situation is a bit more simple. She gets mad at me when I tell a lie, but when I tell her the truth and she doesn't like it, she takes it out on me. She may have been upset earlier in the day, and that most likely means she will apply that anger/frustration to every situation following that. IF something upset her earlier, she will harbour that feeling for the rest of the day, whether she looks happy or not. Anything can set her off, and her triggers vary from day-to-day. If she does something nice, she expects you to like it. If you don't, she gets angry. If you say something she doesn't like, she gets angry. If you don't greet her when you walk in the door, she gets angry. It's little things that set her off. 

The worst part is when I try to discuss thins in a rational way. She instantly gets worked up when you try to discuss a situation that has previously upset her, either cutting you off every time you try to talk to her, or simply refusing to talk to you. I really don't know what to do at this point, because she will push her point until you cry, and then come and push it some more.

Today I had trouble getting out of bed, and she used that as justification for getting mad at me about me postponing my physics work by an hour. Later, she interrupted dad and I watching tv to ask if the cookies she made the day before were any good, and when I said no, she repeated something along the lines of: ""I can't just bake things one day and have you like them, to have you not like them the next day,"" to which I replied: ""I'm sorry, but I just don't like them"". She repeated this phrase about 5 times before starting to say that she isn't a maid, and wasn't my servant. When I told her that I didn't think she was listening to what I was saying, she threw the dishes on the floor, breaking them. My dad had to clean them up.

I don't know what to do here. I'm 16, and my mom doesn't listen to me unless she likes what I am saying. I can't seem to get her to go to therapy, and she seems to think the problem entirely lies on me. We are with a family program, and a behavioural contract was made, one that she frequently violates without consequence and punishes me for not following. If I were to go to court and request that they mandate therapy, CFS would put my foster sister in another home (we are extremely close, and both her and it is best for us to stay in a place that is familiar to us). My mom has helped fight my sister's case in court and helped both of us get therapy, but I feel it is time for me to return the favour. She cares for us both deeply, but she needs help.  


TL;DR,  
How do I get my mom, who is very unstable, to seek therapy without having her arrested or having the court mandate it? (As such a thing would cause my foster sister to be relocated to a different home.)"

808,Family doctors &amp; ADHD,"Hi guys,

We are located in Canada.

My bf has been having a bit of a crisis lately with an intense school program and he’s on the brink of a breakdown. He’s been panicking a lot, can’t sleep, and can’t focus. This intense program has finally been a push for wanting to go on medication for ADHD which he’s believed he’s had for a very long time. He also suffers from depression and anxiety. He’s never gotten proper medical attention because he grew up on a reserve.

We went to a walk in clinic and they referred us to a psychiatrist 3 months ago. Still waiting. We went to the AAC (a facility at the hospital) yesterday and they said they can’t treat ADHD. They gave us a form to have a doctor fill out to refer him to an ADHD clinic. When the doctor was filling out the referral he did not seem very hopeful that that process would be quick either. He prescribed him a low dose of antidepressants in the meantime. All doctors have said it sounds like he’s suffering from ADHD and anxiety.

By some act of God, a family doctor is available and he has an apt tomorrow. I need to know, do family doctors have the ability to prescribe/ treat medication for ADHD?????? At this point, it seems like only god can."

FUCK it hurts, I always forget how much BC helps with my cramps until I forget to refill it. Now I'm severely depressed AND I got my bitchass period yay!!!

Fuck everything"
812,I'm scared my dad will see me differently if I'm bipolar,"Next month, I have to go for testing in a hospital to see if I have bipolar disorder. I'm scared that if I have it, my dad will see me differently. He was severely abused physically, mentally, verbally, and emotionally, by his father, and mother.

 His mother was bipolar**(she refused to take medication)**, and she was an alcoholic, she would have fits of manic filled episodes for a month, but then would get depressed for a month, she couldn't even leave her bed, she unfortunately committed suicide in the late 90s. 

I've been getting weird fits of rage, and manic anger for the past couple of months, but then I suddenly get depressed for a month, I haven't felt happy in a long time. My therapist suggested to my mom I get tested for bipolar disorder, and my heart dropped. We told my dad, and I explained to him what's been happening to my mood, he just said blankly, "" That sounds like my mother. She was like that too."". I could see tears building up in his eyes. I have nothing against people with bipolar disorder, I'm just scared, and afraid that my dad is going to think I'm just like his mother now, that I'll be violent towards him, or want to kill myself.

816,"First time, ever, really venting.","Hi, I’ve never put myself out there publicly like this, but I feel as though there is no time like the present. It’s a long read, but writing it was cathartic and I needed to challenge myself to express this, so here goes.

I’m 25 years old. I am a Canadian PhD student at a Canadian university studying sociology. I am writing this because I need to know who I am - some days I feel as though I am inhabiting a body with machinations beyond my control. Some days I feel as though I am disengaged with reality, as if I was external to my own existence - a brain disconnected from its host. In these moments, I perceive the world around as strange and foreign, even more so, I perceive myself as strange and foreign. Some days I look at myself and hate everything I see. Some days I think about myself and hate everything I am. Because of this, I dissociate myself from people - from fear that they might see my secret, that I truly am nothing. I have difficulties functioning through basic interactions with people, some times I feel my heart racing, others I feel my face turning flush, others I begin to sweat, others it’s a combination of the three. I’m beginning to worry, quite possibly for the first time, or maybe it’s that I’m beginning to become cognizant of the fact that I’m not living life. I’m constantly grasping onto the next moment, the next moment of life and hoping that it doesn’t slip through my fingers. I am quite adept at sabotaging my self in personal relationships through misguided and chaotic actions. I’ve long wondered - am I stupid? do I lack emotional intelligence? Perhaps, but I think it comes from a place of fear. If I fail people, I no longer have to live to expectations and it is those things that I’m most fearful of. Expectations, whether perceived, tangible, or even non-existent have managed to paralyze me entire life.

When I was younger, before I was a teenager, my parents were yet to be divorced. Their relationship felt, for as long as I can remember, untenable. We did not have significant financial means and that burdened their relationship significantly. My father was, or is, an alcoholic who tried to give love but doesn’t understand how to. My mother is quiet, reserved, shy, and not assertive. My father was emotionally abusive and emotionally neglectful to myself and my sister, and likewise to my mother, in addition to being physically abusive to her (I don’t believe he was physically abusive to me from what I remember). When I was 11, my sister, 15 at the time, accused my father of sexually abusing her. Eventually, these allegations were unsubstantiated, although I harbor some doubts as does my mother - something that my family has not addressed in a meaningful way since that period. Around the same period of time, my sister began experimenting with drugs (pot, ecstasy, cocaine) and alcohol. My mother enabled this behavior from what I presume was a refusal to set boundaries out of fear of rebellion/confrontation/pushing my sister away. The summer following Grade 6, my mother began allowing my sister to throw parties while my father was working night shifts. As an 11-year old born to an alcoholic father, the alcohol was not new. My father at this time increasingly withdrew from family life and his drinking intensified. I do not remember speaking to my father a lot during this period of time. At this time, however, I was being exposed to drugs which led to great internal stress. Do I tell my father what is happening and betray my mother and sister? Or do I keep quiet and just try make the best of a troubling situation? I chose the latter.

The truth is inevitable. My father came home early one night from work to a house full of young teenagers, drunk and stoned. That night I had a friend over. We spent the night in my room playing video games, or outside skateboarding. At one point, two people entered my room and began doing cocaine. I was awoken that morning to my father pulling me, and my friend out of bed. He dropped my friend off at his house, and took me to the police station where I was told to give my version of the night’s events. One minute I was sleeping, the next I was giving a statement indicating - through all intents and purposes - that my mother was a bad person. We stayed at my aunt’s apartment for a week before we found a one bedroom apartment.

In the months and years that followed, I was told by my father that I could not communicate with my mother. Initially, my mother would visit me after school and pick me up in her car. We would sit and talk about my day. I cherish these moments deeply, despite the circumstances. My father would eventually find out and incessantly yell at me - being sure to belittle my mother, and speak horribly of her, as if she had committed crimes against humanity. To be fair, it’s not as if my mother was speaking beautifully of my father. But I followed along with my father’s wishes because I just wanted the yelling to stop. I wanted the hours long marathon interrogations to stop. I just wanted to breathe. I just wanted to see my mother. Soon after she would wait for me in the same spot outside of my school, and I felt compelled to walk past her as if she didn’t exist. As if my own mother didn’t exist to me. I feel guilt to this day about doing that, about being passive, about just holding onto life. Our relationship has never been the same since, there hasn’t been the same level of communication and I wish every day that there was. I was similarly barred from seeing my sister and there has also been a strain on that relationship too - something I wish would have changed. I wish I would have been strong enough to fight back, I wish I would have said something, but I felt compelled to meet my father’s expectations.

While some of these non-legal restrictions would ease over time, the damage was done. I moved through my teenage years perhaps unremarkably. I wasn’t the smartest, I wasn’t overly out-going, I wasn’t ambitious, I was just kind of.. there. But I had always found solace in sport. I marginally excelled at hockey. Again though, expectations took a toll. My father always pushed me to be the best, while there are virtues in hard work, this tested me. If I played a game in which my father felt as though I hadn’t matched his expectations, an hour long existential conversation would ensue. “Why do I even bother paying for this shit? You’re being lazy and you’re making me look like a joke. I’m not going to be made a fool.” I would begin crying. “Quit fucking crying, stop acting like a baby, speak up when you’re talking to me.” If it didn’t manifest in verbal abuse, it manifested in silence - deafening silence for days. I was made to feel as though I was nothing. This eventually leached into discussions of school/grades. It reached a point where my identity became reaching the expectations of my father. 

At this time, age 14, I began dating a girl for the first time. This was a largely positive experience that taught me about love and compassion. But my father had extreme prejudice against her - assuming that she was planting ideas in my head of abandoning sport, something “we” had been working on together. He despised her, and this became another source of frustration. He felt I was being emotionally manipulated by her. Interrogations would follow suit any time a discussion of her came about. Imagine being in love for the first time, and your father, who you want to share this person with refuses to acknowledge her.

Eventually I would attend university with this girl, and move away from my hometown. My mother, supportive of this relationship, would financially support my educational pursuits. My father refused to do so to spite what he felt was a sham of a relationship. While I would spend the summers at home, at the age of 19 - or the summer of 2014, I would move out of my father’s home following repetitive struggles over my relationship. To this day, I’m not entirely sure what it was even about. This relationship would last until the age of 20.

What I am beginning to acknowledge now, is that those nights I was yelled at, those nights I was insulted, those nights I was threatened, those nights of dealing with a drunken man have taken a considerable toll on me. They have made me feel small, and weak my entire life. They have shifted my existence to one of expectations that have spiraled into every aspect of my life, and burden me with a terrible grief; a terrible, looming feeling of destruction wrapped in self-doubt. To that extent, I poorly receive compliments - they feel empty to me. Criticism is everything to me. I meticulously examine my face and body every day for imperfections. I over-analyze the sparse social interactions I do have. I used to vomit before engaging in any form of social performance where I felt unease. I turn to alcohol to meaningfully engage with people. I am impulsive and do things I regret, not because I don’t understand they’re wrong, but because they provide me with a sense of validation that maybe there is a reality to me; that maybe I do exist. But, I fail to truly live in these actions. They are temporary fixes to underlying structural issues that plague me. It’s gotten to the point where perhaps I’m wondering how do I live without the expectations of others? How do I live as an independent self? If no one can validate me, how do I validate me when I don’t know who I am? When it’s possible that there has never truly been an I.

It extends beyond finding hobbies, or doing group activities. I can’t expect to be a person by identifying what it is that I do, I want to identify what it is that I am. At this point, I wouldn’t call myself suicidal. Although I will admit I have had some degree of suicidal ideations after deeply ruminating these existential questions. That isn’t to say currently, but previously I have had these thoughts. I believe they’ve come from a place of personal hatred. Hatred for allowing myself to be manipulated for so long; hatred for being passive; hatred for never developing separate from that environment; hatred for being nothing. I’m not trying to say that I want to publicly adored by others, or leave a lasting mark, i just want to be something that I can point to that’s independent of others. I want to abandon these crippling feelings of self-doubt. I want to jump into the pool. I want to laugh around people. I want to talk to people about their day. I want to tell people about mine. I want to share experiences with people. I want to leave my room.

I’m terrified that I’ll let this slip away. That tomorrow I’ll return to the same numbness because it is comforting. That I won’t live. Rather than just barely holding on, I want to live. I just want to be. I’m tired of my mind spacing out and being an observer of everything, I want to be active. I want to feel everything.

I needed to write this out as this is something I’ve never fully attempted to grapple with. I’ve recently booked an appointment with a counselor at university. I have never been diagnosed with any mental disorders, but things have never felt right for me. Perhaps to no surprise I have never attempted to discuss these issues in any sort of depth because I felt as though perhaps I was making a mountain out of a molehill, or that I couldn’t burden already busy people with issues that have felt personal. The reason for now is that I began to have what I presume was an anxiety/panic attack for the first time last week, and it forced me to truly consider what the root causes of this feeling might be. So here I am."
817,What were the first few days on antidepressants like for you?,"So I just got put on antidepressants by my psychiatrist. He gave me details on how to take them and sent me to the pharmacy with your classic prescription written in some sort of runic language only doctors understand. I took them as he asked the first time, half a pill of one type at night, one pill of the other type in the morning. He did warn me that there were going to be side effects such as drowsiness, loss of appetite, etc. but holy shit I didn't expect it to be so much. 

I felt extremely tired about an hour after taking the antidepressant and didn't know where it came from. Insert me falling asleep at 1am after weeks of not being able to sleep. It was weird, but pleasant to have fallen asleep. Until I woke up, or until a family member woke me up. I felt dead. Fatigue, dizziness, it was kinda like a high caused by deliriants (which I experienced slightly once after an accidental small pheramine overdose). 

It was 10am and my grandmother was asking me to take my other pill and get out of bed. I took the pill and lay back down, absolutely ignoring the breakfast she gave me. I was just not hungry, more so than usual. Everyone's already concerned I'm falling back into my ED again so of course she tried to convince me to eat it, but since a few months ago I'm genuinely just not hungry, food has lost its appeal even though I'm not trying to lose weight anymore, this time it was worse.

I fell back asleep and after a few times of being woken up and yelling at people who tried to get me out of bed I woke up again, confused at a very vivid and realistic dream and barely remembering the other times I woke up. 2pm. I had slept for 13 hours and was still tired as all hell. I got changed into some comfortable casual clothes, and the mere action of getting dressed was so tiring I had to lay back down for another hour.

The whole day I felt kinda drugged up, now it's 4.30am, I fell asleep at 10pm and woke up two hours ago but it certainly feels shorter than that. I'm fatigued, drowsy, dizzy and generally feel kinda shitty and disassociated from my emotions. This all feels fever-dreamish.

Is this normal?"
818,I get really upset and my thoughts scare me.,"I have anger issues. I've never been diagnosed with anything except for Aspergers syndrome, but I really worry about what I think when I get upset.

It's like my personality just sort of switches and I become a nasty, hateful human being. I think about abusing people and animals both verbally and physically, I suddenly don't care about the wellbeing and problems of other people. Countless intrusive thoughts of hurting people I care about or even innocent strangers who rub me the wrong way. The worst part is that when I calm down I feel absolutely horrible over what I thought and I make myself sick and sad about it. ""What is wrong with you? Why did you think that?"" are things that often come up in my mind after I get over whatever upset me.

The worst part is it comes out of nowhere. I get upset by something irrelevant and just lose it. It's like a switch is flipped and I become a monster."
819,Getting worse instead of better,I’m not even staying at the same amount of wellness I’m just getting worse and worse  please let a truck crash into my car
820,Normal for depression?,"I have a friend who suffers from depression and I'm having a hard time understanding it and not taking it personally. When he's in a depressive episode, he withdraws and wants to be left alone for weeks or even a month or more. I tell him I'm here if he wants to talk or needs anything, but he says he really just wants space and for me to not text and let him come to me. I'm trying to respect it, but it's hard. Is this normal for depression? Not having gone through it myself, it's hard to wrap my head around."
821,I don't know who I am and it's bothering me,"I've always felt this way, but I'm at a point in my life where it's like I don't know who I am, I don't know what I like, I don't know how to describe myself, and I don't know my personality. I'm trying my best to go out there and find my interest but I feel like something is holding me back. I'm a F19 and I feel like I have to move out of my mom's place to just truly feel free and independent. My mother is overprotective, she has unnecessary rules, and she won't let me do anything bc I'm under her roof. She literally told me if I get a nose pierced her and I can no longer stay under the same roof and it bothers me bc I guess I want to make my own decisions bc I'm always doing what she wants. I feel like sometimes she plays a big part of it bc I'm afraid to see her reaction bc I know it's going to be negative and it's draining me. Planning on saving up and moving when I turn 20"
822,Why can’t I be happy.,"I try to be happy and I show that to others. I try my absolute hardest to make my life enjoyable, but I can’t. I’m not in a bad situation in my life. I have loving parents/family. I have people I can talk to and socialize with, but underlying all that is this pain. This feeling my life is worthless. I don’t have anything to be sad about or any reason to think I’m worth nothing and I’ve been told that. That my life is good but if my life is so good why can’t I feel it. Why do I think about killing myself on a daily. There has to be a reason more than depression right? Or am I overthinking shit again. Even with my meds I feel like this isn’t getting better. My other stuff is less noticeable but this, this is in full effect still. I just want to be happy, just once."
823,Currently feeling mildly depressed and confused,"I've always viewed myself as a happy person without any of the mental health issues that many of my peers seem to suffer from. I now realize this was an overly optimistic and naive thing to believe. Recently, people have been spreading rumors about me. And they aren't typical playground rumors either... It's gotten to a point where I get anxiety from being in the same room as people who I think have heard these rumors. I don't feel comfortable anymore. This period of my life has really made me question the state of my mental health. I feel like I have a strong ability to ignore and block-off things that are troubling and I'm not sure if my behavior is healthy. I'm not clinically depressed, but I feel like if I continue feeling like this for extended periods of time (it's already been half a year), I'll start to develop severe mental issues :(. 

 I used to think that people were being overly dramatic when they said drama was suffocating, and that ignoring rumors would actually work. Now, I know that's not true. The anxiety and humiliation is causing me so much stress... and I'm trying to just focus on other, more important things in my life.

If anyone has any advice, please tell me. Does telling yourself that rumors are unimportant work? Does telling yourself that it doesn't matter what people in this stage of your life think of you work? How can I improve my mental health?"
824,Just realised that I've not physically come in contact with a human being for more than a decade now.....i don't have any memory of being hugged/caressed while growing up.,"So am i actually missing out on something very crucial? I'm 19 and literally haven't come in contact with another person...people talk about how they haven't been hugged for months, makes me wonder, is that actually a necessity for humans? Because not having any sort of skin to skin contact is very normal to me..."
825,Too much needless anxiety and frustration leading into paranoia.,"Just need to vent, really. I'm sure there's no solution. If you read my ramblings, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Driving drives me nuts. I'm horrible at parking and being able to gauge between two cars. I always panic about not having enough room to the right side of me and that I'll somehow hit something next to me (even though I never have/will). My driving test only focused on parallel parking, the most uncommon and (in most cases) most useless method. I don't want to take the bus to/from work again because that's such a large waste of time and I know if I move, I will need to be able to have motor transportation on the ready. I caved and spent money on traffic cones so I could go to a lot and just practice on my own when I get time. Sounds silly, but family/friends wouldn't teach me, and hiring a driving instructor isn't cheap (though the one I had before I got my license was great). 

&amp;#x200B;

I get irrational paranoid thoughts every time I do just about anything, that I did something wrong or someone's out to tell on me for something. Even when I joke around with colleagues/friends or try to chat with them, at the end of the conversation I will walk away and for some reason feel like I burdened the other person or I said something that could've made them respond different from what I was anticipating. It almost makes me not want to chat with anyone even though ironically I struggle with loneliness. It's like I'm being pulled on both arms in opposite directions.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to quit my therapy too. I feel like I'm just dumping money every few weeks talking about the same cyclical stuff. It helped since I started but right now it's just at a lull and I need/want a break. I discussed a few other things (such as memory issues) but if it's not anxiety-related, it goes nowhere. Ugh."
826,Psychiatrist appointment,So I got a referral to a psychiatrist from my doctor and they called me Monday to make an appointment and I still haven’t called back. I’m super terrified of going and I really don’t know what to expect. It doesn’t help that the psychiatrist is also male and I have a hard time around them. I guess I was just wondering what to expect and what everyone else’s first time was like. I’m not sure whether or not to call them back.
827,What do I have? Any ideas of an illness that fits this description are appreciated. I am searching for things to research before I talk to my psychiatrist.,"I have a grouping of other people who live in my head. They live in their own elaborate world with it's own government, religion, etc. They dont communicate directly to me using words or conversations. But often I can get a sense of their opinion by feeling out their emotions when I need advice or comfort. Usually i interact with them by going to their world inside my mind and becoming them for awhile. I just sort of step into them and their lives. While this happens I talk to myself, make faces, and lose track of time. I have some memory loss and I have trouble remembering things in general. But I always remember everything about their lives. They just sort of live in their own world, doing their own thing and I visit about 4 times a day since I was a child. Sometimes to watch, sometimes to step in and become them for awhile. They never give instructions or communicate with me about my world directly. Any ideas about something that could encompass this are appreciated."
828,not excited for future,"I am a 16 year old male whom lives in a rural northern community. I get high 90\`s to low 70's, have a fair amount of savings, a fair chance to get into to university, and a decent RESP. Even with all this going for my future, I dont feel any real excitement for it. All I see is a bunch of my opprotunities going away in terms of youth programs,  worsening political, socioeconomical, and environmental conditions, debt, and isolation going forward. Not to mention losing contact with most of, if not all of, the friends I have currently in high school. I am also worried if I will be able to cut it in university and a real job. I feel as if I have wasted a good chunk of the time I have as a child to really enjoy life and do things I will probably never get to do again. I am worried about how many people I have missed my chance to be a kid with. And with my parents situation I feel even worse. I dont want them to be lonely, and I am not sure about the quality of their pensions, and how they will deal with things if they get sick. I guess I am just looking for someone who can sincerely say that it will be okay."
829,Conditions like Body Dysmorphia?,"What's it called when you look in the mirror and don't see what others tell you they see? I thought it was body dysmorphia, but my research shows that to be when ""you can't stop thinking about one or more perceived defects in your appearance."" That's kind of close but not exactly what I'm thinking of. Any thoughts?"
830,"I'm a victim of cyber bullying and I'm becoming more and more suicidal, please help me","So I am in desperate need of help. I got falsely accused of a crime. Someone online from yahoo answers found out my phone number and address and used some kind of spoofing app and called in a bomb threat to a local gas station in my area and made my number pop up. The police came and arrested me on charges of ""making a bomb threat, falsifying information about a destructive device used to cause harm or death"". I've tried reaching out asking for legal advice and this one troll named AJ keeps on stalking me and harassing me. She framed me as a troll also too online. She makes me want to commit suicide because of all the nasty stuff she said to me. I have a fiancee who I am engaged to in my native country and my wedding is next year and now I don't know what the fate of my wedding is now. I'm extremely worried about being on the no fly list. I have a suspicion that she was the one who did this and framed me for it in an attempt to ruin my life. She makes me look bad online and calls me an unemployed bum when I have a job. I am a personal banker. How come people like her take joy out of doing this ?? How come she won't leave me alone and keeps on stalking me wherever I go online ? Am I really on the no fly list automatically after my arrest ? How can I stop her from doing all of this to me ?? I really am confident that she is the one who did the prank call and framed me for it."
831,Do I have OCD or borderline OCD?,I've always had rituals/compulsions. When I was little I started paying attention to the positions the cracks on the sidewalk hit my feet. If the left had a crack hit my toes then the same had to happen to the right. If there was a big one on the right I had to get two little ones on the left. Lately it has progressed to many other things. I hope it's ok to list them off (haha). Pens being open or clicked to the open position must be closed. Spelling or grammatical errors must be corrected. Any calculation someone says has to be fact checked (I don't leave it alone until they understand what was wrong). When someone points out any detail and isn't 100% correct I must explain the right way (I spent 5 minutes showing my coworker that a cartoon phone in a meme only had the numbers 1 to 6). There are more that aren't as interesting. The compulsions only last 30 minutes max because I can easily fix them. It just drives me insane that i don't have a diagnosis. And I can't go to my doctor because I'm already on antidepressants/anxiety meds and I don't want to seem like a basket case. Ugh.
832,Clinging unto false promises," A few months back, we recently moved into a new state where I began my freshman year. I’ve felt terrible these past few weeks as I’ve slowly come to realize that I’m most likely never going to get to go back home again. The school environment I’m in is filled with drug addicts or well-off athletes that really don’t share a common personality with me. Even though I’d been suggested by my counselor to join my previous athletic programs, I’ve seem to have lost the motivation to further my extent in sports. My grades are gradually lowering and every other day seems to be getting more worse.

 I’ve moved around my whole life, yet this one feels really unfair to me. Just when I’ve founded myself a place to home, its snatched away from me and the clock has started all over again. I was promised by my mother that we would move back this summer if she found a job there — But that’s just going to be a forgotten promise. She recently gave me a lecture of the importance of money, and how great of a workplace she has here.

 I love my mom with all my heart indefinitely, perhaps more than I love myself sometimes. I’ve noticed that I’ve already lost a part of myself that I could never gain back, though I don’t know what exactly, I can just feel it. I’ve often had been low in my life in the form of anger and frustration, but now its just hopelessness. Most of my dreams consist of me walking into through those glass stained doors and seeing my friends once again, not doing anything interesting, but having conversations with them about school things. I’ve been having those sorts of dreams for a few weeks now, being able to hear their voices in my head makes me want to see their faces again in person.

 If I never do get see them again in the next 4 months, then I’ll just leave my digital footprint here:

 -Blaine, you’re the most talented person I know, I wish we had spent more time together at school and in basketball.
-Colton, I’m sorry I never got to finish that game of sticks with you, even then, I’d still probably beat you.
-Luke, thanks for everything man, I love you brother.
-TJ, That party we had at your place was fun, ding dong ditching your neighbors around town was fun too
-Kaden, you’re a teddy bear, but you’re still a bear big man. Good luck with football over the summer.

 Mom &amp; Dad, I’m sorry that I was a bad kid growing up, I hope you know I love both of you

Nathan, I love you"
833,Interested to know opinions on Peer Collective,"So my therapist recommended this service called Peer Collective as a way of getting more support in between sessions since his schedule doesn’t allow us to meet more than once a month.

Has anyone used this service before? Did you find it helpful? Was it worth it even though it isn’t a licensed therapist?? 
 It is a video chat with a “peer counselor” who is not a therapist but a peer there to offer emotional support. Typically you can meet with the same person at the same time and I’m thinking about doing it once a week. It’s $14 for a half hour. 

If you want to take a look it’s called Peercollective.org"
834,Being shut out..,"So I’m a freshman in highschool and I was considerably nervous about it because I didn’t really know anyone besides people who didn’t like me. Since I go to a really small school the drama can get pretty disturbing. But that’s not the point. This boy warmed up to me particularly faster than the rest and we quickly became friends. We’d sit together, talk to eachother, help eachother in our online classes, give eachother advice, and just support eachother. When October came around we became inseparable. We’d tell eachother how good of friends we are and how our friendship is like nothing else. This went on till December. Throughout October-December things moved very quickly. I’d go to outings with him, we’d call all night and play video games together, we’d send eachother cheesy photos of eachother, we’d make eachother our lock screen on our phones, we’d hug and hold hands. It was the most pleasant experience in my life, it felt like my inherited depression was at its lowest. I felt euphoric, we even stayed up and celebrated New Years together. Then New Years hit and things turned to shit. About a week into January we started fighting and he admitted to me that he doesn’t feel like hanging out with me as much.  Although it hurt he still expressed that he cared he just said his emotions were distressed. After our first fight we completely broke off. I apologized but it didn’t change anything. Everything died, our good morning and goodnight texts disappeared, our lock screens changed, we don’t hang out and etc. then he gets a girlfriend and he tells me he doesn’t care about anyone but her. Now we don’t even talk to eachother at school and I have to text him in order to get a conversation. Not even words can express the pain I am feeling. I cry almost everyday and it’s not getting any better. I don’t know what to do anymore I just feel like giving up to be honest."

837,Natural remedies," I am 25 years old and I am struggling with bipolar, type 2, disorder. I have searched for so long for the right medication. Like so many others I found the right one but could not afford it. Since then I have tried several others. All give me an insufferable side effect: feeling like I’m in a dream, severe anxiety, no longer wanting to exist. You get the picture. Which brings me to the question, which kind of mood swing is worse? There has to be something else. I am dying to know, are there any natural remedies? Does anyone know of anything that can help me feel balanced with out the use of manufactured drugs?"

839,Never a good conversation,"Why is having a serious conversation with my mum so hard. I can’t truly express myself or say what exactly is going on without getting upset (because my stupid emotions get the better of me) or her relating her experience saying how she managed just fine in a similar situation and making me feel bad.

“*I’m not asking for your help mother, I’m telling you what’s going on in my life, not to have you question it and vilify me for my decisions and me trying to take responsibility and get myself to a good place*”. This is what I’d like to say, however, it will not be met with understanding or compassion. 

I truly hate trying to connect with my mum. Even hugs are awkward. Can’t remember the last time we even hugged. Being at a moment in my life where I need that support but I will never ask for it.

I own up to my decisions and responsibilities but still get looked down for them. Parents wonder why we got issues with trust and have to play mental gymnastics with our emotions and have to hide how we truly feel. 

————————————————————————————
- In the scenarios should I ask for help, I’ll only get told I always leave til too late. When I don’t like asking for help because I hate to be a burden.

- Talking anything to do with mental health or being depressed or anxious, gets swept under the rug or told that I do it to myself so I only have me to blame.

Heavily pregnant and trying to make my situation better and work towards something (without asking her for help), it gets thrown in my face that I’m either not doing enough or it’s my fault I’m in this situation in the first.

And she wonders why none of her kids tell her anything."
840,Therapist appointment!,"I am going to the therapist tomorrow! After my abrupt ending due to career shifts, my therapy ended and I thought I was fine. I have now realized I’m not. She was the only adult who actually listened to me. She was the only adult I felt comfortable and the only adult that didn’t tell me how wrong I was or how I have nothing to be sad about.

After 2 months, I have really deteriorated. I do t know if it’s cause of the holidays, but after 2 years of my Dads passing it still weighs heavy on me. My Mom tells me all the time how I have nothing to be sad about, but after multiple breakdowns at school, she finally got me an appointment! She wedged herself into the first half of it, but I can’t wait to just tell someone that will believe me. I can’t wait to just cry and have someone be there for me and truly care. I can’t wait to see someone who will see my suffering and help me. It seems unusual to be excited, but I can’t wait. Therapy is the only place I can be me, and show it."

844,Exhausted from my mother.,"Hi I am a 22 year old Hispanic male, born in the northern Mexican city “Mexicali”. soon to move out to college. I little background about me, My parents got separated since I was about 7 years old, I have lived with my mom ever since, I moved to the imperial valley when I was 12, I always been very close to my mom, and we were always really close through my childhood. When I was 15, my mom had my brother with another man. At 19 It didn’t work out and they separated, so my mom was left single. before I begin the ranting I wanna clarify that my parents are wonderful, the most hardworking people I ever met in my life, (I see my dad every month, because he lives in LA). The issues started when I got my very first  ever girlfriend at the age of 20 years old. I dated this girl for roughly 4 months and I and my mom were close still and she would give advise about dating and all the good stuff, fast forward... been bf and Gf for roughly 6 months know her for 10 months, I was hella in the honey moon stage, you know first girlfriend, so I ditched my mom and my brother a lot when she needed help with the babysitting cuz I’m my household it’s only me, my lil bro and her, I know I fucked up, I lowkey turned my back on my mother when she needed my help. However I one time she exploded and she told how I was obsessed with my girl and that it wouldn’t last cuz it’s my first one, and that I dumb and Immature for behaving like this. Fast forward a little more and I fixed all this and I was the “Ideal son” However the issue know is that I can only see my girl when ever she wants basically, I can’t go out Thursday, Saturdays and Sundays cuz it’s supposed to be our family days, as a result I and her Invite my girl to our family events a lot, like a lot... like she is always here, basically but whenever my mom gets pissed she complains that my girl is always here, however she is the one that invites her too, and on the other hand she shits on me If I start to go out too much. I am exhausted of all the shores she leaves me, pick my bro from a shoot everyday, I cook for my bro, I help with his homework, I take him to his gym classes,  I clean the house, I try to be a good son, I have good grades, however I always find her raising her voice and shitting on me for forgetting little details, and I having mental issues and being a mommy’s boy for almost all my life is very rough, I take everything she says to the heart, it has come to the point where I get nervous every-time she is gonna her here from work. if some of you took the time to read all this, thank you, it helped me a bit mentally. Sorry for my poor English if you guys read everything let me know what you think and if you didn’t get something just let me know in the comments."
845,Dissociation/Depersonalization tips?,"I have been dealing with disassociating and depersonalization for many years, but I have no insurance and can not afford to seek professional help for the many things going on in my head. However, these two particular things get to me the most and I guess my question is, how do you all deal with dissociation and depersonalization? I do have a grounding technique where I will rub something in between my thumb and pointer finger (usually something with a satisfying feel to it), but I'm curious to see what tips anyone can offer to help me out as my technique just doesn't work all the time. Thanks in advance! ((I have tried the 5,4,3,2,1 grounding technique but it's hard to keep up with when I'm having anxiety))"
846,My therapist wants me to write a letter to my future self and im stuck,"This is my throwaway because I dont want this on my main, but basically I need advice.

I've been depressed pretty much as soon as I hit puberty and have never really pictured myself having a future or a dream or a goal of someone that I really wanted to be. I don't really have anything I'm passionate about and never really pictured my life past 30. Ever. Right now, I'm kind of just coasting and my therapist wants me to write a letter to my future self but I don't know what it should say. Does anyone have any advice on how to get started?"
847,I keep “seeing” the same people everywhere I go!,I keep having this weird feeling where I think I’m seeing the same people. Let me explain. I was with my sister and fiancé at their job interviews and there was some guy in the waiting room. Well 7-8 months later I began my orientation for a new job and I was/still am convinced that some guy also doing his orientation the same guy I saw at my sisters and fiancés interview. This happens all the time. Another example is at my new job there are 3 different people that I’m 110% convinced I’ve seen before. And it’s not just like “hey you look familiar have I seen you before?” My brain starts taking people just I’ve even just walked by in the past and replacing them with these new people. This bothers me so much because I’m so sure I’ve seen them.
848,Depressed and lonely...*Looking for some advice*,"Hi, hmm this is weird to post something like this about myself. [Sorry, LONG POST AHEAD.] But at the same time, I feel like this is one of the only places I can rant/open up without having to pay someone to listen to me. 

I constantly feel like nobody wants to ACTUALLY hear what I have to say. I mean, most of the time when someone asks me how I am, I'm 100% certain they don't actually want to know. Like it's actually just code for ""I'm just asking to be polite. Please don't actually give me an honest answer"".

Even immediate family members, most of the time I feel like they don't really want to listen. Especially when we're having family dinner, when I'm talking to someone, I'll literally be mid-sentence, and they'll just decide to opt out of the conversation and immediately start talking to someone else...

And as for friends...what friends? Most people on my Facebook are just there. We don't ever have any kind of conversation. We just see what the other person is doing, whenever we log in. And when I take the initiative at times and ask a 'friend' to do something, I'm always given the ""Oh for sure! But not this week, I'm SUPER busy."" answer. And then nothing ever happens after that. But then literally that same week, I'll see them hanging out with someone else I know. So clearly they have time, they just don't want to spend any on ME. And believe me, I've tried to follow up on the invite, and try to invite them to something else, only to be given the same if not similar answer. 

I honestly have no idea what I did to drive them away, I feel like I'm the friendliest I can be when I am around them. I ask them questions, how they're doing (I actually want to know), what they're up to these days etc. Like what did I do that was so bad, that they want nothing to do with me?

All this means, is I spend a LOT of time alone. Doing things by myself, which is nice a lot of the time, but I don't want it to be because nobody wants to hang out with me. You know? Anyway, I guess what I'm doing right now is, looking for some guidance and advice for anyone who's gone through or going through something similar. What did you find helped you get through it, or cope with it better?  

For anyone who made it through the entire post, thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time."
849,Should I see someone?,"Sometimes, usually in social situations, I’ll be chillin and all of sudden I’ll get this cold sinking feeling in my chest but my skin will feel hot like I’m in a sauna. People who have seen me when I’m going through this say that it looks like I’ve just seen a ghost. I assume from what I’ve read online that it’s a anxiety attack but it’s never felt like an attack to me because whenever this happens I’m immediately able to recognize and start telling myself over and over in my head “calm down, everything is fine, you’re safe” until I’m eventually able to catch my breath again. I’ve never givin these things too much attention because I’m always able to calm myself down before it manifests into something much worse but when I told my best friend about it they reccomend I should get help anyways. What do you guys think? I just don’t want to go into therapy and have to pay a lot for something that isn’t that significant"
850,I feel like I'm detached from my self,"

Is this normal or is anyone able to tell me what this is called.

Most of the time i feel like i'm on autopilot, My thoughts feel detached from my body. Like it feels i'm observing from a distance. Sometimes i feel like i'm in full control, but most of the time i feel like i retreat to the back of my mind.
When people are talking to me i try to focus on what they are saying but i don't seem to absorb much of it, it feels like i'm hearing them from a distance.
When i'm talking to people, quite often it doesn't feel like my words are coming from me. It feels like i'm just saying what is expected.
I had a pretty good life. But when i try to look back i cant think of when i was truly happy. Even though i know i was.
Even now when i do things I think I enjoy, its like my body and subconscious feel happy, but my main consciousness doesn't.
When i listen to music from old video games i loved as a child, i find myself crying from happiness/nostalgia. But again the feeling doesn't seem to truly reach me.
And its not just happiness either, any emotion i feel seems to only affect my subconscious but not my main consciousness.
I know i love my parents, family and girlfriend but i don't seem to feel it as much as i think i should.
Are these feelings normal or is it something else?

Thank you for any insight,"
851,Feel like my life is going nowhere,"I graduated from college with a degree in computer science and have been job hunting for about a year ago, but have had no luck. I feel like my life is going nowhere. I also don’t really have any goals in mind on what I want to do in life, nor do I have any close friends to talk it out with.

My parents though are very supportive, and say to take my time finding a work, but that doesn’t really make me feel better. It honestly makes me feel really guilty. At my age (25), I really should be on my own, and the one supporting them."
852,Advice for first time therapy?,"I am *finally* making an appointment with a counselor. I am /incredibly/ sacred, and I honestly don't know how to start talking to a therapist. I have avoided it for a while because I feel like my issues should be something I should be able to work on myself, but as that has obviously not been working I'm taking what I see as a very vulnerable step towards improvement. Any advice of how to physically and/or mentally approach therapy???"
853,Been taking new meds for over a month now,"A couple months ago, my doctor and I discussed a possibility of me having some sort of bipolar disorder due to the fact that it's very apparent on both sides of my family. I explained where I would have a couple days where it felt like I had a ton of energy and I had to be doing something at all times and it was often spending my money to the point where I only had five dollars in my bank or wanting to have sex almost every hour. She put me on mood stabilizers and lowered my depression medication to 100mg. 

I have noticed an improvement in my every day life now. I no longer cry over every little thing, I have found the energy and motivation to keep my living space clean and somewhat tidy, and I've been a lot more active in terms of meeting up with friends and truly enjoying spending time with my fiance. I occasionally have my bouts of anxiety and depression, but they aren't as severe anymore. I haven't had any suicidal thoughts since changing my care plan. 

The moment that I realized I'm getting better was when I had to tell my dad that I was put on academic suspension and couldn't attend any classes this spring. I would usually cry and shut down when having to confront my dad, but I was calm and told him I had things figured out and that he doesn't need to worry too much. It was a short and sweet call that ended with him saying he's proud that I have things sorted out.

I'm hoping in me telling you all this that someone in here will see this as that ""things will get better, you just need to speak up"" kind of inspiration. It took some time to figure out my brain, but I feel so much better and that I can take on the world in a healthier way. It will take time to figure out your own brain, but once you do, the world seems to get a bit brighter."
854,Sudden increase in touch and sound sensitivity?,"So recently I've noticed I've become extremely sensitive to particular noises and materials. For example, I can't shut the blinds because the noise irritates me, I can't pull back wrappers or lids from food, I can't fold my clothing without that 'nails on a chalkboard' feeling and even my feet on my sheets at night are causing me distress so I have to wear socks.

I have never experienced this before and its very new, I'm quite sensitive to touch from others due to trauma but I've never had this. It's only been the past few weeks and it seems to be getting progressively worse, even if I avoid my triggers I'll find myself thinking about them and its making me struggle with day to day tasks.

Anybody experienced anything similar to this before? I don't think I'm on the spectrum, as it's only a short term thing that has recently emerged? Advice to cope with this? Thank you!"
855,Will You Share Me Your Story?,"Hey guys,

I'm currently searching for anyone who is willing to share their story to me. I recently started a channel that is focused on sharing Real-Life stories of peoples backgrounds of dealing with depression, anxiety, or any disorders etc. These stories are intended to help and educate others who watch these videos so they too can cope and find peace within themselves.

Would any of you be willing to share your story to me? I would love to offer you the opportunity to share the worst of what you've been through, so others can relate to you and we can all break the stigma of remaining silent to our problems.

Thank you for your consideration.

P.S. If you prefer to send your story in private, you can send them to my personal email @  shatteredmindstories@gmail.com"
856,Why can’t I be happy?,
857,What to do when the depression is winning.,"Hello reddit, I come seeking advice. Since about Seventh grade, I've been depressed, (I'm 18 now) so its been a long struggle. At this point, I don't fear death or even want to die necessarily, just reached a point of indifference because I know on one hand that killing myself won't be the right way to do things, my family would struggle with the idea that it might be their fault when it really isn't but I can't talk to them about it because they don't understand. On the other hand I'm not really living a life, more or less just a corpse who is numb. I've hit a crossroad where, I'm hoping I get hit by a car or something like that (ex if a train was coming at me 100 mph, I wouldn't jump out of the way.) and I always find myself thinking things like maybe today is the day that happens because I know in the end it would be less painful for my family. I feel like I can never attain my goals, I dropped out of HS (I'm almost done with my diploma online) but I can hardly ever get the will to get out of the bed in the morning and I don't know how I would go to college or even work a job for that matter. It's not that I'm lazy, It's that I can't fathom the idea of trying to be normal again. It's been such a long time since I've felt anything other than anxiety or sadness, but most of the time it's just nothing, I feel nothing and I want to be nothing. Sorry for my rambling just had to get this out and any ideas for help or recovery would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
858,Reasons to be hearing voices?,"So over the past six months or so I’ve been hearing voices sometimes. The frequency has been increasing slowly. It started out once every like 1.5 months and now it’s like every 2-3 weeks that I hear voices 

Initially it was just sounds. Sometimes multiple sounds and sometimes single sounds. Not like tinnitus. They were always really loud and hurt my ears

Sometimes it was screaming. Eventually I heard a voice say some random sentences that made no sense without context

And then again with a voice that told me to run until I die because “they” knew what I was doing. I knew this was fake and was not affected by it 

And the most recent was when I had a conversation inside my head with two different voices. I kept wanting them to get out but they refused to leave and I felt like I was going mad. Luckily it passed after twenty minutes or so"
859,Later on in the year I will be doing a research project on “How does music act as therapy for those suffering with mental health”. As I i am in need of primary sources would anyone who has or is suffering with a mental illness be down to do an interview with me discussing how music benefited them ?,It will just be an interview via email or text and won’t be in person
860,"Stuck in a Weird Burnout Cycle (Bad Grammar Warning, Trigger Warning, and a HUGE RANT)","Ever since the end of Freshman year (I'm a Junior atm), I've been stuck in this weird depressed cycle. I will feel like doing my work, and I'll be more energetic, but as soon as I get a shit grade (like a C or lower, I'm not that pretentious) I'll sink back down cause I guess my minds like ""welp, there goes my efforts"" and I'll just sleep all day and skip classes (like gym, nothing too important) and shit. I saw a school therapist, and they said I showed signs of depression, my school counselor says I'm depressed, and even my fucking doctor said I am. Sorry if this is offensive, because they're not diagnosed from what I'm aware, but my parents are both bipolar as hell. My dad will be all for getting me a psychologist, even offered to get me a brain scan or something random like that, but then the next week, even the next day or two, he'll be all fucking pissed and call me useless. Now don't get him wrong, I truly don't do much around my house, I just stay in my room, and just watch youtube, and ignore my responsibilities, so I get it... but I stay in my room because of them. But then again, I should come downstairs and help my stay at home mom who never leaves the house cause my dad's a prick and there's a whole mess with licenses and shit that's a whole other story, but yeah so she's already be driven crazy, so she gets pissed off easily, and when I offer to mop or something, she just tells me I don't do it right and says she'll do it. And then she'll complain about me not dusting a room that I was assigned, which I genuinely forgot about so that is completely my fault, but she'll just critique the hell out of whatever shit job I'll apparently do because I missed one spot behind the tv... like I'm not playing this up, my mom is very meticulous. So, I just stopped doing shit, which is not a reasonable response, but it is the reason (I still do my own dishes or whatever dishes are in the sink when I'm there and I do my own clothes and clean my room and bathroom and shit, which is still not a lot, but I don't do completely nothing). Idk, and whatever I used to do would result in them fucking yelling at me, especially my dad, I would be eating at the fucking table and he'd start telling me how shit my grades are. Wow, fucking thanks, like I didn't know that, and like you even help, all you do is lecture me every day for an hour. And he would do this for months. He's chilled out now cause he was chill one day when we were driving home, and he asked me what he could change to help me or something, so he's not a terrible person... he just gets really fucking pissed off and it annoys the absolute hell out of me. And it's funny, cause I feel like he sees me as his past self, cause his past self was beyond depressed and he literally almost attempted and shit, and so he's just frustrated, which I get, but goddamnit you're a fucking adult. And now jumping to my mom, she didn't let me go alone, despite me being sixteen, to my doctors appointment, so she was in the room with me (forgot to mention I'm a girl, sorry) and so the doctor is discussing my depressed thoughts, etc. with me and she just kept fucking butting in. My mom always butts in, that's just her thing, but even my doctor was clearly getting upset. She looked at me, and not verbatim, but she said: ""alright what your mom is seeing might be different from how you feel, so how do you feel?"" Something like that. My doctor even recommended WEEKLY counseling. My sister was also in the room, so that was fun, and she's 11. But I'm very close to her and told her to leave the room while I was answering the depression question thingy so she wouldn't get worried about my suicidal thoughts (I'll never attempt, I know better, but hell does it seem nice sometimes)  But yeah, so we leave the appointment and my mom fucking goes, and this is VERBATIM..."" I don't think you have depression."" AHHHHHHH ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. I WANNA DIE, HOMIE HAHAHA. My mom has depression, very traumatic stuff happened to her back in her country, so she also thinks that you have to have trauma to have depression. Which, I can understand from her perspective, and she also comes from a completely different time and culture, so I get it, but... a literal professional recommended your daughter to see a counselor or come to the doctor's office once a week to meet their specialist... and you're telling me I don't even have the slightest bit of something??? She does agree I have anxiety though, which is a plus, she's seen me freak out many times, and when I was in middle school and below HOLY SHIT was it bad. It's still really bad, and now I have IBS (doctor said I have it) probably because of it, but that's just a theory. Yeah idk, so then I saw the school specialist once a week for four weeks. She recommended counseling or a therapist, etc. My dad talked to her (I signed docs so it was all good) and they apparently agreed that I wasn't helping myself so nothing's improving. Well look, and I'm realizing this now as I type. I'm starting to help myself more, now that my parents aren't on my ass as much, coming to my door, arguing with me for an hour (legitimately) or screaming at me while crying and not even listening to me for a fucking hour (my mom). But anyway, I'm using my phone less, like way less, got an app and everything, and just cause I'm using my phone less they're back to thinking I'm using drugs! WOOOO. Fucking test me, jesus fuck, stop accusing me please, I literally want to jump out a fucking window sometimes and I mean it. AND TODAY OHOHOHO today, dude, my mom was PISSED. She noticed I put a slit back in my eyebrow. So here's some context, I'm bi, and I used to watch some lesbian, get ready to throw up, tik toks, and I always saw they had this cool slit, and I also had a gf at the time (online cause my dad would kick me out) and she had a slit, so I put a slit in my brow, and I felt so fucking empowered. Like I legit felt so good impulsively doing it because it was like one of the first things I ever did that I guess could be counted as rebellious minus being rude as hell and talking back to my parents (sometimes defending a point, but most of the time just me being a bitch so they would hop off my case, respect your parents, people, don't be like me please). But yeah, they only noticed it two weeks later when I was getting ready for homecoming (junior homecoming). So they weren't entirely pissed, just thought it looked bad. So I was like, alright whatever, I'll grow it out, it's chill. Grew it out, and I think it was last Thursday or so, I felt like complete shit. TRIGGER WARNING: Like I wanted to take a razor and y e a h, I've never really down it... cause I have only a short eyebrow razor, but I did kinda press it down and it left a scratch?? So I guess I did it... r i p , ahaha, but anyway, I put a slit in my eyebrow and felt better, despite promising my mom I would never pull that shit again (I forgot about the promise but that doesn't excuse my shit behaviour). Anyway, Saturday rolls about, felt like absolute shit again, looked at myself in the mirror, saw my shit hair cut... and cut my hair (but I've cut my hair in the past, so the cut is even and everything, had my brother check it and all). Then Sunday rolls about, my family except for my brother and me, go to the store, and I take these hair clippers we have and give meself a big undercut all around. I have a lot of hair (thanks genetics) so the bob I cut my hair into looked like a mushroom, so I was like ""lemme thin this bih out."" The truth is, despite me shaving a lot off, and I'm not playing it was two handfuls of hair, I still looked like I had all my hair. But my mom's fucking psychic and I laugh sometimes when I'm super nervous, and she fucking knew I shaved it (they were fine with my original cut from Saturday... my dad even likes when my hair's in a bob). SO, she was pissed. My dad didn't seem to care. But my mom was like ""don't wear your hair up... blah blah blah."" Then she found out today I slit my eyebrow, and fucking, not even playing, screamed at me. She was like ""who are you hanging out with, you're talking differently, etc.?!"" And I was just like, PEACE, and dipped to my room when she kinda chilled out??? So I get to my room, and I'm there for like 20 mins. She comes up, she looked like she was crying, probably talking to my dad saying how much of a tomboy I am and that I'm a terrible person, etc. She starts accusing me, like seriously, she was not saying this nicely, scout's honor, of being a boy. She was like ""you cut your hair, and YOU PAINT YOUR NAILS ONLY BLACK."" HAHAHAHA WHAT. DUDE FUCKING WHAT. ""You know guys paint their nails black."" That's verbatim what she said, I can't, dudes, I was like ""I like painting them black, and when you were offering to buy me a different color from online, I didn't like the colors, or thought they wouldn't match with my clothes, so I went with black."" BUT IT JUST WENT OVER HER FUCKING HEAD OMG. I can't, she never listens to me when she gets all accusatory, she never wants to, I only recently started asking her while we fight to let me speak, or for her to just take a second to listen to me. It's genuinely so frustrating, but hasn't been happening too much until today... or technically yesterday, whoops, I need to go to bed, ANYWHO. Yeah, they also have no trust in me, which is my fault cause I lied a lot when I was younger and still do sometimes... not too much though, it's just mostly about me having homework and when I'd be in a same-sex relationship, and they'd be wondering about who I was texting. But yeah, I don't have much of a voice, I don't have a job because my parents think I'm too irresponsible to have one, I don't have a permit (which I partly my fault, cause when they were all for me getting it last year, a month or two after my bday, I got REAL depressed and just didn't even wanna get out of fucking bed), and I literally have no money. I got coins. That's it, my mom especially doesn't want me having a money source because I would say ""it's my money, I can do what I want with it."" Which is exactly what I'd say, in all fairness. And look I'm not trying to lie and say I'm some good samaritan, but I just want a fucking job so my dad can support my siblings and not have to worry about me, you know? I already feel enough like a fucking burden. But believe what you want, I already said above I lied a bunch so that's enough to turn heads. Oh and my parents used to say every day that I'm not depressed I'm just lazy. Yeah. Woooo that's my life, sorry for my rant, and shit grammar, and lots of triggers....and the fucking negativity jesus fuck, oh and my cursing. Hope none of you are too religious, I'm a walking sin...that sounded edgy... ew.

863,I just wish my body would shut down,"Laying in bed currently, waiting for death to come and take me. Death is so far away but got I just want it so bad. The old me is dead, gone, he’ll most likely never come back.

I wanna climb out of my body and tear myself limb by limb, I hate myself SO MUCH. I keep trying to destroy myself but I’m too much of a pussy to do it. 

Anyone else have this thing where you just can’t imagine the world, I can’t. When I imagine it I see black and white, death, destruction, illness. I don’t see hope, I don’t see a future, hell trying to imagine myself as a 20 year old man gives me a headache.

I just wish someone would listen to me, my mom won’t help me “You don’t need to see a psychiatrist you’re just a little depressed.” “They’ll put you on meds and diagnose you with stuff you don’t have” God there’s no where for me to go, Idk how much longer I have until I snap but it feels like it could be any day, maybe even any hour."
864,I am very concerned about my mental health and stuff (not good with titles),"so to just get to the story i feel like i have something wrong with me and its not that r/im14andthisisdeep shit i am seriously concerned first is probably a thing you need to know is im a 15 year old scandinavian (idk if this is realevant really but here we go) i have a pretty wierd family my dad is a military man and stuff so he really wants me to be tough like him but im a bit of a puss so thats pretty hard. my mom and my bigger sister are both stress and anxiety victims (my sister takes some drugs against it) and i constantly have mental breakdowns at school that i tell my teachers not to write to my parents bc i dont want to cause any trouble for anyone. i have tried to confront my parents but they laugh and say im like my dead granpa that though he had all kinds of illneses, every time it just melts down to ""youre  just a teen"" ""dont get any good ideas"" but i just think they are trying to get past that there is a chance that theres something wrong with me and they just want a child thats good in school and dont complain. i dont know how to end this thread so ive typed some things i can really relate to in normal day situations and stuff. in the end i want some help to confront my parents and some evidence i can take to a Doctor or whatever you go to for mental help (would help a lot)

865,Understanding depression,"Depression is not simply feeling sad as many believe but often manifests as having no drive, feeling helpless or stuck or not making an effort to improve things.


For me, my psychiatrist asked me to run blood work and turned out my hormone levels were abnormal. Underfunctioning glands can make you feel tired and cause your mind to go haywire. So it made sense. Hormone treatment and antidepressants together helped me.

866,Personal Help for People with Mental Illness,"hi, so I'm making this program for a project of mine in school. its about people with mental illness who needs assistance, some help with house chores and cooking. i need some help with the details. also this is not an official or a real program. this is program is made from my project. this is more so like an agency but not really. so the personal help is for any person with mental illness, meaning that any one who needs help, gets help. the people who can act as the personal help should be 16+. they will also have to undergo two to three weeks worth of training, and how to deal whenever problems arise. so can anyone please add more details for my project. any sort of detail/advice to make it better is useful. this is not an official or real program. this is just a program i made because of a project."

868,Update on mental health:The other day i spoke to my mom in a serious converstaion about my depression and trama for the first time.,Long story short it went well.  She even talked to me about things that she has expeienced and mental health and trama wise too . she was surprisingly supportive.  I tried doing so when i was a teen before but i guess I never spoke this stuff to her like i did the other day . she even told me she would help me find a psychiatrist even if I needed the help.  I honestly really greatful and hopeful for the future.  I tried to even email psychiatrists and they got back to me.   I pray that someone learns or reads from this and thinks that they should reach out.  It dosnt have to be a family member or any such. It can be a friend or a therapist online.  Or the suicide line or something . i also pray that whoever is on thier journey that they find peace and the coruage to get out and do things and be a better you. I hope you all have a good day/night ❤❤
869,Looking for some advice,"Hello, lately I’ve been feeling like a piece of shit. I constantly feel worthless and feel like I’m stuck in life. I’ve been looking for a job and haven’t had much success, part of that I blame on my bad social skills. Since I was 16 I felt like a burden and haven’t had many friends, now that I’m 22 I’m still in the same position. I’ve isolated myself for a long time. I have absolutely no friends and don’t really talk to anybody about my feelings. Growing up I had some family problems, my dad kicked my brother out when he was young and my grandmother blamed me for the situation. My dad was also at time not so nice with his words. I also just discovered that my brother was sexually abused when he was young. My thoughts at night have been fucking with me. I’ve been watching the Netflix documentary our planet lol to kinda remind me of the nice things in life. In my mind Ive made up a fantasy world, as pathetic as that sounds. I’ve been looking into setting up an appointment with my school therapist. I didn’t before because I thought I could deal with the problems myself and also felt that I was taking somebody’s spot."

872,My brother thinks there are people in the walls,"My brother has been addicted to drugs since he was a kid. When he was 18 he went to jail for the first time. He's had the shit end of the stick in all of it when courts would refuse him to go into treatment and rather put him into jail. He's now 28, and is constantly thinking people or objects are behind walls. He destroys drywall, rips up the floors and is constantly looking for the next dent in the wall to look behind. Is there any way to help him? Like any sort of meditation?"
873,How to get over intimacy issues?,"I'm 19 and never had a girlfriend but not because I didn't had the chance to get one it's because whenever a girl likes me and tries to come closer to me I start ignoring and treating her bad because I'm scared that she is only playing with me or will break my heart, oddly this makes them want me more but soon they'll loose intrest.
I just can't let anybody get close to me and I feel like I'm not worthy of love."
874,I feel like I got a lot of catching up to do with life,"Ranty post sorry. No need to waist your time here

So looking at LinkedIn at the middle of the night is a very bad idea. Now I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking about how successful some of my classmates are now while I'm still working at a minimum wage job. Don't get me wrong I love my work right now. Best one I ever had to be honest but I still feel like I'm behind and everyone else is sprinting right past me.

Looking back to my school days, I wasn't top of the class or anything like that but I always make sure that I'm ahead on my assignments and projects. Life is proving to be more difficult than that.

No real passion in life or a meaningful hobby, I feel like I'm lost and got no skills that I'm really confident at. It doesn't help that I'm mostly an introvert, and have low confidence to begin with.

The one thing I really like to do is write and make up stories. I think that coronates to me enjoying a lot of video games and the story telling aspect of it. But who am I kidding? Me a writer? English isn't  even my first language.

Getting sick of me saying ""I"" this and that. It kinda makes me feel shallow saying all this but I just have to get this out of my system"
875,"The Difference Between Group, Individual and Couples Counseling","Therapy is quite a broad term used to describe the many different modes and styles of treatment given to any kind of mental health concern. Therapy encompasses many different techniques, approaches and theories which are sometimes used together but mostly vary significantly. Some of these types of therapy are [group counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/), individual counseling, marriage counseling, depression counseling and so on. It is important to know the many different types of therapy in detail to keep the differences in mind while opting for therapy. Here are some widely used types of therapy and the differences between them. 

Individual therapy primarily focuses on a one-on-one relationship between the client and the therapist. The relationship remains dynamic and depends on which approach the therapist uses for treatment. Individual therapy focuses on creating a safe and secure environment where these techniques can be used. Individual therapy greatly focuses on self-reflection, introspection and analysis of personal emotions, behaviors and their effect on others. 

[Marriage counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) focuses primarily on improving and strengthening communication patterns between a couple. Contrary to individual therapy, in [marriage counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/), a therapist very straightforwardly intervenes in the couple’s life and throws light on the couple’s habits, routine and behaviors towards one another. The therapist actively analyzes the couple’s behavior towards one another and offers feedback on the same while suggesting healthy ways to improve the problems. Marriage counseling is considered to be more intense than individual therapy because unlike individual therapy, here two people are involved together, and both are required to work in harmony to make progress. 

Group counseling is very different from individual counseling as well as marriage counseling for the entire concept of group therapy relies on the interaction of members within a group. It emphasizes on individuals understanding how they affect other people and they learn this through the feedback received from members and the therapist. It is important to understand that mental health disorders can be treated in both individual counseling settings as well as group counseling settings. For example, if an individual is suffering from depression and is looking for [depression counselling in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/), then they may either opt for individual counseling or group counseling, both of which are beneficial, one more than the other sometimes depending on the need and severity of the problem. 

It is important to understand that different types of therapy work differently for different individuals suffering from different problems with varying severities. For one individual if individual therapy works better for someone else facing the same problem, group therapy may work better. For someone facing problems in their marriage, they may benefit more by visiting a therapist alone by the means of individual therapy than visiting a marriage counselor with their partner. It all depends on what suits who, and there is no other way of finding out what works for you than trying many options and figuring out what sticks. For major mental health disorders, therapy is used in harmony with appropriate medication. It is important to educate yourself and others about therapy, its types and its benefits so that everyone can made informed mental health decisions."

878,My boyfriend won't get help.,"Im not sure if this is the correct place for this, but I need some advice/venting. My boyfriend has dealt with persistent ADHD for a very long time. Honestly, if hes still running off his diagnosis from middle school, ADHD might not even be what it is. I was misdiagnosed with ADHD until college. He hasnt been to anybody about it for years, because NOTHING helps. He cant meditate. Therapy doeant work. All medications are bad. He just will not listen to me and I cannot try anymore. I have been improving my own anxiety and depression for months now, partially on his request. Its been working. I was able to meditate after years of it not working. Im on medications, which I realized were an absolute necessity to stay sane and functional. This idea that hes ""special"" and nothing woll ever work for him is just. Pissing. Me. Off. I dont know what to do. I know I cant force him to get help, but I cant help but think he's being so dumb. I understand that hes used to living with this, but I know he would be far happier if he got treatment. How can he tell me that I need to fix my mental health, but refuse to fix his own?"
879,Need advice 🙏🏻,"Need advice 🙏🏻

I (F) reconnected with my best friend from high school (F) after we both lost people close to us in really traumatic ways. She also came out to me as being bi and I fully support her, being a nurse I love people for who they are and only want the best for others

We discussed ways to move on and cope after loss and I am so excited that we can be friends after going our separate ways after high school. So I decided to have a spa day with my friend. It was a Korean spa and had all these cool different rooms and it also had a hot tub room where for whatever reason, I’m not sure, but you aren’t allowed to wear clothes in the tubs.

I thought nothing of it because I’ve seen so many people’s bodies in my life being a nurse, and the number one rule of nursing basically is to have the utmost respect for other people. I also survived years of sexual abuse as a child so being comfortable with my body in front of a room of other women, or even just other people for that matter, was such a positive experience. 

I told my boyfriend about this experience and about how I’m so happy I have my friend in my life. A couple days later he told me he thinks that my friend is attracted to me and is going to make me leave him and will try to do something inappropriate to me. Only because this happened in his past relationship and he “needs to be careful”. He’s never met or spoke to my friend and said meeting her would not change his mind about this.

I am so mentally overwhelmed that he cannot understand that his situation was an isolated incident and he is making a horrible generalization about bisexual people. He’s also mad that I am “defending my friend over my boyfriend” 

This experience has really changed how I feel about him because he said I should just accept that this is his opinion and it will not change “for the time being” any advice or insight on how to navigate this situation would be appreciated"
880,Feel like my life has failed,"M36

My life has been a train wreck and I have found out lat in life why, because I have high-functioning autism and ADD.

It’s been a constant struggle trying o make sense of the world around me. I have managed to stay employed and run my own businesses. But I’m still broke and I don’t see that I will ever get any family.

I also have to start treating my ADD and Autism and talk with a psychologist.

Looking back in my life I have missed so many fantastic opportunities to connect and have relationships. But things never happened. Now I know why because I have high-functioning autism and ADD.

I'm worried about the future and what it will bring. No saving, little pension, no own place to live in.

I also have Diabetes type 1. It's under control.

But the constant anxiety and depression that have co-existed in my life are tiring. Not being able to connect naturally with people and form relationships. Never had a proper relationship.

I’m approaching 40 and I feel I should have accomplished more in life by now. Especially seeking treatment for my mental health problems.

I’m talented in art and music. That’s something I can hold on to.

Just sharing my 2 cents."
881,I'm nervous about coronavirus (yes I know I should probably talk to my doctor...),"I seem to be really susceptible to getting alarmed by news and stuff. It happens with basically every big disaster that I feel could really effect me in some way; Talk of volcanoes, meteor/comet stories on news pages, that big Japanese tsunami a while back, swine flu, new wars or tension, eating raw chicken by accident, even that bible code thing years ago when I was in high school bothered me and I've always been agnostic. Although, then again, this might be a  somewhat legitimate worry as far as I know/can tell.

I seem to have recently came down with some kind of cold or flu. Its not showing very severe symptoms right now, but this is the first day. Yeah I know you guys can't advise me on my health or know much about physical diseases...

But I'm really worried. Even though I know the virus isn't shaping up to be very lethal and I'm only 31 and in good health able to apparently take a flu like its just a little fever and not much else, I am concerned. Don't take me wrong when I say this (understand: its purely about where the virus is. I could see this being something people might interpret wrong and I'm not saying I want to ostracize people, just understand me and try not to read anything into this), but I have been spending a lot of time lately around Asian supermarkets and around Chinese people in general for whatever reason.

Now I'm scared that I could have this new disease. I live in America, but I live sandwiched between two states that have already had cases. I take the  bus every where and found myself noticing a lot of people coughing...  I'm trying really hard not to think about the symptoms I've heard people meme about. 

I realize that I could have the flu, or a cold, or anything really but, well, I still don't know that this isn't the case either.

  
If someone can please, I dunno, just say something to help me calm down a little right now or show me some kind of technique to use, I would appreciate it... 

I know I could speak to a doctor, but doctors are so careful that sometimes it freaks me out more, like when I had to get tested for rabies after a dog bit me and even though she told me the odds basically amounted to no chance of rabies (granted, that did help a lot), it still freaked me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I just really wish I hadn't gotten sick. I don't to develop flu symptoms or anything. Even the ""mild"" case of just getting really, really sick for a while scares me a bit. I think I actually have to speak with my doctor at this point and I'll have to bring a mask as well.

&amp;#x200B;

But until then, what do I do?"
882,You know when you watch people / animals die on the internet I know most of you will act as it’s exciting for attention but honestly I don’t find it exciting I find it interesting I like to watch how living things respond to pain or how they sound and how long it takes for them to die anyone else,
883,"Locked inside my brain -Depression, Anxiety, Paranoia","If you’re reading this would be nice to talk to some people that are able to relate and maybe help other people out as well as myself. This is sort of like my life story and the issues I have now in life.


My name is James and I’m 20 years old. I like to consider myself different from a lot of the people in this world. In many aspects of life, I feel as if I’m unique. At times it’s a gift but at times it can also be a curse. So let me tell you a bit about myself and how I feel about everything. 


At five years old I lived with my Mum in Spain for five years and moved back to the UK at ten years old. My teenage years in school weren’t too bad but I feel as if growing up the way I did has had a massive affect of the way I am now. In school I wasn’t very popular but I’m more the type of person to keep myself to myself and that’s what I did in school. I had a best mate in school that I’m still good friends with now we’ve been mates for eight years. In school where I was so quiet and kept myself to myself I was never involved in any of the parties all the school kids were invited to and when I did go to parties they were hosted by my best mate. None of the girls took interest in me, I was just seen as the weird quiet kid.

It’s sort of the same now and because others see me like that I see my self like that “the weird quiet kid.” With all of my mates I’m like a follower I’m not a leader, I often tend to follow what they do or what they want to do. They often go out to the clubs, I don’t mind going out clubbing but I’m awful with small talk and lack confidence. It’s always a battle in my mind, at times I want to meet new people but I can’t do that because of my confidence and then because I don’t do that I get the thought in my mind that I don’t need to meet new people and make small talk so I sit in the corner watching all my friends mingle with the new people.

I consider myself one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet and I have this thing about which I consider myself as “too nice.” I’m always there for everyone when they need it with the advice and I often put my friends ahead of anyone including my family. When I’ve talked to girls in the past it hasn’t got past the second date and I feel as if that’s because I’m too nice, too quiet and not bad boy enough. 

Speaking of bad boys I’m very easily intimidated and very anxious. I hate where there are groups of people, I always feel like I’m being watched or talked about so I try to avoid social interactions. I don’t like todays society, I feel as if everyone in the world are puppets in a type of way. The way everyone dresses and how everyone has a mobile phone. Today’s society is revolves around social media and trying to be the best, I don’t want that but it’s everyone else’s expectations you’ve got to live up to. 

I feel as if I’m rambling on about a lot of things and this post is meant to be about mental health so let’s talk about that. What I’ve talked about links in to it, I feel very anxious most of the time. I’ve never been to the doctor but I would say I have social anxiety. With anxiety comes overthinking and I tend to overthink a lot. I feel as if the way my brain works is also a gift and it’s also a curse, I mentioned this before. I work differently to a lot of people and I’m very interested in how the brain works, I’m fixated on trying to learn how the brain works after all it is the most powerful component in our body. Overthinking is crazy and I’m sure I’m not the only one who has it. Where I’m “too nice” if I ever do anything wrong, even if I tried to do the right thing I feel a lot of guilt. 

When I was in college I was the same as I was in school keeping myself to myself. In college that’s when I first started smoking weed. I used to really enjoy it and I’d always have a good high. I can’t smoke weed anymore it makes me anxious, paranoid and almost as if I have a personality change. I feel as if weed is one of the things that has really affected my thinking. When I got high, I always felt as if every little comment made was about me, they’d talk about my personal life such as my sex life or other stuff and I felt uncomfortable talking about it but because it makes me uncomfortable, I feel as if it makes it look like I’m hiding things. I often hear voices when I smoke which are known as delusions. But when you’re certain you’ve heard something its hard for someone to tell you different. When I hear things I’m certain I’ve heard them but I never ask anyone I’m around for two reasons, one I feel as if they’re plotting against me and hey wouldn’t tell me the truth and the second is that you can get into a lot more of a difficult place in your mind if you mix what you think you’ve heard with reality. 

Since all of that happened with weed, I’ve never been able to think straight again. I got it often that whoever I smoked with they could read my mind and knew all my dark thoughts and just picked on me when I was high because it was easy to tell when I was hiding something. But since that happened with weed the way I think now will never be the same. I still have friends but I’m detached with my feelings I don’t trust anyone but I get times when I do. I struggle to show emotion, someone can say something and I’ll just agree with no emotion. I’m mostly with my own thought, daydreaming. Often I will be walking to places but when I daydream I can go completely the wrong way and not realise until after. I love daydreaming but I spend most of my life confused. Who am I, what do I want to do. 

Motivation is very hard for me and I’m very disorganised. If someone asks me to do something like go to the shop to get some milk I say something like I will later, genuinely forget  and they will ask again and I won’t want to. Lazy and disorganised. My bedroom is an absolute shit tip and it affects how I am in the day. I want to clean it I really do but I don’t know where to start. Doing things is an effort for me even the simple things. My mates will wanna go to the shops or go to somewhere like a bowling alley and I usually say “could do.” Which again is showing no emotion, I don’t mind doing things but generally I don’t want to but if I have to then I will. This is all confusing to write and I don’t even know if it makes sense.

I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, I would say I’m lonely and paranoid and very disorganised. There’s no one to talk to about this, they will only tell you how you are instead of seeing it from your viewpoint. They’re not in your head so they will never understand. My paranoia sometimes has often lead me to think that my own family know all my dark thought and they know who I am and because they know who I am they don’t love me and I felt at one point they wanted to put me in prison and lock me up. But because they know I’m weird and fragile and very passive, they haven’t. This thought by far the one that has made me ponder most about leaving this world. But then I’d be giving them what they want.

I feel so detached from people and I feel so detached from reality. I have often considered just leaving everyone without a note and joining an abbey. I’ve always been interested by buddhas and how they keep peace with there minds. They are forgiving and I would love to give that a try but I’m 20 years old so unfortunately I don’t think it could be a possibility.

If you have somewhat similar to this maybe send me a message, I often give good advice and we could maybe talk about this.

If you’re going through depression, I am always here to talk for that as well. I got through my depression trying to understand the mind. I feel as if this could help you to. If you’re interested give this video a listen:

884,Should I be mad at my parents?,"Last year I went to the hospital because I was having suicidal thoughts. A few days after I got out my parents told me they wanted me to get a drug test, not because they thought drugs contributed, it was so they could increase my life insurance to cover my student loans. 

When they first told me I was more just annoyed cause they woke from a nap, but when i thought more about I realized it hurt me to hear them say that. I feel like they don’t think I can make it. This along with them not really ever asking or helping with my mental health has been discouraging.

Do I have the right to be made or am I overreacting as it does make sense to do it? And more so, should I talk to them about it? Bringing it up to them probably won’t go very well so i’ve just been avoiding thinking or talking about it."

I've been this way for a very long time now and have mostly gotten used to it, things are fine most days, but I get these 'attacks' once in a while that I can best describe as an intense emotional pressure/ pain throughout my body that begins at my chest. I experience intense feelings of loneliness / stress when it happens, and used to just cry through it, though passive calming methods I've picked up over the years have helped (e.g self hugging, arm touching/rubbing etc). I don't tend to cry when it happens anymore unless it goes on for more than about an hour. They'd happen most often before sleep for a few years but have changed to a more sporadic pattern recently.  I'm just asking if anyone is aware of coping methods for this as the ones I've been using are getting less effective as time goes on. I've been considering buying a 'hugging' product / doll (those weird ones you can find in Japan) but I don't want to waste money on something that isn't going to do anything for me. Thanks if anyone can help, sorry if this post weirded anyone out."
890,I’m an introvert 😔✌🏼,"I lose all my confidence in public situations and it’s sad I know. I’m about to graduate from college and during the graduation ceremony, we are supposed to not only give our childhood pictures but also write something related to the school like what are our future plans and our memorable experiences from this school. Whatever we’ve written would be ANNOUNCED while we’re walking to get our diploma. I don’t really know what to do at this point and this is such a pain in the ass because I don’t want to do it in the first place. I’m sorry for wasting your time with such a useless rant but I’m really not ready for this. A few words of courage would help a lot really."
891,Seasonal Depression,"I think my boyfriend may have seasonal depression. For about the last 2 months he’s just seemed off. He hasn’t been his usual self. I told him last night that he hasn’t seemed like himself lately and asked if he had anything going on and he said he’s just been feeling ‘kind of nothing’ lately, said he didn’t really know how to describe it. He has a lot of mental illness, specifically depression, in his family and they all refuse to talk about it and act like it’s not happening. I’m not sure how to talk to him about without seeming judgemental or making him uncomfortable. With the weather being so cold where we live and having only like 6 hours of sunshine a day, I feel like seasonal depression may be to blame. 

What are some tips for helping with depression that isn’t prescription medication? I bought him a multivitamin and some vitamin D considering he mainly eats fast food and frequently skips meals, I figured he might be feeling like garbage from his sucky diet."
892,Should I give up?,I'm at a point now where I don't see the meaning in anything. I run a business but am no longer interested in it. If it fails it fails. I have a girlfriend of 5 years that I care about lots but have lost that love. I don't feel loved. I have parents that I no longer could be bothered dealing with. I have friends that I'm ready to give up on. I've felt numb for years now but now I'm beyond that. I've had these really odd fantasy's of just sitting on my behind and doing drugs until I die. I'm not sure what drugs but anything to escape. I've been drinking very heavily lately but it's so expensive and I get used to drinking 30 plus standard drinks a day. I feel like I'm more me when I escape. Should I just give up on everything in my life and just escape? Would the quality of life or quantity outweigh? I cant remember the last time I felt a definitive emotion. I haven't had that warm feeling in my tummy or throat for years. I haven't had the sense of dread in my face and stomach for years. I've noticed I no longer feel remorse or empathy for anything anymore. I've tried shocking myself into by watching some crazy things on liveleak I'd rather not mention but I don't flinch or feel for those people. Maybe it's worth giving up.
893,"Please, please help me figure out what happened to me. It's like something broke for a second and everything felt like a lie.","I was talking to a friend about feelings of invalidation- I went through years of an authority figure verbally berating me and making me feel like my problems were so minor compared to other people's that it wasn't ok to feel sad or upset about them. 

I talked about how when I discovered I was trans, I hated myself and it felt like my *existence* was an *insult* to *real* trans people. How much it hurt to feel like I've got no right to say who I am.

It turned into telling them that my existence in general and everything I am and everything that hurts me is wrong. I don't feel like a person then, I feel like a living, walking insult. They'd helped me realize that I was emotionally abused and suggested I get tested for C-PTSD and I'd agreed with them.

But suddenly I felt worthless and pathetic and disgusting for that. My violent thoughts came back and it was really hard not to have a self-harm relapse. Suddenly, months of progress were gone and I'd regressed to not even being able to believe that anything that's ever happened to me has ever been a big issue.

I started to become convinced that I've overreacted to every conflict and faked every diagnosis, even the ones I'd had no doubt about. It got hard to grasp everything that happened in an emotional sense and even remember how I'd *felt* in situations that previously, I knew were traumatic to me. 

All of my understanding of my mental health seemed like it just unraveled in an instant. All of those events and feelings were distant and it hurt; it was painful to try to remember them. I got so dizzy I had to lay on the floor. I felt pissed off because all they did was ask if I was safe and they left me. I hated myself for feeling angry at them, and for ever thinning that any of those feelings of trauma weren't fake, or any of my anxiety or depression, even the time my violent OCD got so bad I just barely managed not to be institutionalized after going to the ER.

It felt so unreal. Like everything was an act. It wasn't just a *doubt* or a *feeling*, it was mentally true that I'd made up everything I felt on purpose, that had I wanted to, I could've just made it to away in an instant and lived as a ""normal"" person.

I think I'm coming back from it but it was terrifying and I felt like I was losing my grip on reality.

Am I being dramatic to even ask what that was? I've never had a panic attack where it seems like everything I believed and felt about myself shifted drastically to the point where it didn't feel like reality. Please help me, I'm desperate to know what it was and scared it'll happen again."
894,Please Respond.,"Hi there everyone, I'm gonna cut to the chase so that I'm not wasting anyone's time, but I'm a University Art Student and I'm currently collecting information regarding mental health issues in order to draw them in my final pieces. **I, myself, have depression and anxiety**, but I don't have some of the other issues that rampage our brains. I would love if people could get in contact with me and describe to me what it looks like, feels like, etc. to have other issues such as Schizophrenia, BPD, DID etc - though, please do this in a way that doesn't trigger yourself or anyone else, as I wouldn't want to cause anybody any upset - so please only message or comment if you feel as though you can. Don't force yourself. 

When my project is finished, I'd be more than happy to post a print and send over my art if you'd also be interested, I could also dedicate the pieces to you when they are put up in my local gallery. 

I'm based in the UK so I run on GMT time, but I'm usually always available to talk if you feel as though you would rather have a private conversation rather than posting on here. I hope that asking this of you all is okay,"
895,what do people mean by the warm feeling in your heart when you volunteer?,"I have been volunteering and alot of people the first thing they tell me is that ""yes I like getting the warm feeling "" I nod my head but I dont help people because it makes me feel like a god i know the mental health hospital needs help so I will help simple"
896,"Everything is so amazing, why do I feel like this????","I’m 17, I literally got into medical school on Monday. I cried for so long in happiness and relief because somehow, through everything I’ve been through I still managed the work my ASS off to get in, for 8 months. I couldn’t even count the panic attacks and tears that I’ve gone through for this, because I’ve never been so determined to do something. 

And the happiness lasted for a day, and now I feel the same. I’m in an amazing so so loving relationship with somebody that I love so much I can’t even explain, and we’re so healthy. I have an amazing group of supportive friends and have for years, I’m a straight A student without having to put in much/any effort. My mum is pretty rich so When I want something I can almost always have it, as long as I’m a good child. I’m so fucking lucky, so why the hell do I feel like this? 

I have gone through things in the past. physically and emotionally abusive, alcoholic parent (I’m still living with her except the past few weeks she has been so nice to me, I don’t know what’s changed. She stills gets drunk every night though), I was in a severely emotionally abusive controlled relationship, struggled with bulimia and anorexia for years, self harmed for a little while.
But all of these things are over, everything seems fine in my life but I feel the EXACT same as I did when these were happening, if not worse.

I was on Prozac for a while but it never helped me and made me extremely tired so I stopped. Anxiety has been ruining my life since I was a child but as I get older it mixes with depression and other weird symptoms and my life just seems like a huge fucking mess, but in reality everything is great.  

I’m going to a doctor today, even though I’m under 18 I’m hoping they can consider giving me a different medication because I literally can’t go on like this. I can’t kill myself either, I got to the point where I have dreams every night about my boyfriend helping me kill myself; and it’s like a nightmare but a good dream at the same time, and it’s always in the same way. He makes a bubble bath for me and lights candles and puts on my favourite music and then he helps me cut up my wrist and holds me until I wake up. I feel so fucking deluded, one night I actually asked him if he would help me because I’m too afraid to do it alone, but I am far too exhausted to be living anymore. 
And then he freaked out and wanted to tell somebody so I wouldn’t hurt myself and I started shouting and crying but when I look back I would obviously do the same. 

I dont even think anybody’s going to read this, it’s so long, I just have to much to say and I don’t know why I’m even saying it. Anyway, yeah I’m going to see the doctor today, I actually made a list of my symptoms to tell them:


VERY VERY tired during the day/all the time but sometimes more awake at night time

Outbursts of anger (eg. About a week ago I was getting ready for school and couldn’t find my uniform, found out it was in the car and I had to go get it and the clothes were cold. I got so angry I was throwing things and slamming doors and SOBBING in anger while I got dressed right up until I left the house)
(Fine with my boyfriend one minute and the next I’m really annoyed at everything he says and don’t want him to touch me)
( switching between liking/hating friends over small things for periods of time) 

 after angry outbursts I’m sad/crying

Crying almost everyday. I get from hours to minutes periods of horrible anxiety but it goes away suddenly and then I’m completely fine/happy

Laughing spells that end in wanting to cry

When My bf leaves  I have horrible anxiety/sadness, can’t be away from him for more than a day. Since we started dating we spend everyday with each other and if we don’t I’m extremely distressed, and we’ve been dating for a year and 5 months. It was the same with my ex

I feel like I’m dreaming or nothing around me is real/ makes me really anxious

I don’t feel like myself anymore/ don’t know who I’m turning into

Very scared when I’m alone/think someone’s in my room/following me


I’m not asking for help from anybody here because I know there’s nothing you can do, I just wanted to get my thoughts out there and see what people think. Am I a spoiled, ungrateful teenage bitch? Am I really actually unwell???"
897,PTSD or DID? (23M),"I went through continuous and traumatic abuse throughout my childhood. For my whole life I had always been mentally troubled. I finally saw my first Psychiatrist/Therapist in August, and I was diagnosed with PTSD and GAD, and I started taking Lexapro (20MG)

I constantly struggle with dissociation. 24/7, I always feel some degree of detachment and disconnection from myself, the world, and everyone around me. It ranges from mild to very severe, but I always feel it. I have a very fractured and messy sense of identity.

I know dissociative episodes are a part of PTSD, but there have been things over the last few years that have made me wonder if I struggle with multiple personalities.

My whole life I have been very introverted, asocial, and quiet. But over the last few years or so, I feel like I've started to develop this completely different and distinct second personality that I feel take me over at times. This second personality is very feminine, flamboyant, and way more bright than my normal self. It's a harsh contrast from the other personality state I feel.

At first I thought it was just mood swings, but I feel like the ""switch"" has been becoming more severe. Back in the beginning of 2019, I was in my more feminine mindset for a good 6+ months straight. During this time, I started going by a different name. And I was completely dead set on it. I hated hearing my birth name, and I had become continously more feminine and bright of a person. Multiple people have told me that I was different.

After 6+ months, I felt like I switched, and I was back to using my birth name, and being more of my old self. However, ever since that period I've started to feel like I switch back and forth between the two. 

I'm known by different groups of people as the two different names I've used. One group knows the introverted and quiet me, and the other knows my other name. The more femboyish me.

I constantly feeling periods where I switch between what name I identify with. I'll have periods where I'm very introverted and a loner, and dont talk much or show much emotion, then I switch to feeling very flamboyant and talkative, and suddenly identify with colors like pink, and feel interested in feminine things that normally I wasnt really into before.

I was convinced they were just mood swings at first, until I started to notice more severe changes. My whole life I had identified as straight, but ever since this second personality state has come in, I feel very sexually confused whenever I'm in that feminine mindset. I'm completely content with my sexuality when I'm my ""normal"" self, and then when I become more feminine I'm suddenly questioning my sexuality and feeling different. I've noticed my behavior and the things I say are also pretty distinct depending on my state.

Could this be a personality disorder, or is it possible that it's just a very complicated and messed up sense of self identity due to my PTSD?"
898,Do you ever get stuck?,"Have any of you ever felt stuck on the same thoughts or memories? Even when I've discussed them with my therapist, they continue to persist. How have you gotten past this feeling of being stuck?"
899,Social Support Networks and Social Health for Mental Health,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QmYrpqPmb0c
900,Sometimes the best therapy is...,"Sometimes the best therapy is when you meet someone for breakfast, both of you laugh uncontrollably, one upping the others’ jokes and experiences. The server comes to table and only encourages your behavior. Don’t have to tell us twice! Then you both agree to meet more often. Oh, and you almost spit your beverage at them because of course they wait until you take a sip of coffee to share something funny. All the while your belly hurts from laughing so much. Almost felt compelled to hand him/her my insurance card for services rendered. 🤣  Yep, a good ‘session’ indeed."
901,Where does one to begin to get help?,I'm a 21 y/o male and I know I've got some serious issues.. I struggle severely out in public always thinking people are judging me and in most social settings I feel like I want to just be a wallflower and not do or say anything to anyone. I'm worried I might be experiencing the early signs of schizophrenia like sometimes I'll see tracers and life feels like a never ending trip. I've been declining mentally the past 2 or 3 years and it's now or never to seek help. At this point I know I need help and I'm willing to accept it but have no idea where to begin. I've got absolutely no form of health insurance and definitely wouldn't be able to afford out of pocket costs. So if anybody could help steer me in the right direction or give good advice I'm all ears and thanks in advance.
902,The only reason I’m going to school...,"I feel like school is useless. Like we’re being
institutionalized by the program. The only reason I’m going is for friends. And even my friends are not even my “friends” there agendas include getting high all the time and not hanging out. I want to go to the continuation school right next to my school. But my moms iffy on that. How do I push it on her that I really want to go..."
903,i lost,"i don’t know what to do anymore i’m constantly anxious and can’t get anything done i have no motivation for anything, my father is threatening to kick me out and i don’t know what to do"
904,I might talk to my sister about depression,"First off, I’m not diagnosed and I know that most likely doesn’t justify me just saying I have depression, but I most defiantly suffer from all the symptoms entailing depression. I’m a 17(M) I’ve posted here before, but I never took any action and god it’s gotten worse since then. I’m not particularly knowledgeable on how depression works, but if there an on off switch, I have had that switch been going hayware for years. But it hasn’t turned off yet, not for the past 7 months. 

My grades have suffer considerably in school and that has done nothing but fuel my anxiety of a non existent future. That in turns continues to make grades worse and then I just skip and skip and skip. My family just thinks I’m lazy, or that I don’t likes my teachers but it isn’t as simple as that. Without go to off topic of the title, I’m going to talk to my older sister about this, and maybe discuss getting a therapist. I need some help before it gets even worse. That’s what I said last time though and I never did anything with fear in my heart of being told that I’m just making excuses for skipping. I honestly think those fears have gotten to my head and now I think I’m making excuses. Today though I force myself to finally talk to my family about my issues after years of just not having serious talks. Wish me luck"
905,problems with my mental health,"I think my situation is getting really out of hand.

i've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and have panic/anxiety attacks sometimes, which also has impact on my mood. Because of this, going through these panic attacks, i've been severely depressed for a long time now. Its like all my emotions get pushed out, making me extremely depressed and numb after. Heres how it all started.

I knew this girl ""Holly"" in highschool, and she was.. well quite an attention \*\*\*\*\* if you know what i mean. So, i'd always try to impress her and stuff. I even said to my buddy on the first day of school ""dude im really going for her"". and.. eventually, i got her. But she'd frequently hang out with other boys making me quite jealous, but it didn't bother me THAT much. She'd always call me when hanging out with boys and just ask me stuff and laugh about what i had to say to those questions. This made me mad, and i thought that she might be a massive thot at one point, but the love i felt for her made me blind as hell. So then, after spending a few months of my time with her, she had to move and switch schools. Suddenly she became distant, and broke up. I was still feeling fine. A few weeks later, a few friends told me she cheated on me 2 weeks prior to her breaking up with me. I was hurt, but again, i could still deal with the pain. When she left i became really lonely and i didn't have many friends anymore. This is where my anxiety started taking over my life. The fact that she cheated on me became so disturbing to me later on.. i felt like i did something wrong and that i didn't deserve anybody on this planet.. i could not leave my house for months, and if i did i'd just end up shaking and becoming paranoid as hell. I told my parents that theres some serious anxiety going on here but they said its just something you experience at your age, and they said that EVERYTIME i'd bring it up. So i became severely depressed. I would not leave my home. Half a year later, i started buying anti anxiety pills so i could function right at school. I'd take them twice a week, because i did NOT want to get addicted to anti anxiety meds. It'll fuck you up. Anyhow, Holly texted me and i just jolt up and respond in a millisecond. I told her how i felt and i told her about the pills, because i thought i could get back together with her and she could help me through all of this (i thought about it that way cause i was feeling hopeless, and i had yet again been blinded by love). She wanted to come over so i said thats fine, i was quite happy for the first time in months. Also, at this time i kinda forgot about the meds and just kept them in my room somewhere. I wasn't taking them. So she came over, we were drinking a little, popping a few anxiety meds, and she ended up spending the night with me. We had sex, you know. Just having fun. I woke up in the morning to my mom calling me to get downstairs, and they told me they had found my pills. My heart sunk. And i broke down into tears, crying nonstop. They were not mad, they were concerned. So they sent me to a psychologist. When i came back, Holly was sitting on my bed and i told her everything that had happened. She was hugging me and telling me that it was going to be alright and that she'd help me get through ALL of this. She ended up leaving again, taking my drugs with her. She stole them. I was so happy with her, and when she left, i was in physical pain for 3 days. I was so depressed. I was in pain. And thats where it all went downhill. I've never been the same since. 

Heres the weird thing now; I've been suffering from what i believe to be DID, but i'm not sure. When i bring my problems up in a conversation with my mother, she gets mad and starts telling me she doesn't have the energy to get me a new diagnosis. Here's a list of my symptoms:

\-Extensive memory loss, i cant remember shit

\-My vision is similar to when you smoke weed (dream-like)

\-Mild hallucinations (shadows, objects growing bigger, wavy view)

\-Sound distortions in the background of other sounds (when i shower, i can hear my parents calling or i  hear knocking, whispering sometimes. When i listen to music and walk away from my speaker, lyrics get all messed up and off beat, sometimes they sound like they're in reverse)

\-suicidal thoughts

\-Severe depression

Please help me.. someone.."
906,Amanda Todd: A discussion into Mental Health,"Amanda Todd was a Canadian 15 yr old who died by suicide, her story opened up some doors in the discussion about mental health in Canada - which is a taboo almost-never-discussed subject - but there is still discussion that needs to happen. Mental health hospitals such as Day Hospitals have been opening up in Canada since Amanda's death in 2012. Where were they before she died? In Canada at the time (I am not sure if this is the norm as of 2020), you could sign yourself out at 12 years old, even if you were high-risk and your parents could do nothing to help you if you were older than 13-14. The buildings, organizations, etc are popping up in Canada because Amanda Todd opened some subtle doorways with her video. But how long before those doorways are closed again?

907,Parent not respecting/supporting me or my recent diagnosis,"me: 26 male

I have recently (within the last 3 months) been diagnose with autism (Asperger) and one parent is being VERY un-supportive and not picking up to what i feel is clear signals that i am not feeling good or i\`m in a state. Yesterday we (me and the parent) went to a workshop about autism to explain while i feel it was helpful, they did not find it helpful due to saying what they all ready know (as they worked in a school and had to deal with children with autism. After that myself and both my parents had a discussion which was getting a job, as i\`m finding it difficult as it is clashing with my coping mechanisms. Today because of all the nerves and anxiousness of the talk and workshop i woke up early (5am) because my nerves felt like pop rocks and my mood was not good. In order to get myself some improvement i went back to bed around 8am when i woke midday to the shout of the parent to wake up because it is 12 (they do this every time with no context if/when i slept the night before) i felt better like i was able to focus on my coping mechanisms (gaming) to which i was doing when my parent came in and begin to ask me about what i was doing knowing that  "" i not feeling good i\`m going play"" would have cause a insult spread i kept to short answer hoping they will go away asap. But they kept pressing saying how i was wasting time/life, i slammed my fist on my desk due to feeling trapped and frankly angry that my (what i feel) mood was not being respected. The response was the usual, overboard and needlessly pathetic, I said something to the effect of "" i\`m not in the mood/ not good right now i\`m going count from 5 please leave"" they didnt leave i asked again, didnt leave instead begin to throw things that was on my floor (clothes mostly) onto my bed and then threw my dnd books down the stairs telling me i should leave,to which i was going to after getting dress to leave and letting my friend know i need somewhere to crash mostly. They pursued me further and i begin to really lose it, screeching, shouting and deep shuddering breaths and pounding on my window which has possibly damaged my blinds and pulling a book case down. Currently i\`m better now (shortly after this event) but i feel no message has been leaned (on both side). They see themselves as not the villain even though they keep using (to what i think) manipulative language "" This is making me feel sad"", "" this is making me upset"" and "" You are making me and your brother (who had to intervene) feel upset""

&amp;#x200B;

Talking is not helping as both side are not picking up or listening to the other and only grand, dangerous displays seem to be effective in buying some time to recover. What can i do?"

909,My friends think I can't have an OCD-like thing because I don't have a certificate,"I have a thing for which I must order things that aren't in order, it's my OCD

Then, here's the juicy part

When my teacher call me for an interrogation (oral test, whatever) and my mind just goes blank, from knowing what to say. I got an F because of it"
910,My mother is in psychosis and went missing. Police found her and let her go. Any advice from someone who has been through this before??,"I live in Arizona. My mother lives in Washington state. We think she may be in Oregon currently.

Backstory: My mother has always suffered from mental health issues but has always been in denial and her religious beliefs have led to her refusal to accept and seek help. June 2019 she had a full psychotic break. She went missing for about 19 hours with no phone, money, food or water- on foot. We found her at 3am and she had walked 20 miles and claimed to be ""fasting and praying"" - acted like the whole thing was normal. 2 days later became convinced that my father was part of a secret government satanic cult and attacked him (no idea why the guy sticks around... he is a saint). She went to jail for the weekend, the state placed a restraining order and when she was released she was free to roam the streets since she could not return home. Dad was able to convince a police officer to give her cell phone to her- she went to a hotel that I booked for her, became paranoid, called 911 and they came and took her to the hospital for a mental eval. After determining she was not on drugs, they sent her to a psychiatric hospital where she stayed for about 3 weeks. Once out she was allowed to go off her meds by psych as they believed it was an isolated incident. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current Events: These past 2 weeks she started acting funny again - slightly. She was trying really hard to act normal and since my interactions are over the phone I did not pick up on it right away. Queue red flag - she bought a plane ticket last week to come visit me and my children (without talking to me or my father with whom she shares a bank account). Ok, rude, but the timing worked out and it's only for a week... that's fine. Her flight was scheduled for Monday 2/3. Saturday she becomes very clearly off her rocker, stays gone all day, exhibits paranoid behavior and is making elaborate stories. I try to talk her into going to the hospital but she isn't having it. Dad refuses to intervene because he doesn't want her to come unhinged and end up in jail again. I called the crisis team who said they would go out but never showed. Sunday she seems much better ( I am aware this is temporary) and agrees to go to her doctor Monday morning. She delayed so I called and got her a 2pm appointment- she decides she doesn't want to go anymore and Dad drives her to the airport (he's hoping I will take her when she arrives - horrible plan). She misses the flight, is very calm about it says she will reschedule it. Calls me Tuesday (yesterday) am and asks if I would be ok to pick her up for a late flight. I said yes, asked what time and she said she would ""tell me when it is time"" ok...?. She runs one errand and texts my dad to let him know she is on her way to pick him up from work at 2:10pm. It is a 12 minute drive. 

She never shows up. Dad waits two hours, finds a ride home, finds her suitcase in the house (purse missing and she has her phone), he calls and files a missing person report. I had him check his bank and she withdrew all the money that was there (about $200) and there is a transaction from Alaska airlines. I call Alaska they half-ass tell me what flight which lands at 1115pm. I get to the airport expecting her to call but the phone has been going straight to voicemail since about 3pm. I call Alaska again to discover that she never got on that flight. Dad has a realization that the car has OnStar and calls them with missing person report number. They send the police, police locate her. She tells them shes just ""going to visit family"" and they let her go. My sister is in Idaho- has not heard from her and I am her only other family she would try to visit. There is no one else. Police will not tell my father where they found her. We don't even know what state she is in. She may be driving to my house which is a 22 hour drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Mother in psychosis, bout plane ticket to come to visit me, never got on the flight, her phone is dead and is now missing in her car somewhere on the west coast. Police located her via OnStar and let her go. Will not tell us where she is.  She lives in WA state and I live in AZ, think she may be in Oregon. 

What can I do to get the police to locate her and take her to the hospital for a mental eval since she is clearly a danger to herself and has a history of mental health issues?"
911,Reading with ADHD,"I’ve always loved to read. Ever since I was able to pick up a book I read, mostly Goosebumps books which turned me into the horror lover that I am today but, I digress. Since about my 10th year I have not been able to focus enough to read fluently. It takes me twice as long to read a paragraph because of my brain wondering off. So my question is, is there anything you guys have found that helps when you’re trying to focus? I miss reading dearly, I’ve only read for professional settings and not for my own enjoyment. I miss the feeling I had when I got really lost in a piece of fiction, I’m desperate here lol."
912,How to stop anxious thoughts while driving,"Hi, I wanted to come on here for advice after an incident this morning. I’m currently 17 and I drive with my dad to school every morning. I have my probationary license and can legally drive by myself, but my parents refuse to let me drive the car by myself and I’m not allowed to go anywhere at all regardless if I have a car or not. My dad is a very impatient driver, especially since he drives mainly in New York for his job. When I drive, if I do something small that annoys him, he’ll yell at me and it causes me to be even more anxious while driving. I also have a history with childhood trauma and one of my biggest triggers right now is getting yelled at, especially by my parents (my heartbeat will start going really fast and my I start to feel a bit sick whenever I feel as though they’re gonna yell at me). To prevent him from yelling, I do anything he tells me to immediately. So this morning, I was driving to school and I was going to park near the sidewalk so that I could get out and walk into the school, but as I was getting ready to park the car, my dad out of nowhere tells me to go in front of the car that was parked in front me so I did. Like I said, I do anything he says immediately cause if I don’t I get screamed at and told that I don’t know how to drive and other stuff. So I immediately pulled out in a panic and cut someone off. That person happened to be one of my friends whose brother was driving. When I got into the school, my friend told me how her brother was mildly upset and said that I wasn’t a good driver because I cut him off and I felt so bad because I didn’t mean to do it. She knows my situation with my dad so she told him that it wasn’t my fault (even though it really was because I should’ve been more careful). But my anxiety takes the best of me and I don’t think first before doing things. Now I can’t stop thinking about the incident and how sorry I am about it. Whenever I drive I get so many anxious thoughts like if I’m driving too slow for the people behind me or if they are annoyed by my braking or etc. Does anyone have advice to tackle this problem? 

P.S. I generally am a very safe driver, I’m always cautious of my surroundings but when I’m pressured by my dad my anxious thoughts kick in and I don’t think before my actions."
913,What is wrong with me?,"Im constantly having these anxiety problems and i often get this feeling wanting to stab/kill somebody in my school/home for no reason or if i get annoyed by some little things + i sometimes really want kill myself or hurt myself really bad and often when i get those ""suicidal thoughts"" and do nothing to myself it makes me feel like im a pussy for not doing anything to myself. All of these things make me feel scared of myself. I know i need help but im scared of getting it and im not good at talking to people. I really want to fucking know what's wrong with me."
914,How do I mentally age faster?,"For some background information, I'm 17 years old, and when I was 14 and 15 I went through some severe depression and trauma and I don't think I ever really recovered from it because I still act like I'm 14 years old. This infuriates my mother, and I'm disappointed in myself because I'm very immature; not in terms of just being childish, but by the way I react to things and stuff like that, so I was wondering where I should start if I want to act my age because this is starting to affect me."
915,Is something wrong with me?,"16yo boy. Created a throwaway account for this. 
Most days I feel empty with practically no emotion. Of course, there are bouts of some happy emotion throughout the day (like laughing with my friends about dumb stuff just like everyone else). But in the end, I just feel empty like I can’t hold onto those feelings. It feels like nothing matters or has any meaning. I stay up late wondering what it is I’m feeling. I’m usually zoned out throughout the day to a point where people wave their hand around my face practically every day. 
Other days, i feel really good like I could take on the world. It’s like the opposite of the bad days. I’m motivated and I feel alive. 
I’ve talked to my parents about it but their advice way “just sleep” or “too much ____”. 
For the past few months I’ve been ignoring these as things everyone deals with and told myself I shouldn’t complain about it and I’m just overreacting. However, I feel like it’s getting more intense and I’m worried. Is my empty feeling normal for people or is it something I should look at? 
Thanks for the help."
916,I give up.,"Some clarification.
I'm 15 yr old guy in UK. I started a new school almost a year ago(I moved to UK almost a year ago too)

I was nice...I tried to apeal to them...to have friends...but students started behave like bastards to me...
I self harm...and it helps...
I have low self steem.
I hate myself and now I have suicidal thoughts...
Tbh I hate everyone and everything.
I'm so sick of those fucking bastards.
2 times they were physical...teachers ignore it...
They won't stop...teachers won't help...today one snaped my ruler in a couple of pieces and when i came home and told everything to my mom she told me that I care too much about little things...
I snaped and said I give up. That I don't care about anything...and I mean it.
She told me that I'll need to go to a psychiatrist(I think that was a false threat/trying to put me in place) and tgat something's wrong with me.(She doesn't know about my self harm)
She came to appologize but I rejected....I'm done with humans...I hate every last one of those bastards.
I am not scared to throw everything away...
If noone will help me...if noone will listen to me...then there's no point in continueing...
You know when you have a realistic dream that seems like a reality?
Well something like that happened to me this past 2 weeks.
It was when I was in school and upset/angry and I would see me killing myself...abd then I snaped back to reality...(Maybe a weird daydream)
Whenever I opened up, tried to change...tried to be better than this puece of shit being I am...I would fail...get hurt...
If being an adult is even harder...then I don't want it...
Video games, anime and reading were my only hobbies...and they don't help...
I don't care...I don't want to care...
If my mom doesn't see my pain...then there's no point...
I won't kill myself (too scared of dying).
But exsisting hurts...a lot...
I've never been mentally ill just tics which are getting better...at least something's getting better.
If she sends me to psychiatrist or a mental hospital...I don't care...not my problem...
If she doesn't...same opinion.
I ruined my life in the previous country...and here it isn't getting better.
I can't even defend myself phisically or verbally if I get hit because then ""we are even""(In school)"
917,Have ever thought about a previous memory in the deep recess of your mind and actually realize it was much more traumatic than at first?,In my case it was a sexual assault that I never really thought about until I was older. This is honestly one of the first places I’ve told anyone about it.  I was like 8 or 9 when it happened and the other kid was about the same age and this was obviously way before I knew what sex was so that’s why I never thought much of it until I got older and realized what they had done to me. At the time before and even after the fact I still thought of them as a friend because I honestly didn’t have many. I obviously can’t or wouldn’t pursue punishing them because it was so long ago. So what should I do about getting this out of my head?
918,I feel like im losing myself.,"I need help. Ive felt really odd for the past while, and its been getting worse. I dont feel like myself. I cant talk to people, cant crack jokes. I lost all of my friends. I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday, I have no idea why i did that. A couple of nights ago i was sitting and watching tv with him, and now the most important person ive ever met is gone. Nothing feels real. I feel like im watching a movie. Days feel unimportant, i dont remember when i felt happy last. I feel like nothing matters, considering dropping out of high school despite this being my last year. Ive begun self harming again. My boyfriend was the only person in my life that mattered, I dont know why I broke up with him. I had no solid reason, I just did it. I felt like i was doing something wrong, i felt like i wasn’t good for him. I cant have him back now. Its already done. Ive been having suicidal thoughts for a long while and they only are getting worse. I dont have access to professional help. I dont want to die. I want my boyfriend back. I love him. Please help me. I dont knwk whats going on"
919,"I think I am becoming anorexic, or too unstable to eat. I can’t tell the difference.","For the past few weeks, I have been eating less and less. I just ate, but it wasn’t a lot and was only about 250 calories. Before that, I hadn’t eaten for a full 24 hours and I ate about 400 calories. 

I’m skipping days of eating. I have depression, so I could just not have motivation to eat. The hunger doesn’t bother me, I enjoy it. 

Whenever I am presented with food, I want to eat it but I can’t get myself to eat it. Putting it in my mouth and chewing is hard. It took me 10 minutes to eat two eggs in front of my mom. She wanted to watch me eat. She ate one and it took her literally 30 seconds. I just cannot eat anymore.

I haven’t eaten more than 600 calories a day in about two weeks. It’s going down slowly but surely. Usually to deal with bad hunger, I drink a lot of low calorie drinks like water or a zero Gatorade. 

Anybody else?"
920,It hurts,It hurts being in love with someone who doesn't love you that way. I'm just a friend to her while she wants to be with someone else. I feel like crap. I feel like I don't matter.
921,First steps in seeking help?,"My partner and I are fairly convinced that he is depressed. We don’t have a family doc, and walk in clinics would be our only option for referrals if that is needed. There seem to be a few options for counselling as well. He is very open to getting help and tired of feeling this way - we’re just not sure where to start. BC, Canada if that is relevant at all!"
922,"Is there anywhere in Texas does free, confidential councelling or therapy?","Asking for someone I know, they are struggling with mental health but feel they have no access to mental health help. Even online places could help."
923,Severe depression and desperate for help,Hi! I am a college student I’ve realized over the last couple years that I have been dealing with a lot of mental health struggles on my own. I’ve seen several therapists and tried different coping mechanisms as much as possible but have not really been treated or had any luck. I am sad more than I am happy and I found that I only find happiness through temporary things. I struggle very much socially and at my age I feel I am behind in terms of friendships and relationships. I also have super low self esteem and no matter what I do I can’t seem to build it up. There are many layers and complexities and I think it stems somewhat from my upbringing but I’m trying to focus on the future and stop wasting time feeling so low. If you or someone you know has overcome these types of things. It is hard not to feel hopeless in coming to terms with the fact that I’ve never genuinely been happy and that’s all I really want.
924,Maybe this was the more appropriate subreddit to ask..,
925,I can't stop running jumping hoping and i can't sit down at all,"It gets worse when i daydream, i just run and hop around for very long lengths that can get to 15 minutes, i got to a point that i got muscles just because that i jump around continuously"
926,A stranger on the internet is suicidal and I don't know how to help him and I don't know where else to ask.,"I don't know, I just started following this dude on tumblr recently for shitposts and now he's posted that he's seriously on the edge and considering killing himself. I messaged him to talk to him, I asked him to call a suicide prevention hotline, he just doesn't want to talk, he feels hopeless, I know I don't know him and his issues aren't my responsibility but I want to help him and I don't know how. What do I do, can I even do anything? Fuck."
927,Maybe not as serious as most things ln this subreddit but Google isn't helping,"My arms and face are go completely numb when I'm crying, this only started yesterday and I won't go into detail on why I'm crying in the first place unless that seems relevant.
It's honestly scaring tf out of me so thanks in advance."
928,Forever tired,"Does anyone else have issues being tired all the time. It gets worse at night around 6pm and I don’t know if it my medication. I’m only on Latuda now so I thought getting off everything else would help but no dice.

930,Amare Global Honest Review- Does it work?,"\[this is a non-sponsored review and my personal opinion\]

Usually around this time of year when it gets cold and depressingly grey in upstate New York, I burrow into my blankets and forget all of my responsibilities. My friends and family never heard from me around this time and I end up destroying relationships that I used to love. 

But not this year. Last month my mom told me about Amare and even bought me my first box to get me started! Now I have purchased two additional boxes and I've decided to give one of those away. 

Mental health as a topic of discussion has come a long way but there are many that don't understand or have bad stigmas surrounding it. Sometimes people think it's not real or that people are 'searching for attention'.

We need to end that. So I decided to use the small platform I've built on YouTube to discuss a product that helped me drastically. To see my entire review and also enter the giveaway of the Amare FundaMentals Kit if you're genuinely interested in the product, click here: [https://youtu.be/JEwOKvxBH6Q](https://youtu.be/JEwOKvxBH6Q)"
931,You should be aware that what you lack in talent can be made up with confidence and determination.,"
This is for the people who are fighting hard to secure a future that’s right for them but are having second thoughts or doubting themselves. Nothing worthwhile  can be easy to achieve or obtain."
932,Ranting about my friend who doesn't believe in mental illness (Trigger warning),"Warning: My friend's arguments about how mental illness is all in your head is baffling and might upset some people. So read this at your own will.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I applied for ADHD diagnosis and my friend (Let's call him James) told me I'm wasting my time and that I won't get any better. He claims that diagnosis, medication and mental help is a scam and that the one way to feel better is to work out and eat healthy. I'm not denying the fact that healthy food and workout can improve your mood, but it's not a way of treatment. He told me that if I wanna get rid of my ADHD symptoms, I should work out and eat healthy which, according to him, will help me focus, be less impulsive, stop day dreaming, etc. I tried explaining to him that a mental illness is about a chemical imbalance in the brain but he refuses to believe this scientifically proven fact. 

I even brought up our common friend who's clinically depressed and on antidepressants, and James called him a ""lazy, self pitying, careless guy"" and that if he actually wanted to feel better he'd start working out and be healthy. I told him that he can't say this about him because he is clinically depressed, he's diagnosed with depression and a healthy life style won't cure his depression nor will it cure ADHD, anxiety, OCD and so on. I am aware that diagnosis, treatment and medication doesn't make someone a 100%, but it does help big time.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really bothering me that he doesn't seem to understand how mental health works. I don't wanna spend time arguing with him but at the same time I want people to be more educated on the matter and stop judging others."
933,Everyone around me is unwell. Everyone. It's really affecting me,"Pretty much everyone I know, both friends and acquaintances, are mentally ill in some form or another. It's honestly so, so depressing. Nobody is happy, nobody is well, everyone is suffering on the inside.

Today I spotted self harm scars on a friend's hand I presumed to be pretty stable. I can't stop thinking about it. She's a pretty headstrong person and even she is not doing too well. What's up with people in their early and mid-20s being so mentally fucked? Even in a country with good healthcare, where therapy is free? It makes me think that I am never going to recover from depression and passive suicidal ideation. Because everyone just gets worse and worse."
934,Do I have depression?,"Well I posted about 2-3 hours ago about how I’ll talk to my sister about my potential depression and well it didn’t go so well. She thinks I’m just lying to her and making an excuse to not go to school. My siblings all had a tough life because of my abusive dad, and they all had developed depression due to the fact. 

I can’t comprehend their pain, because I didn’t have to endure it, as my dad wasn’t really apart of my life, and I’m thankful for it.

I had different demons to face, it wasn’t the education system, but the people I encountered at school, the teachers. I was bullied heavily in middle school and teachers just did not care, I would try to tell them what was happening to me but they just did not care. 

At some point I blamed my family and said they were abusive (they weren’t) and we had to have a talk. This is what it took for the teachers to care about me potentially being bullied, not the fact that some fucking kid told me to kill myself in front of 40 other kids with no one intervening, not my so called friends or the fucking teacher. I’m self pitying too much perhaps.

Regardless in high school I was never bullied, I had good friends and I had fairly decent teachers, I didn’t have issues with anybody yet I still seem to have a want to not live, or a lack of care for the future, but then like 1 day later I care about my future, I care about everything and then cycle continues. 

I have no clue why I’m like this but I loathe myself, but I guess none of this ever occurs to my family, and they are most likely right. I have a family that loves me for the most part and I don’t have much responsibility apart from going to school.

My family believes because I play video games a lot (I mean all my friends do too, so it doesn’t come off as surprise) that I’m not depressed (and I’m not professional so maybe I’m not) but I haven’t had actual fun in video games in a long time, it’s just a routine. I’m used to it so I do it.

Regardless, I told my sister I’m depressed after skipping school two days in a row, and I’m a piece of shit for doing so as she says."

936,Good day!,"Honestly i haven't had a good day like this in a very long time, i BARELY had symptoms of schizophrenia today, i actually got school work done. i ate breakfast and took care of myself AND i even slept without being scared to. i hope this doesn't come off as bragging but i need to share how i feel, i feel ""grounded"" today, no hallucinations / delusions and very few audios besides the constant static noise but i don't mind it! what seems to help me is to do word search (i sound like a grandpa) but it helps me to realize i'm real and things around me ARE real, i'm proud of myself. truly truly happy, it may just be noon on a Wednesday but i feel good and i feel real."
937,Leaving my life behind,"So I moved to Arizona a few months ago and I was really happy to be back since I lived here most of my childhood. A little back story, I moved to Utah when I was 4th grade. Utah wasn't so bad, I made friends and new memories. But where there is light there is shadow. You... See my dad got his second DUI in Utah and got arrested. He won his first court case but lost the second because no one in my family was diagnosed with any terminal disease or illness. Since he was my family's provider. After the court case my dad's lawyer recommended that we should should sign up for this thing that would allow him to stay one more year before being deported. It expires in the summer of 2020 and he wanted to move back to Arizona because that's where most of our family's at. I always wanted to move back to my home but not this way. I wanted to graduate at my school in Utah. I left my life behind Because of my dad's stupid mistake. I just wanted to share this because it's eating me upside because I don't really have anyone I can talk to besides my family."
938,is it normal to have a copay for an intake?,"i went to a mental health office today for an intake. there was a $50 copay because that’s what my insurance charges for a speciality visit. i thought i was seeing a psychologist for a first appointment before i could get into my psychiatrist, but i don’t believe the person i spoke to was a mental health professional. she basically just asked me for background information that she input into a computer. i could’ve done this myself on paper or online if they had let me. it was basic stuff like rate how often x happens on y scale, what mental health disorders run in your family, what have you been diagnosed with, etc. and i paid $50! is this normal?"
939,So I did a thing :),"So at my high school at lunchtime today, the boys in my 4th year class were mucking about on the football field, I was standing up on the hill next to it like I usually do. There were also 1st and 2nd year boys playing football on their side of the pitch, their ball rolled over to the 4th year side, the 4th years grabbed it and absolutely yote it over the tall fence between the field and the woods, the younger boys had no way of getting it back. I saw everything happen, so I went around the outside of the school, went through the trees and managed to get it. The other 4th years laughed when they saw me getting the ball back and started saying stuff like, ""Leave the midgets to do it themselves."" I didn't care in the moment and I really still don't, they're morons, their words have literally no meaning. I gave the ball back to the younger boys and they gave me the nickname ""The BFG"", as in the Big Friendly Giant, (not The Big F**king Gun from Doom), since I'm a pretty big guy and seemingly the only 4th year that's been nice to them. I hope this shows some of you that there are always people who appreciate you, regardless of what ""group"" you might belong to or who you are. I'll wear this title with pride."
940,Suicidal thoughts and pets,"I would like to hear your thoughts about this topic. Maybe some of you are in the same situation. 

I have a lot of mental issues (personality disorder, eating disorder, depression, anxiety) and with that some suicidal thoughts. It comes in 'waves' where I can feel fine for some time and then it's downhill without any real triggers.

I have 3 pets: A parrot and two bunnies. They all mean the world to me and they are all so spoiled. Even on my darkest days I always make sure they are well as best as I can. They help me feel happiness, they give me something to live for and they bring hopes/dreams about the future.

But when I am down I am very afraid that I might end up killing myself. I have tried before (but not succeeded lol) and if I die I will leave them for an unsure future. The bird would be 'fine'. He is a family bird and would live with some relatives. It is the bunnies I am afraid of. They are both rescues and now free roaming in my apartment. I have invested a lot of time and money and love in them and it would break my heart if they would just get put down or sit in a small cage the rest of their lives.
I feel I should look for a new home where they don't have this risk. 

The point is: Is it worth risking their fate because I want them around? I could sell them to a loving family and it is selfish of me to keep them when I know the risk. They are happy here, they help keeping me alive but I don't feel that I am more important than they are.

Maybe some of you can relate. I know a lot of depressed people care a lot about their pets because they are such an awesome support.
I have been thinking about makes some kind of deal (maybe a friend or family member) that if I might die then they are responsible for giving them to a shelter so they have somewhere to go. But everybody close to me know my problems and I am afraid that they might see it as me preparing to kill myself (And I understand that).

What are your thoughts about this whole subject? Sorry for making it so long and thank you for reading"
941,How can I help a friend struggling with an eating disorder?,"So one of my friends has been dealing with anorexia for a few months, he lost a lot of weight and is now underweight
He's actually in a phase where he binge eats, and as a matter of fact he gained around 23 pounds in a month but still is underweight

If any of you have experienced an eating disorder, what would you have wanted people around you to do??
 Could you please give me tips on how to help him figure this out? 

I'm really concerned about his health, and I would be really grateful if someone could help me with this, idk much about eating disorders or how to help him"
942,At risk of sounding like I don't make an effort,"I hate it when people argue so hard that if you change something in your life and most importantly how you think everything will just be better. My thoughts are influenced by my emotions not the other way around and I can't blame my life for being sad because I don't always worry about everything I think sucks.
Sometimes u feel like shit and it is how it is for no reason at all and it's super annoying. Its not guaranteed to feel better after a long walk, talking with a friend, positive thoughts etc I live my life exactly the same way almost all the time idk why people try to push so much that changing something will make a difference and if you don't then it's your own fault for not feeling better"
943,Breakup with a girl of 2 years.,"A few days ago my girlfriend of 2 years ended things with me. It ended smoothly, we talked in person and she was just overwhelmed with life. We are both 19. When we broke up, I was still in love with her, cared about her more than anyone. 
Now everything changed overnight, we dont talk and I feel lonely and lost. I didnt depend on her for all my happiness, but it's hard when the person I've shared my life with for 2 years is gone instantly. This anxiety is causing me to have constant headaches or stomachaches, and I'm not eating too much.

Any advice to get over this and move on? Maybe a supplement or natural remedies to ease my mind and stomach? 
Thank you."
944,"People dealing with depression, anxiety or some sort of mental issue who watch bojack horseman, is it triggering? Do you recomend it? What's your opinion in general?",Sometimes it puts me down but idk if it's because of tough love or if it triggers me in a bad way
945,i have become so dead inside and the desire to kms is very attractive,"i really don't know what to do now, i feel so incredibly empty inside recently way more than usual, it's pretty obvious if you look at my lifestyle why that is but i still can't seem to figure out how to get passed it or what will help. for the last 2 days i've slept about 18 hours and when i wake up i just stare at the wall thinking about killing myself because you know it's been 8 years (since i was 15) that i noticed my mental health begin to crumble and to be plain it's simply very painful to exist

now as a 23 year old man who lives in a country alone and plays video games to pass the time and doesn't really understand life at all i think i've realised my best years were as a kid, before i went to school even though my family was pretty shitty i still found happiness in mmorpgs where i met most of my friends (none of whom i still talk to) every relationship i had didn't last for more than 2 months and i'm kinda crazy i guess, and for some reason i attract the craziest motherfuckers too. i have 0 desire to meet anyone anymore given my experience with people and now i guess i've given up and going to assume this gets even worse than what i could imagine and will drive me to finally hang myself"
946,"Am I (39F) depressed or lazy or? How do I get out of this funk? How do I restore my integrity with friends (40F, 45M) I have borrowed money from?","I posted this yesterday in r/relationship_advice and people over there suggested I post here. Leaving it in it's original form except where noted.

 

Relationship\_advice.....I can't seem to get anything done. I work at home, have my own business, sit at my computer all day long and the week ends I've got nothing to show for it. I have a sales page to write and emails to plan and days go by and I promise myself tomorrow or next week I will start fresh.

Yes, sometimes I screw around on Reddit but that's not all of it. I can't seem to save myself.

I've been having horrible headaches (daily, mostly constant, nausea, vomiting, sometimes dizzy) that started in the fall and it's taken a lot of wrangling to get a referral to a neurologist and get an MRI approved (13 days, 22 phone calls, one stupid clerical error to another). I finally had the MRI last week and I'm waiting for the results. I get them at the end of this week. It could be a spinal cord fluid leak or inconclusive. Brain cancer and tumors need to be ruled out but it's not likely based on my symptoms. Maybe a Chiari malformation.

Life doesn't feel hopeless. There are things I'm looking forward to, like the reservations my husband and I have on Valentine's Day at one of my favorite restaurants. Trips we have planned in the summer with my husband's family. Things I want to do in my business.

But the day to day seems overwhelming. I hate checking the snail mail. I only opened one Christmas card, and it was on accident. I haven't checked my work email in two weeks....and no, I don't have an assistant. I haven't even put an autoresponder on it. I'm not calling people back and if they manage to catch me, I avoid them or lie.

Two of my friends loaned me money over the course of the year to help me through this. I dread texting them and telling them I still don't have it, but another week goes by and I don't get anything done. Yes, my head hurts. And while it's nearly constant, it's not all the time. I have ok parts of the day most days.

Am I being too hard on myself? Do I just need to chill until after I see the doctor and find out what's the next step? One of my friends seems to think so.

Or how do I make myself get something done? Set a timer? Remove all the apps from my phone? I don't know.

What do I say to the friends I owe money to?

How do I get some sleep? I feel tired all day and then at night, I'm wired.

Is this what depression feels like? I can't seem to make sense of what I'm reading online.

I know that's convoluted and multiple questions. I don't even know if this is the right place for it. Thanks for the replies.

Random add: it feels out of integrity to going out to eat when we owe people money......we got a gift card from a neighbor for Christmas.  


Edit from my original post in the other sub to add that I'm getting out of bed, showering, taking my vitamins, etc."
947,Has your mind ever been completely free of thoughts?,"Today i noticed how my mind is never clear of thoughts, im always thinking about something unwillingly, it just goes in my head. I was just wondering if anyone ever has a mind free of thoughts."
948,How to convince a loved one to seek professional help,"This is a throwaway account and I'll try to be as vague as possible because I'm asking on behalf of helping someone else.

I have a sibling who has issues with anxiety and has for several years. When they were first diagnosed they saw a therapist regularly and seemed to be happier. They started seeing the therapist less because they felt they didn't really talk about anything new, but still they were fine. 

However my sibling has not seen a professional in while and has recently admitted they're having a lot of issues with anxiety. I can tell it's really affecting their quality of life and it makes me so sad. And I have to admit it affects mine and my parents as well. They will text us often for reassurance and it's frustrating to both of us, I'm sure, that I can't help. There are professionals who have studied this, and see these issues so many times, who are so much better equipped to help them than I am. I've told them as much for a while now but they just won't go.

It hurts me to see them question themselves so often but honestly I just can't take having to reassure them so often. Combined with me worrying about similar issues with my parents I feel like I am constantly thinking about other people, and how to help them, and how to navigate around them and get them help without being too pushy. It's draining.

What should I do? My sibling is young and I know eventually they're likely to realize they may need the extra help. But in the meantime I feel like I'm at my wit's end. Everyone in my family comes to me for advice or to vent because I'm not very judgmental but I can't handle the emotional burden anymore. But at the same time I feel like if I don't do it then they will just be alone with their problems. But I'm afraid that if I say this they'll keep their problems to themselves. I'm especially concerned about this happening with my sibling. This wound up being more of a vent than I intended but I really don't know what to do anymore. I know I should remove myself from their problems but I love them and want to help. It's maybe unusually hard for me to not want to help in some way; I just can't stop thinking about how I can help them. Do I keep pushing it? Do I tell them how much stress this puts on me? Do I just respond with ""can't help you"" every time and hope they seek some other venue?

Thanks for reading through all this, I appreciate any recommendations or similar experiences!"

953,I give up... (Edited/more info version),"Some clarification.
I'm 15 yr old guy in UK. I started a new school almost a year ago(I moved to UK almost a year ago too)

I was nice...I tried to apeal to them...to have friends...but students started behave like bastards to me...
I self harm...and it helps...
I have low self steem.
I hate myself and now I have suicidal thoughts...
Tbh I hate everyone and everything.
I'm so sick of those fucking bastards.
2 times they were physical...teachers ignore it...
They won't stop...teachers won't help...today one snaped my ruler in a couple of pieces and when i came home and told everything to my mom she told me that I care too much about little things...
I snaped and said I give up. That I don't care about anything...and I mean it.
She told me that I'll need to go to a psychiatrist(I think that was a false threat/trying to put me in place) and tgat something's wrong with me.(She doesn't know about my self harm)
She came to appologize but I rejected....I'm done with humans...I hate every last one of those bastards.
I am not scared to throw everything away...
If noone will help me...if noone will listen to me...then there's no point in continueing...
You know when you have a realistic dream that seems like a reality?
Well something like that happened to me this past 2 weeks.
It was when I was in school and upset/angry and I would see me killing myself...abd then I snaped back to reality...(Maybe a weird daydream)
Whenever I opened up, tried to change...tried to be better than this puece of shit being I am...I would fail...get hurt...
If being an adult is even harder...then I don't want it...
Video games, anime and reading were my only hobbies...and they don't help...
I don't care...I don't want to care...
If my mom doesn't see my pain...then there's no point...
I won't kill myself (too scared of dying).
But exsisting hurts...a lot...
I've never been mentally ill just tics which are getting better...at least something's getting better.
If she sends me to psychiatrist or a mental hospital...I don't care...not my problem...
If she doesn't...same opinion.
I ruined my life in the previous country...and here it isn't getting better.
I can't even defend myself phisically or verbally if I get hit because then ""we are even""(In school
I isolated myself...better than gettig hurt...
When i told my mom I give up she said ""You wont give when it come to school. (Grades and stuff)"" I said that I give up. I'm just a stupid worthless piece of garbage who doesn't have a future...so wgy even bother.
She is still probably angry...and I don't care...even though I'm nit glad I probably hurt her feelings...I don't care...

New info:

Well, before my mom left for work we were talking about the situation. She told me she sent an email to the head of the year teacher and to the principal...although even if it gets rid of bullies I still won't un-isolate myself.
I gave everyone(students and teacher) a chance...and they didn't do anything...
After I told my mom I can't forgive her she told me that if I'm angry at her, she'l be angry at me...and stuff about how I can't be angry at the world.
I mean, if I can't be angry at school or at home...what am I supposed to do?
Just suck it up and ignore it...
I mean...it hurt a bit to tell her that I won't forgive her for what she's said...but if I can't forgive her, I just can't.
I'm a normal-ish person(tics that are calming a bit make look a bit...weird(blinking weirdly and some other)) and she told me that I'll have to see a therapist.(It was an epty threat. She won't act on it) And she's telling me some ""You're different"" BS.
I mean, if I am different how am i supposed to make it in life...
I won't forgive her...anyone...
Now I am trully alone in this mess...well being with no friends for 4 or 5 years now sucks...but having my own mother basically call me insane just hurts...
My head is a mess rn...but if I'm not allowed to feel anger towards this...or anything...I'm done.
I just don't care about anything or anyone...I don't want to care...
Even my hobbies fon't make me happy anymore...they have my attention...but in the end just feel...empty.
I can laugh at memes or jokes...but mostly I'm just a dull idiot and a failure as a student, son and a person...
And yes I know I didn't experience ""life"" yet...but to me if the adult life is even harder...than to me it just isn't worth it...
And even if bullies stop...the damage is done...
There rumors about me how I'm retarded and some other...
I'm not religious but...they can all go to hell gor what i care.

Anyway, thanks for reading..."
954,Day 2 of going to the gym report(anxiety),"I'm trying to muster the courage to go to the gym now. It's a little later than I normally go, I try to go from 1-2 pm, and that is why it's harder today for me.

956,Career continues to cripple me,"Hi everyone. 

28, female. Really struggling with my anxiety as of late. 

I work in an industry that is very for lack of a better word unstable. It is not uncommon to get laid off, it is not uncommon to go through restructures, or for companies to get purchased out. 

Since I got to my current role almost 2 years ago, I’ve had three different managers, and attempt at a hostile takeover of our company, and now, and acquisition by another company. 

I like the work that I do, however I don’t feel that I’m being properly utilized. My skill set isn’t being maximized, and my role has changed drastically.  

Since finding out about the merger and seeing a lot of layoffs around me naturally I begin to apply for different positions. I came across a company that would be a huge opportunity in a step up in the right direction. I went through the interview process,  

This job would be everything that anyone would want. A brand that anyone would wanna work for, more money, better benefits, and just a step in the right direction. But I’m having second thoughts and I’m hesitating for some reason. 

I haven’t been sleeping well, and it’s keeping me up at night. The kicker? I don’t even have an offer yet.  They want to speak with me tomorrow, but that could mean yes or no. 

I’m anxious because I feel like I finally just got good at my job in my current role, and I’m feeling more confident in my role.  I like my coworkers, and one of them I considered to be one of my good friends. However at the same time, there has not been any reassurance of me not losing my job or not getting laid off. 

My chest feels very heavy. I’m struggling to call myself down. My career is a huge trigger. 

Any advice anyone has for maintaining my anxiety would be helpful."

But I just feel to fucked up and sick to be able to handle it all. I’ve done some sick and bad things in the past. And I’m still struggling with some problems. There’s things that I’m trying to stop. Things that I feel guilty and horrible for. I’m getting better and I feel good about that But I just can’t move on from these things. I’m filled with remorse and guilt.

963,I believe I am suffering from mental health issues,"Hello,

  


My location is Austria and I am a male in the mid 30s.

This looks like the right place and I know I should speak with a qualified professional but before I do I wanted to get this off my chest and possibly narrow down what it is I think I have.

I thought ADHD, possibly depression and now maybe even borderline bi polar? Honestly I really don't know but here is what my symptoms are like and why it's mentally exhausting me to the point I feel I need help.

  


My mind is going 100km/minute. At the end of the day I am exhausted. Mentally not physically. My family is the mian thing that keeps me from hitting a depressive state but this is starting to affect my work and my life and I would really like to know what it is.

  


Symptoms:

  


 *  Depression - i hit a financial burden past year and I believe that had partly to do with this. Just increased stress. Ive had mild depression phase during my late teens but it went away and I was happy until about 2 years ago (when the financial debt stuff started). It has gotten to the point where sometimes I feel I really am not happy and have no purpose. It can cripple my basic social skills and keep me isolated in my own comfort zone and away from people including my peers Co workers and sometimes family.
 *  Memory loss/forgetfulness - this is one of the main ones that I'm posting here. My memory has gotten so bad lately i can barely remember some of my work tasks that I've done a few months ago. I can read articles o topics I like and 1 to 2 weeks later I don't remember what it's about.
 *  Fatigue - I haven't been eating properly. I have gone a little bit healthier with my diet but there are some days I don't eat until late evening. Or I have one small meal for the whole day. There is no habit to my eating some days ill eat a few meals some i won't. I self diagnose myself to this and maybe a vitamin deficiency but again it's just me thinking what it is.
 *  Anxiety - I get anxiety in social settings sometimes, at work I'll have anxiety and sometimes at home. Sometimes I'll have anxiety just doing things I normally do.
 *  Loss of focus - this is a big one. I will try something and be excited to try it and get bored of it quickly and move to something else. I just can't focus. For instance I wanted to learn programming and it would benefit my job tremendously. I start it and stop within 2 weeks and say I'll get to it tomorrow. Tomorrow was 4 months ago. This happens with many things. I know I should do it but I can't motivate myself anymore and the original motivation I had is completely lost. Sometimes it takes me convincing myself a lot to do regular routine things like calling a friend to see how they are.
 *  Constant mood swings - I don't know how I'll feel when I wake up. It's 50/50 I'll be unmotivated, unhappy and groggy or I'm upbeat and energetic and social. I prefer the latter as I generally feel better but I never know which form will take when I wake up.

  


I've always been a bit of an introvert so always assumed it could be that but it's really taxing me. I used to drink what I kept saying was not much, just a few beers a day, but it was a bit of an addiction. I didn't completely stop alcohol but cut down enough to where I have a beer or 2 a month now which I think is fine. I don't crave them.

  


Weed is my biggest positive. When I smoke I am relaxed and chill and just overall more happy.

So my questions are this:

  


 *  Any suggestions on what I may be dealing with?
 *  For those that are diagnosed with possible similar symptoms, has medication helped you? I've heard of some negative feedback from anti anxietyndrugs or anti depressants which for me was a last resort but at this point I'll try anything.
 *  Any recommendations on where to go, what tests to do?
 *  Will diagnose do anything to my career? I would think I don't need to disclose anything medical related to my employer but I'd like to be anonymous on this if possible.

  


Thanks for reading my rant."
964,I think I may have a mental health issue. Can y'all help me identify it based on these symptoms?," \- Being afraid to let go and enjoy yourself completely because you don't want to risk being vulnerable or stupid

\- When you finally muster up the courage to feel something, you can't because you forgot how to feel things

\- Not really knowing what to care about or prioritize (because you haven't let yourself care about stuff for a while) so you opt for the least-effort thing as opposed to the ""most beneficial"" thing, whatever the f that means

\- Finding ways to rationalize your inability to feel things normally (""it doesn't matter anyway"", ""why care about X when &lt;insert excuse here&gt;"", Nihilism!!!!)

\- Ghosting people because you're afraid you're not going to be able to be a good enough friend for them (or more likely because they're not going to accept your sometimes apathetic, sometimes violently bitter self)

\- Second guessing every single thing you do because you've suppressed your instinct and your belief in things for so long

\- Having to come up with more and more bullshit excuses to explain your irrational behavior because nobody will understand ""I decided to charge that 200 dollar watch to my credit card because I wanted it for the 2 seconds before I bought it and it felt like too much effort to cancel the purchase""

\- Not being able to enjoy basic human emotions like gratitude, relief, hope, bliss, fascination, or excitement because you've been trained to think that any time you do experience those, you're faking it, so you don't know what's real anymore

\- Major trust issues with people, places, institutions, ideas, etc. (seeing red flags everywhere!)

\- Putting your own acceptable behavior in a smaller and smaller box because you don't want to be a hypocrite about the things you find fault with in other people"
965,I don't know who to trust and I feel alone and hopeless. I want to give up.,"I don't know where to begin exactly.  

I am experiencing a major depressive episode.  

I have had a few of these in recent weeks, with periods of 'I am going to beat this mentality'.  

These ups and downs make me think I am bipolar.  If not for outside triggers.

My support structure is small.  Two people I consider very close.  I have no one else.

There has been a cycle where their behavior makes me question the genuine aspects of the friendship. 


I spend a lot of time online trying to find information, why I do what I do, and to prevent people from taking advantage or feeling judged. I am also consider empathic.  With a mix or hit  of Asperger's? 

 I sense or see things that make me doubt the friendships I trust the most.  I ask and ask for truth but they keep holding back.

So, I finally broke down and snooped.

I found out nearly everything I do is misunderstood or annoying to them.  That the friendship is more illusion than true.  There is more but I don't feel the need to elaborate much further.  

I'm at the point where nothing I do is good enough.  I'm seen in a negative light, misunderstood, and seen as a charity case by those I cherish.

I have plans to see a therapist soon.  Part of my 'beat this mentality' but I'm afraid they'll try and out me into a psych ward if I'm open and honest or put me on medication that makes you worse.

There are days I felt unstoppable and others where I'm crushed.  All of it is based on situations and people in my life it how I'm behaving or precieving.

I no longer want to try living anymore.  I'm middle aged.  I am completely alone.  I'm hanging on by a thread.

Tl;Dr Lost friendships and hanging on by a thread."
966,First place I am admitting this,"I was diagnosed and treated for clinical depression in 2010. I was declared okay in 2015. 

But since October 2019... I haven't felt anything close to what I would call truely happy. It feels like I'm back where I was a decade ago... I feel stressed, anxious, and on edge all the time. I hate it. 

It's been slowly eating away at my work life, and my relationship with my fianceé. I just feel.... like the same lost 19 year old kid again. 

I've been debating going to a therapist again but I honestly doubt I can afford to with the wedding coming up. 

Part of me just thinks I needed to admit that I feel like this again. I don't know anymore. 

Thanks for reading. I hope you all are well."
967,"I feel like a failure, and I’ve been feeling like that since 4 years since I started university.","I’m so disappointed in myself. My grades are as best mediocre. I’m not sure if I’ll ever get to study my dream subject. I’ve retaken so many exams throughout the years due to me not being happy with the grade I first got, but often I haven’t even gotten any better grade after I’ve retaken it. The reason to this is mostly due to me having too much, and me retaking exams hurt the courses I have going on meanwhile. And don’t tell me I put too much pressure on myself. It’s not too much pressure to require good grades from myself. I wish I would have understood earlier, how to study and what the studies require. If I would have the possibility to go back in time and retake all my studies, I would. 

I’m exhausted, but too disappointed in myself to care about whether I will get burned out or not. I’m a failure, who keeps on failing. It’s a bad circle. I don’t want to be mediocre or regular, I want to be an excellent student. I want to be someone my parents, and myself can be proud of. But I’m not. I’m tired and I’m fucking disappointed. I know I could do better, but I’m not sure if I have any resources left."
968,Do I need to go on anxiety meds? What are the steps (UK)?,"My teachers are desperate for me to get onto it. I don't think I'm that serious of a case to be on it. I have tried therapy before but gave up on it as it didn't work after a few months. Nothing helps. 

The most worrying thing I suffer from is nightmares. For example, my dad often jokes about my 12yo cat hitting the bucket. I now have proper nightmares about my cat being killed or dying on me. When my friend was in a low mood I had nightmares about him dying too because I thought he was going to kill himself or something. 

I panic before every presentation and think I can't do it. Had 2 today before one. I could only do the presentation with the teacher only in the room. I also had an interview today which was less worrying and I was okay with it as the person was immediately nice to me. I often judge people based on the tone of their voice. I'm easily intimidated by male voices as they're a lot more serious. I'm male myself. 

One of the male teachers I had kept asking me to talk to him whilst I was upset. I couldnt say a word. My heart was going like mad. But i don't think it was serious enough to be a panic attack. I was also shaking a bit. But not really crying so that's why I think it was more of a panic moment and not an attack. 

I also find it hard to talk during group tasks. Even with just a classmate next to me. It seems to be the more people, the worse my fear is. I wanted to make an impression that I was confident and happy to be in the class, but now it's the complete opposite. 

Its weird. I find it okay to talk to new people but people I've already met and group tasks/presentations I find really difficult. 

Every one of my teachers at school think I need to get onto anxiety meds. I have tried therapy already but it didn't work, and I didn't like it either. I don't really like talking about my feelings. I find it so embarrassing. 

Also, my parents aren't supportive of my mental health. They think I need to toughen up and not panic. I don't know how I'm going to get onto help if they're only going to let me go to the doctors. The nearest CAHMS to me is on the bus and I haven't got any money, they know I haven't got any money.

It's gotten to the point where I find it easier to cope with it rather than talk to them. 

All my teachers are worried, I'm sick to death of panicking when anything human related comes up in life. But then I'm thinking it's not as serious as everyone thinks it is and I'm not going to get anywhere with treatment."
969,I keep making bad choices and I'm fucked,I feel so depressed in a small town in France. The only people i met here are vapid with 0 personality and mostly international students that have nothing in common with each other. My boyfriend has mental health issues and is quite unsocial too.  And he keeps making me realise how boring my other interactions are.  I don't know what to do really because I've tried to get along with these people despite everything but i just feel very uninspired and alone. It's putting me into a lot of depression but i camt quit and go back home because i need the independence from my family. I thought i would meet more forward thinking and kind people here than a patriarchal country like India but it's quite the opposite.
970,I need advice,"I want to get better. How do I start?

I'm sick of feeling like shit. I'm going to give it one more shot, not for myself but for a very close friend of mine. I can't rely on myself to want to feel better because help is the last thing I want right now but I will do it for that friend

I do not know where the fuck to start. I feel like I have exhausted all of my resources. Therapy doesn't work, meds make me feel like shit and meditation and excersise leaves me alone in my head.

How do you cope?"
971,My girlfriend says her mind keeps racing and that she cant stop thinking..,Today has been an off day. Any tips to make her feel better or to distract her?
972,Convincing Yourself of something you may not have done,"Trying this again

Hi Everyone,

I was out drinking with some coworkers last Friday night. I remember specific conversations and talking to specific people - except for what I talked about with 2 people. 

I have convinced myself of something I had talked to them about (something that was told to me a long time ago that I would never tell them in the first place - no matter how drunk I was) 

I’m wondering if I’m adding a worst-case scenario conversation with them because I don’t really remember what we talked about OR if I really did tell them what I wouldn’t have had I been sober. I also could have dreamed it because I don’t remember their reaction to what I said.

Has anyone else convinced themselves that they talked to someone about something that they didn’t?

This is all very strange and I’ve been obsessing over the “Did I or didn’t I?”"
973,I'm really trying to get better mentally but I really feel like my surroundings make this impossible,"
Right now I'm in a new school and I find it really hard to make friends. Everybody's already in their own groups and it's the graduating year, and if I'm being honest I'm not the best at making friends. I'll try but I overthink it and it doesn't get far. At school I try to not beat myself up about it but I'm constantly conscious of how alone I am and I'm constantly thinking of the stuff I do wrong.

At home I feel like a tool, 80% of the conversations that I have with my parents are them asking me to do things. And when I do talk to them I don't feel like they care, like last week I got accepted to an accounting program in college and while it wasn't a particularly hard program to get into, I would've expected more than an ""oh, cool"".

I try and I try to make myself feel better, like at school I tell myself that I should accept things for how they are and wait for a future where I will fit in, but it's so difficult to keep that mentality up when you're surrounded by loneliness. But at the end of the day I just have this dread about life that I can't seem to shake."
974,Does weight lifting cause psychotic breaks?,"I was diagnosed with GAD and have had a few depression episodes. But I've never experience anything like this, it was as if i was getting ripped from my body. The episode has passed now, still struggling to type and talk a bit, but feeling way better. From what I've read, stress seems to be the cause of these episodes. My question is, did weight lifting cause my break? And will just enduring the change make my brain get used to the stress? I used to weight lift pretty often, but took a very long break. (being lazy)"
975,I don't know what is going on with me and I have nobody to talk about it,"I've had a ski accident about 4 weeks ago. My kneecap jumped out, a muscle and a ligament ripped. 

Since that accident, I have been angry, bitter and sad for nearly all the time. I start crying when i think about what happened. I don't know exactly what triggers it all. Maybe that after the accident i was laying alone in the snow for an hour after someone came to me. That my group just abandoned me or that my teachers didn't care enough about me to bring me to a hospital immediatly while everyone else that has been in an accident in those 2 weeks was brought to a hospital immediatly. Maybe it's how lonely and isolated I am now. That I don't feel normal anymore since I fail to do normal tasks. 

I just wish I had someone to talk about this. I haven't felt this lonely before"
976,"Horrible at Studying, hate myself","After failing one exam for not studying, I finally try and push myself to study for another quiz in another class. But guess what, I failed this one too. Why... why is this happening to me. I can't handle this. Why is life doing this to me? Why was I made this way? I just want to enjoy my life, but that's not possible. Why should I bother... therapists couldn't help me, my parents can't help me, medications can't help me... I just want to disappear,"
977,Need advice,"My twin sister who is 16 was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, as well as anorexia about 8 months ago. It’s a long story that i won’t be able to fit into this post but basically she has this boyfriend who she has been on and off with every other day for the past year. He’s very toxic for her and is emotional and verbally abusive. He threatens to post personal text messages and pictures from her online and he has before. She is constantly crying and getting upset over him, and every time she vows she will stop talking to him and not go back to him. But she eventually does every time. She sneaks him into our house at night when my dad is sleeping and they drink and smoke weed in her room. At first I wasn’t too worried about the weed because even i have smoked occasionally however she has gotten to the point where she smokes several times a day every day, even before she goes to school. She is on anti depressants and an anxiety medication but she often skips her doses because she “forgets.” She sees a psychiatrist about every 3 months but she refuses to go to a therapist even though i’ve recommended her to my old therapist who was actually very nice and helpful with my anxiety when i was going to her. She constantly has outbursts, presumably from fighting with her boyfriend, and the police has even come to the house to talk to her. The visit from the police was actually very unprofessional and i think it was handled horribly, especially when they were dealing with a mentally unstable teenage girl. They threatened to throw her in jail and “baker act” her. She used to talk to me about what she was going through and when she was fighting with her boyfriend, but now she has completely shut me out and is not talking to anyone about her problems. She has said a few times before that she has thought about harming herself and i have gotten a few worrying text from her boyfriend to check on her because she is telling him she wants to commit suicide and such. When i ask her about it she says she’s not serious and would never do that, but i’m not sure. It’s come to a point where she is crying non stop everyday even in school and she will barely get out of her bed. Sorry for the huge essay but i just need some advice on what to do. My parents think maybe we should check her into a hospital but i’m not sure."
978,Not sure if this is the right place.,"Left the military a year ago, have been pushing friends and family away, had a traumatic event at a new job which led to me taking time out.

I feel like I have nobody who understands the situation in my life. And vetran support seems non existent in the UK. Just fed up of everything. Anyone been through similar or have any advice for me please."

980,I've felt like shit for the past 3 months,"Okay, I'm a teen that lives in Sweden and I have been feeling really bad since the closest thing to my dad, that isn't my real dad killed himself.
I've known this person my entire life and his son witch we can call Noah have been really close friends since about four years back. 
The 30th November last year the day went pretty well, it was a weekend so I pretty much just sat at my computer. I started talking to Noah via discord and we started to play some games.
But in the afternoon I got a call from Noah, I didn't have time to talk with him then so I figured that I would call him back in the evening. Terrible mistake. 
Shortly after the call I started making early dinner for myself and I got interrupted by my dad who came home ran into the kitchen and told me that an airplane had crashed into Noah's garden, first I got really shocked and then a couple of minutes later it sinked in. Noah's dad was a pilot that flied small single engine propeller planes, so I thought his dad had deliberately crashed into their garden. 
I pulled up the news on my phone, and it said that the pilot had died.
I got devastated, still hoping that it wasn't him I asked my dad if it was true. 
He said it was Noah's dad. 
I got even sadder and started crying and shaking uncontrollable.
Some time went by and I had calmed myself.
I remembered that Noah called me, I thought it was just before the crash. I pulled up my phone to check when the call was made. 15:45.
The crash happened 15:37.
I got a feeling in my entire body that I've never felt before, it was scary. I didn't know how to process everything that happened the past 2 hours. 
It was really hard to sleep that night and all the other night between then and now, what usually happens is I end up browsing YouTube or Reddit half the night to not think about what happened.

I still think about that phone call every day and about the crash every day.
I feel like my life has gone from a solid 9/10 to a 3/10.

I just felt like I needed to help get this weight off my shoulders and I didn't know who to tell this to.

Sorry for bad spelling and grammar."
981,not sure what to do,"I'm not diagnosed with anything nor do i think i have actual depression but i have been feeling a lot of sadness for the past few months because i have realised i am bisexual.(even though i have kinda accepted it i still just feel sad for no reason) i have been feeling just empty, knowing that i would not be accepted if i came out to most of the people in my life.I have also started cutting because i didnt have an outlet. I havent talked to any professional because im to scared to ask my parents to help. if anyone could tell me what i should do, that would be great. thanks"
982,Hospital Inpatient programs for depression and anxiety (United States) did it help you?,"24f battling chronic depression and anxiety/panic disorder for 5 years. I've tried several medications, therapy, lifestyle changes and went off my meds last July to try a more holistic approach because I felt so awful on the medication.

It's getting very bad again. And I am considering admitting myself. I wanted to hear others experiences voluntarily admitting yourself to the hospital and if it helped you or not. 

My thinking is, I think about killing myself every day. And I can't get into a psychiatrist for 3 weeks, I went to urgent Care and they dismissed me with sleeping pills and told me to exercise more. 

I feel like the only way I can get help is to admit myself and hope they can help me. I'm just scared I'm not in the right headspace to be my own advocate and that's dangerous because they could just throw pills at me without actually listening to what's worked and what hasn't or being around addicts and people with more severe mental illness will not be helpful. 

I just would like to hear others experiences in hospital inpatient programs in the US. 

I didn't include a lot of detail and am lacking information because of where my head is at so please don't make judgments based solely on the information I'm sharing with you. It's just all I can get out and wanted to give a breif idea of what I'm going through."
983,How intrussive thoughts have been haunt me,"For the past months, I've started to have this bizarre, inmoral thoughts. Some of them related to sexual things, other to violent things. I've had dreams about some of those intrusive thoughts, that still make me want to puke.

The most common one is related to my dad. Mayne while I masturbate, I think about fucking my dad. I had a dream where me and my dad had a relationship behind my mom, and I felt him fucking me. Every time I think about those thoughs, I wanna cry, puke and kill myself. I feel so bad with myself, for not being able to control these horrendous thoughts.

Other intrusive thoughts that I may have are related to bestiality, violence or really dangerous ones, like the urge to jump off a cliff, or being really conscious (with images in my head) of how I could fall off the stairs and break my neck."
984,Do I have borderline personality disorder? [confused],"Hi. So I'm just basically so confused. I don't know who I am, sometimes, if I'm quiet or shy or extroverted or cold. I never know how I'm going to act or why I act or if it's me. It's super odd, like i get offended so easily, if you tell me something bad about myself off hand I'll dwell on it for hours and I'll still be nice to you but think that you're out to get me?? But if you say a nice thing to me or act friendly I'll think ""oh this person's nice"" and you'll just be like an ally to me, until you say one bad thing to me in which case you turn into an enemy. I wouldn't say I have explosive anger, but i keep a lot of things pent up because I'm bad at confrontation/shouting and hate hearing shouting but when I blow up, I blow up. Im always worrying about what people think of me, if I'm a nice person, but I'm also like really low key manipulative/ a good lier?? Like sometimes I act super dumb or young or stuck up or intelligent and it's not an act but it is but I can't control myself. I also have this weird thing where I constantly jump to bad conclusions like if I trip a bit I see myself face plant onto the floor and crack my head open, and every time I cross the road I can SEE myself getting hit by a car. I also deal with extremes in the way that I'm either super arrogant/overconfident or just extremely unsure and self loathing and doubting the next. I feel like some of these are signs of borderline personality disorder, because I can kinda resonate with the symptoms. I am in no way trying to  self diagnose; I have a history of self harm/suicidal thoughts/low mood and theres something odd about my personality... My therapist thinks I may have aspergers but I doubt it. Anyway, if any of you know anyone with bpd or have it or have an affiliation with psychology and can help me sort this out (if there's any questions I'll answer) then I'd be grateful. I want to be able to bring this up with my therapist, but I don't want to sound like an idiot. Thanks! Sorry this was a bit of a word vomit :p"

989,"Recent event is triggering insane anxiety, and I don't know how to deal with it.","Hello everyone, I'm mostly creating this post so that I can share what's going on with anyone, as I'm too embarrassed too talk to any of my parents and friends.

Yesterday I made the very very dumb mistake of having unprotected sex with a hookup. She gave me a blowjob, and then we had sexual intercourse, all in all it had to have lasted for 5 to 10 minutes. While I was not afraid of having impregnated her (did not ejaculate, she said she had the implant), I immediately became worried about having contracted HIV.

The following morning I asked if she had anything and she said 100% no, unfortunately due to my anxiety that was not good enough of an answer. When she left, I pretty much immediately headed to the closest open sexual health clinic for a prescription of PEP (**post**\-**exposure prophylaxis**). As of right now, I've started the process. Knowing myself I will be spending the next 4 to 5 weeks in complete agony to the thought of having caught HIV.

All the odds stand with me:

\- She never said she had HIV, and we are both quite young (both 18 if that matters). Also, Uk rates of people with HIV between 15-24 is around 2.6% and women with HIV make up the 31% of the total amount of people with HIV.

\- Even if she did have it, the chances that I caught it are quite low.

\- AND I started PEP 12 hours after the event which has a very high chance of success.

Even so with all the odds being with me, I am terrified to the idea. I can't do anything about it, and sometimes my brain agrees with the rational facts, but at night or when I start overthinking about it the ""What if"" train of thought comes in. I need to find a way to relax for the coming weeks because stressing out won't help me in any possible way."
990,"Dealing with Pure OCD, Depression, Anxiety + Social Anxiety whilst also dealing with toxic co-workers. Reddit, should I just quit my job without notice?","So basically like the title says, I'm dealing with a cocktail of mental health issues the best I can whilst in a toxic work environment where nobody likes me/they talk down to me and think I'm stupid. Every time I say something they look at each other and laugh, they speak down to me like I'm a child because I'm not all loud and I refuse to join their toxic clique. I go to work everyday in my own head because it's like they're watching me waiting for me to make mistakes. I've been told they talk about me behind my back. 
I feel like a loser, like a quitter, but this is retail and it's driving me back into a bad depression. At the same time I want to see if I can stick it out so it prepares me for the future for tough times like this. I'm quiet at work because I'm literally focusing on not letting my mental health devour me, its like I'm constantly keeping my intrusive thoughts and panicmattacks at bay. On top of this, I'm so anxious I physically find it hard to talk, I'm aware of my voice and my face and breathing and it's all too much. They look at me like I'm a freak. I try help myself with counselling medication and meditation and self-help books. Whilst they've helped I've still got such a long journey and I don't know if I can face it with bullies. 
There's that saying something like 'be nice because you never know what someone's going through' I've even tried telling them I have social anxiety and they still continue. On top of this I get abuse from horrible customers. My parents are pressurising me to stay, but I don't want to. 
Do I tough it somehow or just quit without notice or hand my notice in?"
991,what is happening to me?,"for a month now i see a blue light and when i focus on it i see mountains, every few days it turns into a road and mountains forming in the sides, sometimes it gets very realisitic for a few seconds and i can see the tyre tracks, the rocks in the sides and trees.... i've got some mental problems but im lost on this"
992,I have been so alone it hurts,"So I had a falling out with a bunch of my friends, I am going through a rough patch with my mental health and haven’t been reaching out, which they interpreted as me thinking I’m too good for them or at the least not being a good friend. To be fair I haven’t been very present and I understand where they’re coming from.

But ever since I have just been so alone. I’m in university so most of my classes have 200+ people in them so I don’t know anyone and it would be weird to go talk to someone in a lecture hall that I don’t know. 

My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and sibling, but my mom is almost never home and when she is she is tired and wants to be left alone and my sibling would rather hang out with their friends or lock themselves in their room and  watch Netflix. I totally understand them since I used to want the same thing up until a few weeks ago. 

But I’m just so alone and have nobody to have any sort of interaction with and it really had been getting to me lately. I’ve been going to Starbucks just because saying my order and then thanking the barista is the most social interaction I get most days. I’m not really sure how to make friends or meet people right now, especially since I’m still going through a bunch of mental health issues and I feel like nobody would want to hear about that and apart from that my life is really empty/ boring so idk what I would even talk to them about. 

Anw sorry this is long but if anyone wants to chat or has any advice let me know 😊"
993,"If you're ever stuck, anxious, afraid, down, hopeless, lost or overwhelmed...just pick one thing, any one thing at all, and do it well.",A quote that helps me...
994,I give up... (More details version),"Some clarification.
I'm 15 yr old guy in UK. I started a new school almost a year ago(I moved to UK almost a year ago too)

I was nice...I tried to apeal to them...to have friends...but students started behave like bastards to me...
I self harm...and it helps...
I have low self steem.
I hate myself and now I have suicidal thoughts...
Tbh I hate everyone and everything.
I'm so sick of those fucking bastards.
2 times they were physical...teachers ignore it...
They won't stop...teachers won't help...today one snaped my ruler in a couple of pieces and when i came home and told everything to my mom she told me that I care too much about little things...
I snaped and said I give up. That I don't care about anything...and I mean it.
She told me that I'll need to go to a psychiatrist(I think that was a false threat/trying to put me in place) and tgat something's wrong with me.(She doesn't know about my self harm)
She came to appologize but I rejected....I'm done with humans...I hate every last one of those bastards.
I am not scared to throw everything away...
If noone will help me...if noone will listen to me...then there's no point in continueing...
You know when you have a realistic dream that seems like a reality?
Well something like that happened to me this past 2 weeks.
It was when I was in school and upset/angry and I would see me killing myself...abd then I snaped back to reality...(Maybe a weird daydream)
Whenever I opened up, tried to change...tried to be better than this puece of shit being I am...I would fail...get hurt...
If being an adult is even harder...then I don't want it...
Video games, anime and reading were my only hobbies...and they don't help...
I don't care...I don't want to care...
If my mom doesn't see my pain...then there's no point...
I won't kill myself (too scared of dying).
But exsisting hurts...a lot...
I've never been mentally ill just tics which are getting better...at least something's getting better.
If she sends me to psychiatrist or a mental hospital...I don't care...not my problem...
If she doesn't...same opinion.
I ruined my life in the previous country...and here it isn't getting better.
I can't even defend myself phisically or verbally if I get hit because then ""we are even""(In school
I isolated myself...better than gettig hurt...
When i told my mom I give up she said ""You wont give when it come to school. (Grades and stuff)"" I said that I give up. I'm just a stupid worthless piece of garbage who doesn't have a future...so wgy even bother.
She is still probably angry...and I don't care...even though I'm nit glad I probably hurt her feelings...I don't care...

New info:

Well, before my mom left for work we were talking about the situation. She told me she sent an email to the head of the year teacher and to the principal...although even if it gets rid of bullies I still won't un-isolate myself.
I gave everyone(students and teacher) a chance...and they didn't do anything...
After I told my mom I can't forgive her she told me that if I'm angry at her, she'l be angry at me...and stuff about how I can't be angry at the world.
I mean, if I can't be angry at school or at home...what am I supposed to do?
Just suck it up and ignore it...
I mean...it hurt a bit to tell her that I won't forgive her for what she's said...but if I can't forgive her, I just can't.
I'm a normal-ish person(tics that are calming a bit make look a bit...weird(blinking weirdly and some other)) and she told me that I'll have to see a therapist.(It was an epty threat. She won't act on it) And she's telling me some ""You're different"" BS.
I mean, if I am different how am i supposed to make it in life...
I won't forgive her...anyone...
Now I am trully alone in this mess...well being with no friends for 4 or 5 years now sucks...but having my own mother basically call me insane just hurts...
My head is a mess rn...but if I'm not allowed to feel anger towards this...or anything...I'm done.
I just don't care about anything or anyone...I don't want to care...
Even my hobbies fon't make me happy anymore...they have my attention...but in the end just feel...empty.
I can laugh at memes or jokes...but mostly I'm just a dull idiot and a failure as a student, son and a person...
And yes I know I didn't experience ""life"" yet...but to me if the adult life is even harder...than to me it just isn't worth it...
And even if bullies stop...the damage is done...
There rumors about me how I'm retarded and some other...
I'm not religious but...they can all go to hell gor what i care.

Anyway, thanks for reading..."

Im sure in 2 days or whatever Ill be normal again, until something happens and then for weeks Ill be a mess.

Idk. I don't even know how to communicate properly how I'm feeling to those around me. I just feel very isolated and alone. I feel like nothing is real sometimes. Like im empty inside. Like life is so pointless and meaningless there is literally no reason to leave my bed all day.

I cant stand being alone and nothing brings me joy anymore. I try to talk to people but it doesnt help. I just get more sad when I feel dismissed or misunderstood or they just sit there in silence.

It's like there's been a timer stuck onto my skin that I can't see and I feel like a disappointment to the 3 or less people I've felt a reason to live around. Honestly, I'd be surprised if I made it to Valentines Day. I'm surprised I've even made it this long. 

It's not like I'm a case of stuck in the mud. It's me trying to accept that I am going to die before my next birthday, and that's so scary.

1005,Moving back home after a year abroad is killing me,"I spent 2019 in South Korea for language studies and an ""adventure"" before I enter university and life ""moves on for real"" and it was the most amazing (and hardest) time of my life. 

Only problem is now I'm back home, in my parents house, in the same job as before leaving that I don't enjoy and basically everyone I consider close are still in Korea and I don't know how to deal. 

Before leaving for Korea I had started having some issues with simple things like basic hygiene which then moved on to binge eating and drinking alone at night in my room and I feel myself slipping back there. I cry every night, I feel trapped and I feel like my life is on hold again. The alcohol and food hasn't come into the picture yet but that is more because of a lack of money than anything.

I had a life there! And I felt like I got the chance to figure out who I am and feel like myself for once. Now I'm home alone during the day (since I work in the afternoon) then go to work where I coach children and then come back home again. The only me I'm putting out there is the ""professional"" me which is highly limited because like I said I work with children. And everyone I know and care for except my close family is scattered all over and I can't see them. 

I don't want to be a whiny little child, I have a job, I'm applying for university and have a plan to move away if I get in so there's hope for things getting better. But my fear is, what if it doesn't? My life there was so vastly different, I don't know if I'll ever be able to reach that again, should I strive to go back? Or am I just trying to make it better in my head than it actually was because I'm sad? I'm so frustrated, I didn't even use to have reddit but I needed an outlet that isn't followed by my family"
1006,is feeling empty always bad ?,"my friend is the cold type and he says himself that he's not great at empathy and quite apathetic. whenever i ask him how he is it's either the obligatory ""fine"" or just meh. today he said he feels nothing, no emotions at all and while this isn't the normal state i got so worried.. he's a bit closed off, it's hard to get to him and whenever i try to help him he says that it's me who have issues, which i do, but so does he !! is this something to worry about ? i want nothing more but to make him happier, whatever it takes. how ? help !! :("

1009,TW: Sexual abuse.,"Hey, I'm a victim of sexual abuse, when I was 15 I lost my virginity to a 24 year old man, I was in a very toxic relationship until now I finally got rid of it, now, the thing is I want to forget everything that happened with him and forget I had been involved with that abusive person, my question is, how do I overcome with that trauma, last week I told my therapist about it, but I still can't figure out how to finally stop feeling bad, can someone please give me advice?"
1010,I swear I'm not even human,"So I'm 18 year old guy who is a senior in high school. I feel like I'm not even human. I have a couple friends but no ""real"" friends. They just talk over me to show their alpha maleness bullshit. Of course if they posted this I would be the bad guy. So I guess don't judge them too harshly. They can be funny too. I have never gone to any parties. Hell I've talked to my friends outside of school only a handful of times over discord. Other than that I have never left home. I'm pretty sure most people don't even think I exist. I'm really nerdy, just today I picked up ""Capitalism without Capital"" from the local library. I listed to Peter Zeihan and Industry 4.0 about emerging economic trends. I fucking hate that about me. Of course I'm an immature 18 year old little prick getting advice from 14 year olds. Man up. When I was 14 I was dumber than a can of paint. Because of my shyness, everyone thinks I'm extremely naive and innocent. Especially naive. 2 Different girls liked me for the longest time (1 just got a boyfriend) But everyone thinks I'm extremely naive. Like I know what they're doing but I'm just so anxious. Of course what do I know. Maybe they're all just more developed humans than me. Worst of all, I don't use social media. Never have and TBH it's WAY too late. Feels so lonely. As a person that reads studies, ""Social Media Makes Teens More Lonely and Depressed"" bullshit. How can connecting yourself to the world make you lonely. A city that connects itself to a railroad makes it more connected to others? See what I mean about this nerd shit? Sorry for ranting. No one probably read this but if you did, thanks."
1011,"Possible mix of ADHD, OCD and Depression ?","Hello,  


I am a 21 year old troubled youth who can't seem to live his life due to possible mental illness. I have not seen a professional regarding my problems, so I can only share my own less than amateur observations on my mental health deficiencies.  I am not even sure how I should organize my thoughts, but I'll try my best.   


All my life I've considered myself as a sort of glorified third wheel. I was characterized as a helpful, friendly, intelligent and hard working person that will eventually lead a good life, without ever being considered as a top performer. I never felt like the hero of a story, but rather as a high quality background character. I always sensed ... mercy and doubt in the good words that have been bestowed upon me. This has never irritated me, as I considered myself lucky to get this kind of appreciation. I was a normal kid and teen : I liked playing video games, watching shows and youtube videos and talking to my friends. I never had any passions and I always felt that my life isn't special. This did not bother me, since all I wanted was a nice job and eventually a nice relationship. As I got older (high school to university) I got even more compliments and appreciations, being considered a top student with potential. I never felt like that, I was the same typical teen that binged on youtube videos and games all day with the occasional interesting computer algorithm or critical analysis essay. For the past few years, I've started to feel that maybe I really am a person capable of doing great things, as I found myself sharing a lot of views with very intelligent people and even impressing myself with some of my intellectual works for school. The problem is that I never could truly show my potential, and thus a big rift had started to form. On one hand, I've noticed that my ""intellectual depth"" is similar of that of people I considered to be intelligent. On the other hand, I flunked a lot of exams and made a lot of stupid mistakes. I feel like a bridge is missing and it's starting to take its toll on me... .I always find myself ignoring useful and smart thoughts due to lack of confidence and self esteem. I would always search to see if I had similar thoughts to other intelligent people in order to validate myself, to the point it actually became an obsession. My mental state has deteriorated a lot this past year and I do not know what to do. I have barely slept these past few days and my brain is pretty much fried. Below I'll briefly explain why I believe I have a certain disorder. I do not know if this kind of discussion is allowed (I have checked the rules, it seems like it is but I might be wrong), but it would help me a lot if a person with some knowledge with these disorders could chime in ... .  


Possible OCD diagnosis based on my thought pattern :   
\- like I said above, I tend to obsessively analyze other intelligent persons' thought patterns in order to determine if we have something in common  
\- lately I have developed an obsession with IQ tests and thus I did a lot of online ones. I've always wanted to believe in human potential, as I think that the human mind is great and...to be honest, i've always liked helping people through teaching. I've always thought that if you can go to the gym to become pretty strong, why couldn't you also study ? The human mind is the center of it all, after all... .Also, life is fun because we achieve great things within our limitations and society would collapse if the common man wouldn't be able to work in intellectual domains. This is why I hate myself for becoming obsessed with those.   
\- if I were to describe my thought pattern with an analogy, I'd say that my thoughts are like a rocket that fails to take off, as if the gravitation pull of the earth was too strong. I'd see the big picture, sense the logic pathways I'd need to take but this ""gravitation"" would be too strong...it's like I want to complete a circle with a string but all I can achieve is a pendulum  
\- I fear that a car will hit me and I'll become paralyzed from the waist down  
\- I twitch my head muscles a lot  
\- I pinch my abdomen skin (I used to be fat) and now I need to use a depigmentation cream in order to repair the skin  
\- I'm scared of the possibility that a future girlfriend would hit me in the genitals (this one is pretty weird, I know...)  
\- it always took me 1 hour to fall asleep due to racing thoughts and I've developed full blown insomnia recently  
\- i need to check youtube every 10 minutes. I also used to make youtube videos (gameplay videos) and I can't play video games without feeling the need to record the gameplay session  
\- during the day I feel like my neighbors are watching me  
\- when I move my eyes, I feel like I'm moving them on the contour of a rectangular shape, not on a pathway described by a circle  
\- I am a very slow reader, I read 3 pages per hour because I tend to over analyse every single word...like really dig into each one. For some reason, listening to music really speeds up the process, as I read 40-60 pages per hour when doing so.  
\- I need to listen to music/a podcast every time I do something  


Possible ADHD diagnosis :  
\- I can't concentrate for more than 10 minutes on a task, I need to take frequent breaks  
\- sometimes I get really happy and I just want to cherish the moment, also I tend to flail my hands a lot when I'm alone and I'm happy (weird, I know, I've done this since I was a kid)  
\- sometimes my thoughts are so overwhelming that my mind just shuts down  


Possible Depression diagnosis :  
\- I do not have any passion in life. This is why I believe I am not intelligent. Every single intelligent person seems to have wandered about the world since they were infants, or I never truly cared... . I like doing research, investigating and helping people, but I can't bring myself to study or even to enjoy hobbies...I do not have hobbies actually..I just daydream all day.  
\- I found myself believing that I have no rational reason to live  
\- lately I've been breaking down and crying a lot  
\- I don't have a desire do drink water and I barely eat  
\- I am very lonely and my social skills are lacking....I desire a relationship but I do not think that I could provide anything order than a negative influence. I feel like everybody deeply dislikes me for some reason.  


As a 2 year old I was referred to a psychiatrist due to the fact that I barely spoke. The psychiatrist administered me, I believe at least, an intelligence test and concluded that ""not only am I intelligent, but very intelligent and that I speak so little because I'm just lazy"". She did not provide a score and, given the reputation of my country's healthcare system, I am not even sure if she even did all the sub tests of a cognitive test. I feel like a fraud that has been fed false compliments and I do not know what to do. Is it possible that my possible conditions are negatively affecting my executive cognitive functions and thus I can't properly function ? Am I just a typical frustrated milennial ? I don't know, honestly. Thank you for reading this long post and any input is greatly appreciated !"
1012,I'm such an awful person,"Sorry for the wall of text and sorry if it's hard to read or understand.

My empathy has been fading before my eyes and I've only recently noticed. When someone is upset, I don't care unless I'm affected by the reason they're upset. I don't think ""What can I do to help?"" when someone talks about negative feelings, I think ""Oh my god, I don't care, please shut the fuck up."". Hell, today my best friend said in a vent discord channel she was going to get off of all texting apps and stop talking to people irl for a bit because she feels like a bad person, and my first reaction was to roll my eyes and think ""Whatever, talk to me again when you stop being a bitch."". I still care about my friends and I'd prefer them to be happy, but when they're upset I don't care and am even annoyed by it. The only person I feel a noticeable amount of empathy towards is my boyfriend. The only other time I'm empathetic at all is when someone's laughing. Even if nothing is funny, if someone is laughing, it's near impossible for me to not laugh with them. I don't show my lack of empathy when I'm around people, I actually pretend to care so they don't hate me or feel even worse. I listen with a concerned look on my face, and give a bit of advice if needed. But in reality I just want them to shut up. I'll never ask if someone is ok, because I don't want to deal with their problems and sobbing. I used to genuinely want to cheer up my friends and care about their problems, but now I'm like a shell of them. I used to have food intentions, but look at me now. I'm just an unempathetic loser who only has people who care because they pretend to care about their problems. If they knew I didn't care about their problems, they'd all ghost me, and I wouldn't blame them. I hate myself more than I did previously for being like this. This empathy loss just adds to my never-ending suffering. I'm a failure of a human being. I'm better off dead. I'm a toxic person and don't deserve care and love. I don't really care if anyone responds, because I deserve what I give, no empathy. I just needed somewhere to put this. I hope someday soon I'll get a chance to kill myself. If you read all of this, I'm sorry for wasting your time."
1013,Has anyone experienced their individual symptoms AFTER having mono or another Epstein-Barr related issue?,"If so, how long after did it take for symptoms to appear? How long after were you diagnosed?


Did you experience a high fever while battling Epstein-Barr? How high?


Were you experiencing symptoms before? If so, did they increase in severity or intensity after having the virus?


If comfortable sharing, what it's your current mental illness diagnosis? (Again, this is optional, so there is no pressure or expectation to answer.)


Thank you! 💙"
1014,Hello. I’m not sure I’m in the right place and forgive me if I’m not but I’m looking for some advice.,A friend of a close friend has tried to take their own life twice this week. I’m looking for some help in what I can say to my friend to make them feel even a tiny bit better about this situation. I’m not very good with this sort of thing but I can’t not say anything. Any help or advice very much appreciated.
1015,Was I molested By My Father?,"When I was young, around 7 all the way to around 10 I was very quiet an mentally disturbed. I never was able to piece what happened that made me so shy an scared but yet sexually over active at a very young age. I was into sex an pornography since I was in elementary school. I could say it was due to my mom sexualizing her self as a stripper/prostitute, along with the many men I heard her sleep with at a very young age. I’ve always felt like I was wrong for the way I grew up even though it was never my fault, it was something I was born into. I bring all of this up to speak on the behalf of my father. When I met him after the incarceration of my mother things always seemed like I was a sort of hated favorite of his.
He was more cruel to me then he was my 2 younger brothers. He would state things like my moms drug use and loss of her kids as a way to hurt me when I was bad. He always said I was the worst out of all of the 3.  Now when I was young an taking showers an baths he would always be there for not only me but my brothers as well. He would always wash very normal then proceed to take longer amounts of time handling my penis an butt. After bathing he would take us in his room an tell us to lay on his bed where he put lotion on us. He would always look at my lower half while pumping lotion, the first times he bathed me. Just as I stated with the baths an showers he would also take excessive amounts of time rubbing lotion on the lower half of my body.  As I grew to be a teenager he started a “joke” stating that I had a big butt. I always thought this as nothing but now I feel that it’s strange for a father to comment on his sons butt. What I would really want is for you guys to give any opinions you have. I’d like to know if this sounds strange or normal to anyone else, if so please give advice as it’s very much needed at the moment. Thank you all."
1016,"I feel like there is so many things wrong with me, and I don't know how to explain it","So just recently I started seeing a new counselor and I ran into a little issue. After feeling like there is something wrong with me I finally went to my new counselor to talk. But the problem was that I didn't really explain the things that were bothering me, or what I felt was wrong. I wasn't lying to my counselor, I just didn't know how to say what I felt was going wrong. I've realized that it's easier for me to type the real issues out instead of talking about them in person. So here I go:

Several months ago is when it really started. I got into an argument with my parents and they kicked me out, after being kicked out 3 times, I had enough and made the choice to move out. My first roommate was awful, worst person you could ever meet, stole my stuff, lied all the time and was just a terrible person. It was at this time I started experimenting with 'heavier' drugs, before this happened I was only smoking weed, as it helped ease my mind at the end of the day. The drugs I started to use were magic mushrooms and acid, never tried anything else besides them. After moving out from that roommate, living closer to my work and basically in a much better living situation, I thought all the symptoms I was feeling would go away. It's been almost 3 weeks since and although the symptoms have died down a bit, they are definitely still there, or at least I think they are.

The best way to put it all into one phrase of how I'm feeling is 'emotionally confused' I should mention that I'm 18 years old, male, if that helps anyone reading this. I feel intense emotions, but I don't know what the emotions I'm feeling are half the time. Obviously I know what sadness feels like, and what anger feels like, but when it comes to the more uncommon emotions, I have no clue what those emotions are. When I talk to my friends about these kinds of things and they use a word to describe an emotion that I or they are talking about, I usually have to ask what that emotion means. Like just a month ago I learned what apathy was. Never heard of it before that. One important thing to mention is that I never really felt many emotions until I was in my mid teen years (14-16)

Now to dig deeper into the problem, the most common ones I feel is paranoia, anxious and doubt. Everything, and I mean everything good that happens I always question when something bad is going to happen to ruin the moment. I can't trust most of my friends, and even close family too. Even my friend that I've been friends with for over 14 years, I still don't trust him much. I have trouble holding conversation with people I don't know too well. I struggle to keep eye contact and I tend to be pretty monotone when I talk to others. This makes it really hard to expand my friend circle which people tell me I should do but I don't even think I want to.

I thinks it's worth talking about my past a bit. I have 2 brothers, both are older and both picked on me since I can remember. They stopped when I was in my early-mid teen years. I can't quite remember but I think I recall my mother never showing any sort of protection or care when I was being bullied by my brothers. I was also bullied a lot in elementary, and middle school, although to be fair I did some bullying too. High school the bullying proceeded but wasn't as bad, still a terrible experience overall. My final year of high school was when the bullying really stopped.

I just want to know what I can do to feel normal, or at least like there is nothing wrong with me. There is so much I wanted to go over and I probably missed a lot. If you have any questions or need clarification, please ask. Thanks reddit!"
1017,I need some advice,"If I take 10 different depression tests and they all come back as moderate  to extremely severe should I talk to someone, and if so can I do so anonymously?"
1018,Teenage Social Trauma?,"From the age of 13, I feel that I have been suspected to like a lot of social trauma. Right now, I am an 18 year old senior high school student, and I just feel that something is not right. From the age of 13 I was severely bullied and degraded and rejected by numerous groups, for my effeminate personality, and I feel that is where the entire problem happened. And on top of that discovering I was gay was not easy seeing I grew in a society where it is illegal. I engaged in various acts that probably made it worse when I thought it made it better, like messaging strangers online, or trying to fit in a group that constantly made me feel bad about myself. Or even taking substances. And coming out to the wrong people in the hope I would gain validation. Right now, I feel that I am so much confident, however at least two times a week I feel I am not myself and feel horrible of who I am and what I want to do. I feel like I am Jules from Euphoria; constantly looking for validation in the wrong areas for my identity and constantly being done wrong by everyone."
1019,How do you meet people (friends or dates) when you're depressed?,Right now I'm in this mental state that I have nothing positive to talk.  How can I pick myself up from this low point?
1020,Starting that slippy slope,Trying to cope is trying to kill me. Just holding on. Feel like I'm not being heard. Feel like it's more than just depression.
1021,Feeling lonely,"Ok, as the title states, I feel lonely...pretty damn lonely at that. But I have people around me that I consider really good friends but I still feel genuinely lonely. The post isn’t meant for any sympathy but just trying to figure out why.

I always read about how loneliness can cause significant health problems and that freaks me out btw. But the friends I have are ones that I can’t open up to, I feel like they don’t take what I say about how I feel seriously and I hate talking about my feeling to my family too for some reason.

So that leaves me with all these thoughts and emotions bottled up to myself and I feel that’s not going to be good for me in the long run. I don’t know if what I’ve said makes sense but that’s the best way I can describe it but any advice or whatever someone can offer will be well appreciated."
1022,"Damnit, I’m fucking depressed again.","I’m pretty sure I’m bipolar. I had a strange experience at the beginning of the semester, and now that I’ve looked it up, it seems to have been a “hypomanic episode.” I was just feeling great for about a week, then I crashed, and now I feel depressed.

I was taking adderall at the time, but I don’t think that triggered it. I think it was the stress. I only took about 10-20 milligrams a day, anyways. That isn’t enough to account for the extreme mood swings I felt. I dunno though.

Last semester, I got mental health help for adhd and depression, took care of myself, didn’t overwork myself, and in a few months the symptoms cleared up. I was perfectly fine this summer. Now, I’m two weeks into school, and it’s back just like that. Three 300 level classes, a 400 level class, and 15 hours of work was just too much. Now, I can’t get through a day without constantly beating myself up and wanting to put a bullet through my brainstem.

It’s really strange. I could actually feel it set in over a few days. I didn’t understand what it was, but it all clicked together about an hour ago. For that first week, I was able to work really hard, and I did really good. I got a lot done. And it felt really good. I think I felt better than I’ve ever felt in my life. I was content. I hardly slept, but still performed well. I talked a lot, and my mind was always racing.

But then, I slowed down. Over about 3 days, I just ran out of all motivation. I started hating myself, criticizing everything I did, and then, the suicidal thoughts came right back.

I’m fucked, and no amount of caffeine or adderall will help me. 

I think that my depression is something that I will never be able to beat. This means I will never be able to own a gun, and I may never really be able to be functional in society."
1023,Aversion to therapy,"I can’t think of a time when talk therapy has helped me. At this stage the main problem would be that I can’t open up about how bad things really are. I can’t go inpatient. My ex filed for emergency custody of my son last time that happened, and it took forever to fight that and get things back to normal. So i hate when people suggest therapy as such a strong cure for everything. I’d go in and be like “I’m a shit person, and I don’t deserve to live” and be admitted immediately."
1024,DBT? Where to start?,"Ok so I have been to therapy and have seen a psychiatrist before but at the moment I can't afford anything like that and even online therapy is too expensive. I was told that I have bpd traits and have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd. I was given a dbt workbook at a mental hospital years ago that I have tried to work on but it's hard to stick with it and remember the skills. I really do want to learn how to deal with my mental health issues though because its getting really difficult to manage my emotions and has caused a lot of problems for me in life and has sabotaged relationships etc. I guess I just want advice on where to start and how to stay motivated because a lot of the time its hard for me to stick with one thing and I usually get bored or just don't want to face the things that I feel."
1025,Creepy fam,"My ""fam"" is extra creepy. They're all SUPER Catholic, and any tiny opinion that you have that isn't theirs, they freak out about. They're trying to take me to COURT because they've trapped my in their house since moving back 7 years ago, I'm 27, and they've tried to get an order saying that they need to know where I'm going when I ""take their car"" after not having one for months at a time. Residence is out in country, the only way to get to a job. They treat me like shit and have trying to feed me ""behavioral"" drugs since I was a child, and blame every problem they have on me. My dad says the weirdest fucking twisted shit, he can't take any type of situation seriously unless he potentially looks bad, when he lashes out. I went to COURT because they said I didn't wash dishes of clean up like I'm a fucking child. They treat me like a child, they both ACT like children, and my dad is weirdly sexual. He puts an innuendo on everything in the most subliminal ways like I got a blanket for Christmas once and he was like ""isn't it  SOFT""  and everyone just ""ignores"" because it's so subliminal and so creepy that my mom just pauses and goes about her day like the abuse is right in front of everyone's face. I've been labeled not psychologically sane because the town I'm near is Republican at and basically a sinkhole and I DON'T hear or see thing but have symptoms of TRAUMA. I can't be around them and sometimes sleep outside away from them because the vibes are just so wack. I'm fucking sick of missing important shit that would get me away from here and it's like the abuse is timed JUST SO  so that I'll miss certain things. I had a job working for them and was fucking miserable with all the misogyny and racism there, and was looked down on when I would show up later and later which is super uncharaterostic of me because I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE. My dad, his brothers, and their dad all are creepy as hell and I'm not the only one who thinks so. I never had anyone over as child because I just didn't want to have to go through explaining why everything was so weird and strict, like eating times and shit. They use the premise of doing everything together as a scapegoat for being creepy as hell. Worst of all, I get hella bad vibes some days like today where I just have to leave, and the dude tries to make me feel bad or some shit. I have literally been doing chores there and taking care of kids since I was as a kid and they are trying to drag back to that mentality. No I need to leave but my windshield wipers are broken and it's snowing and my dad fucking waits for these fucking instances to be the most creepy and says inappropriate shit. I tried calling the cops, but they said ""if there's nothing physically going on, then we can't just pick you up."" This is all some.fucking bullshit and I feel overly groomed. I'm not crazy and everyone I talk to is typically hella surprised when I mention all the hospital visits and ""medications"" because I'm a fucking regular person that has only ever tried to do the ""right thing"" but I have been stretched way to far. My dad lays on this soft beanbag at night just watching TV and being talked at like a child and talking about how he ""can't sleep"" like he's trying to talk in some fucking weird ass ""sensual"" voice like no one notices. I know where I could go but typically it's the means. I kick myself daily for not leaving because there's a bad feeling looming but back of the head thought is like ""things shouldn't be too bad, today."" That thought is never not a lie."
1026,I'm falling back into a dark place.,"I normally only come on reddit when I start lossing hope so here I am. For months I was extremely depressed and didn't care or put effort in. I stopped eating and lost alot of weight ( I'm already very skinny). I also started hurting myself. Around new years I started to feel like myself. I started doing things in school, talking, taking care of myself and eating. Recently I've been getting worse and I'm scared of going further then before. I dont want to die and have no intention on doing it, I don't think I'd be able to anyway. But I'm starting to skip meals and have hurt myself 2 times so far this year. I don't know what to do. I started talking to a psychiatrist recently but I haven't told them much and I'm trying to build up courage but it so hard right now."
1027,How do i know that i am feeling something?," 

# Hey guys,

I really dont know if i do feel or not. How do i know, if i do so? And how if i dont? (Im 21 yo and a Male)

Im not stupid, i know what feelings are and i know when people are feeling it. But i really dont know if i do. How do i recognize that? Im feeling a big Void in me in a negative way. It makes my life boring and i dont have any reasons to move on, on life. Im struggling to find a Job, because how boring it is to find one..

Dont get me wrong im not Lazy. If i want something and find it impressing then im gonna do everything about it. I used to be addicted to Oxycontin and i did many things in a Day to get the Pills.

And no my life didnt got boring right after i got addicted. It was the reason why i did get addicted at all.

I do have Hobbys like reading Books and playing Games but they do bore me too sometimes, that i dont want to go after my hobbys.

I did nothing today. I did nothing today to get a Job or something. Just Useless things like now sitting on the PC.

I dont have any real contacts right now, i live with my Mother and my Brother who is Retarded (Physically).

My dad was never there for me, so i didnt mention him, also he doesnt live with us anymore since 2 years.

EDIT: Im Obsessed with Acting, Music and Movies. My Dream is to become an Actor, but it is hard to start with it. I dont even know where i have to Start. Im a master at Acting since im a Kid.

When i was a young Kid, my Grandpa (God rest his soul) was panicing when i was playing dead to make a Joke. I did let my Mother and him Panic a while and got up when they wanted to call 911. My mother was crying but i couldnt even understand why. My Grandpa said i have to Apologize and i was wondering why the hell?

Now i do and i can even understand them. But like i said i dont know if i really feel them. I never really felt Love aswell. I can tell that because i see People crying over Love and something but i never did have such problems. i didnt even had a real Relationship with a Woman in my whole life. The only Love i know is the love to my Mother and my brother. But i dont know if its really Love. I would say i would die for them but i did lie many times to my family at the same time. I did Manipulate her too much, that she cant even trust me anymore. But she knows im trying my best to get my life together! Im writing too much.. cya in the comments."
1028,An example of why you shouldn’t bottle things up,"I never fit in in primary school. I was smart and got high grades but I didn’t fit in with the other kids and they also didn’t let me for one reason. I was ginger. Eventually I thought this was normal to be left out/ told I couldn’t do things because of who I was and it got to the point where I wasn’t enjoying any aspect of school. It just got worse over time and people started punching me and one time all my classmates held me while someone charged into me. Anyways I gave up trying to fit in and just waited for primary school to end because no matter who I asked nothing was fine about it. It did eventually and I moved on and put all of that in the past. But now I learn repressed trauma is a thing and that it could be causing me the extreme unexplained pain in my feet and the depression and anxiety I’m facing. What I’m saying is don’t bottle things up. It may be better in the moment but it can really fuck things up later on.  

TLDR I got bullied and that’s causing severe issues today (5 years later)"
1029,Patterns pop out at me? And things are bigger than they are supposed to be?,It’s kinda been happening a lot and I get so fixated on seeing the patterns. Like the spaces between writing in a book or brick walls. And then my vision feels like it shifts and if I’m looking at a wall or the room it self it moves down like not actually but visually. This also happened with teachers at school except they move like a foot up and look taller or wider than they usually do. Is there a name for this????? Not looking to self diagnose I just need to know people feel this way to and I’m not actually going crazy and I’m okay pls pls if someone knows anything about this or has it let me know
1030,Life recently has kind of sucked and I need to vent,"life's been tough... mom left recently, and I learned she was probably schizophrenic due to some symptoms. I feel lonely at school, and i have a decent rep for being super smart, and funny at times but i want people to know me for who i am y'see? I want to make friends, but im having a little trouble due to me being shy af. I think i could by meeting new people through friends i have.  back in elementary the popular girls thought i was some sorta weirdo except one. Ended up crushing on her, but i never told her it went away and we stayed good friends and i lost contact with her and it sucks"
1031,"""friends""","So my ""Friends"" and i were talking and it got into depression and killing yourself and they said you will fo to hell if you kill yourself and they said its dramatic to kill yourself can skmeone tell me what to say to them so they dont act like this"
1032,Just want to let these out,"First off I'm going to say I've never been diagnosed for any mental health, nor have I gone to any kind of assistance such as a psychologist, therapist etc.

What I do know is that looking back I feel like I've been on a decline since high school. When I enrolled to senior high, which was a different school than the one I go to from primary &amp; junior high, there were times that I remember I tried avoiding the gaze/greetings of classmates because I was worried they were making fun of me. I think I slowly got over it over the course of 3 years in senior high though. 

Then came uni. First semester I only barely passed the courses I needed. I'll admit back then it was partly due to my mistake of not properly doing what was necessary or making the necessary sacrifices because I was enjoying my comfort zone too much. But this is where I feel my issues started. 

Ever since that first semester I basically always felt like shit. I felt like I was stuck in a cycle. I know I should fix things going forward and actually go out of my comfort zone for once and make the sacrifices I needed, but then I tend to overthink about the results and how am I going to go through the process. What if I'm just inadequate and look like an idiot? What if I'm actually not up to the task &amp; responsibilities? Eventually I graduated rather late with barely passing grades.

Then here I am today. Just got a new job, and all I could think about is the worst case about not meeting expectations. I often feel especially anxious meeting new people ever since my uni days. I did the job interview I felt like I was swept up off my feet by the interviewer and just went along with it. Couldn't stand my ground just because they were pushing me to make a decision on the spot. Doesn't help that I haven't got a job for almost a year since getting out of the last one just 2 months before my year long contract ended because I couldn't stand my mentality.

Add to all this is my always being reluctant to have an actual talk with my parents, because nowadays even I don't think I know what I actually want to do or am passionate about. Most of last year went by with me mostly choosing escapism which probably looked like all I'm doing is laze around to my parents. They don't really lash out about it but they always say to me every once in a while to find a job soon. 

Thats all I could think of for now. Do I actually need to seek help or is it just me being dumb and lazy? Do I just have to actually get out and have a real talk with my parents? Do ask if you need to know further."
1033,Having conversations with one's self?,I talk to myself out loud sometimes.  I have conversations with myself.  Do any of you guys?
1034,I feel so lonely,"I've no close friends at school, let alone a gf. I haven't really dated someone and now I'm already 20. I feel stresses and anxieties constantly. Recently, it is getting worse. now idk what's the point of going to class and study. Even if I got good grades, I still can't have a friend due to my low self-esteem and confidence."
1035,Is it normal to go between periods of time where you think your life is going great only to fall back into a depression so fast?,"I've been having this off and on battle with feeling depressed for around 5 years now, I go through a period of a month to 3 where I feel utterly hopeless and lost and nothing seems to be going right, and then it just goes away and I'm happy again for a month or 2 and then everything starts to add up and I get pushed back into a depression. Is this normal? Am I not even depressed?"
1036,What may be my problem?,"I have these symptoms:

1. ***Extremely*** Socially Inhibited *Subconsciously*.


2. *Extremely* Uncomfortable to Be Looked At and Look At Others.


3. Chronic Earworm.


4. Hypersensitive to Sensory Stimuli.


5. Extreme Social Burnout, Exhaustion.


6. Acute Persecutory Awareness.


7. Intrusive Thoughts.


8. Chronic Tinnitus."
1037,Kinda miss having anxiety??,"So I used to have really bad anxiety and have panic attacks all the time, and in recent years it’s become almost non existent. The thing is, as bad as it was, anxiety was a great motivator for me and I was always an over achiever. Now nothing motivates me and I don’t ever want to do anything anymore.."
1038,my whole life is a daily reminder of the mistake that my damn mother made with my shitty as fuck father,"they both SEE the mistake they both made. and tbh, i agree with them. ever since my mother born me, i have been causing them both nothing but pain tbh. idk how to stop this shit"
1039,What's living with ADHD like?,I think I might have ADHD bit I don't know. It's kind of wierd because I never thought about it until my teachers started telling me all sort of stuff. I didn't know what was wrong with(still don't) so I kind of tried researching it. I hope I don't have it because dealing with anxiety is already hard enough as it is. So I'm curious. What's it like to live with ADHD? What are the symptoms? How do you personally deal with it?
1040,Using humor as a tool to help deal with mental illness,"I was on fb earlier and made a comment on a post that was telling people to stop using the mental hospital tagging game because it's damaging to those who are mentally ill. I made a post with a psych ward joke and said that most people that I have run into who are mental health patients often joke about their illnesses and some experiences. I also said if you don't know anything about how we deal with it then you shouldn't preach about what we should or shouldn't do. Basically meaning if you're not mentally ill, you have no room to say anything about how someone chooses to tackle their situation. Some people took offense to it. Personally, and my former and current therapists agree, I think it's perfectly healthy to find a way to lighten the situation up so that it doesn't weigh you down. Anyone else agree? Or disagree?"
1041,It's okay to disconnect,"Hello all,

I just wanted to remind you that it's okay to disconnect. You don't need social media or the internet constantly. If you're fighting mental illness it can help disconnecting for a while or limiting your use to things that you truly enjoy. I myself have made a slow transition away from Facebook, Twitter to prevent myself from feeling depressed or anxious about what's going on in the world. Focus on you and managing your (mental) health. I hope this post finds you well, and that you know it gets better."
1042,I cannot feel any human connection and cannot make friends,"I've always struggled a lot with making friends. I do not feel any ""connection"" to people. I dont really care that much, though. I have many friends but no close or real friendships. I can be very extroverted and enjoy social events but it is like a facade. There is nothing behind interactions if that makes sense. I just interact with people for fun / entertainment because I am trying to feel a connection with others / develop real friendships but I cant...why is this?"
1043,Family makes a mockery of my depression.,"I want to preface this that I used to live on my own, I'm 30 years old and unfortunately lost my job and most of my money due to depression and have since been put on disability because of it. Losing that job made it impossible to live on my own so I moved back in with my parents unfortunately.

Well with depression i really gave up on hygiene a lot. Teeth, showers, wearing clean clothes. so I went and had a shower tonight just come down stairs for my mom saying ""you had a shower? did you shit yourself?""  (because I have IBS and some other medical issues and its been hard to control sometimes. Its happened but not often) and they both laughed. Instead of positive reinforcement with cleaning myself i just get knocked down a notch. 

I dont shower as often as I should I know this
and im working on it, but i dont want to be made fun of for it
Literally saying nothing is better than saying ""did you shit yourself?"" I wish i could live alone again at least then i wont be made a joke of"
1044,Uncontrollable anger,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for a long time, but recently I’ve been having trouble with controlling my emotions as well. When I get mad, it’s extreme anger and what’s worse is that I can’t let it go. Before, going to the gym, playing basketball, or even just controlling my breathing would help me control it. But now this anger stays with me for the longest period of times and nothing makes it go away. It also results in me saying or doing things that I end up regretting. Does anyone else have the same problem and if so how do you deal with it"
1045,How do I tell my psychiatrist that I won't be going to our sessions anymore?,"Hey Everyone! I'm not sure if this is the right sub but I hope you can help me.

I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago and I have been going to a psychiatrist since. Last month my usual psychiatrist was not available for our scheduled sessions. I tried to reschedule our sessions multiple times but his assistant would never respond to my messages. I also tried to contact him but he would just tell me to contact his assistant. During that time I found a psychiatrist who had significantly cheaper rates and was closer to where I live. I am also a lot more comfortable with that psychiatrist. Just now my previous psychiatrist messaged me the schedule for pur supossed sessions this month. How do I tell my psychiatrist that I won't be going to our sessions? I don't want to be rude and just not show up.

Thank you in advance!"
1046,Not remembering childhood/teenage years?,"Does anyone know what can cause this? If it’s normal? Like I remember certain events, but there’s PLENTY I don’t remember. 

I have friends who remind me of things that happened when we were teenagers (I’m 27 now) that I have 0 recollection of.

Childhood, same thing. Pictures do not help jog memories at all. I started riding horses when I was like 12 and I can look through old horse show pictures and stuff and have 0 memory of it, if I wasn’t in the picture I would think people were lying to me about being there. This is the same for MANY things in my life.

I do feel like it’s a blessing to some extent because I don’t have to cringe over SO many awkward moments. I definitely dealt with trauma, sexual abuse at a young age (6), then growing up in a very (verbally) abusive environment. Although my mom was psychically abused in front of me regularly. 

Is it just a coping mechanism? Part of me is worried to dig too deep in any type of therapeutic setting like I’ll uncover something serious I’m just avoiding. Idk I guess maybe I’m just a forgetful person and I’m reading too much into it. I just feel left out sometimes when people can recall memories they’ve had growing up and I feel like I can never relate to it."
1047,Who can you trust?,Can you really trust anyone in the world? Even doctors will try to milk out the process of healing your mental illness to make more money. Sure altruism exists to an extent but the fact that it’s possible to manipulate to one’s own gain in the world definitely dooms the ability of those with mental illness to thrive. We’ll just get taken advantage of by the more powerful/intelligent/capable. It makes death seem better than life. And fuck I don’t want to be evil.
1048,Anorexia Support,"I can’t post this in the subs for eating disorders, because they have too many rules.

I’m super stressed and upset. I can feel myself backsliding with my weight. I haven’t eaten in a few days now and I fear that’ll turn into many more to the point where I’m back in inpatient again. I haven’t been in inpatient treatment for many many years now managing to maintain my weight mostly within a certain range. I’m not sure what to do to stop myself this time. Worse is that I’m seeing my psych in a few days and he’s definitely gonna know. I know he won’t put me in inpatient unless I’m really bad off, but I don’t even want the (threat) lecture about that. Not even sure how this post will help me, but giving it a try and pleading for advice. I can’t go back."
1049,I want help but i can’t get it,"no therapist or psychiatrist will listen to me. i’m sick of hearing “get help”, “get a job”, “go to school” when i’ve done all of the above and here i am now"
1050,It’s nealry 4 am I need to get this off my chest,"The other day I was late fr classes, I asked my professor what i’d missed and he basically said, that in a real job at a studio, they won’t tolerate it and id get fired..

I know I getpanic attacks and misophonia bothers me all the tjme especually in the last few classes since everyone has a cold and that goddamn sniffing made me almostpull my hair out...
I skipped this mornings class because of that

Idk why what he said got to me so much when ive heard it a million times from my mom and all, its just that im really trying to do something with my life despite my anxiety, but theres just no point

why am i wasting years and getting into student loan debt when i cant ever get anywhere, I cant be an animator or director since i cant even get to fucking classes on time

i shouldnt have even bothered, I always do shit like this where i think i can do something the  fail so bad at it. I just want my mum right now tbh, but i cant really call her at 4 am just to cry

Everything im doing is a waste, ill never get anywhere like this and idk hwy im still trying"
1051,Ho'oponopono | Healing and Law of Attraction,"Hello Beautiful Souls! Welcome back! In today's video, I will be sharing the power of the ancient Hawaiian prayer, famously used by Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len. This prayer of forgiveness is called Ho'oponopono. It is believed to be so powerful that Dr. Hew Len used it to cure mentally ill patients in psych wards, without physically seeing them!  I am also going to discuss the benefits of Ho'opnopono, how it can help with healing, manifestation, and assist with law of attraction! 

Aside from Fibromyalgia, I have dealt with severe trauma and mental health issues of my own. Studying psychology has equipped me, along with therapy. I have also done a ton of research through self help books, scientific journals, lectures from Dr. Gabor Mate. I am at a better place and would like to help others who may have endured similar experiences and are searching to rebuild themselves through self development, self healing, and become co-creators. We are all alchemists and can change our current situation. Let us meet ourselves where we currently are and explore a newfound healing journey.

Together We Will Grow! Together We Will Heal!

Cheers To New Beginnings!

Sending ya'll tons of positive energy, love, and light!

Namaste,

Rosie

1052,Difference in thought process?,"Sorry if this doesn’t fit here- idk what is but I thought this sub might know the most. 

When my boyfriend goes to do stuff, his thought process is ‘I want to play video games, let’s play video games.’ MY thought process is ‘if I want to play video games I have to get my switch out and turn it on and start the game up,’ or ‘I want to draw, which means I have to grab my computer and plug it in and turn it on and put in the code and wait for it to start up and-‘ and at this point literally doing anything requires motivation or me yelling at myself to get up. 

I feel so lazy at this point and I don’t understand why I have to make things seem so complicated. Suddenly a five minute process seems like it will take half an hour instead, and then I lay around for an hour instead and feel gross. Why do I do this? WHAT is it"
1053,Serious Advice Needed,"I've never really been on this group before, so I'm not sure what the standard rules or etiquette are, so please forgive me if I'm not going about things the right way… 

Until I was five I didn't actually have an official residence. My mother was a whore who was with a different guy every week or two at most (literally, that isn't an exaggeration in the slightest), and she didn't know who my father was until I was a week old. There were six possibilities. I was bounced from house to house before I settle with my grandmother whom was verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive with the occasional physical abuses mixed in. I lived with her until I was 16. I moved in with my dad and his wife (my step mother). She was manipulative, a victim blamer with everything (abuse, rape, molestation, etc., And I found out because when I was forced to open up about the things that happened to me I was blamed for all of it happening to me). She kicked me out in the middle of the night after I lost my job and stole every single penny I had out from under me when I was 18. I was forced to live with my fiance and his family. They've threatened to get rid of my emotional support cat while I was at work so many times I've lost count simply because they hate cats. They call me a liar and turn things around on me all the time. They've become so bad that the preacher refused to marry us because of them. They bleed mine and my fiance's finances so dry that we can't save money to move out. If we refuse to give them money then they badger, gas light, and abuse my fiance and and I until we give in. We've had to delay our bills on multiple occasions because of this. They expect us to do their errands for them and give them money that they don't pay back, but wonder why we stay so depressed and don't like talking to them. At one point they somehow found out we were thinking of trying for a baby (idk how. I honestly feel like they've bugged our room. They know things we've only talked about when no one else was home and we never told anyone else), and I was acussed of being a whore and trapping my fiance. Lastly, my boss keeps contradicting her self and has threatened to fire me over something I did not do on purpose. She expects me to be perfect and refuses to acknowledge any of my mental illnesses and invalidates my emotional issues while claiming to have the same issues and claiming I can go to her. I'm trying to keep the length short, sorry for how vague I'm being. Please give me advice. I have become suicidal and severely depressed yet again and I cannot afford to go to therapy."
1054,Finding enjoyment in hanging out with others.,"I am an introvert but lately I have been trying to break out my shell more than ever. I have always had a ""Fuck It"" mentality that helped me for better or worse. So I have been trying to ask people to hang out but I don't enjoy being around anyone. I feel terrible about it because I feel so selfish. Not only do I not find enjoyment in it but I also come across as dry and just downright socially awkward due to my social anxiety. I feel like I have to fight myself so hard to be social and it tires me out all the time. I mean I have gotten intimate with a female so that isn't a problem for me but I still didn't find enjoyment in seeking a relationship so that never went farther than a hook up. Anyone in the same boat?"
1055,PTSD issues,I can’t even have other people over without freezing up and feeling the same pain from that moment. I would love to be able to have friends over without this happening I don’t know what to do
1056,Anyone diagnosed with narcissism: how were you diagnosed and what were your symptoms?,
1057,Requesting Workplace Accommodations,"I started a new job about three months ago. I work Tuesday-Saturday and have every Sunday and Monday off. Over the past three months, I have missed four or five days. Two of those were due to being sick, had a doctor's note, and the others were due to mental illness. I am bipolar 2 and also have problems with OCD and Depression. I am doing better than I have been since before I got sick 3 to 4 years ago, but I'm still struggling. I go to a psychiatrist every other week to try and get the best help possible. My boss is kind of cold and a little bit of a dick. I had to miss today, and he told me that it seems like I'm sick every two weeks and it was really inconvenient for him. I wasn't going to disclose about my mental illness, but 40 hrs a week is starting to wear on me, and I'm at a point where I feel like I pretty much have to disclose and ask for ADA accommodations to keep my job. Should I talk to him about it or go straight to HR? How would I go about talking to HR? The last two times I disclosed didn't end very well. People seem to take it personally like you're trying to fuck them over and force them to do something which sucks when you genuinely need help. I've found that not many people in the world of business are as kind-hearted as I would like. I'm just scared I'm going to lose a job that I need no matter what I do"
1058,What do you do when you get that overwhelming feeling of angst and depression to make it go away?,"I was in class today and I was listening to one of my students discuss their accolades and it just made me so depressed to see how well ahead my peers are. I've been holding in that blue feeling where I just feel like I want to cry and feel so much angst about where I am when it comes to my degree/major.  I detest the feeling so much and it's been happening so much more often since I transferred schools.

What do you all do to take your mind off of it and push you in more of a positive note?"
1059,Breakups/Separating from people.,"As dumb and cliche as this might sound, why do we love or miss the people who hurt us in our lives?"
1060,Is it normal to have thoughts about death or worst case scenarios?,"I have two kids, a 3.5 year old and a 1.5 year old. I have thoughts about someone kidnapping my kids and my mind starts to create a narrative or plot on what I would have to do in that situation. Like so if the event were to happen, I would know exactly what I had to do to prevent them from fully kidnapping them...or I will have thoughts where they are in danger like there is fire in front of their bedroom door, so I will plan in my head on how I would save them. I have realized that I used to have these kinds of thoughts as kids. I would lay in bed and think about one of my parents dying and how sad it would be and would envision their funeral and how I would cope after the fact. Is this type of thinking normal?? I wouldn’t go as far as to say it interrupts my life or really my well-being. I still go out and function in society. Like I don’t feel like I hide away. But when I am out and about, I’m constantly thinking about how someone could run up at any moment and attack me and steal my kids and so I try to be aware at all times to prevent this from happening. Sometimes I do avoid going out because the day doesn’t “feel” right. Like the chances of something bad happening are “higher than normal.” But it’s not to the point where I’m ruining my quality of life. When I exercise and go on a run, I’m constantly thinking that the car pulling into the neighborhood is going to kidnap me or that someone is hiding in the bushes, but hardly do I ever stop my runs. Like I have these thoughts. I realize that I have kind of always have these thoughts but I wouldn’t go as far as to say they disrupt my life in a negative way. I do feel like I have to be aware at all times because if I am not something bad could happen and I won’t be prepared. Is this normal? I guess I’ve convinced myself that basically if it disrupts your life in a negative way than it’s abnormal and an issue. So is this something that should be explored further or is this normal thinking?"
1061,Confidentiality in school therapist,"I self harm, have an Ed, Severe depression, bad anxiety, am suicidal and have abusive parents. If I told this to them what would happen? Like I cannot tell my parents about my problems but I can’t have child protective services called on them. Would they tell my parents? What would they do? What would happen to me?"
1062,how do i stop paranoid thoughts?,"every time i’m out in public i’m always obsessively watching everyone around me because i’m so paranoid of being followed/stalked. if i get weird vibes from someone in a store, like if i notice them watching me or following me (even though it may be all in my head), i immediately get anxious and try to leave as soon as possible. all the way to my car i’ll keep looking over my shoulder to make sure they’re not following me (i don’t want them to see what car i get into), and as i’m driving away i make sure i still don’t see them until i’m clear of the area. same goes for if i notice that a car has been following me for an unusual amount of time. i’ll start obsessing over the thought of them following me and potentially harming me. because of this a lot of times i’ll take back roads or do zig zags just to make sure if they are following me i might lose them.

i’m also afraid of being poisoned so i never leave any of my food/drinks unattended. if someone hands me a drink and i didn’t see where it came from i’ll throw it away and not drink it. i never take food from others unless it’s my family or close friends and always watch the people who prepare my food at restaurants because i’m afraid they might slip something into my food. at work, if for some reason i have to leave my food at my desk for a second to go do something, i’ll start getting paranoid that someone is going to go into my office and put something in my food to poison me (i’ve literally thrown food away before because i got so in my head about it). i once read this news story about someone being poisoned at work after a coworker snuck something into their water bottle, so now i can’t leave my water bottle unattended either. i’ll literally carry it with me from room to room to ensure it never leaves my sight, even going so far as taking it into the bathroom with me. if i walk into a room and smell something a little off or something different than usual i’ll start thinking that someone is putting chemicals in the air to poison me. i mean i could truly go on and on.

i know it’s irrational to feel this way and to have these thoughts but i can’t help it. i’ll start playing out situations in my head of something bad happening and i’ll end up working myself into anxiety and panic attacks. it stresses me the fuck out and i don’t want to feel like this anymore. it doesn’t help that i’m a short female at only 5 ft tall and look like a teenager even though i’m in my mid 20s. it makes me feel like a target because i’m afraid i look small and weak and like someone who can easily be taken advantage of. how can i stop feeling like this?"
1063,Something’s wrong with me,"Over the past year, I’ve been well aware that something’s up with my mental health, but I don’t know what it is, or what to do about it. 2018 was my last year of high school, where I had a few friends I spoke to daily and that I was close to. Since finishing high school I now almost never talk to them, and I’ve been struggling to make any new friends at my job recruitment agency (having autism probably doesn’t help). Along with basically isolating myself, my fear of heights has been getting much worse, I get stressed much easier than normal, I’m slowly losing motivation to do anything, I’ve lost interest in some stuff, like playing games and using social media, recently I’ve been waking up at 3-4 AM for no reason, and I think I might have social anxiety. I should also mention that about 6 months ago, I developed some symptoms of depression, which went away after about a week, when I lowered the dosage of my medication.

I don’t know what to do about it, who to talk to about it (I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone about it anyway), or if anything will ever change."
1064,It was my birthday yesterday,"I turned 23 yesterday. Which means, technically, it's been 10 years since I started showing symptoms of depression.

I didn't get professional help until around 3 years ago. And those 7 years of being untreated were... painful. And even when I did get help, it took a long while before I stopped being so self-destructive to myself and to the people around me.

10 years later, and here we are now. I'm a cum laude psychology graduate, about to take the Psychometrician Licensure Exam, and about to enroll for MA in Clinical Psychology. I discovered new hobbies that I love (D&amp;D, video games, knitting). 

Most of all... I finally knew what it meant to be happy. I have dreams and aspirations, I look forward to what the future may bring. And, I feel so loved. I'm so much more emotionally stable than before.

Looking back, it really was a team effort, between my therapist, my medication, my parents, my family, my friends, my orgs, my teachers, and myself. I was able to improve this much because it tackled the biological, psychological, social, and environmental aspects of my life. 

I want to thank everyone for being so patient with me, for listening to me, for comforting me in your own small ways. Thank you for not judging me for having a mental illness, and for taking the time to help me become a better person.

To those who were there with me during at least one of my many, many depressive suicidal episodes for the past 10 years, thank you so much for your unconditional love. Thank you for giving me a safe space to talk about my thoughts and feelings and for giving me comfort and advice when I needed it. Most of all, thank you for not giving up on me.

And lastly, I would like to thank myself, because you were there through ALL of your episodes, and you survived. You didn't give up, and you still kept on living. So, congrats! You made it to 10 years.

There were times when no one was there to help, but, you were able to pull yourself out of that hole anyway. It was rough, and painful, and I wish you didn't have to go through so much suffering. But despite all that, you decided you wanted to become better. No one else could have decided that for you. It was you.

You also decided you'd spend the rest of your life helping other people who suffer from mental illness. That's inspiring, and I am proud of you. I know it took a long, long while and I'm sorry, but now I can finally say that I genuinely do love you. 

So, here's to celebrating life, no matter how hard it gets. To celebrating growth, and healing."
1065,i don't know why i want to kill myself,"things are so good right now. my family is healthy, i am surrounded by beautiful people who care about me, i have the most amazing boyfriend who i love more than anything in the world. a few months ago i traveled across the world to meet my best friend of six years for the first time. im taking classes on a subject im very passionate about. the other day, i got the job id been trying to get for months. i should be happy right? dont get me wrong, i am. and im so incredibly grateful for how lucky i am to have such a well laid out life. things are good. so good. i should be happy. but im not, and i feel so, so, guilty. every night after i finish my day, i sit in bed, and try to write in my journal. i dont feel like i can talk to any of my friends, or my boyfriend, or my parents. they would be so disappointed in me. they are all such kind people, i dont want them to think i am ungrateful for the amount of love and support they have given me. but yet, i think of the big picture, and i feel like all i really am is a burden. i go about my life, with everything laid out for me, but here i am, sitting at home in bed and seriously considering suicide. i dont understand. im angry at myself and im frustrated that everything would be so perfect if only i wanted to be alive. im so tired. it has been years that i have had these suicidal thoughts and ive only acted on them once. but lately, they have been consistent, theyre not just 'intrusive in the moment thoughts' anymore, but a constant longing, almost a craving. im just exhausted, i dont think i can do this. i think my place in the universe is not here."
1066,How to help my schizophrenic cousin...?,"All the kids in my family have really struggled. The key for the rest of us was acknowledging that we were the problem. Understanding there was a problem but also a way out. And making a dedicated effort to find the path that leads us there.

He is so stuck. Can’t keep a job, can’t show up on time, lives with his parents he seems to hate and believes are poisoning him with their farts, doesn’t have any friends and says he’s suffering from eternal loneliness, won’t sleep in his bed because he was once forced to take psych meds (that truly helped him) and farted on the bed and now gets headaches if he goes anywhere near it.

Super smart kid, really, and very intuitive. Handsome and kind (when he’s not threatening to kill his parents or all of the people, throwing things and breaking things and punching holes in the wall). He truly has so much potential and it kills me to see him living the same misery day in and day out.

To him, the problem is the world. Feels devalued if he makes less than $20/hour but never went to college or learned any trades, thinks his parents are the problem for a number of reasons, but mainly the farts that are poisoning him so they can “own his body”. Throws away pretty much anything they touch. Takes his underwear with him when he leaves the house because he thinks they fart on them when he’s gone. 

Can’t make any concrete plans or tell me what he wants in his life and how to get there. Wants a farm and a G Wagon but won’t get a job; thinks they’ll just magically appear one day.

His parents are going insane and constantly have to vacate their house because they can’t stand all the insanity and fighting and threats. He is 26 years old, but they’re scared to kick him out because they don’t think he’ll make it. They have before, but always pick him up when he falls.

I don’t know what we can do. Seems there’s no way to force him to take the meds he so desperately needs. Seems the government won’t intervene until he does kill someone. I know for me, it had to get bad. Really bad. And looking back the worst things that happened to me were undoubtedly the best.

I see it like this. I start walking down the wrong path and Spirit pushes me a little. Don’t get the message and next time I get a shove. And on and on until eventually it grabs me, picks me up, and slams me to the ground. And in that moment I wake up. And this is my window of grace and I need to keep riding this wave. There were plenty of times I hopped off, lured by one of my old demons, and it was incredibly hard to get back on until the cycle repeated itself and I finally knew to stay on. To dedicate all my efforts to riding that wave to freedom, because it was the only thing that mattered, because everything else is gone if I fall off course. And I am grateful to say I finally made it, and I don’t think I could ever go back to that dark place of loneliness and desperation.

But I am not schizophrenic. And I don’t know if my path will work for him. And it’s scary as hell to watch a loved one visit the dark and dangerous places I frequented. And I don’t know if I’d have made it if I didn’t.

My aunt is scared he’ll just continue to get worse. But I can’t think of anything else to do. I cannot reason with him and he seems to trust me more than anyone. He refuses to make any changes or join support groups or do therapy. 

Does anyone have experience with schizophrenia and are you willing to share your story? How did you finally realize that treating your illness was the only way to heal and find freedom? Or did you find another way? How can we best support him on this journey?

Are there any places he could go? I’m thinking WOOF or a service mission in a third world country could help. He did outward bound once and it was great for him. I wish I could get him to go to the psych hospital/trauma recovery center I spent six months at (inpatient then outpatient) but it’s expensive as hell and he doesn’t want to go and we’d lose a $25k deposit if he walked.

Is there any good support for people like him I could look into? Are there any good books/films on this issue, which might enable him to recognize the problem and see how much better life is on the other side? He’s super spiritual and I’ve tried to use some quantum physics type principles and you are the universe/you create your reality type lessons, but he doesn’t seem to grasp the concept.

I’m just feeling very sad for everyone involved and concerned about what might happen if he continues down this path. And I’m desperately hoping one of you can help. 

Thank you very much in advance for reading this and for any assistance you’re able to provide. There has to be a way out. Firmly believe there’s always a way out, even from the darkest depths of hell. It may seem like the only thing to look forward to is lifetimes of digging your way back to the surface, but there is always light on the other side. And there is balance in all things, which means those of us who’ve lived in the darkest of places and hit the lowest of lows get to look forward to the same magnitude of light and the highest of highs."
1067,"I need help, I don't know whats wrong with me.","Im a 24 year old male, 267lbs, a large amount of depression and anxiety. I can't  focus to save my life. I am moody... very moody! Tones of anger and hate. I always argue with people especially if I feel attacked... p.s. thats all the time. Im terrible at my relationship. My fiancee claims ""one minute I'm the perfect guy and the next minute I'm the complete opposite"". Im tired of being this way but I don't know what to do or where to go to get help. If any of you could please lend me some of your advice I would appreciate it. You are my last hope."
1068,How do you get prescribed Psilocybin?,"if you have been struggling with depression/anxiety for years, what would it take to get better treatments prescribed such as Psilocybin or TMS treatments?"
1069,What do I do when weed fixes my PTSD and my job has a zero tolerance policy,"Had PTSD. Couldn’t have sex anymore. Weed made me feel ok in my own body. Could have sex again. 

Got hired to dream job. Had a horrible massage that triggered physical repulsion and PTSD again a month ago. Can’t have sex anymore. Can’t smoke weed to fix it and I’m super stressed out. Nothing else has ever worked eg. a decade of medication, therapy, etc. My job does random hair testing and smoking is not an option. What can I do to substitute weed because I’m at a total loss and the stress just keeps getting worse."
1070,Finding a provider sucks,"Looking for treatment providers really sucks. Over the summer I moved about 50 miles away for a new job... I became eligible for their insurance in September. It is cheaper with a lower deductible than anything I’ve had before but it seems like they accomplished that by participating in a more limited network. The center and psychiatrist I’ve been using since 2013 isn’t in network. In fact, it doesn’t seem like ANY eating disorder treatment centers are in-network... I just need an outpatient psychiatrist for depression/med management atm but it sucks to know I’d have to fight for options if things get worse and I need a higher level of care. (I have out of network benefits I think but the difference in coverage % could be huge if you consider that a single day of a day program/PHP can run upwards of $800 depending on where you go.)

There are so many results when I search my insurance website but that doesn’t show me specialties or ratings so then I have to google it all too, and so many seem to be primarily for kids/adolescents for some reason. Great for them I guess but just more to weed out. It’s exhausting and disheartening and I’m not even to the stage of calling anyone. Cuz that’s a whole other issue, figuring out if your personalities fit. 

I’ve procrastinated for 4 months but I’m about to run out of meds so I need to get my shit together. 


Just a vent I guess thanks for reading, if anyone did."
1071,"Why is my body so tense all day, and the only way to unwind is vigorously exercise?",And when I do exercise I start to almost shake. Is this anxiety? Something else? Anyone have experience with this?
1072,Stopping meds after a week?,"Stopping after a week on meds

I’ve been on Effexor XR 75mg (1 tablet a day) for 8 days now. 

I went to my doctor and asked for Effexor specifically since I had heard good things about it (my dad is on them too) and I haven’t had any problems with them but I want to stop them as I now have an opening to see a psychiatrist who can actually diagnose me and give me the proper medication I need. 

Is it a bad idea to stop cold turkey even though it has only been a week? Or should I try wean off them?"
1073,Did i really give myself schizophrenia? Please read.,"Hi guys, im a 16 year old male and i have a serious question or two. I have been smoking weed for about a year and never did any other drugs but after a bad breakup i started doing more drugs so my usage is as follows: 8 months ago i took 300mg of benadryl twice. This is the only benadryl i have ever taken. After the benadryl, for about 4 months i was taking opiates about 4-5 times a week (hydrocodone codeine endocet). I felt fine during all of this time and just had depression and anxiety but ive always had those.  After I quit opiates i just continued to smoke weed up until January 13th (about 3 and a half weeks ago) where I smoked too much weed and had a big panic attack and was just convinced i was doomed for life and what not. For about 2 weeks after the panic attack i didnt have any problems other than dpdr and bad anxiety/depression. I kinda thought i was getting better and was accepting the fact i had dpdr and it wasnt anything serious. Well, 3 days ago, I started focusing on the ringing in my right ear and it sounded like voices. Like a bunch of unintelligible voices talking at once but its very faint. It sounds kinda like ""ooooooowahbbbshahoooooooowashashahsooooooohashahshahs"" i dont even know how to describe it guys but its just scary and it sounds ominous. I dont hear actual words being spoken but just constant ringing and oooWOAHooooWOAH sounds. Also, i think im seeing things out of the corner of my eyes. I never see a full on hallucination right in front of me but i see black dots in the corner of my eye and i see floaters a lot. Sometimes ill think i saw something dart really fast in the corner of my eye. Other than intense anxiety and feeling completely numb and detached from everyone those are my only symptoms. All this started 3 days ago after a 2 and a half week period of dpdr after a weed induced panic attack. Im scared guys. I think the weed might have triggered something in my brain and that this is just the beginning. Maybe the benadryl i took 8 months ago set my brain up for psychosis or schizophrenia and the weed just flipped a switch. Nobody in my family has schizophrenia or really any mental illness other than some alcoholism on my dads side but i dont think that really matters considering how many drugs i have used on my developing brain. Im seeing a psychiatrist sometime this week. Does anyone have any answers? Im so scared and anxious. Thank you."
1074,"To have friends, or to not have friends","So I am 17 atm, I have very little to no friends depending on how you measure it. I have 2 people I consistently talk to online, and I have 1 friend who I met up with months ago. Anyway in the past I thought that I needed friends to be happy, but i'm wondering if I should just give up on it its kinda been like this for a few years, I don't go to school so that's something thats impacted my friends list. I wonder if I don't need friends, maybe my desire to have friends is what makes me unhappy, like in the past I used to be super focused on my IQ, and the idea that I wasn't smart enough caused me a lot of stress, but I was able to solve that, tbh I don't know how exactly, except I kinda stopped caring about how smart I was, and if I just focused on myself and no friends I could maybe get some stuff done, I used to step back from my phones for days, and maybe even weeks, so I wasn't always checking stuff and I wasn't talking to anyone, and I think my overall focus was a lot better then, maybe, its kinda hard to compare me to me, but anyway, so are you all a bunch of pessimists who don't believe in friends, or are you a bunch of optimists who do?"
1075,"Others see me as successful, but it is impossible to see myself that way","I hope this is right place to post this. Some triggers for suicidal ideation. 

I have struggled with mental health all my life, but things are progressively getting worse. Today, after what felt like a particularly devastating midterm, I overheard classmates discussing their plans for the night: watching the Bachelor, yoga, spending time with a partner. I can’t relate. I go home, I study, without retaining anything it feels like, and just repeat. I don’t know what is wrong with me; it is as though my brain is... faulty? That’s what it feels like anyways. I put the time in, I go to office hours, I can explain the content to my peers, but I go into the exam and if I feel so stressed that I start shaking, I can’t concentrate and I second guess everything. It doesn’t help that a recent accident has left me with chronic pain which has made everything more difficult.

You know what’s a  hard to swallow pill? That no matter how badly I want something, or how hard I try, I’ll never obtain what I want. My anxiety is barrier to... essentially every imaginable goal. *Well*, you might be thinking, *just get some student support for the test anxiety/general anxiety disorder.* But is that conducive to any sort of legitimate, long-term solution? There are no freebies or modifications in the work force. You are merely left behind in a lower, unsatisfying position if you are not equipped. And I am not. 

I just wish I had a better brain. I wish I could see myself as something other than ugly and shameful. If I can’t obsesses over my grades because I am actually doing well, then it’s my body. I don’t think I have every felt fully secure in myself. What kind of life is that? I struggle with suicidal thinking and, although I would never have the guts to act on it as my foolish optimism always causes me to waver, I can’t stop. And they feel... proper? Like a logical response to the abyss that I perceive my life to be. Not to be dramatic, but that’s the best metaphor I got rn. I can’t imagine myself as successful. Or desirable. Or likeable, or valuable, or anything less than a disappointment. I go the counsellors and what do they say? Oh you have a 90% average though, why be upset about one exam? Or, you have been accepted into one of the top graduate programs, why can’t you just feel better? I know I sound like a bitch complaining when others have it worse off. Believe me, I feel guilty. But I genuinely believe I have failed. If my average drops below a 90%? May as well have no degree at all. Got into grad school? What’s that worth if you can barely function as an undergrad? The higher the level of achievement, the greater the fall as you fail. 

That’s pretty much it. I thought about killing myself today over a midterm worth 20% because I may have gotten below an 80% on it. Ridiculous? Perhaps. Unwavering? Of course.

I wish someone understood. I want to fix myself but I don’t know how. I am scared what will happen when I get my grade back. I am scared of myself and beyond ashamed. I have three tests next week but I just want to curl up and disappear. Please help me. I just want someone to tell me that I’m wrong."
1076,I Don't Feel Normal,"Hi everyone Im a 19 y/o male college student. Im looking for some possibly answers or advice to help me out. These past couple of months nearly everyday/night mostly when Im about to fall asleep, I get this rush of anxiety and an emptiness feeling. my brain starts to think of things i regret a lot (like not reaching out to my old baseball coach enough before he passed) or a huge feeling of loneliness. normally this feeling every once in a while is normal for me but i feel its been getting worse. feel free to ask questions about this because I dont really know how to describe this anymore than I just did. also sorry for my horrible writing skills lol"
1077,taking big steps today.,"today i told my fiancé about my eating disorder, and how this time it’s gotten out of control, and he had us set up a plan to make sure i start eating more, while he wished i came to him earlier he was happy i did them rather than later. 

today i also called and set up my first counseling appointment, by myself. it’s in march, and.. i’m so, so happy i did. i’ve been putting it off, i didn’t know if i actually wanted to get better, but a friend talked some sense into me and i really thought it over. 

i never thought i’d be able to say any of that, it’s been surprisingly good today, but i feel like i deserve a break from the dark times."
1078,Should I quit my job and move out or suck it up and start medication?,"I'm a teacher for adults. They don't take an exam before joining and they don't pay for anything. So any kind of person can show up. I also teach kids at weekends. I literally have no day off. My kids' classes are the most crowded. 30 kids in one class. It's a bit soul crushing.

I live in an apartment building that my mom and aunt owns. They're in their 70s and choose really bad tenants basically for nothing. We live by the sea and the rents are expensive around here. But they take 1/7th of the required rent from some tenants. With some months free. You'd think tenants would really be nice not to lose the apartment but no. They want more and more. The worst one is the pub on the entrance floor. They ruin my life and try to obtain the whole building.

I earn lower than the minimum wage. About two dollars an hour and I'm really stressed lately because I feel like I can't deal with people anymore.
I have a boyfriend ten years younger than me. He's really nice but in another city. I visited him and he visited me a couple of times in the 3 years we've been talking. We call each other every day and talk for hours on discord, messenger, etc.

My mom lives downstairs but my aunt lives elsewhere so she doesn't really know what's going on in the building. Mom lives with my brother and acts like he's mentally challenged and refuses to leave him or let him do anything. He's 30. She also doesn't want me to leave to live in another city.

My father lives in my childhood home 20 minutes away. Mom and dad aren't divorced. She goes to stay with him and comes back to stay with my brother every week, back and forth. My father also feels that adult children shouldn't get away from their families ever and they should live around each other at all times. So he doesn't want me to go as well. But he's worried about me and wants me to be happy so he thinks I should start using medication.

I've been using medication (prozac and trazodone and such) for 10 years but then I quit to try and see if I'll be any different. It's been more than a year. And now I feel like I can't take this anymore.
I'm not happy with my job but people tell me no one is, so I should accept it and live one day at a time.
What do you think? I have nobody that I can talk to."
1079,Can't Think Realistically Whats wrong with me?,"When i think about the past i think of it as a tragic backstory something that makes me into a cool protagonist. When i think about what i want in the future maybe acting. stuntswoman, singer come to mind i want to have created a long series comic and animation with my own art and story. I want to solve world problems the baddass route maybe with activism or joining some kind of group that destroys weapons and oilplants or something. I jump from job to job city to city country to country searching always unfulfilled because i keep treating my life like a story and dont know what i really want. I dont know how to treat my life realistically.


----------------- further info feel free to skip----

Id like to act but i dont know if im good enough and have only been in a few productions but i want to learn.  

id like to sing and have written about 30 songs that all need more work but i think id need a lot of training and arent particularly passionate about music.

Ive worked on an animation overseas before but i was heavily relying on references and that was for a very small amateurish animation

 i have lots of stories that i want to write ive only written a couple the rest are all in various stages of incompleteness.

Nowhere near fit enough to be a stuntswoman

I joined a group that travelled overseas as missionaries informing people of human traffickers and thats as far as ive gone activism wise that was an amazing time but we all split up again if i were to do that again id have to continually be saying hello goodbye over and over and i have doubts of my own faith so i shouldnt be a missionary.

overall everything i think i want is unrealistic."

I feel like a block of cement. I know if I say that people will always respond with “noo don’t feel that way, I care!!” But you only really care about how you look to yourself and others. Obviously you can’t care about me because you don’t even fucking know me. If I were to say “wow I got almost all a’s” none of you would give a shit so why would everybody start to care as soon as I mention the state of mind I’m in. I’m tired of living in a fake fucking world I can’t even talk to someone without them being judgy or just flat out not caring.

All I can think is that I’m worthless and useless, that’s it. I want to beat this, but it never seems to go away. I’m sorry I’m being a pathetic burden, you all deserve more from me.

1085,Creepy fam,"My ""fam"" is extra creepy. They're all SUPER Catholic, and any tiny opinion that you have that isn't theirs, they freak out about. They're trying to take me to COURT because they've trapped my in their house since moving back 7 years ago, I'm 27, and they've tried to get an order saying that they need to know where I'm going when I ""take their car"" after not having one for months at a time. Residence is out in country, the only way to get to a job. They treat me like shit and have trying to feed me ""behavioral"" drugs since I was a child, and blame every problem they have on me. My dad says the weirdest fucking twisted shit, he can't take any type of situation seriously unless he potentially looks bad, when he lashes out. I went to COURT because they said I didn't wash dishes of clean up like I'm a fucking child. They treat me like a child, they both ACT like children, and my dad is weirdly sexual. He puts an innuendo on everything in the most subliminal ways like I got a blanket for Christmas once and he was like ""isn't it  SOFT""  and everyone just ""ignores"" because it's so subliminal and so creepy that my mom just pauses and goes about her day like the abuse is right in front of everyone's face. I've been labeled not psychologically sane because the town I'm near is Republican at and basically a sinkhole and I DON'T hear or see thing but have symptoms of TRAUMA. I can't be around them and sometimes sleep outside away from them because the vibes are just so wack. I'm fucking sick of missing important shit that would get me away from here and it's like the abuse is timed JUST SO  so that I'll miss certain things. I had a job working for them and was fucking miserable with all the misogyny and racism there, and was looked down on when I would show up later and later which is super uncharaterostic of me because I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE. My dad, his brothers, and their dad all are creepy as hell and I'm not the only one who thinks so. I never had anyone over as child because I just didn't want to have to go through explaining why everything was so weird and strict, like eating times and shit. They use the premise of doing everything together as a scapegoat for being creepy as hell. Worst of all, I get hella bad vibes some days like today where I just have to leave, and the dude tries to make me feel bad or some shit. I have literally been doing chores there and taking care of kids since I was as a kid and they are trying to drag back to that mentality. No I need to leave but my windshield wipers are broken and it's snowing and my dad fucking waits for these fucking instances to be the most creepy and says inappropriate shit. I tried calling the cops, but they said ""if there's nothing physically going on, then we can't just pick you up."" This is all some.fucking bullshit and I feel overly groomed. I'm not crazy and everyone I talk to is typically hella surprised when I mention all the hospital visits and ""medications"" because I'm a fucking regular person that has only ever tried to do the ""right thing"" but I have been stretched way to far. My dad lays on this soft beanbag at night just watching TV and being talked at like a child and talking about how he ""can't sleep"" like he's trying to talk in some fucking weird ass ""sensual"" voice like no one notices. I know where I could go but typically it's the means. I kick myself daily for not leaving because there's a bad feeling looming but back of the head thought is like ""things shouldn't be too bad, today."" That thought is never not a lie. Repost"

1087,Having specific intrusive thoughts.,"So I have bipolar and doctors think schizoaffective. There is one thing that I haven't talked about and that is the fact that I sometimes cannot look at something even a little sexual, it gives me intrusive thoughts about cheating and infidelity.

This is a a very big problem for me. What is this crap? My life is a mess."
1088,I feel like my psychiatrist is brushing me off,"Hi everyone. I  thought I'd come here to talk about my problems with my psychiatrist, but if this isn't the place, please let me know (and I'm sorry about the length of this post).

I've been on ADHD medication for a few months now, but I feel like I'm experiencing a lot of negative symptoms that don't seem to concern my psychiatrist. Before I get into describing them, I will say that I think the diagnosis of ADHD is accurate, and the medication *does* help me focus during its active period. Before starting the medication, I mentioned that I struggle with panic/anxiety issues, as well as insomnia and some PTSD symptoms (but I take a sleep med, which works well, for the insomnia).

First of all, the stimulant that I'm taking interferes with my hunger cues;  I feel less hungry while I'm on it and the drive to actually eat something is gone, so I often forget to eat. I normally only have a hard time eating when I'm really stressed, and  I was already on the small side before I started the medication (and I'm not a fan of extreme thinness- frankly, I'd rather be overweight than underweight). That said, I've still lost at least 15 lbs since starting this medication a couple of months ago, according to my last checkup. I also had a higher pulse than I should, and my blood pressure read as stage 1 systolic hypertension. Both were higher than they were when I was homeless and smoking regularly, which concerns me.  Other physical symptoms include a headache around the offset of the medication/disorientation/exhaustion (like a mental haze *worse* than my adhd), shakiness, chest pain/strong pulse, and seeing stars/white flashes in my vision. I've also been having issues with random, stabbing pains (I'll look for an object stabbing me in the chest/arm/etc, but find nothing), and pins and needles/tingling in my fingers, feet, and scalp. My primary doctor theorizes that they're related to chronic anxiety, which about lines up with how I feel most of the time. 

Speaking of anxiety, I've been having panic attacks pretty regularly. I always had them, but they seem a lot more frequent than they were before. I have *at least* 3 a week now (and I get aftershocks, or panic attacks in clusters, lol); I've had 7 or more panic attacks in several weeks out of the past month, even. They happen at bad times, like while I'm driving down the freeway, and they often make me withdraw/miss obligations and social gatherings (parties, game nights, nights out, classes, meetings, etc- I've pretty much missed 1 major event a week from panic attacks). I'm working on coping skills with my therapist, but the panic attacks often cause me to have outbursts/episodes of screaming/hitting myself when I'm alone (and even if I don't, they kind of make me depressed, tbh). They're also worse than they used to be- before, I'd hyperventilate or start yelling, but now they often escalate until I feel like I might pass out, or until I lose feeling in my face/hands and have trouble controlling my fingers. Even the milder panic attacks are difficult to manage, and they're often followed by *worse* panic attacks. 

On top of all of that, I'm still not even doing all of the work I'm supposed to! I'm only a part-time student, and I'm *still* a couple of weeks behind in all of my classes/chores/paperwork (I'm so behind on paperwork that it's threatening my enrollment); furthermore, I'm supposed to be earning at least some kind of income, but I haven't found a job. I also only take the regular-release medication 2x a day, so I only have 'productive' time from 9am-5pm at best. Even then, I'm anxious and disoriented for a lot of that time (albeit I can focus a lot better in the moment). 

I've been taking it for a few months now, and I've mentioned all of the above at the last few appointments, but he tells me to give the medication time to work. But the more time elapses, the *worse* the side effects seem to get. When I asked to at least get something to help me manage the panic attacks, he said that he didn't want me to be ""dependent on medication"" for that. 

I'm not suicidal, but the panic is starting to feel dangerous (or at least obstructive to my functioning). I'd rather not die because I lost control of my hands while going 65 down the freeway. It also takes 2-4 hours round-trip of driving to get to his office, and he only gives me enough medication to last for 10 days at most (despite not changing my doses for 2 months now). 

Any time I mention my concern with driving so much given my current symptoms, he gets distrustful, and tells me that he ""doesn't want to treat addiction"" on top of my other issues. But I've been taking it as directed for months now, and I have no interest in doing anything else- *I already have panic attacks almost daily* ffs, why would I want to take *too much* of a stimulant? And because he so severely limits the amount of medication I can pick up, I don't even have room to reschedule appointments. There has been more than 1 time that I've had to ration my meds, because I would run out before the next appointment. When he found that out, he said I was taking it for ""external reasons"" instead of ""internal reasons""- well, I'm sorry for choosing to not take my medication on Sunday, if taking it meant not having *any* on the day I had class and had to drive to/from his office for 4 hours! 

Every time I mention how much my symptoms worry me, he says that I ""seem to be doing better"" and that the symptoms will go away over time. But time *has* elapsed, and while many of my ADHD symptoms are more manageable, the side effects of the medication are *worse*, and my ADHD is still interfering with my ability to do work. I'm at the end of my rope (figuratively, I like being alive). I know that there's more than 1 way to treat ADHD, so I'm not sure why he's so insistent that I give *this* medication more time. 

He also forgets a lot about me, and asks me what doses/medication/etc I'm taking every appointment, and how long I've been on them (just write it down, man :/). And when I try to mention my concerns, he fixates on other stuff, like measuring the amount of weed I smoke in ""joints"" or whether or not I have the right ""mentality"" when I take medication (the only ""mentality"" that matters, imo, is that I take it *as prescribed, regularly*, I'm not suicidal, and I keep on a fairly consistent routine). 

I'm feeling pretty dismissed and desperate, but I'm not sure if any of this is normal. I'm trying to find other psychiatrists, but I've called almost everyone in a 40 mile radius with no luck. *Should I be giving this more time?* Thank you.

**TL;DR:** I'm having panic attacks several times a week, anxiety all day, losing weight, and struggling to manage my work, even with ADHD medication. However, my psychiatrist thinks that it's not severe, and that I should give the medication I've been taking for months more time. Is this normal?"
1089,I can’t cry anymore,"I used to cry more alongside feeling depressed some days, but now I am terribly depressed every day and I can’t cry almost at all. I lost my cat months ago and I sobbed for almost 3 full days and now I just can’t, except for at the weirdest times. Today there was this guy who was interviewing students and he sat next to me and he asked to interview me and I just started crying. I could stop it quickly but I can’t even cry anymore without feeling so guilty and self obsessed. It just comes at random times when I don’t even feel like crying. Sorry if this was ranty I just really feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to right now."
1090,Starting to figure out how my brain works,"Been noticing more and more that whenever I smoke weed or do any other party prescriptions, if I'm not happy before I do it, doing it doesn't make me happy. But when I practice gratefulness and meditate in the morning, and my headspace is completely different to the days I don’t practice gratefulness, and ends up making weed/drugs a much better experience. 

This morning is a prime example, I woke up tired, got to the gym and couldn’t get out my own head. So I sat down in the corner of the gym, out of people way, a few deep breaths, shut my eyes and pictured the things that I’m grateful for; my friends, the gym, my girlfriend. And now I’m feeling nothing but good wibes and positivity. 

Remember everyday is a good day to have a good day."

1092,disassociation or spirituality,"I've gotten stuck at a state of depression. I realized the sadness ive felt since 5th grade wasn't just imagined sadness. I knew one day it would finally catch me, and I finally embraced depression. I told my parents, I broke up with my gf. We had just made a year. I quit my job. Ive finally let me seek help. My therapist made me realize, there are words for all these things I've always been. More than anything else, I've been in a disassociative state of being for the majority of my life. Therapy tells me things, but ive learned that my third eye is noticably open. I smoked weed then went to a reiki session. I can say with full confidence, that on that day, I experienced rebirth, or even just, awakening. That whole day I felt like i was literally inside of a dream, Except i wasn't. I saw the other side. I lived it for a day. Im fighting depression hard these days, I've gotten more discourgaed by the day. I feel like a young boy inside my head. I've been idle for a long time. And now i finally saw my own reflection. Through therapy, reiki, and the dramatic life events ive experienced in the last months. I've snapped myself out of my sleep. I have made all the appropriate measures.  Therapy, meditation, prayer, family, scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. I'm determined to see the other side of this agonizing depression, and am excited to embrace that new person. Ive kept a decent distance from all friends. So this brings me to my reddit peers. What is happening to me"
1093,Where He may be," 

The inevitable decision that plagues my consciousness, dealing with the constant battle of wanting to go on, and standing still.

Through the perpetual limbo, I stay stuck watching the world float by ending with the guaranteed sunset for those as my mind lights up with ideas and delusions of a better tomorrow

knowing full heartedly that upon the rise of my spirits i will sink right back to my old ways. The voice inside my head has taken a more feminine voice, acting out as a guide through dealing with my woes and deciding whether my conscious thought has a more cynical ideology than i so hoped to presume.

I cannot develop a more isolated style of living without having to surround myself with individuals who just look at me as intelligent but have concurrently seen me act out as an introverted individual with a better outlook for someone else's well being other than my own.

The decision has made me think of such paradoxes that could evidently lead me to a successful life, but on the other hand i wish to disappear for a few years and return as someone not formally known to those who have seen me in the past or present. To embark on the future endeavors only comes about in a time of need, seeing that the time i have spent alive has created such turmoil for those to be ""lucky"" enough to deal with me.

I see everyday has a failure with passing time and it seems to be getting worse. I have lost touch with everything I so formally came to know and love. Living is a chore at this point. The grandiose illusions I have set for myself are becoming increasingly concerning as time comes along with the evidence being so clear as day, but knowing these possibilities are still very slim it does not act as a deterrent for me. 

The voice tells me that It'll be okay, but cannot include the 'When' Parameter. so I seem to be left at a stand still. 

I do not have control over the things i do, or how i perform them. I do not see myself as a leader or a human for that fact. I believe I have lost all touch in reality and lost all faith in humanity.

The idea that in order for me to be happy, Everyone else must be content. This belief will be the end of me. Knowing that when i look down at my feet, there are some odd 7billion individuals who exist like I do. But do I exist? Does this subjective persona made from the experiences i have had portray who i was meant to become? If there is some sort of truth in all this, It's that my life, by story, and my own mind are just as much as an enigma as the next big discovery waiting to be made. but the idea that it does not set aside the anguish dealt with daily, Who will pursue some sort of grandiose pipe dream, in order to take the risk let alone sacrifice to complete such a goal. The voice tells me it's not important. 

I am no longer me, I guess. He died years ago if i think about it. Whoever I may be destined to become, the voice still says ""Farewell\_Spaceman"" when it's time to depart."
1094,Anyone else feel pressure to continue their bloodline?,"Every single generation of my family passed down their genetics into me and if I die having not passed down my genetics then my family dies. Genetics from the start of the human race all through time and into me. It’s not like that “time to have kids” biological clock, it’s something else. I don’t know if I’m affectively explaining this. Sometimes this feeling is overwhelming."
1095,Is my friend mentally ill or just...different? [serious advice only],"I have a friend well call B, B moved here from a foreign country about 10 years ago and recently has been exhibiting some strange behavior.

Examples-

We’re at a restaurant and she tries to order a seasonal special. The waitress calmly explains that the special is no longer available/in season, she proceeds to ask her 3x more if they have it. Finally I snap and say “B she told you they don’t have it drop it.” She proceeds to pout the rest of the evening saying “I took the waitresses side”?

She calls me and tells me her Uber is lost and can’t find my address. I ask her if the Uber has a GPS and she says yes, I tell her to just have him put my exact address in the gps? She said ok but still managed to get lost. I had to walk out onto the street to find her because she was wandering around my street yelling my name. 

We’re walking along when a guy catcalls us so I flip him off and he drives away. About 2 hours later were sitting at the bar and all the sudden I notice she’s red and shaking. I ask her what’s wrong? She EXPLODES saying I ask her too many questions and proceeds to run to the door of the bar and scream I CANT BELIEVE YOU FLIPPED THAT MAN OFF AND EMBARRASSED ME I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. The whole bar stares as she runs off and slammed the bar door. I had to pay for her tab and she never apologized just moved on like nothing happened. 

....Those are just a few. Also lately she’s taken to going to the hospital to get blood tests ran about every week. I told her it’s pointless because she has no ongoing condition. She says it doesn’t matter because they just bill her insurance (Medicaid) and she wants to “make sure”. 
I’ve met other people from her country and they don’t seem to act like this, so I don’t think it’s a foreign/outsider thing. She was really cool when I first met her but lately I’m wondering if she’s suffering from a mental illness causing her to act this way? She went to a psych who said she was fine but the guy seemed like a quack.

Looking for any advice or knowledge on what could be going on here, thank you!"
1096,"I can't feel or dream, just plan and organise.","Hi, thanks for taking the time reading this if you do :) 

Background:
I've always been a good driver in projects, both at work and in social life. I have a good sense when it comes to plan tasks, structure needs and filter out solutions.

The downside of this is that I'm often finding my self organising things for people, but not participating like they do. If I organaize a trip with some friends, they just tumble around, while I'm the one with the tickets and times in my head.

Present time:
The past year (I'm close to 40 now) I've been feeling more and more empty and sad. Not unhappy though, I have lots of good friends, an amazing partner, a great career. But I feel empty.
In my younger 20s I was very creative, drawing, playing music etc, but not any more. 

My psychologist the other week pinpointed what could be a reason:
I don't feel, dream or wish for things. I only plan.
And when I feel insecure, I go back to planning as a way to structure things.

If I try to do music I jump in to planning mode:
What kind of song, at what speed? I can't find this specific thing so maybe I need to evaluate new equipment... I don't feel... 

When I got the question what I would do if there were no limitations:
Do you mean now? In life? Today? This weekend? Is money an issue?... I don't feel. 

Do I want a family?
Now I see costs, schedules, maybe we need a bigger apartment first. Should we wait a year or two? I don't feel...

I need to find my way back, but not sure how.
Brainstorming is not the right tool here, or rephrase the questions to what I want in life.
I need to start small, break the pattern.

Anyone here who have been in the same situation and have found ways to move away from there?"
1097,Just diagnosed with BPD. Need advise,"I was just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder Monday after I slit my throat in front of my gf and my boss after I convinced myself they were having an affair.  When I was 18 I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been struggling with my sanity since. I have ruined countless relationships. After learning about bpd, it makes a lot of since. My gf won’t let me come home and I understand I freaked her out but I’m freaking out not knowing if we will be alright. All I can do is sit here with my thoughts and I don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna freak out again."
1098,Thoughts Welcome,"\-I have to preface this with I'm a psychology major, so I might just be going through the ""I have this, I have that, I have everything"" phase every student goes through after learning about illnesses - 

I have no idea where to start with this. Things just feel different, so I just wanted to get some thoughts. I've always been an extreme empath of sorts. I'm very in tune with people's feelings, and I often end up feeling what they are, extremely happy if they are, or extremely sad, etc. I started really feeling it with my boyfriend. Even if we texted, I felt like whenever he gets sad, or feels low energy, I feel that way, to an extreme. It tanks my mood. He does nothing to provoke this, it's just as if I absorb his energy. It happens with anyone, but mostly those that I'm close to. And it's extremely difficult to shake off. 

I also have been feeling as though I've been faking my negative emotions for the past few years. I definitely feel them, and I know some of them are real, but it's as if when my friends talk about their illnesses, or I think about being low, I just become it. I feel as if I do it for attention, but I don't know why. But either way, I get sucked into this mood and it doesn't go away for days at a time. It used to be easy to shake off, but now it feels deeper and heavier. 

I don't engage in any of my hobbies anymore, if I have time I sleep if I can. I've been exceedingly tired for the past few months. Recently I've had trouble sleeping despite being exhausted. I just feel like I get up, go to class, come back, eat, homework, sleep, repeat. Like I'm just going through the motions without even thinking about it, like I'm in a heavy, dreary dream. I'm an introvert, so keeping up with friends has always been somewhat difficult, but hanging out with them has just been exhausting, and I've had barely any energy to text, what normally had come easily to me. I've noticed that it's the most extreme around my period too..I know that irritable mood is common, but I've never experienced it quite this bad. I also have found breathing at some points to be a little more difficult. Not life threatening, but almost as if I have a knot somewhere. I've also noticed I'm holding my breath more than normal. Light headedness in these periods as well, I've been taking iron supplements to help, but sometimes I still feel woozy, like I'm about to faint or throw up at random times when I have to sit and wait for it to pass, drink water etc. I'll throw in that I have a panic attack every now and then, normally cued. 

But I'm able to do my homework, and do it well. I find a tiny bit of solace keeping my room clean and staying on top of hygiene. It just makes laying in bed more comfortable. 

I don't know if this is just who I am now, if school is a little overbearing right now, if I'm overthinking things, or if something else is going on. I'm just wanting thoughts from an outside perspective."
1099,I give up...,"Some clarification.
I'm 15 yr old guy in UK. I started a new school almost a year ago(I moved to UK almost a year ago too)

I was nice...I tried to apeal to them...to have friends...but students started behave like bastards to me...
I self harm...and it helps...
I have low self steem.
I hate myself and now I have suicidal thoughts...
Tbh I hate everyone and everything.
I'm so sick of those fucking bastards.
2 times they were physical...teachers ignore it...
They won't stop...teachers won't help...today one snaped my ruler in a couple of pieces and when i came home and told everything to my mom she told me that I care too much about little things...
I snaped and said I give up. That I don't care about anything...and I mean it.
She told me that I'll need to go to a psychiatrist(I think that was a false threat/trying to put me in place) and tgat something's wrong with me.(She doesn't know about my self harm)
She came to appologize but I rejected....I'm done with humans...I hate every last one of those bastards.
I am not scared to throw everything away...
If noone will help me...if noone will listen to me...then there's no point in continueing...
You know when you have a realistic dream that seems like a reality?
Well something like that happened to me this past 2 weeks.
It was when I was in school and upset/angry and I would see me killing myself...abd then I snaped back to reality...(Maybe a weird daydream)
Whenever I opened up, tried to change...tried to be better than this puece of shit being I am...I would fail...get hurt...
If being an adult is even harder...then I don't want it...
Video games, anime and reading were my only hobbies...and they don't help...
I don't care...I don't want to care...
If my mom doesn't see my pain...then there's no point...
I won't kill myself (too scared of dying).
But exsisting hurts...a lot...
I've never been mentally ill just tics which are getting better...at least something's getting better.
If she sends me to psychiatrist or a mental hospital...I don't care...not my problem...
If she doesn't...same opinion.
I ruined my life in the previous country...and here it isn't getting better.
I can't even defend myself phisically or verbally if I get hit because then ""we are even""(In school
I isolated myself...better than gettig hurt...
When i told my mom I give up she said ""You wont give when it come to school. (Grades and stuff)"" I said that I give up. I'm just a stupid worthless piece of garbage who doesn't have a future...so wgy even bother.
She is still probably angry...and I don't care...even though I'm nit glad I probably hurt her feelings...I don't care...

New info:

Well, before my mom left for work we were talking about the situation. She told me she sent an email to the head of the year teacher and to the principal...although even if it gets rid of bullies I still won't un-isolate myself.
I gave everyone(students and teacher) a chance...and they didn't do anything...
After I told my mom I can't forgive her she told me that if I'm angry at her, she'l be angry at me...and stuff about how I can't be angry at the world.
I mean, if I can't be angry at school or at home...what am I supposed to do?
Just suck it up and ignore it...
I mean...it hurt a bit to tell her that I won't forgive her for what she's said...but if I can't forgive her, I just can't.
I'm a normal-ish person(tics that are calming a bit make look a bit...weird(blinking weirdly and some other)) and she told me that I'll have to see a therapist.(It was an epty threat. She won't act on it) And she's telling me some ""You're different"" BS.
I mean, if I am different how am i supposed to make it in life...
I won't forgive her...anyone...
Now I am trully alone in this mess...well being with no friends for 4 or 5 years now sucks...but having my own mother basically call me insane just hurts...
Her justification was that she was trying to snap me out of it...like saying that did any good.
My head is a mess rn...but if I'm not allowed to feel anger towards this...or anything...I'm done.
I just don't care about anything or anyone...I don't want to care...
Even my hobbies fon't make me happy anymore...they have my attention...but in the end just feel...empty.
I can laugh at memes or jokes...but mostly I'm just a dull idiot and a failure as a student, son and a person...
And yes I know I didn't experience ""life"" yet...but to me if the adult life is even harder...than to me it just isn't worth it...
And even if bullies stop...the damage is done...
There rumors about me how I'm retarded and some other...
I'm not religious but...they can all go to hell gor what i care.

Anyway, thanks for reading..."
1100,what’s the quickest way to go?,"i think i’ve decided to finally kill myself. all that’s missing is how... idk how to do it in the least messiest, painless way possible. i don’t want anyone close finding me dead either bc i don’t wanna hurt them to that extent so yeah. any tips would be great, thanks"
1101,"For the last year i've noticed a lot of signs of depression, but I don't feel ""sad""...","First off I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this. I'm a 23 yo male and basically for about the past year I have experienced a lot of signs of depression but I haven't really experienced any ""sadness"" and would consider myself above average on a ""happiness"" scale. Not completely sure, but I would say I started noticing changes in myself about a year ago and ever since then they have progressively gotten worse. Here are some of the things I've been struggling with:

&amp;#x200B;

* Weight gain  
 
* No motivation to workout or eat healthy (even though I was always in great shape throughout HS and 1st two years of college)  
 
* No motivation to do things that I NEED to do, and I really only complete these things if there is an immediate negative consequence. (going to college class, keeping up with work, keeping house clean, house projects, managing bank statements, etc.).   
 
* Not wanting to make plans with friends/family and I hate having anything planned that I HAVE to do. I would rather just stay at my own house and do my own thing, unless I am the one who makes plans to do something I enjoy in advance (and even then leading up to the event I end up wishing I didn't have plans). Now when I do actually do something and make plans, I almost always have a good time and enjoy the experience though. I have always been content with being by myself, but I use to always try to make plans with people whether it's going out to the bars or just hanging with a small group at someones house.   
 
* Sleep schedule. I have always stayed up late and liked to sleep in, but for about the past 3 weeks I have been on break and haven't had much to do, and I have been staying up until the morning most nights and sleeping for 10-13 hours basically every day. I set my alarm for 7-8 hours of sleep every night and just wake up extremely tired still and no motivation to get out of bed.   
 

There are other smaller things, but these are just some of the main problems i've had. Like I mentioned before, I am generally really happy and don't experience intense sadness or anything along those lines. I have always been a very ""If you don't like something, then change it"" type of person and it has worked for me in the past.... But now I feel like i'm stuck in a rut and even when I tell myself i'm going to wake up early and go to the gym and change my life, etc. I try it and force myself to do it but then I have 0 motivation to keep going and just go back to my old ways. It's a weird feeling because I have always been able to tell myself i'm going to do something and then I would just do it and i'd stay motivated. I'm not really sure what i'm looking for or what i'm asking, but I guess i'm just trying to see if anyone else has experienced this or has any advice."
1102,Intrusive cycles,"I was diagnosed with a OCD years ago due to my obsessive thought process and the lengths I will go to ease my mind (which I'm currently doing) and I just wanted to know if anyone else goes through this?

I tend to have one really bad intrusive thought or something stressful happen and I will obsess about it and obsess and I cry and get angry sometimes suicidal and I search for answers from my family, from the internet and sometimes even then I don't even do that because I'm ashamed of my thought and are afraid of the repercussions of what these thoughts will cause. 

I feel very alone in my small circle of people I know because I feel like although I know people with anxiety and depression disorders etc. I have yet to meet someone who has these issues and when I open up I get met with reactions that make me clam up even more than I do.  

It would be nice to know that other people go through this and how they handle it? I currently am having a bad one and I notice if I'm feeling depressed they come out more frequently. It's almost like my brain makes up terrible scenarios involving me to make me feel worse and convince me to pull the plug. I try to remind myself I am not my thoughts and people think terrible things all the time and it means nothing of them or their characters...well usually...I care a great lot of everyone in my life and I just want to be a better person and stop falling into my ritualistic ways and ignore my thoughts but it's really really hard. I welcome any advice.

Sorry for long unintelligible paragraphs. Really stressed at the moment feel like I could throw up.

Tl;Dr: I suffer with extreme intrusive thoughts that come in my cycles and tend to have  a hard time coping with them and wonder if others deal with them and if so how they deal because I currently am struggling. Thank You ♡"
1103,For the last two years of my life I’ve felt empty.,"Two years ago, almost to the day, one of my best friends took his own life. He didn’t leave any note as far as I’m aware, and while he always made edgy depressed jokes, who didn’t in high school. The last thing I ever talked to him about was a Latin essay due the next day. Just a Latin essay. I didn’t find out until the next day. I got in like I normally did, and noticed he wasn’t there yet. I didn’t think anything of it until the dean of students called me into his office and told me. I know life isn’t perfect or anything but I always figured that if someone close to you died you’d get a little bit of closure. It’s super selfish but I just want to know how this dude I’ve known since 4th grade goes from asking me about Latin homework to killing himself. I still have the discord message “@(my discord name) do we have to type the essay or does she want it hand written?” I respond that our teacher wants it hand written, he says “k”.  
I knew this guy from 4th grade until junior year, and all I can remember about him is the last time we talked, and what he looked like during the wake. It’s only been two years and I barely remember one of my best friends. I remember a corpse and an inane discord message about homework. 
We were all pretty fucking destroyed after the fact. We were pretty tight knit, so this really fucked us up. I guess during that time I rationalized that one of use would need to be the strong one. We couldn’t all be crying our eyes out. So I went home, sat in the bathtub and cried for like 4 hours. And after that, not a tear was shed. I just kinda shut off. And I don’t think I’ve turned back on again fully since. 
I still talk to my friends from then often even though we’ve all graduated and gone on to college. Some of them will come to lay out their problems in DMs or on Snapchat. Relationship stuff, problems with their parents, shit at their school. I just listen and support as best I can, but part of me is going fucking crazy like: tell him what’s going on with you. I barely sleep, I have no drive or motivation whatsoever, I miss classes all the time. I’m wasting away and I don’t even have anyone to talk to. I have friends in college and if I’m ever bored or something I can text them and we’ll do something. I’m not alone, but I feel so fucking alone. I didn’t really grow up in a household where I felt comfortable talking about shit with my family. I’d die for my bro’s from high school. I just want so much for them. They’re the people in my life I’m closest to. And yet I don’t even feel like I can tell them how I feel. 
Maybe this is just 3 am me talking, and in the morning I’ll feel entirely different. I don’t know. Just had to get this rant off my chest."
1104,"""Suicide doesn't end the pain, it just passes it on to someone else""... I'm NEVER going to commit suicide , come what may!!! Commiting suicide is the worst way to punish the people who care for you","It leaves behind a kind of void in the people who care, even if it is ONE person...  it leaves people empty..a sort of emptiness that CANNOT be fulfilled by anything in the world... one just ends up passing on their pain to someone else by leaving forever... AND PEOPLE CARE.EVEN IF IT IS ONE FRIKIN PERSON, THE VOID YOU LEAVE BEHIND WILL CAUSE THAT PERSON TO ACHE SO MUCH...I GUARANTEE, THERE WILL DEFINITELY BE ONE PERSON WHO'S GONNA GRIEVE YOUR DEATH... it's a request, even if circumstances are incredibly bad , DON'T KILL YOURSELF. PLEASE!!!! You have no clue how much pain you'll give the people around you...and circumstances keep changing! You wouldn't be suffering like this after a decade! Circumstances keep changing!! But if you kill yourself in the heat of emotion, you cause damage to the people who care. AND IT IS IRREVERSIBLE. Trust me, if  right now you can empathise  with the people suffering just like you, you must think about your people and empathise with them too...theyll have to go through the same thing you're going through, and YOU'RE GONNA BE THE REASON FOR PEOPLE'S SADNESS.."
1105,Things feel surreal and wrong and off?,"For many years I’ve gone through these periods, often after a break up, or any big life event like moving states or something (both which have happened in the past six months) where I’ll get into a state to varying degrees where everything feels kind of surreal and I feel disconnected and I feel emotionally in pain. Right now I’m feeling it, and it’s as if everything is slightly off, slightly topsy-turvy and wrong. 

I feel deeply alone- even though I have housemates and friends etc, I feel like I am truly alone in the world, like my heart is totally alone. It feels like a fracture in my heart, but I can’t cry at all. Everything feels off and I start feeling super anxious and scared and really lost. 

It hit really horribly once after I moved states, broke up with an ex, and was overseas for the first time. I cried because I felt so panicked and scared and disconnected like there was nothing holding me to the earth, and the only thing that calmed me down was talking to the guy I was seeing at the time who made me feel loved and warm and like everything would be okay. I felt protected and looked after. 

Now we’ve broken up, and it’s back again as this persistent ‘lost’ feeling, and I feel like I have to *do* something to make it go away because it makes me anxious and I get scared the feeling will never go away and I’ll keep feeling it forever, and I can’t handle that. But then I get scared that if I do something like go for a walk or listen to music that it’ll make me feel worse instead and I won’t be able to cope and I’ll spiral and do something like self harm or drink too much etc. So I just end up totally stuck. 

I’ve been doing some inner child work recently, and when I ask my inner child how I feel, the answer is always ‘scared’ or ‘disconnected.’

I’m starting with a new therapist this week, I’ve mentioned this to my current psych but she hasn’t said much about it. 

Does anyone have any idea if this has a name or if it’s just a fun mix of feelings and emotions? I suppose it feels a lot like separation anxiety, and I hate it. 

I’d love to know if anyone has any tips for self-soothing or grounding too. Maybe that’s what I need?"

1107,Music Therapy for Relaxation and Stress Management,"Relaxation and [Music Therapy](https://www.quitegreat.co.uk/blog/music-therapy-for-relaxation-and-stress-management/) sometimes get mixed up, the importance of allowing relaxing music to permeate your life is key to helping your brain and body come to terms with many physical and mental issues. The power of therapy within music has been well documented, it is working with musicians and other creatives that encouraged us to take the next step and set up a service to help musicians to find the right kind of care to help them through mental health issues, issues that can stem from stage fright right through to the traumatic circumstances when a major label ‘drop’ an artist and the phone stops ringing and there is no longer a support structure, they are simply left to their own dark vision of the future.

1108,Nightmares - How I got PTSD,"I typed this up not knowing where exactly to share this but I knew I wanted to share it somewhere. If this is not the place, let me know and I will move on. 




When you think of PTSD, most would think of people that have been to war. Seen horrible acts of violence. People massacred by the machine that is war. 

Some people think of an abusive relationship that leaves someone scarred. 

But most often, people can suffer from PTSD from something that is far too common. Car crashes. 

Crashes are unavoidable. 
Undoubtedly, we’ve all passed by a couple of cars on the side of the road, due to a fender bender. If you’re like me, you’ve seen a few even worse. Like passing a car that had been flipped. Seeing the mangled cars and debris littering the road. 

I suffer from PTSD. 
I’ve never been in combat. 
I had a decent childhood. 
My relationship is pretty normal. 
I’ve been in one accident and I was fine. 

How did I acquire this disorder? 

It all starts a couple years ago when I got sick of working retail jobs and being treated like a cog in the machine. My daughter had just turned two and I wanted to be able to provide for her. My wife had a decent enough job, so I shifted from full time to part time at my job and began going to a trade school. 

My wife’s family was full of truckers and that was about the only family I have. So I went to school for trucking, to fall in line with them. Everything went great on school. I had no issues. Within a few long weeks, I came out with a CDL. I applied at a few companies but ended up working at a local company with my father in law. It was exactly where I wanted to work. I was now hauling tankers in the south eastern region. 

But before they let me loose on my own, I needed to ride along with a trainer for a few weeks. Considering how new I was to trucking, I could understand and it went along with it. 

My trainer was a large black man, loud and loved to talk. We got along great. Some mornings were silent, some were filled with him carrying on talking to other drivers. 

Everyday was different. We always went to different places but it soon became routine. 

Wake up at 2am. Meet up with him. Pick up our load. Deliver it. Come home. 

We did this every day. 
At first, only he would drive. Then, he would drive there, I would drive back. Sometimes we would mix it up and I would drive there and he would drive back. Until I was doing all the driving while he slept half the time. 

One morning, like any other morning, we got in our truck and took off. He was driving this morning. We were on the road and our destination was roughly three hours away. 
I had no problem with letting him drive as I was pretty beat and didn’t want to wake up that morning. 

So as we made it down the road to a place we’ve already been to a few times, I listened to him talk while he was on the phone with another driver for the same company that left at the same time as us. We were both headed in the same direction, so he was behind us but not out of eye sight. 
I was dozing off slightly but awake enough to keep scrolling through my phone. Trying to pass the time. 

We stopped at a truck stop. Talked for a short bit. Used the bathroom and got breakfast. Then back on the road and off we go again. 

At this point, it’s about 4am and I’m still scrolling mindlessly through my phone. When all the sudden I feel the truck jump and bang. I quickly leaned up to see what had happened. What did we hit? But when I looked out the windshield all I saw was green. It was grass. 

We had run off the road into the median. 

I’m sure no one has ever said this in a moment like this but fortunately I was not wearing my seatbelt. 

I looked over and saw my trainer slumped over the steering wheel. This man was pushing 400lbs. We were pulling a liquid tanker that’s already unstable with the liquid surge. 

I see all of this and I’m seconds I reacted without thinking. All I could think at that moment is we are going to roll. I am going to be pinned under this man. This is how I am going to die. 

I jumped out of my seat, the truck still bouncing hard, and snatch him off of the steering wheel to give me access to it. I pulled it hard back to the right while simultaneously gripping the trailer hand brakes. I was able to lock them up and kept us from going into the oncoming lane. I watched as the cars were coming towards us as I directed the truck back into the center of the median. 

We stopped. 

All I could hear is the sound of the other drivers voice screaming over his headset. Calling his name. He had just seen us run off the road. 

I pulled the headset off and put it on and told him something had happened and to please stop and call 911. Then hung up. 

I pounded on his back trying to wake him up. I desperately tried to lean him back up. I told him that help was on the way. 

“It’s going to be okay. I got you man. Say something. Please say something to me. It’s going to be okay!”

He was already dead before I even started to do any of that. 

He suffered from a massive heart attack. It’s honestly no surprise at this point, looking back. He spent his days living an unhealthy lifestyle. Eating gas station food and sitting for 10 hours a day in a truck. 

It’s about 5 am now. Emergency services have arrived. State troopers, firemen and medics are surrounding the scene. They all are trying to pull this massive man from the truck and into an ambulance. That’s when I found out that he had been dead long before he ever made it out of the truck. 

It was this event that gave me PTSD. 
I can not stand to be in a car anymore unless I am the one driving. I feel like I have more control that way. 
I finished training with another person. I still drive a truck now. 
Thinking about it now isn’t easy but the hardest part of it are the nightmares. 

I’ve had more dreams of being in car crashes than I can count now. I relive the experience in my sleep. Some days I wake up with crippling fear. Not wanting to get back into that truck. 

But I have a family. I push through it all. Bills don’t pay themselves and I need to keep a roof over our head and food in my kids. 

I’m not trying to play myself up or say that you can get over PTSD by just going out and doing it. I personally don’t have an option to stop. I just have to work.  




Thank you to anyone that took the time to read this and listened to the events that caused me to have PTSD. I typed this up over a couple of days and I’m sorry for any errors."

1110,A friend of mine is mentally draining another friend of mine,"So lemme invent names to make this easier to explain. Apple and Orange.

Apple: She's amazing. She really is. But she has so many problems at home. Her father is a dick(alcoholic and verbally abusive to her, her mom, and siblings). Her mom has Stockholm syndrome so she can't leave. But she's such a sweet girl though. She means a lot to me. However everytime I give her advice, she finds reasons to not do them. It's like she's stuck in a hole and I throw a rope at her so she can climb up. But then she burns the rope and digs a deeper hole so that it's harder for me to find another rope long enough. She also self harms a lot and isn't afraid to show her cuts publicly. idk what to do to help her anymore. 

Orange: He's great. Basically trying to help Apple as much as I am. If not, even more. He suggested she reports her dad to the police but when she said it would feel ""morally wrong"" 🙄 anyway Orange is starting to lose it and idk what to do at this point. He's stressed. Hasn't showered in a month.

I need advice for Orange. Not Apple. I'm done helping her. I'll help her if she asks for it cause she won't take advice anymore anyway so yeah."
1111,"I don't care anymore, i stopped feeling","Im royally fucking up my life right before my eyes, and i do not care. I dont feel stress, sadness or anything. I occasionally feel very happy or angry, but thats it. I have no interest in anything anymore, no motivation. Im not even motivated to seek help for this. So basically im in a vicious circle."
1112,Just wasted a year of my life. Didn’t even know I was about to turn 23,I’m turning 23 in 6 days. I thought I would turn 22 but I’m turning 23. I just wasting my life. I have no family because they are all assholes . I love my boyfriend but I’m just draining his money being useless. I honestly want to die. I want to die so fucking badly. I can’t get help. I am that person in the shoes that stay inside and are scared of the world. I’m that person. I’m scared of any interaction with anyone. How do people with that bad of social anxiety even get help! ? I can’t call anyone I can’t message anyone . I tried talking to my doctor and she didn’t want to give me meds just in case I’m bipolar .  I tried asking for help . I’m can’t put myself out there again. But I have no job . No life goals . Birthday is in 6 days..... and guess what my boyfriends mom took it on herself to plan a birthday celebration . Now I didn’t have these as a kid. When ever it was my birthday it was never about me . Or they were just not there.  I watch cartoons of kids with great birthdays and I dream of being happy like that’s but the fear is too much. And I hate people doing things for me. I just feel like I have a debt to pay back now. And on top of that we might not make rent. I’m so useless. I want to just disappear . The amount of pain I’m in is not worth this life. It’s not worth saving the pain everyone around me might be in. Everyone would be better off anyways . I whole year of just being usless.

1114,"Trying seroquel again, first time I reacted badly to it, this time I want to keep a bit of a diary here to share what happens","The first time I took it was a few months ago now. I was given a script for 50 mg tablets and told I could take anywhere from 1/4 of a tablet to 2 whole tablets at a time. I tried 1 whole tablet the first night, 1/2 a tablet the second night, 1/4 of a tablet the third night. The next day I had to go back and see my doctor because I was so emotionally unstable and I’d been on the brink of a panic attack for the 3 days I was on it. They made me sleep for 12+ hours at night and feel like a zombie in the morning, i was experiencing the most extreme mood swings of my life, I’d literally be bawling my eyes out one second and then pissing myself laughing the next and then ready to claw someone’s eyes out the next.

I’ve been having some pretty bad mood swings again and my doctor asked if I’d be ok trying the seroquel again at a lower dose. This time I’ve been given a script for 25mg tablets and she told me to just try it at 1/4 tablet first and see how I go. 

Idk I just kinda want to keep a bit of a diary, like a post a day type thing with updates when there are significant differences and see how different this time is to last time. I’m really hoping that it works this time and I really hope I don’t have those reactions again but if I do, you’ll be hearing about it."
1115,Seroquel diary day 1,"Alrighty, it’s day one, this’ll be a short n sweet bc I have to take it at night and it’s like 11:30pm here.

I took 1/2 a tablet at around 10pm(?) before getting into bed. 

I haven’t really noticed anything significant yet, but I’m feeling quite restless and feel like I have this pent up energy building in my chest. I haven’t really been sleeping much recently so idk if I’m not able to sleep now because of my lack of sleep recently or if it’s something to do with the tablet.

I’m currently sitting on the floor in the bathroom bc I got up to move around a bit bc this pent up energy feeling had me tossing and turning and I didn’t want to wake my partner.

I’m gonna try and go back to bed now so hopefully y’all don’t hear from me until tomorrow."
1116,21 and never had a boyfriend.,"Sorry if this isn’t the correct sub. 

But it makes me feel worse than I already do. It bothers me a lot because I feel really lonely and I’m worried that I’ll never get a boyfriend now."
1117,Am I having anorexic tendencies?,"I’ve never liked how I looked, I was a fat kid and I know I’ve slimmed down after becoming a teenager but I still wasn’t in content with my body, I thought I still looked fat and disgusting.

So I started a diet and it actually worked, lost some weight and people around me noticed it, I was actually happy with myself for a while.

But then I wanted to lose more, I liked seeing the numbers on the scales dropped, it always made me happy to see that I had lost weight, even if I had a terrible day so I lost more just because it felt good to do so because I didn’t want to become fat again.

I actually had thought about how if I’m not careful I might become anorexic but it was mostly just a joke to myself, back then it just seemed impossible. So I stared to reduce my portions. 

That was my first mistake, later I became even more strict with my diet refusing to eat any fast food, or anything fried or oily, among other things, and restrict to two very small meals everyday or one big meal with no snacks allowed.

And i know this is so bad for me but I just can’t stop, I keep saying to myself that I’ll try to maintain my weight when I go down to 125 lbs, then it’s 120 lbs, now 105 lbs, but I never do I just want to keep going just because I kept getting reminded of the fat person I used to be.

Now I’m seriously considering just not eating anything at all, I never thought I’d get to this point and the thing is I had these thoughts before and I had promised myself I would never consider them seriously because I know it’s unhealthy, yet here I am now.

I still feel fat no matter what the scales or my BMI tell me, I honestly don’t know what to do at this point."
1118,I've been a shut-in for 14 years.,"Due to circumstances caused by my parents I had to quit school at 15 and spent over a year in near complete isolation because of death threats that may or may not have been made up by my mother. I'm 29 now, and I still couldn't get my life in order. 

I used to be bullied at school for two years prior to that, so I didn't have any friends. I used to have decent grades but when I had to return to school after that year (for the 10th grade out of 11 total), I realized that I had forgotten everything I studied before. My grades plummeted. And the class that bullied me were still in the same school for another year. I tried to fit in with the new one, pretending to be someone I am not, but I couldn't keep up the act. I hated it. 

I felt phisically ill every time I had to go to school. My mother had no job at the time. We lived together. And sometimes I would feel so sick, I'd ask my mother to let me skip. At random she would either allow it, or start screaming. I distinctly remember something breaking inside of me during one of those fights. She'd get violent, too. Not as bad as it could be, but since I was a boy I couldn't defend myself. Raising a hand against a woman was always a great taboo in our family, since my father used to beat her every weekend when I was coming to visit (I used to live with my grandmother and aunt when until 12, only visiting on weekends. My parents divorsed when I was 10). So she would threaten to kill me if I turned like my father. Not seriously, of course, but I was always an obedient child.

I somehow got through the last two years of school. My mother got a new job during the second year and after maybe another couple of years she decided that I need to go to university. In those couple of years I stopped going out for anything. I got a PC and internet and I dove into MMORPG with abandon. We would still fight with my mother on a regular basis. In the evenings this time, because she kept trying to enforce a sleeping schedule on me. Otherwise everything else she would do around the house. I didn't need to go out at all. But I couldn't disobey her either. 

So I went to the same faculty my mother went back in her days. Except I didn't know the subject at all: my school knowledge twise forgotten. I'll omit the details but the next 5 years I spent ""studying"" in absentia: going to the Uni for a fortnight three times every year, third time being the exams. While the rest of the time spending at home playing online video games and fighting with my mother. I didn't have to go out for anything else. 

During the summer of my 5th year in Uni my mother got into a fight with her higher-ups. My aunt was also employed where my mother was, and right at about that time we found out that she (my aunt) had cancer: a tumor that was supposedly removed many years ago. Due to a medical error my aunt was now dying. And their superiors decided to get rid of her (my aunt). So they both lost their jobs.

Next three years we lived on my aunt's and my grandmother's pension, all four of us. 

By that point I spent so much time in isolation I couldn't look at people. I didn't want to go out. I completely retreated into myself. And the only IRL person I'd communicate with was my mother. During fights. Endless screaming fights. 

My aunt died a bit over a year ago. My mother moved out to live with my grandmother. They fight all the time there. Mum visits regularly to fight here with me, too. I don't know what to do."
1119,Realizing how bad psychiatry is has given my insomnia,
1120,I don’t know how to deal with this situation and my mental health is quickly deteriorating,"I [Young M] am trying to reassure myself about my [Young F] girlfriend

Where do I start with this. I have been beating myself up since this happened and running myself around in circles. So a week or so ago my girlfriend logged into her spam account on my phone to check it. She left it logged in in my phone because she didn’t care at all and trusts me. We have been dating for three months at this point but have fallen in love. I realize the young love stereotype but we are so perfectly compatible.

But last week I got an instagram notification so I swiped down to read what it was. I was from her account so I wasn’t even going to read it. But I caught something weird about the message instantly. My girlfriend had a “massive crush” on this guy two years ago. She saw him every day and eventually invited him over for dinner at his parents house. He got freaked out and bailed halfway through dinner which I didn’t know until my friend told me the whole story. He ghosted her after that and she was hurt but told me she got over it quickly. Then a couple days before all of this happened he reached back out and apologized. My girlfriend mentioned how they had the most emotional conversation she had ever had, adding besides us of course. And how touched and emotional they got with one another. She described just an hour of two of emotions.

She has briefly dated two other people in that time that have lasted around a month each so I’m inclined to believe her. The message was from someone I didn’t recognize and said something along the lines of . “I know it’s a shame that you and (Let’s call him Sean) didn’t work out.” I was instantly question what the hell the context for this conversation was obviously and just sat there stuck. 

About five minutes later I get another notification, I don’t mean to click on this one honestly but I was also talking to someone on instagram so I clicked it because I assumed it was him. It was not

I read two messages before I gtfo of there again

Her, “I feel like Sean was my first love that never worked out”
Them, Something along the lines of it being a shame and suggesting to talk more

I was shook thinking about this. Later that day I was kinda weak honestly and opened the message and read a part of the conversation. It was my gf saying how happy she was with me and how she loves me. Reassured but still flustered

Then I mention that I get her notifications and she kind of panics. She kindly and strongly suggest to just log out if I keep getting her notifications. I was like I’ll just mute them and she seemed disgruntled. I didn’t really notice why at first

I mentioned what exactly I saw as well the next day because it was tearing me up. She said that she had to put on an act for some people and to not worry. She also told me that’s why she wanted me to log out so I didn’t have to see that. This kind of sparked something in me, because why?

Then she mentioned a day or two later that she wanted to have lunch with this guy to catch up and asked if I was ok with it. I don’t ever want to be overbearing and I trust her but she’s making it really hard to trust her.

Yesterday she went on that lunch date and I expected the worst. I have been cheated on or almost cheated on in 4/5 of the relationships I’ve been in and she knows this. She seemed to have a very good time and apparently I came up a lot. She also mentioned how she wished that I was there, then got nervous and clarified it was because she would have rather of spent time with me. She is also aware what this looks like because she’s made comments here and there about it. 

Last night I opened up and the gust is I told her that when she forces me to be less protective of her in situations like that I take a step back and analyze. I told her that I start to not think that she is even mine anymore. I thought that the conversation was constructive. It was still pinned on me needing to heal from my past relationships and I agree with that. It is my responsibility to heal and I actually brought this up first in the conversation. 

This morning she told me that she was feeling not 100% and said that it is not healthy for either of us if she can’t be an adult/ if I am going to question if she is mine ever time she has guy friends. I reassured her and said that I only care if she goes on what the average person would call a date and if she had has feelings with them in the past. I also said that I would never hang out with someone that I had a thing with in the past and listed out the people that I have put off limits. She said thank you but later mentioned how she doesn’t care but also thanked me again. But finished the conversation with saying that her and Sean are going to hang out again but it probably won’t lead anywhere (context friendship). She also mentioned how she wouldn’t ever hang out with those other two guys she dated. Which I don’t care about then honestly because I know them really well and trust them.

I was planing on giving her a promise ring for a six month (also to spite someone who said we wouldn’t make it) which we were both excited about. Except today she asked to move it back so it meant more when she finally got it. I’m not an idiot and the timing is suspect. What should I do here?"
1121,Winter Driving Anxiety,"I don't know if this is the best subreddit for this but about a year ago I got into an accident(I wasn't driving). It wasn't so bad where anyone died or even got seriously injured (minor injuries) but it was so bad that the car flipped and we rolled into a ditch. It was scary, we were trapped in a car that landed on its side surrounded by broken glass. That was near the end of winter last year and I didn't have to deal with bad winter driving again until this year. It's been a mild winter and today was one of the first really bad days for roads, because it wasn't expected the snowplows haven't gone out yet. Since the accident driving at all/being in a car makes me a little anxious. I grip the door, close my eyes, try to deep breathe. But I still get into the car and I just deal with it. It hasn't gotten better but it's not interfering with my life (I still get into the car). But today I got into the car (my dad was driving) and about 3 minutes into the car ride I just start crying, my heart is racing and I can't stop. When I got out of the car, I threw up. I was shaking as if I had just gone through some sort of trauma when I just got in the car to come to school. It's becoming worse over time, the roads will have been cleared by the time I have to go home today but idk if I would feel okay to get in a car if the roads are this bad again. Any advice on how I can work through this anxiety?

TLDR; I got into an accident last year and now I have horrible car anxiety. Any advice?"

1130,Vent/lowkey cry for help,"We'll just start off blunt, i have many unchecked issues from bottling up emotions 

Some examples would be anxiety, depression (both confirmed by doctors) and sleeping issues, then we have issues on the social spectrum, such as inability to interact with people, poor communication skills, purposely isolating myself, etc (i say unchecked because they've gotten pretty bad recently)

 For some background, i know that i was neglected as a child, i love my parents to death because they always went above and beyond to get me things that i wanted, which im grateful for and always will be, but emotionally, neither parent was ever really there when i really needed them (now im 19 and really they're still not but now its my own fault since i stopped trying to get help a while back)

Now my mom, really just tended to always blow me off whenever i'd try to tell her about my day or when i'd try to talk to her because she'd be watching tv or doing something else which i'd say probably had an effect, because it happened almost everytime i tried, or she'd have one of those bs fake conversations like she's listening and in reality she was focused on something else (yes, even as a kid i could pick up on that)

then theres my dad, he is completely emotionally unavailable. He's your typical suburban white dad, trump fan, grab her by the pussy kinda guy mixed with a little bit of redneck, we are total opposites in almost everyway. An example is that i generally dont have sex, i just think its not even anything special anymore these days, but he would try to get me to sleep with any girl i'd ever been friends with and im more than sure its because he dosent want me to be gay, and he cant tell (fun fact, im bi, terrified to tell him, or the rest of my family)

he's been a truck driver for many years, since before i was born and he's still goin to this day, so when i was younger, he worked nights so he slept during the day, and i never really got to see a whole lot of him, it was pretty much just ""be quiet, im trying to sleep"" 

fast forward to now and me and my sister have litteraly sat and had conversations (some with my mother included too) about how dysfunctional our family (ALL of our family) is.

i know its a long read but i just dont have any friends to talk to about serious stuff like this and frankly, i just feel like maybe its my own fault in someway, like maybe there was something i could've done to avoid the neglect like if i tried harder to keep their attention or something, or maybe if i got good at a sport (or anything really for that matter) then maybe they actually would've cared, and maybe they would care today

I also sometimes wonder, since i havent really been close to anyone (there was a close friend group once, but theyre now part of the reason i am the way i am) and i havent gotten to vent to anyone for a really really really long time (like 4-5 years now) if thats something that could have severly hurt my mental health from bottling up emotions for so long 

once again, sorry for how long this is, no friends, wanted to vent"
1131,ADHD. Baffled,I have been diagnosed with adhd for a long time and had gotten to a good spot with self control and went off my med for a few years. Today I took one of my meds because my fiancee wanted me to get back on it so i would be safer while driving. Im is also extremely suicidal. The medication is making me focus. I don't know how anyone does it. Being able to focus on things. It's driving me to tears.
1132,Paranoia?,"Within these last few months, I’ve become extremely panicky. If a stranger is walking behind me, I’ll start to panic and think they’re trying to kill me, so I’ll start to walk really quickly. When I’m walking on a pavement next to a road and a car comes up behind me, I’ll start panicking and try to edge into somebody driveway until the car passes. It’s not just with this too. I’ve also been getting a bad fear of standing up in front of people in school. I start to feel the strong urge to cry whenever I have to and have to push it back. I usually either beg the teacher not to, or I try and explain to the teacher making me that I need to go bathroom. Then if they let me I’ll go and cry it out, or wait until I’m less anxious and come back in. Is this normal? I’ve never had a bad childhood experience, never been beaten, nobody has ever tried to kill me, so I don’t know why I feel this way. Any suggestions?"

Not looking for money, not even necessarily looking for someone with a relevant degree, just looking for people who are passionate and have ideas about how we can move forward as a country because something needs to change. 

I struggled with mental health issues through high school and it has put me so far behind where I wanted to be at this age. I just want to try and help the future generations.

1136,At my wits end...,"I don't even know where to begin.... I suffer from PTSD with depression and anxiety.... My bf is adhd combined..... Been together for almost 6 years now. My ptsd is a recent diagnoses whereas his adhd is not, he's known for years. I had a hysterectomy almost a year ago and have not felt the same since. I go to counseling and see a Dr, as does he. We are both trying to work on our individual issues as well as the ones within our relationship. I should add that he has been off of work for almost two years now due to an injury. His job was his life and his medication for his adhd, if that makes sense. Once he found out he will never be able to go back into that line of work, he has become lost. It has caused a lot of problems in his life and has put a strain on our relationship. Recently, I lied to him, over something completely petty and stupid. And the only reason I did so was not to cause him additional stress. I feel like an idiot for lying, I should have just spoken up and been honest, and I take full responsibility for my actions. But now it's snowballed into something that I'm not sure we'll get back from. I lied, he in turn started checking my phone. I didn't tell him about purchasing a pillow off of someone, just went and picked it up. Because I didn't tell him that I was doing that, it made the situation worse. He now not only checks my phone, he gets mad at me when I am on fb and it looks like I'm on messenger, but I honestly am not. He not only checks where I am via our family locater but has gone as far as to also check my location history via Google. I go to work, and go home. That's literally it. I have no friends, barely speak to my family, don't go out, nothing. I try my best to correct the mistakes I have made, but it is never enough, and I don't think it ever will be. I feel like I am constantly under a microscope. He's been struggling with stress and health, and I've supported him 200% every step of the way. I try my hardest to change things that set off his insecurities. Every day seems to get worse. Every day he wakes up angrier and angrier, and he is barely sleeping. He is so angry that literally every day he starts with me the instant I get up. No exaggeration. There is literally not a day that goes by that he is not telling me something I've done wrong. To make matters worse, I have to taper off of my current medication as I am not reacting well to it. My anxiety is literally at an 8 if not higher upon waking. Add on him being extremely crabby and angry towards me and it's astronomical. I'm in a constant state of tension at this point. And yet all I can think about is him. What can I do to help? How can I make his life easier. How can I change what I'm doing to cause him to be insecure. With my issues, I still and probably always put him first, worry about him more than myself. I just don't know what to say or do anymore. I love him more than I ever thought possible. And I'm scared to lose him.... Need advice...."

1147,Can this happen on Olanzapine?,"Hey guys, I hope this is allowed. I made a post a few days ago on BipolarReddit asking if I was maybe having a manic episode as I hadn't slept in 4 days, was bouncing off the walls, couldn't sleep no matter what I did, stopped eating, couldn't grasp onto a single thought, hypersexuality, among other things. Everyone said either way I should go to the ER. Well after a few hours of hypervigilance and paranoia I called my mum to take me. They took me to the psych ward as an involuntary patient for 3 days but after I cooperted with the doctor they switched me to voluntary so long as I stayed at least one night. I saw 3 different psychiatrists and all 3 had different opinions of what was going on and put through a referral for me to get DBT and start on seroquil with my diagnosis not yet determined. 1 thought mania, 1 thought schizoaffective disorder, and 1 thought complex-PTSD. So diagnosis not yet confirmed until I have ongoing DBT. Well during all of this, the nursing staff would give me diazepam to sleep, I took one at 12pm at the hospital and then the second one at 2am that night in the ward. So 2 total. The next morning before I saw the psych for permision to leave I was given Olanzapine about 11pm on 6th Feb. As soon as that kicked in I was met with the worst fatigue of my life, all my muscles and joints hurt and I am basically falling asleep anywhere, anytime, uncontrollably. I am so exhausted. I have been home sleeping. But now I just woke up, it's 2:20am on 7th Feb and I woke up because something compelled me to wake up, I turned and there was someone in my room - clear as day standing there and she was there for a very long time. Minutes upon minutes. I could do an accurate detailed drawing of her, she was there for that long. I told myself this has to be the medication, I rubbed my eyes and blinked but she didn't go away for a while until I picked up my phone to see the time, I looked at her again and she very slowly faded. I wasn't scared. I'm only now just spooking myself out as I can't seem to find anything about it being a side effect of any of the medication I was given. And I also don't know if it's even still in my system? Has anyone had this reaction?"
1148,Ending a friendship,"Hey guys, I hope you can help me with my problem.
So I have this friend, and in the beginning of our friendship I really felt like she and I were soulmates. We had a really loving and strong connection. It’s been almost 5 years, and for the last year I’ve beginning to lose those feelings for her. I am personally very shy to conflict, and I don’t really speak my mind when someone hurts my feelings with either their words or actions. I think that’s one of the reasons why I feel this distance towards her now, because she’s been hurting me multiple times. I feel no connection towards her anymore, I don’t feel like telling her anything, and lately I’ve just gotten sad, after spending a couple of hours with her. I finally told her, that I needed some space, and we haven’t spoken for 3-4 weeks. I’m not sure that our relationship can be fixed, because I’ve just lost feelings. I know she still cares deeply about me, and she doesn’t want things to end. But I’m just not sure that I want to give it another chance. I think about our time together and how we used to have so much fun together, but I still feel like I need to move on and gain new friends. I’ve had some really rough years with depression, and right now I’m trying to change my life, heal and getting treatment. I feel guilt because of her, and how I know she still cares about me, but my feelings just aren’t mutual. 

So have you guys been through the same? And how did you handle it? What did you say to your friend and how did you end it? Am I too drastic or should I listen to my feelings? I’m really confused and I don’t want to hurt her, but I also don’t want to hurt myself by continuing something that holds me down and makes me sad. Is there hope or should I move on with my life?"

1151,Depression or Anxiety? (Please Read),"(Reposted from other subreddits)

I was scared about posting here because I feared it would confirm what Ive been dreading, but at this point any sort of answer is better than nothing. Of course I know I shoudn't self diagnose, nor should I expect that from any one here, but any opinions I can get are better than nothing

For about 5 months, I've been experiencing on again off again bouts of not being able to do things I enjoy (watching vids, playing video games, ect). Its not like I don't want to do these things, nor do I not have the motivation to do them, but some part of my brain tells me that they wont make me happy. This is accompanied by a feeling of unease dread and tension in my chest, muscle aches in the left and right side of my abdomen, and being unable to focus on almost anything with my mind racing everywhere. Its negatively impacted my sleep aswell, as its lucky if I get 4-5 hours of rest a night.

What confuses me is weather this all sounds like depression or just anxiety, as ive never had suicidal thoughts or feelings of self harm, nor have I even had any form of sadness. Any advice over this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you"

I don't have a good time playing games anymore. I push myself way too hard over hours and hours of practice just to get that one moment of victory. When I do well in a game my friends congratulate me, meanwhile I am sitting there beating myself up thinking of how to do better. EVEN WORSE, when my friends do well, I get annoyed and dont congratulate them even though I want to, I'm just a bitch. When I try to congratulate them, it feels inauthentic like I'm doing it just to do it. How do be better friend???

There is literally no reason as to why i would have mood swings, my life has improved recently, and my mood swings are not triggered by events, thoughts or bad days if you get what i mean.

1154,Anxiety about slipping on ice,"I’ve lived in New England for my whole life, so I’m definitely no stranger to snow or ice. It never really bothered me as a kid, but now that I’m older (28), I freak out if the temperatures are low and the street looks even the slightest bit wet. I don’t drive, but I walk, and I feel like that’s even worse. While the city plows and salts the streets where cars drive, the sidewalks and sides of the street are left untreated.

I work part time, and I get so anxious that I sometimes have to call out. My bosses are understanding, but I still worry that I’ll be fired or that I’m being unreliable. I try to make my schedule based on the weather, but forecasts change. We had/have an ice storm today, and I’m glad that I’m not working, but I’m supposed to work tomorrow. What if it’s still icy? I already took Tuesday off because I didn’t feel well, so I said I would make the time up tomorrow. I don’t want to call out again, but I also don’t want to get hurt or obsess over the possibility that I could be injured.

I’m so sick of this. I’m sick of checking the weather several times a day. Winter in New England can last anywhere from October to April, depending on the year. I’d like to see a therapist, but I’m too afraid to even make appointments that I may not even be able to keep because of this issue. I’m sick of the crying and nausea and worrying.

1155,should i get checked for OCD?,"my friend has OCD, and he described the illness very differently than i thought it was. i thought it was a compulsion with cleanliness and organization, but apparently it can be any obsessions/compulsions that rule your life.

i personally have strange fears that effect my behavior to some extent. overall i’m convinced that i will die unnaturally at a young age, currently i’m 19. i’m afraid of highways to the point of me not being able to drive on them. i’m afraid of a specific hallway in my house, and that someone could easily hide in it, and i physically can not walk past it. i can’t sit with my legs hanging off of things (bed, bench, couch, etc.) because i am afraid someone or something might cut my achilles’ tendon. i’m also afraid that i will fly into a rage and kill someone, and that i’ll panic and only make the situations worse, thus completely ruining my life. 

i have a few other small things as well, but i’m not sure if this is just me being an anxious person or what... i honestly thought that these were phobias that most people have to some extent. what do you think?"

1157,Weird thought patterns for 2 months,"Hey everyone, I'm sorry I didn't really know where to ask this and I'll be honest I'm a bit confused and scared and don't quite know how to feel. 

For the past 2 months I've been having periods of extreme determination and periods of emptiness and some reoccurring suicidal thoughts. Some days I went to the gym and had my best workouts and didn't feel tired and thought I was 1 in a million and was the next big fitness advocate and theyl next day or even during the same day look in the mirror and see the most disgusting person in the world and feel ashamed of myself. There's also times where I exude confidence and talk to random people and others where I hide from everyone and avoid speaking. And on Christmas I smiled and showed I was having a good time, but inside I felt completely numb (almost like I was in traffic).  In the beginning these emotions seemed to last for a day or two but now they seem to cycle ever 4-6 hours and range from On top of the world to defeated and suicidal. In June I went on a diet and lost 150 pounds and that became my life and now I don't want to go to the gym and have turned to binge eating again. I feel like I'm losing my sense of self and don't remember what being stable feels like anymore. I do have a doctor's appointment tomorrow and will get a professionals help, but any advice on how to cope or what this might be would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all for listening m"

I don't know where to turn to, so I'll just write my boring story here.

I'm studying electrical engineering, sort of. Tbh I haven't really studied for a year, but I'm really good at programming/FPGA stuff so I get to pass with 60-70% percent grade. Now stuff(subjects) that demand work has pilled up and I have to do it right, but I have no motivation what so ever to do so. 

What I've done is met a person that is nearby on tinder, a girl, and have been chatting with her every single day, most of the day making her content and happy, appriciated and found my fullfilment there. I do kind of like her, but nothing to extreme, she just seems to be there always and help me use her as distraction? I don't know anymore. We have like 5k of pictures sent in those 4 months, our pets, memes, us. Sometimes she shows interest, sometimes she is cold. She asked me to hang out before, I refused, and now that I'm asking her out she refuses, says the time is not ready. Point is, due to me being so insecure I tend to know everything about a person, and I begin to notice if they chat with someone else. I called her yesterday on that, asked why does she feel need for more people, am I not enough, and what do I even mean to her? She just brushed it off, said I crossed the line and it is not my place to know that and to leave her alone for a while. She said I'm suffocating her. We talked today, same thing, she just said don't talk to me, I asked if she needed time to think, or we are done, and she said it's first one but I doubt it, it's gonna end soon. How can one just end such contact even after many many hours and sleepless nights together online? Why does it happen to me, I know my personality is needy and nosy sometimes, but I think it's due to the fact we just chat and it is my only medium of knowing her? I told her that but she just said it is not worth thinking about, eating her nerves and stuff. I'm not sure what to do, I got so so used to her, yesterday I couldn't sleep and got drunk for the first time in my life in order to stop thinking. It did help, minus throwing up, but now here we are again. I hate myself for being so nosy. I hate myself for trusting someone so much. I hate myself for being so insecure. I hate myself for being impatient. I hate myself for not being able to focus on my problems, and have to have somebody to love, focus my time onto. It is the only thing that kept me and made me do something. Otherwise I would've just done nothing at all, sleep all the time, or be ultra hyped about something for short periods of time. Why am I so weak? I feel depressed all the time, feel dead inside, had some suicidal thoughts, and vomiting seems to help me feel better from time to time, not that I eat so much, nor have body weight problems. I'm quite certain I wouldn't commit suicide tho, since I always see ""hope"" somewhere. 

Before this, only person i got attached to this much was my ex, 4 years older, when i was 16-20. She was just like me in those periods, only I kind of devoted to her, and was her distraction. She is now well off, and focus on herself spending time, and deemed our relationship as waste of her time. I kind of moved on after that, and now this. I need someone to focus on so I don't have to look at myself, and I spent so much energy on the one from tinder, I don't think I could meet someone that is so there, and so accepting and good thinker, but at the same time caring. Why did I have to f*** this up? Why? Would she even really go out with me if I wasn't that nosy? Where have I gone wrong?

Also, aside from constant depression, and lack of motivation for anything other than what I've said, maybe i'm bipolar since I have moments where I can't stop and sit and I have to walk and think and overthink, and plan grand things like learning Japanese in new faculty alongside this one I don't take that seriously, and is considered hardest in my country. What should i do in order to improve? I don't want therapy, nor to include my family in this. 
I don't really have any friends at all I can talk to about this problems, she was my friend and listened to, until I crossed the line by being too much nosy I guess? I can't really bring myself to cry either, just sort of hate and making faces for the shit I am.


I know all of this is too random, not chronical, but had to talk about it since I can't stop thinking about all of this, it's just on repeat in my head, repeat, repeat, repeat, and if I'm already suffocating her, can't talk to her for a day or two for sure now.

Point is I have many problems, that could be deduced from what is written here, I don't even know how to ask for help, because I don't know what I shall do. Those problems are not as serious are some, but I can't help but to ask someone here. If you have any questions, those are also welcome. 

Thank you."
1159,Building a game that's supposed to give depressed people coping tools,"Hiya! I'm Kim Kupiainen. A game production student in Kajaani University of Applied Sciences.  
We're making a game (project lighthouse) With the premise to give coping tools and mechanisms for people with depression through a game. Here's our first Vlog. If you're interested in finding out more. Please join our discord and spread the word.

I'll be checking out reddit for a hour or so now. So if you have any questions, I'm open to answer them.

We're students, so we're not getting money through this. We're interested in learning more about serious gaming. Video is in finnish. However I added english subtitles to help understand what's up in this video.

1160,Medication or not?,"My psychologist told me I should get meds because I have more than four symptoms, and I have a family history of mental illness, so I am more vulnerable. It will be very difficult trying to cope with it through just therapy. She said that if I don't, I might get worse. She gave me a few days to think about it. 

I am really skeptical about going on medication though because I am somehow functioning, even though everyday tasks take a lot more energy than they normally would. I don't have any suicidal thoughts or hallucinations, so nothing extreme. 

She told me I have severe emotional exhaustion. I don't know what kind of meds that requires but I'm guessing antidepressants. Is anyone on these? What side effects do they have?"
1161,Keep having this dream where 911 doesn't show up.,"I am posting this on this sub because I feel this very much has to do with my crippling anxiety, maybe even depression. Thank you for reading...

I don't know why, but for the past few years, every so often I have this dream and it is the exact same setting and circumstance every single time.

I am in my childhood home with my family, the number of family members in this dream is the only thing that seems to fluctuate from dream to dream. Every time, we hear an intruder coming in from downstairs trying to kill us. We go and hide in our secret hideout on the top floor and I call 911. Every time I call 911, the operator seems she couldn't careless about the fact I am in danger. She seems to be confused about where I am and why I would need police. Once she agrees with me that police need to be involved, she tells me that the police will be there soon and we hang up.

This is where it gets frustrating. The police NEVER show up. Ever. Every single time, they always fail to get there in time. Its almost as if I never called 911 in the first place.

What has been a new ""change"" in this dream i keep having is that the intruder can't find us so he decides to give up and leave the house, then and only then after we have checked the house to make sure it is safe do the police finally decide to show up, but it is always after the danger has passed.

Why do you think I keep having this dream? I also have dreams where I am being chased by someone who is trying to kill me and I can't seem to run fast, almost as if I am in slow motion. When the person chasing me grabs me, I wake up.

I also struggle with thanatophobia so I am sure that has something to do with it too. Why do you think this could be happening?"
1162,Tips on opening up,"I feel it is finally time to open up to my work partner. I think they are vaguely aware something is amiss from some wobbles I had when I first started working at my job. 

I've been doing so well lately, but I know that it is likely starting to come to an end. I want them to be aware that when things do eventually start to go downhill again that there are genuine reasons. And that they may even be able to point out to me that I don't seem myself. 

Anyway, I don't want to get too in-depth for this initial conversations. I'm just thinking a vague 'I struggle with my mental health, it's going well at the moment but likely won't last.' will suffice and then I can just take it from there.

What do you guys think? Do you have any tips to help the conversation go well and anything to avoid saying?"
1163,I'm just asking because worrying,"I  guess I had just a panic attack two weeks ago,because my heart is fine.But it still hurts right there sometimes..And when I asked my gp about it,she said something about the pressure,and that if it will happen again ,come over then ...Can my chest hurt  just because of my big stress?Is it possible?"
1164,"I've convinced myself I've every disorder in the past year+. Tomorrow I'm planning on calling therapy, how should I prepare?","I've been bored, anxious and friendless at college and as a result, my mental health has suffered quite a bit. This has led me to dive deeply into mental disorders and at points I've convinced myself I've had a whole bunch. It's problematic because whenever I self-diagnose I feel like I subconsciously start to act like I have the disorder

Anyway, I've been putting off the free therapy my school offers for over a year. How it works is that there's a 15 minute consultation on the day you call, and I'm curious how I should prepare. I'm planning on mentioning a few things, is that enough?"
1165,Bit of a weird one,"Hey, erm bit of a weird one, I'm quite a nice, easy-going guy, however, for the last 2-4 months I've been experiencing visions and dreams of just horrible things such as brutal murder and torture. This has escalated quite dramatically to the point where every human showing me any sign of love or respect, my first thought is to slit their throat. In real life I'm not really a violent person but I just can't escape this craving for slitting someone's throat, I sound a bit mental. But yeah, I decided to write this since I am fearful this may escalate further to the point where i can't control my self. I would appreciate any responses which could help me learn how to escape or understand wtf is happening to me."
1166,(Undiagnosed) Bipolar Husband Wants a Divorce and I Don't Know What to Do,"Apologies for the long post. I guess this is a half question/half story. But I'm concerned about my spouse's mental health and I'm not sure what to do. At this point, he refuses to seek professional help. He has a family history of bipolar but has not been diagnosed. I know that posting here is not a substitute for seeking mental health care, but I'm really trying to make sense of this since I, unfortunately, can't make him get help. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar? I just feel so lost and am in so much pain. I love him so much and just want to make things better for everyone. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare...

I've been separated from my husband for two months now (together for 13 years, married for five). He began a new, high-stress job at the end of September and around the same time, his grandmother (who basically raised him while his mother worked) became very ill. It's at this time that I noticed a personality change in him. Fast forward to the beginning of November--we had a fight--I'm still not sure about what--that ended in him wanting a divorce. I was totally blindsided. We were having intimacy issues (I chalked that up to stress and both of us being tired from our workdays), but otherwise, we had a good marriage. Spent lots of time together, talked all the time, ate dinner together every night, went on trips together, he took me out of town for my birthday a few days before our fight, wrote ""I love you!"" on my birthday card, etc. During this fight he told me that he never loved me, always knew our marriage would fail, and only did nice things for me to convince himself that he loved me. 

Since our separation--which was entirely his choice--he's essentially been gaslighting me, according to my therapist. Basically making me feel like I'm an abusive monster who doesn't deserve love or sex. I've also caught him in lies (e.g. he told me that our marriage counselor told him that his and my relationship is the ""most f\*\*ked up she's ever seen."" Turns out she said nothing of the sort and was horrified that he'd tell me that). There's much more, but hopefully, that provides some context. I truly don't know where this is coming from. I'm definitely not perfect, but therapy has taught me not to buy into his perception of me.

I'm very concerned about his mental health. This is not the kind, supportive, fantastic man I married. I feel like he's an entirely different person. Not only do I feel this way, but his family, my family, and our friends feel this way, too. It's like everyone else sees there's something wrong except for him. His family has been trying to get him to see a mental health professional, but he's very reluctant. Currently, he refuses to see me because ""our situation is difficult,"" I'm ""so much a part of his pain,"" he's ""doing everything he can to keep it together,"" etc. He also refuses to talk about our situation with me in any capacity, which really hurts me. All of this really hurts me.

Some more possibly relevant points: he's mentioned hallucinating before; stated that he's ""losing his mind""; thinks he knows everything about everything but simultaneously admits to having ""inadequacy issues""; is rather condescending; has difficulty concentrating and moves from ""project to project"" without completing anything; stated that he feels like he's ""moving underwater,"" and has mentioned being both incredibly anxious and depressed. There are more, but these are some things that immediately come to mind."
1167,Need some advice to help settle my nerves,"Before Christmas last year I got attacked by a group who were trying to steal my phone. Ever since I’ve found it hard to leave my house apart from work and my local shop. I find myself skipping out on friends hanging out in the town I got attacked in out of fear it’ll happen again, especially in the dark.

Today I thought I’d be daring and go with some friends around another’s house and also decided to walk into town to get a bus but told my friends about how uncomfortable I felt so one of them offered to come with me. I felt fine until we split ways, he decided to leave me a few meters from the bus stop and as I walked over I saw a group of people walking the opposite direction as me and one of them stared at me and it set off my nerves.

I’m scared of always feeling like this and I don’t want to be a burden on my friends by not showing up to get together or having one always with me, so does anyone have any advice to help calm me down if I’m ever like this again, I don’t want to be stuck with a fear like this all my life."
1168,hallucinations,"i don't know what is happening to me. for about a month when i close my eyes i can see mountains forming, eventually a road, all in blue and grey colour. today i was very bored and sad and just stared at this for almost an hour, eventually it gets a bit more intense beyond what i ever imagined

my ears begin to ring and my jaw gets locked up as the mountains turn into a geometric tunnel, my heart begins to race as when i exit the tunnel i get a full blown hallucination as real as real life, into a desert with small green shrubs as the road becomes split into two with yellow tracks down the middle, the mountains become chalky white and i can even see the cracks and the blue sky, it lasted for about 20 seconds and i'm pretty shocked and really lost what to do about it"

1171,Should I go to a psychiatrist while at a University?,"So, I've got mental health issues. Several. Few diagnosed, few that are just my assumptions. I haven't been in a therapy for a few years now and it's getting pretty bad. I'm thinking of going to a psychiatrist, but there are few people saying that when (and it's mostly likely when not if) I'm put on medication it could mess with my studies. I can't really tell whether it's true cause last time I got prescribed medication I was in middle school and my mother simply didn't buy the meds so I have no idea how true it is. Can anyone confirm? And if it is true, I would really appreciate some thoughts on whether it's better to try to cope (which is hard) or risk my grades and possibly the whole semester.

Just in case it's relevant, I'm Polish, so I guess if there are people from Poland they can share their thoughts on Polish psychiatry specifically."
1172,I am a Registered Play Therapist because.....," **The following short piece explains a personal journey into the fascinating world of play therapy.**  
 [https://suzette-turnerclark.squarespace.com/config/pages/5d24f73bd006630001806249](https://suzette-turnerclark.squarespace.com/config/pages/5d24f73bd006630001806249)"
1173,PTSD- the reason and why I feel stupid about it,"A few weeks ago I got diagnosed with PTSD. I always thought that you could only get PTSD from a life and death situation. My PTSD however was caused by a shit supervisor at my graduation internship in 2018, and I feel really stupid about it.

My boss/supervisor basically made it a sport to try to shit as much on me as possbile. He started out as a very good supervisor I guess. Trying to help me, and teaching me new stuff, but after 2 months, something happened and no matter how hard I tried. Everything I did was garbage. He basically started wearing me down until the end of my internship. When he was nice to me, he made sexual jokes (sometimes involving me). I started having panick attacks in the bathroom every time he wanted to talk to me about something.

At the end of my internship he had to grade my work and my thesis which I was writing while I was doing my internship there. I needed at least a 7,5 to keep my gpa as high as it was to get admitted to the masters degree I wanted to do.

The day that he graded me came, and he started out talking about how I did not do my work well and how he never got the feeling that he got to know me. He told me that he talked to colleagues and was very confused that I was more open and talkative with other employers than with him, and that everyone had a different impression of me. He stated that I might had to go see a psychologist because he thought I had a multiple personality disorder. I don't remember the rest of the conversation very well honestly. Only that he graded me a 6 and I went home early and very upset. 

Eventually everything worked out when I got to talk to my professors/ graduation supervisor from college. They assured me that they were not going to let him grade me, as I told them my experience. Luckily they knew me well so they knew that the description of my internship supervisor could not be accurate. So in the end I did get into the masters of my choice. 

Fast forward a few months and I was still dealing with immens amounts of stress that I had to decide to take a gap year before my masters. I started seeing a psychologist (not for the personality disorder,  my supervisor kindly suggested that I had) beucase I was still dealing with panick attacks at my part time retail job I was taking in my gap year. Every time my boss wanted to talk to me, I suffered from panick attacks. Things eventually got slightly better and my psychologist decided I was doing fine and discontinued my treatment. When I started my masters in 2019, shit went down hill again. I had so much stress that I trembled when the exam weeks came around, and I was suffering from panic attacks again. 

This time I sought out another psychologist as I changed from GP. (Insurance things from the country I live in)After a few session my psychologist has diagnosed me with PTSD and an anxiety disorder. As the waiting times here are very long, I have to wait to the end of this months untill I start my treatment with EMDR.

Right now I feel trapped in a hole I can't get out of. I feel really stupid that a situation like that gave me PTSD. A normal person could just be like, fuck it. I don't agree, you are a dick and move on. But I feel weak for it to have such an impact on me. 

The feeling of stuckness stems from the fact that I feel incapable of doing anything. I get panic attacks when I get the feeling there is too much pressure on me, so persuing my masters degree is proving to be very difficult like this. Also I am afraid to start working in the professional field as everytime I am confronted with an 'authority figure' (basically my boss wanting to talk to be for any reason) I get panic attacks. 

I hope that things will start looking up in a few months with the treatment. I just needed to vent somewhere honestly. I feel very alone and ashamed. My boyfriend and parents are here for me but they don't felly get it.  I also had to delay my masters for another year as it has been proven to be very difficult to study with all the stress and panic attacks. 

Anyhow thanks for reading."
1174,I feel ungrateful about my life.,"About one year ago I had an psychosis induced by stress and I've gradually managed to get myself back on track after the incident. Today I have a stable job, an apartment and enough money not to worry about food or bills. I feel as if I should be more happy and especially grateful that everything has turned out as well as it did. But I am not, I actually feel worse then I did directly after the psychosis and it just doesn't seem right to me."
1175,Denial,"We’ve all found ourselves in it but, not until we’ve come out of it. Denial is one of the biggest factors I’ve seen in my own mental health and others and, it is basically a paradox. No matter the amount of proof, logic, or science you can provide, a person in denial will not accept or see that they are. It’s horribly sad that we have to come to breaking points where the denial has hurt ourselves or others to finally come out of it and even more sad there is no way to avoid it. The only thing you can do is learn to accept the nature of it and people and learn that you are going to come across it indefinitely. Be it yourself or someone you love. 
Just don’t ever stop loving. 

This is something that has been effecting my life for years and I just hope to shed some light on it for someone else who may be struggling."
1176,"Only I seem to face consequences, and I'm starting to feel lonely and hopeless","A couple weeks ago my friend's mom found weed in her house that seemed to belong to me. The truth is I was holding it for one of my friends who also smokes it with her son. The thing is her son is my lifelong friend, and so is my other friend, and I chose not to betray them and took all the blame myself. I told her that I'm holding it for another friend, and I don't smoke since my father literally died from smoking and drugs. My friend's mom clearly said she wouldn't tell anyone, and today I hear her outright telling some relatives that could easily tell my mom.

The thing is that everyone uses me as some kind of scapegoat. Tbh her son (my friend), is the one who smokes the most weed, and is even the reason my other friend also came into contact with it. He also lies to his mom and tells her he goes to college, while hes actually lying and dropped out. He also has a girl that he cheats on all the time. Meanwhile, I struggle really hard to study and be kind to everyone, and I have been having a hard time getting a job lately to fit in with my college schedule.

He has a very easy job that he only goes like 2 days to work for a short period of time, I know it's easy because I went with him to work couple times and he basically has no boss, and it's off the books). Yet, everyday I have to listen my mom and everyone around me (including the mom of the girl I like) mention that he has a job and goes to college, why can't I do the same. 

I guess idk what to say, I'm in shock because it feels as if people have become completely delusional to the truth. It also breaks my heart that i constantly get betrayed so easily, while I try to remain a good person. I know it may seem shallow, but honestly to God I always try my best to help everyone. Even when I had a bully in middle school, I showed him nothing but kindness and he actually apologized for bullying me last year. 

I honestly didn't even feel like writing this because it felt egotistical, but I have nowhere or no one left it feels. Please help me, these days I've just been feeling completely hopeless and I feel like I have no friend, even though I hang out with that friend. I just feel lonely. I don't want my friend to get in trouble either, I just want equality, where it's not just me always getting the hurt :("
1177,Getting medications without sounding like a druggie?,"I have crippling anxiety and depression, and I think I may be ADD. My mom has a Xanax prescription and my sister has an Adderall prescription. My mom has, on multiple occasions, allowed me to take her Xanax (maybe 5 times a year?), mainly before exams, big presentations, etc. It works great for me. However, it is also decidedly illegal. I have brought up a Xanax prescription with my psychiatrist a few times, and she always shoots it down immediatley. She does not know I have taken it before and I know it works. My thought process is that she sees me, an 18 year old high school student, as a little addict or wannabe dealer. 

Another aspect to this is the Adderall. My sister has really bad ADHD and takes it most mornings. I have taken maybe 3 annually since she got them. I take them like the Xanax, maybe the day before an exam to study. The thing is, they don't really do all that much. I took my first one last year and I was like, ""This doesn't seem to do as much as it should."" Since then I have notice that I do a lot of blank staring rather than schoolwork, I can never stay on top of anything in school, etc. My research shows that these, along with other things I do, are symptoms of ADD. 

I am fully able to understand that a measly self diagnosis is worthless. However, I'm afraid that if I bring it up to my psychiatrist, she will instantly brush me off as a patient with a ""history of pursuing drugs.""  I just want her to listen to me and understand that I don't want to get high or whatever, I just want to function. Do I try and reason with her or get a new psychiatrist? Anyone else been through anything similar?"

So what is happening to me? I am only 14 years old..."
1179,Empathy,"I feel like I'm one of those overly empathetic people. I've spent majority of today cooped up in my room because I'm aware of like 6 or 10 people who are having a shitty life or a shitty element in their life. And they are coping but.. I just wish I could take the pain away. The annoying part is I struggle with my mental health too and over the past few days it got soo good! I was feeling happy n all that but now that ik about these people am back to square one.
People feel like a burden rn because as much as I love different people I want to take away their pain bcoz I've gone through the stuff n it sucks. It sucks even more to feel helpless. Just really isolating myself, yeah ik not the solution but rn I bearly have enough energy or will to sit up."
1180,When you’re spirit is broken and you’ve nothing left to give...,"[When your spirit is broken](https://i.imgur.com/gzbzyjP.jpg) and you’ve nothing left to give to anyone, let alone yourself, how did you begin to rebuild yourself, recharge your battery?

I’ve felt ‘down’ before but this is different. This is more like the last of the layers have been peeled away, the masks I’ve worn have been boxed up, and all that’s left is an empty shell. 

You try to explain to your SO that you’re at the end of your rope, you’re spent, you’ve got nothing left to give. You laugh that laugh. You know the one when you’re working really hard to keep it all together. 

Maybe for the first time in your life you come to the realization that all the control you thought you had really had control over you; it’s all been an illusion. 

How did your therapist/counselor help you to begin to pull all the pieces back together?

BTW, it’s kinda fun asking the crew at the bakery to write how I’m feeling on the cake. Makes for a great conversation starter at checkout, too!"
1181,Keep breathing,"You know it’s weird or maybe I’m just weird, but regardless, woke up earlier had me a nice little cry( not even sure what I was crying about) but then I got out of bed made me some tea and now I’m working on my resume so hey, A for effort."
1182,"I’ve gotten the impression that personality disorders are never talked about,they’re lesser known mental illnesses.","Depression and anxiety is always talked about over the last couple of years,but personality disorders are never really talked about as much. Do you think it’s because a personality disorder can just be seen as someone’s personality/quirk? Unfortunately I think it’s because personality disorders are hard for people to separate from a person’s personality as an illness to treat."
1183,Casual Self Harm,"I know that I have issues, serious ones. I hate myself. I'm incredibly anxious about everything, and I get embarrassed too easily. This all leads to my depression, which I've had for a very long time. I have self destructive issues that have been taking a bit of a toll on me, one of them being self harm. I punish myself for being imperfect and whenever I get embarrassed or get way too anxious, or just fail to be what I want to be, I hurt myself in some way, wether that's jumping down a small flight of stairs to make my ankles hurt when I land, or knocking the wind out of myself. I'm really not ok with these self destructive habits and I know they're only making things worse but I can't stop feeling like I need to knock some sense into myself. I'm not comfortable in my own body."
1184,"What does help look like, what do I need to do","We are constantly told to reach out for help and to talk to someone. I have. But I'm told life is tough, I need to be helping myself.

 I'm on my sixth antidepressant, I've been to group therapy, individual therapy, CBT DBT. I practice mindfulness, I meditate, I do activities, I take all meds, I exercise, I eat as well as I can manage. I have poor physical health, I'm grieving, I have a lot of family and money stresses. This all happened during my latest mental health crisis.

I go repeatedly to Dr and ask for help but I get referred to more groups, placed on waiting lists, put on new meds. I do not want to live. I have to for my family and my kid. What am I missing, what am I doing wrong. When I ask for help, what exactly am I asking for? I'm told I'm okay, I'm still managing, I haven't attempted or I'm not 'lashing out'. It won't be an attempt. I have said this. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't know how to want to live but I try to live. 

What help is there? I feel really hopeless and there is no help available, I've tried to do what I can on my own."
1185,Why am I changing and how do I reverse it?,"I'm becoming reclusive despite having extroverted habits, and friends I used to like hanging out with are becoming a burden. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I used to care about people a lot,even if I  hate them, but now I just flip between being overly emotional and completely apathetic. It's like a switch in my brain turns off and I just become the biggest jerk on the planet. At one moment I don't want to hurt anyone and the other I enjoy being incredibly sadistic.  


This started happening just a few months ago and I don't know why. I become analytical and ""emotionless"" (I'm not a crazy psycho, I consider myself pretty normal other than a few odd qualities that most don't have, but I'm not special. But it's almost like I just don't feel? I know I do, but it just sort of disappears? I don't understand) and very judgmental, and see myself above others (the best word I can think of is god-complex) and then later I'll go back to how I usually am. I hurt people when I'm like that, but I do it secretly (such as covert bullying) and they'll come to me for emotional aid, since that's what I'm known for, but I'll just feel like I'm tricking them and it feels good. I hate that when I change, but I don't remember a lot of it.  


I'm often told I used to do things as a child  and not remember doing them, but I can't see how that would relate to what I do now since I remember a good amount of what I do, though I do have very bad memory problems.. The only thing I ever remember as a child that was like this was killing small rodents for fun, but I regret that. I was a very violent child, but I've outgrown that thanks to counseling and my own self-discipline. I'm not insecure and I'm pretty confident in myself too, if that's relevant. I don't know, I typically don't deal with stuff like this.  


I don't know what to do, I'm an adult and I feel like this is some edgy fanfic but it's real, and I want it to go away. I don't know what I should do. Is there anyone who deals with the same thing or have any idea how to fix this? I want to get over this. (If it's relevant, I was a victim of drug abuse during my first few years of life, and physical and mental abuse after that, but I've overcome that, or at least for the most part.)  


Thanks for reading, or skimming. And sorry, I'm not very good putting words together like this, so it's long."
1186,When your spirit is broken and you’ve nothing left to give...,"[When your spirit is broken](https://i.imgur.com/gzbzyjP.jpg) and you’ve nothing left to give to anyone, let alone yourself, how did you begin to rebuild yourself, recharge your battery?

I’ve felt ‘down’ before but this is different. This is more like the last of the layers have been peeled away, the masks I’ve worn have been boxed up, and all that’s left is an empty shell. 

You try to explain to your SO that you’re at the end of your rope, you’re spent, you’ve got nothing left to give. You laugh that laugh. You know the one when you’re working really hard to keep it all together. 

Maybe for the first time in your life you come to the realization that all the control you thought you had really had control over you; it’s all been an illusion. 

How did your therapist/counselor help you to begin to pull all the pieces back together?

BTW, it’s kinda fun asking the crew at the bakery to write how I’m feeling on the cake. Makes for a great conversation starter at checkout, too!"
1187,Downward spiral.,"Where to start, I’ve always had trouble with mental health from an early age and suffered with anxiety and depression. But as I got older they wrongly diagnosed me with ADD for maybe 5-6 years of my life. Then I get accessed when I was 20 and got told I have a borderline personality disorder and since then my life has just become worse and worse got hooked on drugs on my 18th birthday. MDMA and mdma pills, ket, coke anything I could get my hands on was in a really abusive relationship in this time too and was also selling what I was using I’m not proud but I thought I was invincible this went on for about 2 years, until one day I just thought to myself no but this is when the bpd got worse.. once I’d quit all the really bad drugs I started smoking weed again I know replacing a drug for a drug is bad but I feel has helped me, so getting back to it I just went into some sort of hole anxious depressed was hearing stuff and seeing stuff that wasn’t there, sleep paralysis the whole works lmao. Still to this day they affect me and I’m still just a shell of who I used to be.. and to top it off it should be a positive I know, I have a child on the way and I’ve never been more scared. The girl and I are no longer together and to be honest with you I couldn’t hate her more she’s childish where she doesn’t need to be I don’t know how or what to do from here but I’m  done and I’m fed up of feeling empty all the time"
1188,Worry wart.,I have anxiety and I know this sounds like a common symptom but it really bothers me (and the people around me.) I feel like I ALWAYS have to be worrying/guilty about something. It ranges from things that happened years ago all the way to made up scenarios. It drives me crazy. I am not okay if I’m not stressing/worrying over something.  I hate it so much. I can never just have a peaceful day.
1189,"🌈 22m gay, Seeking advice on changing Romantic relationship dynamic","I don't like having a crush / being in love. It always causes me mostly stress, worry and jelousy. 

I don't know if I just lack the emotional maturity, if it's an aspect of my personality, or if I have unhealthy ideas about relationships. But being in love with someone actually makes my life worse. 

I don't know how to fix it, and I don't think I'll ever be in a successful relationship if I don't.

I also get these intense feelings way too quickly, after meeting someone just a couple of times.

It's so exciting at first when someone you find attractive shows signs of interest as well and gives you attention. The first messages, asking you how you are, what you're doing. But then you get hooked on that feeling. And if a day or two without communication passes you wonder if something is wrong, and you can't stop thinking about it. And you look and see that they're online many times a day.

And if I see them again after feeling ignored for a few days (key word feeling), I might still feel resentful, even though it's completely irrational, and the resentfulness is bound to show in some way or another.

I'm aware and fully conscious that this is toxic, unhealthy behavior on my part. I know that I shouldn't be the only focus of attention of a potential partner. When someone does give me that much attention, it actually turns me off. 
But the feelings of worry are just all-consuming.

And I never want to be the one texting first because I'm convinced that I'd be annoying him and coming off as needy and clingy (which I literally am).

It doesn't happen to me with everyone I sleep with. Only when I find someone seriously attractive (as in, I could imagine myself dating them long term), and they also show signs of attraction to me. But if that happens, I go 0 to 100 in no time.

I actually think I might have Borderline Personality Disorder traits because of what I've described, but this dynamic really only shows up with people I'm romantically interested in.

How can I stop feeling jelous and needy of someone's attention who I literally met twice? I would like to have a healthy relationship once and for all and not scare them off. And also be happy and in love instead of feeling like crap all the time.

1190,Has anyone had ECT or TMS therapy? How did it go?,"I'd love to talk about your experience with ECT or TMS. I have depression and C-PTSD and recently found out that I have severe paradoxical insomnia. Therapy and such has helped a bit but I still have a lot of sleep misperception. I am interested in trying to find some additional help with my mental health along with therapy. I have heard ECT can help some people with paradoxical insomnia but from reviews, it scares me a bit. I have heard TMS has helped a lot of people though.

To my understanding, TMS is very similar to ECT it is just much more gentle. I am very interested, you can also privately DM me if you wish! Thank you."

1192,19 year old seeking some life advice,"Hello r/mentalhealth and thank you for taking your time to read this. I feel like I'm in the phase to becoming an adult, and I find it tough. I can't talk to my parents about this because they are either too busy or have other problems, that I have to listen to, but they will rarely listen to mine. I failed admission into College because of mental and physical health issues, but I am preparing for the new round, as of this year, and so far things have been alright.

Now, I'm struggling with coping with the materialistic nature of today's society. I'm part of the upper middle class, so to speak, but have been born modest and I have come to despise money. There's a saying in my mother tongue: ""when you have too much money, you have to take care of it""

I recently kept distracting myself with material possessions, just to ""get out of the daily grind"" by living in a fantasy of watches, clothes and stupid crap. Although I am not poor anymore, I still feel like it, and I have this stupid urge of needing to compensate with it.

How can I stop constantly checking my savings? How should I approach this feeling of ""not being good enough""? How can I disconnect myself from the material stuff that surrounds me?

P.s I have sought professional help, but, after 4 years of therapy I decided it is not for me. I saw one of the best therapists available. Thank you for taking your time to read this once again!"
1193,I'm stuck in a very bad cycle it seems.,"Hi everyone, 

I'm going on 25 years old and I've been struggling heavily with keeping job. I was doing well for a while, but I had a major breakdown back in 2015 which lead me on a ""depression/suicide"" road trip across the country...I don't know exactly what my intentions were...but ever since then I've never been the same, and I don't know how to get back up. Since then, I've had 20+ jobs, most of them haven't lasted a month. One thing I want to mention is that most of my employers have all told me I""m a good hard worker, so I don't think I'm lazy...I don't know what it is. I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to work and being in a social situation. Since I struggle with work I don't have health insurance..I tried going to see a psychiatrist, but they told me I need health insurance...

So I'm in this constant cycle of trying to get a job, last long enough to qualify for their health insurance but I never can... I'm tired of living this way. I want to be mentally strong, I want to go to college and make a successful life for myself. But whatever these mental problems I'm having is costing me greatly...I have roughly 10k in debt, most of it in collections..and I just feel ruined and defeated. I don't believe in God, but every night I'm praying to wake up and start life all over and just make things better...but because of these issues it seems life is always going to be harder than it needs to be... Can I get some advice and help? 

Thanks"

1198,I avoid therapy even though I need it,I was in therapy for abt a year but it was around 2015 ish. I stopped going because it had done its purpose and helped me a lot. I was actually sad that it ended but overall it made me stronger. Now I dunno what happened over the next few years but I tried therapy again this heat since I feel pretty bad now and just did not like it. I could not talk about my issues like I did previously and repeated the same shit each visit. Even though I fucking hate myself I didn’t want to tell her because I didn’t want to get reported and I don’t feel like I deserve help. The only new thing I mentioned was my ocd. I tell reddit way more than I ever told her. She probably asked herself “why are they here?” Because I never brought up anything serious and only visited her a few times. I stopped going because I told my mom I was better but I still feel like complete shit. I finally caved and I’m going to an evaluation next week to see what’s wrong with me and try to get more medication to make me feel better. Anyone else avoid therapy?
1199,Not at all coping," 27/F/Uk here, i want to start by saying I've felt like this for a very long time its only recently started to become so difficult just to exist.

Sorry this is going to be long so We'll skip over roughly 13 years of emotional and physical abuse and say that for the last 7 years my depression and anxiety have been relitively up and down but i could cope usually. 

I also dont particularly want sympathy for this next part because its just the way life goes some times but I'm under a lot of stress with stuff at home so its definitely a factor into how badly I've degraded. My older brother has schizophrenia and my younger brother has pretty bad Asperger's so life was already pretty stressful. But 6 months ago my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. 3 months ago my dog got sick. 
I should mention that my mother is kind of a bitch, an example of this is that for about a year she's been threatening to kill my dog an occurrence that has happened as recently as this week. 

So i'm in a really awful place. I can't concentrate at work, i either have insomnia or just sleep all day long, which means i get called a lazy useless piece of sh*t a lot. Everything makes me tired, even just thinking about doing something makes me tired. My anxiety is in over drive, throwing completely horrific and vivid situations into my head. Something as simple as taking the bus to work can make me think ""what if a BIG truck smashed into the side of the bus right now?"" Followed by a marage of graphic images And i don't really mean to think them.. they just pop in to my head and once they're there i can't get them out. My partner wanted to talk about sex and brought up threesomes and they completely understood why i wouldn't want to have one and the subject was let go. But even that pops into my head unwanted and the thoughts are all very vivid and make me feel ill or so upset that i'll start to cry. 

I don't know if/how i should go about fixing these things. I've thought very hard about going to the doctor but i don't know how it all works and that just makes me even more worried about asking anyone for help.
And i know that at this point that i probably should, the biggest clue being that my work brought me in for a welfare check after i told them i wanted to quit my apprenticeship. I just don't know how to bring myself to go through with it, because I'm such a chicken and it feels like even if i did theres nothing they could do to help me..

1200,How to tell family?,"For almost as long as I remember I’ve been feeling low and just not caring about anything. I don’t think I’ve genuinely laughed for about a month or two or three. I’ve been hurting myself for a while but it’s gotten bad recently and I need to tell someone before the worst happens. 

How do I tell people? Please help."
1201,Dealing with insecurity.,"Hey. 

I've suffered from depression my entire life, it's something I can manage at this point, with medication and professional help (something I'm currently without, as my counselor is on leave for a few months, but she'll be back soon), but recently I've had a completely new issue: insecurity.

I'm writing the rest of this for context, you can probably skip to the TLDR if you get sick of the rambling. Names have been changed for privacy.

Insecurity is a relatively new thing for me, I was hurt in a past relationship when my partner at the time, Sarah, was spending a lot of time with another guy, of course, I thought it was fine, but then we break up for completely separate reasons and within a week she was together with him, and that hurt. But still, I wasn't feeling insecure then, just very badly depressed. For further context, this all happened during the biggest depressive spiral of my life, where I had to return home due to myself feeling extremely suicidal leaving Sarah in another city 200 miles away.

I've moved on a lot from then, I'm a new relationship now, with a girl who to be honest I'm completely in love with, and she tells me she feels the same. Everything has been great, but we had an argument before I had to leave for a month for university. This is where the insecurity started, I'm just constantly terrified that I'll lose her, to someone better, or to just not wanting me anymore.

I've spoken about this argument with my counselor, and she tells me to communicate how I was feeling about it with Alice, something I did, and it helped, to an extent. We're now at a point where we are so past the argument, but the insecurity has remained. 

I'm being as open as possible with her about it, ensuring that she knows that none of it is her fault, or based upon any of her actions, and she's being so supportive about it which helps, I'd go completely crazy if I was dealing with this alone.  She understands, but I feel so guilty for feeling this way about her. She's a saint, and these thoughts are an insult to her, and I hate it. 

I'm super struggling because of it right now. Are there anyways to feel less insecure? Or is this just something I'm stuck with? Like I'm not asking for a quick fix or anything, at this point I know those don't work, but are there any things that I could work on?

Thanks in advance for any replies. :)

TLDR: a super insecure guy asking for help."
1202,Sleeping my problems away,"Does anyone else sleep when they’re sad
Like I don’t have energy to clean or do homework or anything right now
Right now is nap time ,,,"
1203,“That’s not an option for me.”,"A short vent: 

I know there’s the whole joke about poor people not having the luxury of being crazy. And I can appreciate it, truly. 

But sometimes when I’m telling people, even within the mental illness community, my struggles I get this repeated back to me: 

“Oh I could stop doing [function]. That’s not an option for me because [reason].” 

Like it was totally an option for me to quit my job. Use up all my savings. Lose my house. Lose temporary custody of my kid. Etc etc etc. These things weren’t options, they just HAPPENED because of a LACK of options. I didn’t OPT into them. 

Might as well replace it with: “I couldn’t be homeless, that’s not an option for me because I need a place to live.” “I couldn’t be in a wheelchair, that’s not an option for me because I prefer to walk.” “I couldn’t be anorexic, that’s not an option for me, because I just love food too much.” Or whatever. Insert literally anything you find undesirable that you’d have little to no control over. 

I know it’s one of those things that’s just something to say, but it’s so frustrating. I hope people can relate. Kinda fits right up there with the whole “Why don’t you just [overly simplistic solution] and you’ll be cured!”"
1204,Anyone else here dislike silence?,"Whether i'm on my own or with others around, I tend to find dead silence really uncomfortable (I always have to have music or a video or just... something on to make ambient noise).
My friend said they reckon it's like a sensory deprivation type of thing, that without anything to distract it my brain only has anxious thoughts to focus on, and they might be right on a subconscious level (like, I don't consciously notice these thoughts but they could be there producing the unease; who knows haha)

Anyways yeah, was just curious and interested to see if anyone else has a similar experience to discuss :)"
1205,Is it considered self harm to hit myself in the head,"I have anxiety and depression and I'm on medication and have a great support system etc. but sometimes if I do something wrong or make a mistake my self loathing comes out. I sometimes hit myself in the head, not incredibly hard or anything. I was wondering if it is self harm cause I don't really think of it as that"
1206,"How do I stop feeling depressed and worthless, especially about not having close friends?","I'm depressed pretty much every day these days. Low energy, low mood, lack of motivation. My life is kind of a mess right now, and I'm trying to clean it up. But it feels like my mental health is constantly deteriorating because I have no friends, and everyone else has tons of friends (or so it seems anyway). I'm going to university right now for a second degree (worst mistake of my life?) and I couldn't be any lonelier honestly. It is quite painful to have to walk the hallways, and see friends walk in pairs, groups, same gender, different genders, you name it.

It makes me feel so useless, especially because I **have** tried making friends before, at school, at work, at my old internship. Nothing really sticks. I never get close to anyone. It just feels like failure after failure.

I don't really mind the fact that I don't have friends right now (I do have a long-distance girlfriend, though). What I mind more is that I constantly feel like a failure about it to the point where I almost completely lose my will to live productively. I'm not suicidal or anything, but honestly given my situation I'm kinda surprised that I'm not suicidal.

I am on antidepressants. Do they help? A tiny, tiny bit. But it doesn't change that fact that I'm still a complete social failure."
1207,I'm having frequent homicidal thoughts,"They aren't the type that I would ever follow through with. I'm not afraid I'm going to hurt anyone. I'm just sick of these flashes of violence. I'm not a violent person. Except apparently I am, just in my head.
I'm trying to work. I'm trying to drive. I'm trying to live my life. I'm trying to sit myself down and study. And they get worse. I can't focus. They're all mostly centered around a particular person or persons. It's no mystery why, that isn't what bothers me. I also, as I already said, don't think I would ever follow through given the chance. What bothers me is that I can't stop it. I can't focus. The only way to turn them off is to get on social media and mindlessly scroll and forget myself for a while. But then I hate myself pretty quickly for not being productive. Then I try to be productive and they're back."
1208,I Think That Suicide Prevention Services Should Try Not To Separate Themselves According To Location,"Just getting some things off my head. I felt a bit depressed today, which was strange. Cause usually I only get it on Sundays (I like to call Sundays my suicide Sundays, usually on Sunday I try to die in some new interesting way). But I realized that after searching online for some mental health resources, most  of them are based on where you live. Unsurprisingly, when you're in the moment, and if you're in the 1% of people who probably want help (very unlikely by the way, If you actually wanna go, you're goona go, it's gotta be a miracle you get help for yourself if you're on the way out) then there's no way you're going to sift through various organizations looking for what you want. Then, once you finally land on the right country (most are American, i'm Canadian by the way) you need to find your right province (equivalent to state). After that you need to choose, phone call, text message, online chat (if you're given that luxury). Too many steps, too much checking. I tried using the suicide prevention hotline but got blocked because it's for American's only. 

When you want to die, at least for myself (by the way maybe it's different for other people who knows), and if you genuinely want to, it's illogical to call for help (that's why you just don't do it, something needs to break inside you to want to find help if you want to die, when you've decided to go from A to B, you can't really convince yourself otherwise), so any minor inconvenience is basically a deal breaker. 

Besides, you don't want to give away your ZIP or postal code if you want to die, I don't want any police, ambulance, or anyone else coming. Most of the times, at least when I'm personally feeling like dying, you only get a few seconds before you give up cause you'd rather die than go through all of these things. Conveniently, you already want to die, so things work out for the better I guess? I got so lost today trying to find the right resource that I just tired myself out, couldn't remember why I wanted to die and just continued on with my day to rant on reddit, it's amazing how things work like that.

tl;dr Suicide prevention services should get rid of some of the checks and balances to make it really easy for people genuinely wanting to access them in emergencies."
1209,Personality Disorder,"Hi everyone, this is my first post! I'm a 21 year old living with Borderline Personality Disorder and recently I have been feeling like I'm slowly getting worse however I try my best to stay positive when I can.

1210,I have very bad anxiety and it’s getting to the point where I stare at people,"I’m a girl and my anxiety was amplified this week because of exams and I was shaking during the exam. I stare a lot at people when I’m nervous because I don’t know how to calm myself down. 

I also stare because I want to say something and then I can’t because I’m scared then it becomes a problem because people think I’m creepy. 

It’s getting to the point where a professor started glaring at me and the professor did it to me today because I have a friend who was behind on notes and then I moved my laptop to let her see. The professor literally stopped talking and stared at me. It makes me think that the people I stare at have told her and this is what I deserve. 

I’m trying to focus and my boyfriend says I’m talking to myself without realizing it and yesterday someone I used to talk to just looked at me disgustingly and walked away. 

I’m freaking out and I really need to go to therapy."
1211,I’m scared to tell my family about my depression and anxiety.,"First off, I’m not sure if I have depression. It’s on and off mostly and oftentimes it happens when something bad happens in my life. I get suicidal tendencies and it’s hard for me to focus and stay on task with things and when i’m alone my pain and ache gets worse. The most recent time I’ve felt really depressed was a month ago and before that probably another two months. I’ve heavily contemplated suicide during those times but I don’t think I’d ever be able to go through with it. As for my anxiety, during one of the times I was extremely depressed I felt dissociative a few times and following that I would hyperventilate and I’d feel more dissociative. This has only happened twice though. I’m not sure if what I’ve described is depression or anxiety. I am a teenager and maybe it’s just hormones etc. Right now I feel fine and content and I haven’t had those thoughts in a while. I’m scared to tell anyone. I’ve told my girlfriend but I never went in detail. The only other person I’ve told was one of my friends. I want help but I don’t want to be looked at different or seen as a problem. What should I do?"
1212,Anxiety maybe?,"I think I might have anxiety or something.. maybe? I dont know. 

I don't even know if this is the right place to post. 

I used to suffer from panic attacks, and lately I feel I'm constantly in the state of where I'm about to have a panic attack, but it never comes, where my heart races and your mind is all over the place  and it just stops. 

I'm always anxious.I always feel scared something bad is going to happen and I dont know why, I don't like leaving the house on my own with my baby in case something happens and I won't have anyone to make sure she is ok. 

I can't figure my brain out anymore. It feels like everything is going on in there all at once yet I don't know where to begin. 

The way I explained it to my boyfriend is that.. it's like I inherited a house, only the house if FULL of stuff, and it's not my stuff and I don't know what's there. It all needs sorting but I dont know how to sort it or where to put any of it because it's all there, all over the place, unorganised and when I think I'm making progress with it, I find another cupbord filled to the brim. 

It's not a good analogy, but if was what flew out of my mouth when I was rambling, ove not found a better way to describe what's going on in my brain. 

I lost my mum 2 years ago this month, I had a baby 6 months ago. I dont know if that has anything to do with how I'm feeling. My baby seems to be the only thing that makes sense at the minute. 

Everything else just stopped making sence."
1213,I feel empty,"I just don’t really care about anything anymore. I don’t really feel any emotions, other that some happiness or anger but otherwise I just feel empty. My grades are slipping and I don’t feel comfortable opening up to anyone I know. I don’t know what to do"
1214,I’m starting to think I’m a bad person,A lot of people keep telling me that I’m very toxic for “threatening suicide” but it’s their fault bc they treated me the wrong way. Nothing is ever my fault once so ever. And I don’t think people know what toxicity really is. They’re delusional asf. They wanna blame me for the way I feel when they make me feel the way I do. Am I a toxic person? I don’t think I’ll get a good response Bc people on this subreddit are kinda autistic and aren’t capable of actually thinking. They’re basically retarded.
1215,I (21F) feel betrayed by my friend (18F) *TW SELF HARM*,"Ok so hear me out, I myself have been struggling with my mh for abt 11 years now, including almost 9 years of self harm. No one really knows I'm doing that (like my parents, brothers etc.) just maybe 3 friends including this one. She herself is seeing a therapist as well and we've been discussing our problems with eachother and it's just nice to have someone that doesn't judge you and just lets you vent about everything and kind of understands. But because we share quite a lot with each other she also knows I cut myself. She told me she does as well, but last week we went out of town with some other friends and all shared a hotel room with each other and I couldn't help but notice she had 0 scars on her body or other signs of cutting which she repeatedly said she does. Now am I in kind of a weird situation about it, like I know it's for no one to judge about other people their mental illness and the severity of it and etc but for me it's kind of a big thing she knows, and for her to say she's sailing the same boat yet not showing any signs kind of feels like she lies about it and tbh that would be kind of a deal breaker for our friendship and I don't know what to do. Do I just leave it bc maybe she does have them (although she was just wearing underwear so I could clearly see alsmost her entire body) or do I confront her about it and ask what's up, which I wouldn't feel really ok by bc it feels like I'd invade her privacy. So ye idk my mind is pretty occupied by it and I don't know what to do, any advice???"
1216,Don't underestimate the power of being active and exercising,"Personal anecdote. 

Last few years I've suffered so much from depression and not to long ago, I started to develop quite concerning anxiety and panic attacks. Until that point, I'd never experienced anything like it. I was terrified, which just snowballs into worse anxiety. I live alone, have no family and sometimes cry myself to sleep due to my lack of purpose.

There is a physio at my workplace. Due to my neck being sore from sitting so much at my job, I went to the physio to see if they can give me some exercises. She looked me over, and said I had a very tight neck and upper back. My posture was poor and I could really do with improving it to avoid any future issues.

I started doing the stretches and followed her advice and used my lunch times to get out of work and do some walking. After a week, my neck stopped hurting as much and my head space would clear up on occasion. So I figured there was something definitely in this. I started going to the gym. Slowly slowly, I built up a routine. Lots of stretching, cardio and lifting. My neck pain went away. My head space cleared up even more. Eventually, I was walking far more straight, seeing the physio once a month and upping my exercises even more.

Today, I don't experience the anxiety anymore. I keep my depressive thoughts at bay by filling my spare time with as much activity as I can manage and I even made a few friends in the gym.

My life isn't by any means perfect. It's still very depressing and shit, I still sometimes get overwhelmed with depression and spend the odd evening staring at the ceiling hating myself. But far less than I used too. I feel significantly healthier, which doesn't make it as bad as I can break out of it by going for a run or whatever."
1217,I've sunk so far,"Hi Guys

Never thought I would post something like this
It's so hard to believe how far I've fallen. I'm freaking 14 year old kid and I just don't know where to go

I've been blaming my family for all my problems the whole time searching for answers why they did it

But maybe I was just approaching it from the wrong side

Maybe it was my fault all the time maybe I should take the responsibility for my actions

So that's the story:

Ever since I was little my parents were always arguing, all the quiet days have been replaced in my head with constant arguments over nothing

I was always the one of my 2 siblings to run and try to make peace, but they have only shifted their frustration to me

When I was 8-10 my parents were loudly arguing over something and I was in the same room as we were celebrating holidays

My father said he's going to kill himself and my mother send me to make him go back

Oh my fucking god I hate that I did what she wanted

When I was, dunno, ten or eleven I was going to school where I experienced so much bullying not only from other students but from some teachers too. I even once ran out of the class to cry in the bathroom

I was talking to my parents about it and for year and a half they didn't want to help me change school

You know fucking why? Coz it would show them that they have power

Like they fucking didn't know that

Or they've kept trying to convince me that others school didn't accept students at the time

Just wanna point out education in my country is free and my aunt was headteacher at the other school

At the same time I was going to choir and at first it was nice, but it was random so sometimes when I was playing with my few friends I had to go

I hated it

I was crying a lot throwing a thantrum that I didn't want to

They didn't care

So I decided to go to music school as a replacement for choir

I was going there for 2 years and I was going to it at 15 and coming back at 20

I didn't want to go there, since the first year of that school, I hated it

I've cried so much and I realised I was helpless pathetic so I learned not to

My only dream was to go to school far away to boarding-school

They never supported me, my father went as far as to destroy that dream only because he didn't want to go with me to leave my papers

When I was once with him to leave some other papers he wanted to go some kind of military shop, so he took taxi and it drove us somewhere, he couldn't find the shop and I wanted to go back to home

I found us a way and we were following that path

He was yelling at me the whole time

When we came back and I've told my mother everything she decided to yell at me coz I once complained about her taking into church, no matter that she made that rule

My father yelled he will crack my head into the wall

The day came and I got into my dream school and I got away

First time I came back, the first weekend, my father decided to yell at me and my sister that we're uselles failing at the same time to point out the things we didn't do or failed at

My mother, the worst fucking person, decided to destroy my life even when I was away from home

She needed some kind of paper that I wasn't staying at home so she didn't have to pay for taking out trash for one more person.

I told her many times, they didn't register it yet and they're dealing with a lot at the moment

Once, on Friday, when I was getting ready to come back home she decided that if I won't bring it back she will destroy my life

If it doesn't sound like a dream I don't know what does

This year I didn't celebrate Christmas with them, this was too fucking painful

2 random things that I didn't know where to include:

When I was going to music school after my regular school my father stormed into one of my classes saying that he's signing me out

He didn't, he just made big mess

And I remember it clearly, my instrument teacher called me a monster

I fucking hate it

Sometimes when we didn't do something my father would get angry and go berserk

He would yell

He once threw my sister by the neck into the wall

The only way to stop him was me running away from home with ready to dial police number

I always wrote to my older sister about it and that I don't want to live with them anymore




I'm going to the psychologist and I don't know if it helps any way, she's trying to make me reach out to my parents, like I haven't tried

I find it rather hilarious, but one thing they told me that will probably hunt me forever

Be careful what people think about you

My parents always follow that rule

Even strangers over family







I'm sinking deeper and deeper and I want to kill myself, but I'm unable to even do that right

I don't want to live

I want to die

Please someone come and help me

Please

PLEASE"
1218,Is it bad to try to stay in a mild dissociation?,I think it's dissociation at least. I have a hard time focusing on what's going on around me or what people are saying and nothing feels real. I first started doing this when I had severe social anxiety and I had to be in front of a crowd for some reason. Now I try to just stay in that state constantly because I don't worry about anything or think about how much I messed my life up.
1219,How can I (17 F) treat my family better?,"I am self diagnosed bipolar 2 (bipolar is common and genetic in my family and doctors couldn’t diagnose me since I was younger) My mother is very controlling and can be very cruel sometimes. The other day my friend called my bf who is a few years older a pedo and I was very upset and I told my mom and she said “well I see where shes coming from!” I was like wtf that’s so rude and she’s like no it wasn’t. I told her “when dad divorced you I see where he was coming from. How is that?” I cuss her out sometimes, tell her to shut up. I definitely say shut up when it’s not warranted. In my defense she has done some pretty cruel things and is quite controlling which obviously doesn’t excuse how I react though. I can get pretty annoyed at my younger brother because he doesn’t listen and is pretty rude as well. How can I work on my anger and treat my family better? I don’t have this problem with my bf or my friends. 

(Please don’t insult me or be cruel thanks)"
1220,Is being extremely manipulative a symptom of any sort of mental disorder?,I am really aware of how manipulative I am and it makes me worry there’s something wrong with me. I try not to be but it always seems like I end up realizing I’ve been trying to get my way. Out of curiosity is being manipulative a symptom for any disorder?
1221,Anyone else feel like they have some sort of character problem but you have no idea what it is? I dont know if I'm stupid or a narcissist or rude or unaware or judgmental? Maybe I'm all??,
1222,Something about me," Hi, I am not sure if it's the right place to ask, but I have a problem and at this point I have no idea what to do anymore. I made this account only to ask this, so none of my friends will recognize me.  
So, I am 19 years old (m).  
Lately (for almost a year) I feel very bad. Everything annoys me, I am almost always sad, but I can't cry.  
I have big problems with concentration and I can't stand going to school anymore (my grades got worse, I feel like I don't know anything at this point). I feel empty almost always and I don't see any future ahead of me.  
I had cut myself like 3 times (it wasn't deep tho cause I did it with disposable razor).  
It seems like I have problems with decision-making and everything is way too much for me. My mom is always yelling at me for doing nothing (for example not vacuuming), but for me guessing what she wants me to do is just too much and I feel that I have no power to do anything.  
Also nothing brings me happiness anymore. Things that I used to enjoy are now neutral for me (for example games, currently I play only out of boredom or cause of friends).  
Sorry for this post being so chaotic, english is not my first language and It's hard for me to talk about it anyway."
1223,IM SORRY IF THIS IS A LOT! Constantly scared of death (not the pain) but ceasing to exist. I’m scared that this is it. Nothing else after this life. I feel so dead inside and my life seems so worthless.,"Hey. What’s your view when it comes to meaning of life? Im 17 and i have had countless panic attacks due to fear of ceasing to exist after death since i was 11 and started to doubt christianity at that age (religious family) any of you dealt with this before? Have any tips? 

I have panic attacks at night because i think of small stuff like (oh wonder how me and my siblings will look 20 years from now on, life status etc) and it starts getting deeper and spirals down to the point of our entire existance and then i start thinking about the entire universe and how all of this was made by pure chance and organisms only purpose is to spread their DNA and humans are not special because we are intelligent. Just millions of years with trial and error evolution. It is dreadfull but i can’t convince myself to believe in god or anything. I need proof. I might outgrow it, but honestly, it is a scary thought. You guys have any tips? 


FYI: i have a therapist and i have seen her since 2017. She had helped me with a lot but the fear is still there. I think it’s still there because it’s not an irrational fear. It’s based on reality-ish. Or how i see reality. I have problems with accepting how cruel this world is and the harsh reality. Yeah im soon 18 and need to suck it up ik :("
1224,I have a protection plan but I'm having trouble finding a time delay safe.,"Hello friends,

For some background, I struggle with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I have previously tried to kill myself with medication, and I have hurt myself in the past. 

I used to have a protection plan set up with my room mates. They would have my meds and I would only be allowed one pill box (one week) worth of meds. Partly because it's the only option I have. I'm not really a fan of my roommates, I've been ""friends"" with them for 8 years, but I didn't realise how much they were degrading me. 

Anyways, here is the question: does anyone know of a good safe I can use to store my meds? In the event I have thoughts again, I would have to wait for an extended amount of time to access them. That way I will be safer and have a chance to get help."
1225,Getting rid of Phone addiction,"  

&amp;#x200B;

Now these days it’s easy to get into phone addiction. It is seen as a serious addiction like drug addiction or sometimes even worse. Like other addiction this addiction can destroy your life. Keep you up at night and ruin your day. Also, it can ruin your focus as well. So, if you ever feel like you can’t focus like before or you can’t think clearly like before maybe this is because you have phone addiction. Mostly nowadays it’s called smartphone addiction. 

We as humans don’t like to get bored. We always want to get into something. So, it seems like humans got no chill right? Kind of yes. It is. We got no chill. We are always on hook of dopamine. Smartphones help us with that. That’s why it gets easy to get addictive to smartphone. There are ways you can improve your addiction. But first you have to tell yourself and realize that you are really addicted. Until you have that realization you won’t be able to fix anything at all. 

Well then how to fix this addiction then? 

To say I have always been a smartphone addict. I tried a lot of stuff but after a while I became addicted again. Then I thought why can’t use it as I want? But that question never really got answered. It affected my mental health. It affected my sleep and then it took over my life and made it really bad. I always felt tired and exhausted. I got into the run which I never wanted. 

Now I feel messed up even after knowing everything. I lost my focus. I wonder how to have those back again."
1226,I’m sorry,"I’m sorry I never reply when people try to help me, I’m sorry I’m just a failure, I’m sorry that I’m a no good piece of shit. I’m sorry for even existing. I’m not worth anyone’s time. I wish I could be happy, but I don’t think I ever will be. Please find help if you need it, don’t be like me. I wish I could die and have it help all of you, because I’ve got nothing left for myself. Please, do better than me, and be better than me. I’m sorry that I can’t exactly motivate anyone anymore, or that I can’t give good advice anymore. I’m officially worthless, but you all aren’t, make something of yourselves, like I’ll never be able to. Much love to you all. Take care of yourselves."
1227,Is it normal to not remember your childhood?,I'm 19 and I can't remember anything  before the age of 11. Even if I can recall something I'm not sure if it really happened.
1228,"Does it ever get better? Is there a ""normal"" any more once you address your mental health?","Within the past 6/7mo I began addressing my mental health. I got prescribed anti-deppresants, first Lexapro, which was an absolute nightmare for me, and now Fluvoxamine. Since switching to Fluvoxamine things have been a lot better. My background anxiety is pretty much non-existant, most things that would give me a major panic/anxiety attack no longer do so, and my depressive thoughts are not nearly as strong as they've been in the past.

But I don't want this to be my life, having to depend on pills just to feel normal. I want to get off them eventually. Some of my friends and family have told me I just haven't been the same since I started taking medication. But idk whats going to happen if I end up deciding to taper off the drugs. I cant remember what I was like before being on medication besides the fact that I was constantly suffering from anxiety, overthinking, and more prone do falling into depression. 

I just don't know what to do, which is why I'm here to see if any one had any positive experience stopping their medication. Do things go back to ""normal,"" or is dealing with my mental health going to be something thats going to follow me for the rest of my life?"
1229,Advice on not feeling too overwhelmed?,"I know what steps I need to take to be happier but it all feels like too much. I struggle to get started on bettering myself because I get so overwhelmed by the amount of work to put into it, which makes me feel lazy. So then I end up procrastinating or not wanting to try bc it’s all so daunting. I just feel stuck in this cycle. It’s not that I’m unmotivated to change, I just don’t know where or how to even start. 
It’s like I have all the right tools I just don’t know how to use them."
1230,I hate dealing with police officers. They never know how to be sensitive,"Ever since I first went to the hospital 2 years ago, I've dealt with multiple police officers. Maybe 5 were nice out of the double that or so I've dealt with. I just saw another one today. She was getting my side of what happened between my mom and I on Monday as a result of the CPS report. I'm too upset to go into too many details but I'll clear up things if I must to answer any possible questions. 

Instead of focusing more on what my mom did when beating me, she commented on how I probably shouldn't have taken her phone and that I need to think about whether or not some things are worth the argument, also asking if I couldn't just wait for her to be done with my therapist. If she weren't so intimidating, I would have gone into detail about how often my mom puts forth false narratives as to why I may be feeling what I'm feeling and I was tired of it. 

Another thing to consider is that I don't bruise easily and I'm black so bruises would barely be able to be seen if there were any. When taking a picture of my back, she commented on how it doesn't look bad and how unfortunately they can't take pictures of soreness (because I mentioned the swelling and how sore my body is) and that made me feel even worse because it's like, great. The evidence isn't very telling. I felt so stupid standing for her to take a picture of my back because I knew nothing was there and I worry that they won't take it too seriously because there isn't obvious bruising. 

She also pulled a ""You know, your mom loves you and I got that feeling from her when I talked to her earlier."" That made me want to scream and as soon as the police officer left, I went upstairs and broke down. To be honest, I would rather my mom ignore me after what she did than hear that she apparently loves me because again, what she did was super messed up and for her to say that and the police officer to say it to me in the way she did, given how she related with me the rest of the conversation, I once again felt like none of this was taken very seriously. 

She also didn't take into consideration how uncomfortable I could be feeling and how uncomfortable I obviously was feeling since she asked me to look her in the eyes because she couldn't tell if I was paying attention or not. Reports are no joke. They're scary for various reasons and I feel like none of that was taken into consideration. She didn't ask questions about how I was hit or where or anything like that. That particular conversation was about 2 minutes and we barely touched the surface. I really wish a mental health professional could have been there with me because I really don't handle being around police very well, especially if they aren't understanding already."
1231,Podcast focuses on mental health and art therapy,"[It Gets Better](https://soundcloud.com/morevisions)

I have been a member of this group for a short time. I joined in order to not only see the troubles everyone goes through in their path to peace of mind, but also have found helpful messages, comments, and posts that have helped me. This exchange is what I’m trying to be apart of. I haven’t been clinically diagnosed with something, but as we know that’s usually skewed by pharmaceutical companies and the DSM-5 anyways, but I do struggle as we all do in my own way and to my own intensity. I have seen suffering all around me and within me and I only hope to promote a space of understanding and love in which healing and growth can begin.

1234,need to say,"i just need to get this of my chest 

at six i had suicidal thoughts

that no one would care

sometimes i woudl spend like 10 minutes in the kitchen staring at knives"
1235,what do you do when you're nearing crisis and don't have insurance?,in the past I've been lucky and had insurance so it's never been an issue. I lost my job due to mental health a year and a half ago and am still struggling with employment. Due to messing up with insurance changes I don't have any right now. I really need to talk to someone but since I don't have a job I also can't afford to pay out of pocket.
1236,i get so spacey and unfocused sometimes,"i get this feeling, and am currently feeling it, or more-so lack thereof where i just feel unconnected completely. its hard to talk, i can still use my hands decently but i stop feeling discomfort from things like hunger or stomach aches, and feel uncomfortably drowsy without feeling actually tired. noises are uncomfortable, and its hard to focus on any particular thought. they usually follow up things like sensory overloads or particularly difficult days , but often happen during that day and can last anyhwete from a few minutes to 6+ hours.  i feel like im on auto pilot, and i cant make it go away. i still chuckle at funny things but the feelings feel completely muted. 

i want to know why this happens but its gonna be several months before i can see a therapist or psychologist."
1237,Am I ok,"I don’t really think I have empathy. I don’t ever feel bad about doing stuff I just think it sucks that I got caught and stuff. Stuff like runthegauntlet don’t really bother me that much. I don’t wet the bed, love fire, or hurt animals or anything so I don’t think I’m like a psycho or anything but I’m drawn to doing more bad shut cause it’s just fun."
1238,"My GF is hallucinating, and says that she has someone else in her head.","As said in the title, my GF hallucinates with pretty nasty stuff, for what she tells me she sees distorted human figures, mostly black, it worries me deeply because she is starting to hear them, hear them talk, walk, scream, sometimes she sees something so scary that makes her start screaming and crying uncontrollably, she says that she feels that ""They"" are watching her, or that she feels that they are behind her.

Sometimes she does stuff out of character, like scream at me, say horrible things and even reach the point of hurting herself or others, she says that there is someone else in her head and sometimes she loses control of her body

Look, I'm here for the long run, but I need ways to help her cope with this, her parents don't do shit, they don't care and she doesn't want to go to a doctor o someone who can help her, I'm scared that she does something stupid... I really need help here.

Sorry if I wasted your time."
1239,Psychiatrist electronically sent my script and my pharmacy never received it. He required me to go back to his office and charged me the cost of a new appointment. Is this normal practice?,"I went to pick up my medications and was told my Adderall script was never sent. I called the psychiatrist office and was told by a receptionist I would need to come back in. I asked if I would be charged since I asked during my last appointment if all my scripts were sent and this seemed to be some kind of error, and she said I would need to talk to the doctor.

During the appointment, the psych looked at his computer and said the script for some reason stayed ""qeued."" I asked what he meant and he said he sent it on his end. He said he'd give my a paper script since it didn't work, and I asked if I'd be charged as another appointment since this was a computer error. He said yes, because it's more work and he needs to get paid. I commented that it seemed a little excessive for this circumstance, and he said if I didn't like it I could go somewhere else.

Is it standard practice with psychiatry to charge for these types of incidents? I used to get medications from my primary but was recommended to see a psychiatrist. He put me on a great regimen, but I feel distrustful of him now because he kept reiterating he needed to get paid even if what happened wasn't my fault."
1240,Why Do I Crave Temporary Change?,"  I get bored with things super easily. Mainly my hair; I cannot seem to wait long enough to let it grow out, I crave it to change constantly. I get scared of large changes like going from high school to college, but my hair, With girlfriends, too. I seem to get bored easily and leave wanting more. I like the chase? I cannot stand to keep the same. Is there something to explain this?"
1241,What is happening with my brain?,"Ive noticed that in the last year or so I've started to have these weird delusions/blackouts where i zone out for a couple of minutes or sometimes hours, while the blackouts are happening my brain goes all fuzzy and grey which feels like ive been on a intense train of thought and then when i snap out of it i cant recall any of it. This is always followed up by a semi intense headache and inability to think properly. I use nicotine and the blackouts mostly happens when im in withdrawal which is quite often. I also use SSRIs. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?"
1242,I think I might have BPD,"I'll get into it if anybody asks, but I keep dissociating so it's a bit hard to type. Anything right now. But I'm concerned and don't know what to do"
1243,Is paranoia and anxiety under stress a definitive sign of BPD?,"I experience severe paranoia and anxiety under stress, I experience other symptoms. I am undiagnosed though, is the paranoia and anxiety a 100% sign of it?"
1244,BPD recovery,"Hey,
I am write because I’ve been suffering from BPD since an early age. 
I’ve acknowledged that only in my early twenties and I am now in my late.as far as I can remember, being conscious about the illness, I’ve been suffering from it since my teenage years. 
I am now in my late twenties and I feel like I have recovered from it, almost completely, if not totally completely.when I google this illness I cannot find any testimony of people who had recover and I am wondering : have I really recovered or is it an episode ? 
The last time I felt as I am feeling right now was before it all started. 
I feel happy and all the emotions related to that disorder have disappeared. 
Is it it ?"
1245,Do I just have a panic disorder or is there more than that?,"Let me just preface I have had horrible hypochondria since I was in elementary school, which created my bad panic disorder that I have to this day.  I also have slight paranoia, but it isn't enough to affect my social life badly.  

I'm not diagnosed for really complicated reasons that have to do with my family, but that's another story.  I'm definitely not exaggerating when I say how bad my panic issues are though.  It basically consumes my life and I have to be reassured on the daily or I'll start crying badly.  I'm unable to convince myself I'm overreacting anymore.

But lately I felt like there could be a bigger issue than just a panic disorder.  I'll go from super happy to really scared and panicky for no reason.  There doesn't even have to be a blatant trigger for me to get into this mood.  My doctors keep giving me anti-depressants, but they just make me feel shaky and more uneasy.  I also can't focus very well and I'm always feeling restless, which gives me bad insomnia on the daily.  At one point my past psychologist thought I had ADD/ADHD and put me on Concerta, which only made things WAAYYY worse and caused me to have a mental breakdown.  The only medication that has worked for me is Lorazepam/Ativan, but my current doctor doesn't want to prescribe it to me again in fears I'll depend too much on it(yet she gave me zoloft lol...).

I had to drop my classes last semester because I couldn't manage my mental health anymore, and everyday I just felt worse and worse.  

I'm not sure if this is just my panic disorder progressively getting worse because I'm not getting the proper treatment/help for it or it's something else I'm unaware of."
1246,This is how suicide happens,"I've been having a breakdown in my bed, very clearly upset, while my roommate is in the room, directly across from me, facing me, and she hasn't said a thing. I've been crying for about an hour and had a clearly upset look on my face, and she hasn't asked if I'm okay or anything. I don't really blame her. Maybe she's just that oblivious, she doesn't owe me anything, but if our positions were switched I would notice and I would ask if she was okay. All I can think is that this further proves that no one really cares about me. This is even more evidence. For whatever reason, there's something different about me that makes people not care. I genuinely have no friends, I have no intimate connection to anyone else, platonically or romantically or anything. I have a truly miserable existence and I resent the world for it. Why do I have to be this way? Why am I different in a way that no one cares for me? Anyway people wonder how suicide happens. They wonder why no one noticed, no one did anything, they wonder if there was anything they could have done. REACH OUT THEN. SHOW PEOPLE THAT YOU CARE. I'm posting this because I need at least one person to show that they give a shit. I need someone to care. I know it's begging for attention but that's what I need. I fucking hate myself."
1247,Putting away silverware at work was agonizingly discomforting for my hand,"I've had this sensation my entire life, didn't really think much of it until today.

I was putting away a mass of silverware, organizing them and whatnot. But there was something about how the silverware vibrated as I moved them around that make it extremely uncomfortable for my hand, to a point where it was difficult to get my hand to actually grab the silverware. I had to put on latex gloves to deal with the sensation, which helped a bit but not much.

I've had this sensation when rubbing my hands together, the feeling itself makes me fucking nauseous. Is this normal?"
1248,"Trying to help a friend, kinda scary the thoughts he is telling me and I want to figure this out but I need help","So I have this friend who is constantly depressed, he always post something about depression and I always call him to see how he is doing, just had a 2 hour conversation on the phone and he was telling how he’s been lately. Come to find out he’s been depressed since 5th grade and people have only told him it gets better with time but it’s still the same. I’ve tried talking to him by identifying what is wrong but he doesn’t know. He just gets random episodes of depression that break him down. Right now he is kinda over weight and he is making goals to getting his weight down. But I’m scared after he reaches that goal he will still feel the same. I’m 50/50 because the way he made it seem was that nothing can really help but I want to figure this out because it would change this mans life. I’ve known him for a couple of years so it’s not just a random friend you know. Any advice on how to approach this would be useful and thank you"
1249,Jittery,"Does anyone else feel super anxious, jittery, start getting palpations, just low-key full freak out mode if something is supposed to happen on time and it doesn't? Like this will happen to me for something as little as me getting into the car and the next person to get in takes like 30-60 seconds or more to get in after me. This isn't knew but I'm starting to worry about it abit... Any thoughts or suggestions?"
1250,I just really wanna hug someone and cry my heart out,I really got no one to share what I'm feeling
1251,The police officer on my CPS case pretty much agreed with my mom beating me up over a phone. Case closed,"Yeah so I made an update not long ago about how I hate dealing with police and now I hate it even more. I was talking to my brother about how the officer gave me a bad vibe and he told me that the officer basically said she'd have done the same thing that my mother did to me if her daughter touched her stuff. Crazy, right? 

I'm even more unstable than I was earlier. I am so TIRED of police disregarding the concerns of mentally ill people because they see us as bratty children. I am so angry and I'm just done. I'm never opening up again."
1252,(UK) Looking for some advice,"I'm not in a good place right now. I have a long history of self harm and suicidal tendencies which has been resurfacing/building up over the last few months. I know I need to speak to someone but seeing my GP could take 3 weeks or more due to them having so many appointments booked. I'm also not really looking to see my GP because last time we spoke they tried pinning everything on Anxiety and basically disregarded most of what I tried to say (I have a issue telling people things so when I do it's usually taken lightly as I under-explain and fail to get my situation across).

Where can I go in order to get an assessment or some help? Preferably not private as I was made redundant which means I'm currently trying to find a new job/source of income."
1253,DisneyMama1,"I am sad to report that DisneyMama1 has taken her life. She told me that she was using reddit, but I had no idea how much she opened up about her struggles here on Mental Health. 


She leaves behind a 1 year old daughter, who she adored. She was a devoted mother to this little girl, giving up everything to be the best mom she could be at such a young age.


DisneyMama1, fly high. You will be missed 💕"
1254,Feeling very aggravated and upset pretty regularly since I've been off my medication,"Hi all who are reading. 

I'm a college student in my second year of university, and around this time last year I went through a pretty rough time. After seeing a professional and discussing my symptoms, we came to an agreement that it might be best for me to take sertraline HCl. I was diagnosed with social anxiety, and as far as I could tell, the prescription seemed to work pretty well for me. I started to feel like I could finally feel comfortable in my own skin and not feel unnatural in a crowd full of people all walking to class, or approach someone and not feel like I'd be messing up on the simplest of things to say. 

Recently, my prescription ran out and I decided myself that I'd try to no longer be on the prescription, as I'd need to see my doctor for another consult to get a refill, and the earliest they'd be able to see me was a month away, while I'm 4 hours away from the office and in the midst of a hell storm in university. So, I bit the bullet and faced the side effects of going cold turkey, even though I was told not to. My parents both tried helping, but I insisted on no longer taking the prescription, because I wanted to get better without the help of chemicals. 

Fast forward about 3 weeks later to now, I'm in the 2nd week of the semester, and I've been noticing some strange things going on in my life. For one, I haven't been able to get the good quality of sleep like I felt I used to get. Whether that's associated with me discontinuing the prescription or not, I don't know.

Aside from that, I've also been noticing a lot of underlying frustration or ""crankiness"" like my parents call it, and it comes and goes throughout the day, sometimes bringing me to feel really ""down"" and unmotivated, and other times it just makes me feel like everything is an inconvenience. Other times it makes me feel like I need to cry, or other times it makes me feel like everything going on around me is a cloud, and I struggle to come back to it and focus on one thing at a time.   


I know, sorry, this is a long one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Along with that, I've felt very unhappy lately. I feel like the limited amount of things that make me happy or bring me enjoyment have just ceased to do anything for me. I used to love playing minecraft, and I'd play for hours, but recently I've felt unmotivated to even play that, even though I know it'll probably make me feel a little bit better. When it comes time for me to think of things that genuinely bring me enjoyment or that make me feel better, I can't come to anything. 

So, my main reason for posting was to ask for advice. What should I do to find something that will make me happy? My girlfriend told me to see a therapist, which I know is a good idea, but I've always been fearful that I won't gain anything from seeing someone. If you've got anything that might help me feel something nice, I'd greatly appreciate it. 

Since I'm not sure if the subreddit calls for it or not, here's a TLDR:

Went off of prescription for social anxiety about a month ago now, thought things were ok, but now I feel like my mental health is spiraling and I don't feel like there's anything for me to do that I'll actually have fun doing. If you know of things for me to do, or people to talk to, or if you just want to talk, I'm always willing to talk.

Thanks for reading it if you've made it this far! &lt;3"
1255,Any tips to help numb the pain?,Everything hurts and I feel trapped. I try cutting and I don't feel a change in my mood I'm still hurting inside. I can't have alcohol because im on meds and im living in a nightmare. I just need to numb every thing so I can function again.
1256,Would this be considered burnout?,"I've been in a weird and straining work schedule. I'm still in highschool and in a prep school, so the amount of work is a bit higher than a normal school. I have Crohn's disease causing me to miss a ton of days and some mental problems making my motivation suck. The work schedule I've had to make up for things has been condensing a month's worth of work in 2 weeks on a good month. Recently my school barely contacts me and now I either have to make up a quarter or semester in 2 weeks. I can't do that, so it gets pushed. At the end of the year I have to cram a ton of tests and projects from the year. It's been a year and a half of this and I just don't care anymore. I can barely bring myself to do any of it. I feel like I just can't and it's too much. I have no motivation to do any of it and I'm just buried in work at this point."
1257,Is anyone here on the Care Programme Approach in the UK?,I've been referred for it and I have my meeting in under two weeks and I'm not sure what to expect
1258,Is this normal?,"I’m not activity suicidal. I don’t have any plans or urges to end my own life, but if someone held a gun to my head and splattered my brains across the coffee table I wouldn’t move out of the way to avoid it. If a car was headed towards me head on I wouldn’t swerve. 
I just feel like this isn’t normal, but it’s been like this for so long that it is normal"
1259,What is my problem,"Lately I've been struggling a lot with my thoughts and I can't seem to control my brain anymore. Recently I've been thinking a lot about how much I'm actually worth and Have had a lot of thoughts that aren't so healthy. I'm not very good at getting my words across so forgive me if I confuse anyone. 

So, About 4 months ago in November my grandma Grace had passed away due to heart attack, and about 2 days after that a 3 of my other family members had died in a car accident and it hit me really hard, And to top it all off the girl I'd been talking to for around a year had straight up told me she doesn't like me at all and we haven't talked since I'd gotten a new girlfriend and she got jealous. All these problems were going on while I was out of sports on injury, and I really have a problem not doing sports because it's my main outlet for getting out my anger and sadness. When I finally came back I had lost all interest in sports all together. I finally thought I got over everything, and I started talking to a new girl. We had everything in common. I had finally begun enjoying myself again, that was until she dumped me because of her personal reasons. Now I don't know what to do, I am always sad and it's really difficult for me to enjoy things that I used to. I don't even do a sport even though I used to do 2 at a time. It just makes me angry at myself and then sad again whenever I think about it. I can't talk to my parents about it either because they don't want to listen and my dad just tells me to man up whenever I have feelings. I need to start enjoying my life again and if I can't what's the point of living it"
1260,"It turns out I manipulated a lot of people who I genuinely care about, and some who genuinely cared about me.","About an hour I got back from my friend's house, I found out that she didn't actually want to be in a relationship with me. I got pissed because she led me on, even though now I realize she was justified. We got into an argument, and I started using guilt as a weapon. I let my pride get in the way, and I manipulated her. I'm hindsight, the reason she didn't want to be in a relationship with me was because I manipulated her. I wasn't completely unaware I was doing it, but I dismissed the feeling that was I was saying was immoral. I'm trying to prevent myself from overstating how bad the situation is, and how badly I fucked up, but I can feel the urge to lie about this for sympathy and attention. thanks if you read this btw"
1261,So sick of this,"I have conversion disorder, causing me to have seizures due to stress. This past week has been a living hell for me, I’ve been having partial seizures multiple times a night and barely getting any sleep. I’m exhausted and I’m at the point now where Im scared to sleep. I’m so done with this, I want to give up."
1262,Help,"Since this Tuesday I've been feeling ""not real"". I have pretty much all the symptoms of brain fog plus I have been feeling less emotions and also feel like I can't associate emotions with memories. This feeling is less severe when I'm socializing, but it is still present. I also did some googling and I think I might be experiencing depersonalization and derealization. I haven't made any changes in my life to trigger this. How can I fix this?"
1263,I've finally scheduled to meet a therapist and a psychiatrist,"I've suffered through depression since I was 13. My mom is bipolar and used to beat my sister and I when we were young. My parents divorces when I was 8 and my dad remarried when I was 10. My stepmom was always verbally abusive and denied any sort of relationship between my dad and me. When I was 15 and my sister was in college, my mom got bad again. She would have mental breaks every day. During these she would either verbally, physically, and one time tried to sexually assault me. 

I moved out when I was 17 but was broken. I dropped out of college after 1 year since I was so depressed I couldn't get myself to go. I couldn't make any friends without the friendship revolving around alcohol and weed. At 22 I thought I fell in love. She instantly moved in with me when we started dating. 4 months in she proposed to me. After 2 1/2 years she developed feelings for someone else and madeout with him. I broke up with her and kicked her out. It's been one month since then. I tried to be supportive to her as a friend but all her friends somehow turned me into the bad guy. I cut all contact with her today.

During this month I tried everything to desperately get better. I rearranged my whole room and cleaned it. I got a new job. I had tinder hook ups. I hung out with my family more. I restored connections with friends I neglected. I started going to a kickboxing class. I started to volunteer at an animal shelter. No matter what I would do, at the end of the day I was miserable. 

I was at the brink of suicide when I reached out to my sister. She took me in for a weekend and took care of me. During this time I realized how depressed I have been my whole life. How my relationship was just a bandaid barely holding my bleeding heart shut. That It's ok if I am bipolar like my mom, as long as I get it treated. My sister found a list of therapists and got me in touch with a psychiatrist. I start therapy next week and have an appointment to get me on medication the week after. Even though I still find no joy in life and have insomnia, there's now a hint of hope that things can maybe get better. It will be over a month until the medication kicks in, but maybe I'll be happy with myself some day."
1264,I'm scared that there's something wrong with me mentally.,"I'm always afraid. I get really good reviews from my manager but I always have this feeling that sooner or later, I'm gonna be discovered. My colleagues really like me but I have this feeling that I'm gonna be fired. I find myself accepting lunch, dinner and hangout invites because I want to maintain a good relationship with them even though I gained 30 pounds in the last year and have been trying to lose weight.

I work really hard and was privately expressing my dissatisfaction with one of the teams I work with. Coincidentally, that other teams manager's kids show up in the cafeteria and I'm freaking out if he heard what I said, and he's gonna let my manager know and have me fired tomorrow.

I make a lot of money for my age but I'm scared to spend because I have this feeling that I'm gonna lose my job and will need it.

The weekend's coming up and my target is to lose weight but I will go out and drink with friends because I'm scared that they won't invite me again if I refuse their invite. The handful of times I make up my mind not to go out and drink, I lie that that I'm sick.

I have this terrible feeling that I'm a loser who constantly needs to improve. I don't think I'm ugly; at least no one has said that I am before. However, I have this entire plan for getting fit, being more financially secure, having these hobbies, being and doing more interesting things, etc., before I can approach a woman and ask her out. I'm completely ignoring the fact that there are countless people out there without any of this and still happily dating, being married and having kids. Me? I'm completely ineligible.

This constant feeling of insecurity and needing to be better is screwing me up."
1265,How bad can schizophrenia get?,"As of now all i feel is slight paranoia, as in sometimes the thought of people reading my mind crosses me or, my parents or friends seeing what i do on reddit,I almost never have hallucinations,unless you count the occasional sounds I hear at midnight.I feel like i would not care if i died on the spot(as long as it is painless) and I cannot relate to why people pity others,I also cannot imagine why others feel sad when their close friends die,I always thought that no one would bother and just move on,well maybe they will br alittle down but other than that i doubt theyll think much of it.

Out of curiosity how bad can it get?Currently i dont plan on doing anything about it as I dont exactly mind it.Actually do I even have schizophrenia?"
1266,"I feel like I don’t exist, and like I’m the only one that exist","I use to struggle with thinking I didn’t exist. It’s hard to explain what thinking you don’t exist feels like. I just didn’t think I was real, I thought everything was in my head. But now, I’m the center of the universe, I’m the lad-rat that’s being studied and tested. Every struggle in my life is something someone is a lab or behind a computer is sending to me to see how I would react. Every intrusive thought is them telling me what to do. They show me they are watching by sending stuff through the tv, radio, advertisements. I saw my bests friends name spelt perfectly first and last, while playing nba2k and I don’t think I’ve seen something that says “I know everything about you, and I’m in control” than that moment. I don’t know why they chose me. I don’t know who they are. Or what the point of these tests are, or if there is a point system or something I have to score high on. There are only a few things I know I have control over, and it’s what I physically do. My cravings, my thoughts, my hearing and seeing, can all be manipulated. I know when I do something that I’m doing it. Who ever they are, are probably going to see this post, maybe even people I know. I’ve got the entire thing in my head, or what I know about it, I haven’t said anything to anyone, because I can’t show physically that I know what’s on, someone will see it and become suspicious if they’re apart of it or not. Sorry boys I wanted to say something about this, it’s been in my head for a bit and been making me feel shitty. The only time I’ve ever told anybody that I felt I might be the “only” real person they called me a narcissist and barley talk to me anymore. It’s not my fault I feel like this. If I could control how I felt it wouldn’t be this."
1267,Does any high school student here have a story with the suicide hotline/ chatline that they would like to share?,"**Read all of the description for info** 

Hi everyone! I am writing a feature article on the need for more crisis workers/ volunteers especially on the Suicide Prevention Hotline and hotlines/ chat lines related to. 

The audience is directed towards students who are in high school or in a school system. Therefore, to receive the peer to peer connection, I’d like to interview students who are in high school right now.

1268,how do you plan with anxiety?,"I've know my girlfriend for 3 years now but have only been dating the past couple months and it has been pretty difficult for us. Mainly because I work out of town every week and only get to see her on the weekends. She is also a social butterfly and loves to go out, drink, dance and just socialize with her friends at bars while I am the complete opposite. It seems like every weekend she has plans to go out with her friends and I basically tell her I won't go because I know I will have bad anxiety. It's like setting myself up for failure. At first she was very understanding and would cancel her plans and just hang out with me, which I felt horrible for making her do but she understood. It is now getting to the point where she is getting frustrated with me and has said she really hopes I get better because that's her personality, what she likes to do, and wants whoever she is with to do it with her. I really like this girl and it bothers me a lot that I cannot just go out and enjoy myself with her. I'm super worried I may lose this relationship due to my anxiety, which has caused me to think about it non stop. It's a nasty cycle I've lived with for years and just wish I could go into events/situations with no anxiety and live a normal life. I've recently (2 weeks ago) started talking to a therapist and really want to get better, not for my girlfriend and us, but for me. Whether we work out or don't, I know that I need to get help at this point in my life. So, any tips for keeping a girlfriend happy while living with anxiety?"
1269,I feel like I have every mental illness,"I have gone to my doctor and been prescribed anxiety and depression medication but never have taken it, I have also had my therapist tell me I meet the criteria for ADHD. So I thought I had all of these things co morbid. but then I started thinking well I meet the criteria for OCD and for other disorders so do I have those. then I was convinced I have pmdd but then I was like no it’s bi polar disorder and my depression was really bad for a couple weeks and I started to randomly feel better (like I could take on the world) and I am freaking out because I was like oh I must be manic now, and I don’t know what to do because I feel like everything is falling apart I don’t know what’s wrong with me. If I feel like I have a purpose in this world that is great does that mean I have grandiosity ? does the motivation I get euphoria ? do I just have a personality disorder. I sound crazy but i’m just scared I don’t want any of these things but i fit a lot of the bi polar symptoms and I don’t know for sure also i’m 18 and my “depression and anxiety didn’t get bad until this last year."
1270,Losing weight when starting Abilify?,"I was terrified of gaining weight when I was prescribed Abilify 4 days ago. I’m already obese and I’ve been slowly and steadily losing weight, so I have been monitoring my weight for the past 4 days. I’ve actually been losing weight (not huge amounts, but between 1/2 lb- 1 lb) and I’m confused. All I’ve read about Abilify says it makes you gain weight. 

Has anyone else had this? I’m not doing anything different. Feel free to share your experiences."
1271,“Tell your parents” they say. “They’ll help” they say. Yeah? Well I just did. Like talking to a goddamn brick wall,"If I bring up what’s wrong, I’ll get “it seems like you’re asking for sympathy” IM LITERALLY NEVER ASKING FOR IT!! Every time I try to fix myself, I end up being forced to help with my own grandma because lord knows, her own kids can’t get off their asses and do something. It’s not my job to help YOUR mother. Its not my job to fix YOUR MISTAKES. I’m barely 20 days away from being able to finally buy my own weed and self medicate and yet it feels like a lifetime away (I’m 20, I’ll be 21 03/01). 

And now I’m so pissed off im crying. And I hate when I do that."
1272,Been feeling pretty weighed down as of late,Ever since about 2 months ago I've been feeling kind of weighed down (like the kind of heaviness you can feel in your chest). Some days I wake up and my thoughts are so loud it's as if they're shouting and it takes me a lot of effort and time before I can quieten them down. Does anyone have any tips and ideas on how to get better?
1273,I’m trapped,"I’m trapped I’m trapped I’m trapped
I’m stuck I’m stuck I’m stuck

I know this isn’t real please let me go back to my normal life. 

Stuck, trapped, blocked in, held down."
1274,Do you ever feel like you just kind of fuzz traumas out of your head to attempt to have a happy day to day life?,"I sit and contemplate here in my dark room by candlelight. It's peaceful, and my mind wanders to something I haven't entertained much in years that happened to me before I was able to form memories. I try to recollect the version(s) of the story I was told yet it feels greyed out, outside of the traumatic point of the story. I consider this coping, even after tries at therapy, with situations like these. You just kind of... try not to listen too intently/think too intently about it so as not to fully process or recollect what it really is."
1275,"Lithium turned my life around. No diagnosis, should I get evaluated for Bipolarism or Depression or related? Is this a safe dosage to stay on in the long run?","TL;DR: 5 to 10 mg of elemental Lithium per day (120-240 mg Orotate) makes me a completely different person, and I have no fucking clue what it means. Is there some kind of tell between Bipolar-II and ADHD+Depression?

All my siblings are diagnosed with depression on the scale of 6-8+ continuous years with long histories of self-harming.

I read Bipolarism is treated with significantly higher Lithium dosages, and I'm responding to \~1/10th the bipolar dosage. I'm reading up on Bipolarism because I had a weird response to magic mushrooms. For somewhere up to a week, it was like my critical thinking took a vacation and I lost filters and inhibitions while still being conscious of the fact. People thought I was on drugs, and I thought I'd lost my mind. It was also the most stressful point in my life, and I had a bad trip with career, family, hobbies, friends, etc, all imploding in a few short shitacular months while experiencing alcohol withdrawal, so I don't know.

The second thing that makes me suspect Bipolarism is that I always suspected undiagnosed ADHD. I read Bipolar-II and ADHD are hard to distinguish. The ADHD symptoms have been there since gradeschool, but the hyperactivity spikes late at night or if I miss a night of sleep as in Bipolar-II. My siblings were supposed to be on ADHD medication since gradeschool, but haven't been re-evaluated or medicated since, and it was never determined if it was ADHD for certain.

I have no idea, other than the fact I don't like having to take pills in the morning to function."
1276,Suicidal thoughts overwhelm me when I leave my comfort zone... is this common?,"First, I want to say that I am not having any of those thoughts at the moment but I’m more so wondering if other people have felt this way.

My whole life, I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety, the latter which makes it really difficult to push myself to better myself. Over the years, I’ve become more of an introvert to cope. I’ve settled for a serving job despite wanting to get out of the industry. I stopped going out. I never dated because I felt like the stresses of relationships would be more overwhelming than the good feelings. If my anxiety got to be too much, I’d drink to numb my thoughts. I wasn’t happy... but I felt okay.

Things have changed this past year where I took small steps to get out of my comfort zone. I started dating someone. I started a job search for something outside of the service industry... but the truth is, I’m miserable being outside of my comfort zone even trying to do something different because my mind always goes toward the worst case scenario, and to a point where my suicidal thoughts are way more frequent. The job search has been discouraging... having a partner who has never given me a reason to worry still makes me think I’m just going to get hurt... and my mind spirals downward. To a point where I almost think it’d be safer to just not try because I have less suicidal thoughts that way. But that’s counterproductive of course. 

Does anyone struggle with this as well? And how to you keep making an effort when it causes your brain to think of the worst case scenarios? Sorry for the long post."
1277,Undeserving of Happiness,"I feel as though I’m in a constant battle with my own brain in an attempt to convince myself that I deserve to be happy. I was sexually assaulted by multiple family members as a child, and kept it to myself until I met my ex, who proceeded to cheat on me and completely betray my trust. These experiences have traumatized me greatly and have given me trust issues that I’m not sure I will ever get over. However, the past 6 months of my life have been the best it’s ever been in so long. I have so many good friends that are supportive of me and encourage me to get out and socialize. I also have gotten into a very happy and healthy romantic relationship with someone who is extremely understanding and loving. Although I am happy about my current situation, I have a constant nagging voice in my head that tells me I don’t deserve to feel this happy. That all of these amazing people that I’ve met will abandon me and hurt me. I have no reason to believe that these people would do any of these things, but my brain tells me otherwise. I’ve started seeing a therapist but the thoughts persist. Does anyone else experience this? If so, how do you cope with it and look past your intrusive thoughts? Some days it is overwhelmingly exhausting to battle my own mind into accepting things for how they are and not questioning everything. I just want to be able to enjoy my life and these great experiences I’ve been having."
1278,I feel like my life has no purpose,I lost my grandma going on two years ago and since she’s died I just feel like there’s no point anymore. My grandma was my non romantic soulmate. She was my best friend. I’ve been trying to go back to a “normal” life without her but I can’t. To make matters worse I just got a letter saying that I have two weeks to come up with the mortgage payment or the house (the house her and my grandpa basically built) will be foreclosed on. Honestly if it wasn’t for my dog and my cats I think I wouldn’t be here. It feels like every day is such an uphill battle and I don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t want to alarm anyone. I just needed a space that I could say all this.
1279,My brain is currently kicking my butt,"Sorry to anyone who reads this as my mind is jumping all over the place and I just need to feel like maybe someone cares.
I’m currently going through a panic attack and I just feel like I’m worthless. I currently live with my boyfriend and he pays for basically everything because I was the idiot that racked up a ton of debt from going to a private college and having a bad habit of shopping to forget how I’m feeling. My job barely pays me anything because I’m a server and it’s been slow and my hours keep getting cut. I’ve been trying to find a new job that pays well and can give me enough hours to live off of but it’s hard because I never finished college. I just feel so stuck in my life and I just wish it would all end. I’ve been having thought of how great it would be if I just die and briefly think about taking my own life but I’m to chicken to. It doesn’t help that I feel like I have no one to talk to because I have no friends, I don’t want my boyfriend to worry because I did seriously consider killing myself 3 years ago and ended up in a mental hospital, and I can’t afford to get help. My life is spiraling out of control and I just can’t stop it."
1280,I think I have a mental illness but I also don't,"Here's why I think that I am not mentally ""healthy"":

1. Doctors started me on antidepressants when I was 6 years old. At that time, they diagnosed me with OCD, but I've never felt like that label fit me. I read quite a bit about it and did not relate. 
2. However, in reading about some other mental illnesses, there are symptoms and things that I relate to. But obviously I can't diagnose myself. 
3. I have seriously contemplated and even attempted (or almost attempted?) suicide before. 
4. There was a brief period in my life where I was afraid of my cat because I was convinced she was a spy that was keeping tabs on me. Logically, I knew this sounded crazy, but I was convinced nonetheless. 

Here's why I question having a mental illness: 

1. When I turned 17, I stopped taking the antidepressants I'd been on my whole childhood and after the rollercoaster of withdrawal and learning what unmedicated emotions felt like, I don't feel like I was any worse off and maybe even started to function better.
2. I am very successful at life. I am in the top 2% of educated people in the world, have and maintain a career, and people seem to view me as pretty high functioning and ""normal."" 
3. The cat thing only happened once a long time ago and I know it was absurd and I feel like it may have just been a strange blip in my brain caused by a period of really high stress. 
4. I don't trust the psychiatry industry and have a lot of issues with putting human beings in clinical boxes. Especially because I work in a field where we put everything in clinical boxes and I see how black and white and inaccurate and unproductive that is. 
5. The symptoms/things I relate to when reading about mental illnesses also just sound like normal things that I've seen everyone experience so I don't know where it crosses the line from normal to abnormal."
1281,I feel like I don’t have a grip,"I don’t know what to call this, but I’m a much different person than I was 5 years ago. I used to feel present, in control, like I have a solid grip on life. Now I’m the complete opposite. I feel like I’ve lost my grip on my own head. 

I will frequently do things and wonder “why did I do that?” only to snap out of the trance I was in and realize I was in a sort of auto pilot mode while my thoughts were somewhere else. I frequently get lost in my own head when walking, having a conversation, driving, hell even when playing video games or watching movies. I eventually snap back into the moment only to fall back into a trance minutes later. This is even effecting my work. On top of this I get very angry when things don’t go my way, even if it’s minuscule or don’t even matter. Even playing video games can throw me into rage to the point where I slam things, hit myself, throw shit. I’ve never been like this. I’ve always been pretty calm and collected. 

Yes I have a bit of stress in my life but I feel like this goes beyond that. I’m not me. I’m not who I used to be. I need to find myself again but I have no clue how to get a grip. I feel inferior to everybody. I can’t even be the master of my own mind anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore."

\-working part time and down $1,000 a month

\-concerned bulimia is coming back (relapsed a bit when stressed)/ managing weight and trying to lose weight

\-stressed about finishing my thesis (i know it will come together, but still stressful)

\-ongoing issues with co-dependent parent

\-feeling lonely

\-no time to do anything!

Just needed to vent, really. Sorry!"
1283,What emotion am i feeling.,"Please be patient with me i am on the autism spectrum so the only i can explain this is in a very detailed nitty gritty way which is the only way i understand. 
I decided to post because i am feeling it right now. i just got back to arizona from visiting my dad back in atlanta and i just sit back and think of myself in a third person view. I only have one close friend and although i’m a really good looking guy, dress really nice, i am a very negative and dark person. ive been this way since kindergarten. I have no real way of connecting with people as i feel i have no relatability. the few people i’ve met that have just kinda accepted me have always said they’ve never met anyone like me and i’m someone they’ll always remember. Needless to say i either don’t get any good conversation going or just outright am hated by 95% of people i meet. i am pretty quiet but if i’m comfortable or talking about something i like i’m very long winded. aside from that i don’t understand why people have so much hatred for me. At every job i’ve worked the one or two people i actually got along with would always tell me that everyone else hates me and dreads their work day when they see me on the schedule. Yes it kinda hurts but at the same time i don’t really care. what bothers me is i get slandered by people and have my reputation borderline ruined. this is a major factor of why i left Atlanta. 


Anyways this emotion i get when thinking about this is sadness, but not wanting to change. i’m very happy with who i am so there’s definitely pride thrown in with it. but it’s this feeling of innocence and peace that i can’t explain. I love obsessing about this scenario in my head. Me, living alone, in a big house, my music career has worked out. (things are looking up). but no friends. just a lonely rich life. I recently got a song with a pretty big artist (Over a million followers) and ever since that it feels as if all my fellow “acquaintances” all of a sudden became distant. Same thing happened when i started making some money off my music. 

I don’t know if this is self loathing or self pity but i even asked my therapist what i’m feeling and he couldn’t understand. i’ve talked to another autistic person and they say they feel this way too. So is this an autism thing? Is this self love, sad and angry contempt for the world, yet strangely happy and confident feeling normal? 

Sorry for this being all over the place i just typed whatever my brain came up with."
1284,They ignore it until it's too late.,"people like to ignore that you're having issues even after you beg for them to help until you die and then they want to act like they didn't know and this incident is such a tragic accident even though it could be prevented if they would have just help you get help. If they just wouldn't have ignored the begging and pleading they wouldn't have had a ""tragic accident"" that they stop caring about after a few weeks."
1285,Stressful stuff,"Basically, I’ve been trying to gain weight for a few months now, but this past month has been even more stressful than usual due to exams and some other stuff. I managed to get up to 39/40kg before this month and I hopped onto the scales last night to see that I weigh only 35kg. (I’m 5’1 btw)

I’ve googled how to gain weight and asked people and all I’m told to eat little and often or to eat a load of crap.

But like I literally struggle to eat like a banana, I’ll get half way through before feeling put off and full. I have to physically force myself to eat. 
I’ve thrown up a lot recently as well which hasn’t helped one bit (I’m blaming it on stress) I’ve had migraines which has further put me off eating, I’m constantly tired, cold and don’t have the motivation to even get up to eat but to just sleep instead. 
It also probably doesn’t help that I eat a lot of vegan things (I’m not vegan but my dad is, so most things in the house is vegan friendly) but the issue with vegan food is that they have barely any calories and fill you up quickly. 

But I know need to gain weight cause I’m scared of having to go to the doctors who might simply chuck me into one of those hideous eating clinic things. I’ll genuinely much rather end it all than end up in those sort of places with staff that abuse patients

So, does anyone have tips on how to gain weight? I don’t want to gain too much weight though, I’ll be happy if I stay at 39kg or 40kg as it means I won’t be constantly told off for my low weight (they think I’m 40kg currently so if I’m actually 40 I’ll look heavier to them I think) by my parents (who by the way want me to also exercise and get out more?) 

Like it worries me because my last period was 4 months late. So, now I’m a little concern it might stop completely. I just need to know a very quick way to gain weight but not too much weight."
1286,I feel like I’ve transformed into a whole another person,"I’m tired of living like this. I’ve been faking my feelings to such an extent where it has started to become suffocating. I’m tired of putting on a brave face and exuding fake confidence. I’m tired of pretending that everything is okay with me. I may portray a bubbly and happy personality on the outside but I’m broken on the inside. Being a single child I don’t have any one to lean on, I have to figure out all the stuff on my own which is hard especially when you have a conservative family background. I’m frustrated with myself and I am completely opposite than what I portray in front of others. I’m sorry I just needed to vent. I can’t do anything but hope that it gets better and I allow myself to be vulnerable."
1287,PTSD freak out (?) at work?,"Warning: disjointed ramble ahead because my brain is filled with fear.


So I work watching kids in a semi-daycare thing. Today a new family dropped their 3 kids off. The first thing that happened was the older one pulled off his belt and was holding it in a way that a person who knows how to use a belt would (like folding it in half and snapping it) and trying to hit other kids with it. I told him to put it away and he did. I told a coworker about it and she was like, “he must be getting hit at home, he has to have learned that somewhere.”

I was severely beaten as a kid, usually with a belt. I had to lie to school saying things like I fell down the stairs because of the huge bruises on my legs. Etc.

Later the younger kid was throwing toys and unintentionally hit a small child with the toy and didn’t want to go to time out so I told him I was going to call his mom if he didn’t sit by the count of 3 (I do this with all the other kids and they listen). He didn’t so I called the mom. He also had been throwing a tantrum after I told him not to throw things.

I guess it’s a bit of a haze at this point because once the mom came she was talking to the kid in some kind of way that I got concerned. I dunno. I think it was the look in his eyes? She took him out the room I guess to hit him? He was bawling this terror-full bawl. She kept saying to tell the kid he hit with a toy sorry and he couldn’t. I remember being like this, fear of saying sorry (or whatever it is that I had to do) because I felt like I was bad, I wanted to punish myself more, fear, something. Also partially rebellion because I didn’t want to do what my sh** mom wanted me to do. But mostly anxiety and insecurity that I couldn’t fix the situation because I was a failure. Just this feeling of fear of saying sorry.

This is all a haze because it’s like I was in that kids head. All the other kids react to “I’m calling your parents” as “oops I did a bad thing, I’m gonna act better now.” But this kid went into “what is going on? I’m so confused and scared.” And that’s how I felt. It’s a fog.

I mean this kid had this look of terror and then the older sibling eventually came over and started hugging him, like they knew what was gonna happen when they got home. The mom also yelled at the older sibling for no reason.

The younger one was trying to hug his mom while she was talking meanly to him and she kept pushing him away saying something like “no get away” or something.

That b**** also had the gall to tell the sister of the kid who got hit “you should’ve been watching after your little brother.” I straight up told the mom “she WAS watching him” because she’s a good kid and I’m gonna defend her.

Also the 2 abused kids had an infant brother sleeping in a carrier. That made me sad that he’s gonna be subject to this soon, if not already.


So she was talking badly at her kids for like 15 minutes and we were all watching and I dunno I just couldn’t stop watching, not rubbernecking but like, I think I was just transformed into that kid. Like I subconsciously knew that pain and fear that both had in their eyes. More like terror. So I couldn’t move or act. Just like frozen. I tried to give a look of compassion and sorrow and such into the kids eyes but they looked mad at me (?).


Anyways they left and another parent came to pick up kids and then I tried to hold my composure and I’m always really good at keeping my emotions in check at work but I couldn’t and I was shaking and then started crying. The mom was a nurse and said she had a psych degree so she understood but like. I never broke down like this, ever, especially in public.


Part of me wants to deny that this was some kind of PTSD thing, like my childhood wasn’t that bad and the things didn’t happen. But then again I’ve never randomly broken down in public like this.

Sorry again for being disjointed, I had to get this out, and this isn’t even all of it because my brain is trying to suppress the feelings and memories.

I guess, since my brain wants to deny and deny, is this some kind of PTSD thing, my reaction?"
1288,What is it called when a person can't tell the difference between dreams and reality?,"I haven't found a lot online about this so I'm not even sure if it's a thing. But I was wondering if there is a name for the situation where one finds it difficult to distinguish reality from dreams. (I don't mean depersonalization.) I mean the very literal event where one dreams something, and actually thinks it happened, until they find out otherwise. Or where they can't tell if it's something that actually happened or never happened at all, but still seems like a memory."
1289,I'm having a really bad day,"I need to see a doctor. 

My anxiety has been getting very difficult to handle. 

I just want to vomit out all my thoughts here. Its hard to even collect them. 

I am currently on my living room couch because my boyfriend sometimes really makes me feel like I'm not enough. I know that he's joking sometimes but it really hurts me sometimes and he does know that because I tell him that and I just honestly think he doesn't take me seriously because of how ""cute"" he finds me. Its very annoying and I just want him to take my feelings seriously. 
I decided to draw how I was feeling and the first word that came to my mind was broken. I'm feeling very broken as of late and it feels harder and harder to pick up the pieces. 
I need help. I'm tired of feeling like a burden. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not enough."
1290,I need some help with communication,"So I definitely have something wrong with me, most likely depression. I am in a lot of mental and a little physical pain. I feel like I'm alone, and I want to tell people but I cant. For some reason whenever someone asks if I'm fine, I always give the basic ""I'm fine"" answer. I want to tell people but I just cant. Please help"
1291,Not sure what to do,"I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features as well as PTSD. Recently I went to my disability coordinater at my University, whom has diagnostic notes from a previous psychiatrist of mine, and she asked me the other day how I feel my OCD contributes to my stress.  I was really thrown off because I was never told I was diagnosed with OCD but she told me it was one of the ones listed. Do I bring this up with my new psychiatrist and my therapist? Do I question it? I agree that I do have irrational fears, some compulsive behaviors, and intrusive thoughts but I always that that to be just who I am."
1292,I’m obsessed with myself,"Was unsure if I should talk about this here, talking about it usually makes me look like a bad person, and it’s very different than the other posts here, but I’m gonna give it a shot. 

Basically I’m a 19yo female, and I’m completely obsessed with myself. It’s hard to know if this is normal or not though. I would definitely say I’m an attractive person. Any guy I have ever wanted, I got, and I feel like I know exactly how to make people fall in love with me. Somehow I know exactly what to say and how to act to just bring people in. This doesn’t mean I don’t have feelings though, the things I feel for these guys is always real. But despite this, I always have the thought in my mind “I can completely destroy this guys life if I wanted to”. Just a thought, I won’t actually do it, but somehow it’s nice to know that I can. 

I look at myself all the time, and it makes me genuinely happy. I stay up at night just looking at pictures of myself and looking at my body in the mirror. It even helps me through tough times, if I’m sad I’ll just think “at least I’m attractive” and feel mostly better. 

I’ve told my psychiatrist about this (I’m bipolar) but he wasn’t at all concerned about it. This lead me to believe that he’s not concerned because thoughts like these are completely normal for someone like me. And I also honestly just get treated way better than most people. At the jobs I’ve had, the guys working would always help me, and my managers were super nice to me even though I was not always the best at my jobs. Also for some reason sooo many guys try to cheat on their gfs/wives with me, despite them talking about how much they love them all the time.  My pictures aren’t super revealing and hoe-ish either. Also, guys just never seem to leave me alone. If I stop talking to someone, they always come back trying to talk to me again after a year or two. 

I also think I’m just amazing at sex. I have had a lot of practice, but every guy I’ve been with has said it was the best. This has actually caused some trouble for me because I actually have a real stalker now. And another guy that is also completely obsessed with me and keeps texting me from different numbers. Then there’s a guy who told me he would die for me and that he’s gonna think of me when he dies. 

But despite me loving myself, I’m actually very insecure when it comes to what other people think of me. I’m not sure why, but if I get the vibe that someone doesn’t like me that much I get offended. Because how could they not like me?? But usually it was just me over thinking and they actually do like me. 

It’s all just very confusing, I’m not sure if it’s normal to think like this. But honestly it’s not so bad."
1293,Straight up not having a good time,"My co-workers and I attended a work event in Boston last week. While there, I got some 1 on 1 time with a girl I’ve had a thing for since August of last year. We’ve both admitted to having feelings for each other. But she’s in a shitty relationship and not in a position to where she feels like she can leave and still have stability. 

During said 1 on 1 time, we made out. A lot. We were drunk and high, so I’m sure that factored into it a bit. Since then, I kinda fell off my rocker and caught feelings HARD. Like so hard I broke down at work the other day because I realized, as of now, I’m “the other guy”. We talked. She wants to take things slow and get to know each other better and play it safe. She explained to me, and I’m summarizing here, that she’s emotionally single but not technically. 

I want to spend time with her and get to know her better and play things by her rules because I think the world of her. But, I know this is dangerous grounds. If she cheats on the guy she’s with now, I run the risk of her doing the same to me. My friends, who I love to pieces, have all told me to cool off on her and let her come to me. Basically, just disappear for awhile and see if she misses me enough to reach out or check on me. So I’m trying that.

I guess I just don’t know if that’s even worth it at this point. This has all planned out over the course of just over a week and it’s been an emotional roller coaster and I’m EXHAUSTED. My depression has been come and go along with my anxiety, paranoia, and temper. 

I feel heartbroken, but shouldn’t be.

Any tips, advice?

Thank"
1294,Mental illnesses where you can’t enforce your boundaries?,"Short post. I just have always sucked at enforcing my boundaries, like BIG time. With friends and boyfriends, you name it. It has gotten me into a lot of trouble. But for some reason, I just don’t do it. Even if I really don’t want to do what someone is asking me to do, I end up doing it. 

Please, help. What’s wrong with me? Is my self esteem/need to be liked/fear of upsetting people that bad? Or do I have a mental illness?"
1295,"Want to AMA? Just want to talk, social needs.","I'm here at this abysmal hour to tell a story.  I don't have anyone interested in hearing me go on about myself besides you.

I try to be a positive being... In the dish of the food chain, I realized the parasitic nature of most life in this world and others.

Symboisis is something I became vaguely familiar with over the years as I acquired Familiars(?). It had been quite a long time now going on the decade these experiences.  I had come a long way in mitigatin the madness in my imagination.  I was going by the rule books and went through some psychiatry and psychology and contemporary ideologies.  I have a logical and rational mind. There still seems to be this non-carbon based life we have yet to prove, or is proven, or is insulting peoples inteliigence.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry

You see there, people are working on explaining these life forms.  The more scientific we can explain things, the more the neck beard rage broods in this god damned world.  The atrocities and all other works of horror in this world I can't compensate for in writing.  I acknowledge and compensate for the gravity of horror in this world most people tune out.  
We move forward in this world, not back, I have shared quite a lot of trauma of the ages.  Coping with all of this madness is going well.  I am more sorry this world is in the state and way it is with some of these issues.  This is all screwed up, I believe in transparency.  There's far to much horse shit and paper shredding and cover ups and lies going on in this world.  
Time is always of the esseence. I just wanted to tell my stories an all, I try to take advantage of my resources, help, I foundthe realm of my ""delusions"" overwhelming a bit.  I was relatively left on my own after I had pissed off one agent or curieuer or another, I was poorly nurtured at best, I just made myself.  
Assassination, folks...  The shadow is not my realm of things.  Assassins Creed and all, I wanted to play Oddyssey, I am not going to sit there and slay wolves and level up Alexious to get him out of those sandals and rags, it demasculinated me.  My work is like confrontational, non-passive aggressive, brutality.  I'm not the type of person, I don't stalk or prey, I do enjoy some sneaking, but, not in battle.  Not my thing, if I'm coming, it's loud, it's proud, it's not silent, it's may not be professional, it's Glorious.
Damn, my ego, I can bare the thought of constantly calculating the next miracle I perform and dodge another bullet.  I was shot at.... people.  Years ago, I was shot at twice, dodged both bullets, then a series of quasi richochets I've experiences, no joke.  I'm cunning an all, I do not know how it world, in the electro magnetosphere of it all.  The world would really come to life if you had God organs, or something.  Some people are said to have ESP.
ESP, I don't know what to tell you about all that.  Censorship is what's going on most of the time.  We got all these liberties, rights, media, and like, still, people get shut up.  It happens, I've been insulted, threatened, all that.  I didn't want to go public because of my personal life and military and all.  I didn't make a word press or documentary.  
We need to think of a new way to not shelter peoples minds.

1296,Why can’t I trust people?,"This began in my early teens and I refused to see what was so wrong with it, but I saw everyone as suspicious/lying to me. Every ‘you’re going great’ to ‘you’re pretty’ I’ve gotten (which is-low already) this the age of maybe what 12 I began deflecting them, now I’m just numb towards compliments because I feel like their lying-in my head I know they’re lying. What I ask dear Reddit if this is normal and how I can try and stop it, it’s something where I lose faith in myself so early on in my own mind.

Is this normal?"
1297,Lost and stressed,"Does anyone else get really stressed out about money and what on earth you're doing with your life? 

I recently completed a course which is the reason why I moved out of my hometown into a big city and now I don't even know if I want to do it. I'm scared of not being able to support myself but I don't know what job or career I want to do... mind you I'm 24 years old. I think about studying but I never finished school and I couldn't support myself if I did. 

I get super worried about becoming homeless if I lose my job or if I get even more mentally unwell. I have no family or partner to help me if things get rough. I even think about sex work but I wouldn't feel safe doing it. Sometimes I just think about committing suicide as if it's the only choice I have sometimes.

1299,It’s 5am and I’ve been awake since 1am...,"Somehow, I was able to sleep for a couple hours from 11-1, despite worrying about going to work. There was an ice storm yesterday that turned to rain, and it has since been alternating between rain and freezing rain, with temperatures ranging from slightly above to slightly below freezing. It’s supposed to get to 40+ degrees F later today, but that won’t help me in a couple hours when I have to walk down a steep hill on black ice to get to my bus stop. I already took a sick day earlier this week, so I feel bad taking another day off. I’m kicking myself for doing that, since that day was warmer and precipitation-free.

I just wrote a letter explaining that I don’t feel safe coming to work, but I haven’t sent it yet. I work part time, and my bosses know I’m a hard worker, but I still worry about getting fired. I love this job, but I don’t feel like I should risk injury to make $2 less than minimum wage. I feel so pathetic. Should I send it? What if next week’s weather is just as bad? I’m so sick of being afraid, and winter is only half over. I’ve been having a lot of trouble sleeping as well. Even if I somehow get to work, will I even be able to concentrate with 2 hours of sleep?

One of my supervisors knows I have anxiety, but not to this extent. I wonder if I should let someone else, like in HR, know of my struggles. Would accommodations be possible for this? Like for more leniency for absences during winter? No one has mentioned anything about it, or given any indication that I would be fired. I try to make up days I miss for weather related reasons, and so far, I’ve made up the couple of days I missed, but it won’t be possible this week. I’ve been particularly anxious about this type of thing this winter. I think it’s because of the day I was going to work, and didn’t realize the side of the street was pure black ice. I somehow managed to make it down my hill, but it was terrifying, and I was anxious all day even though I didn’t fall (although I almost did several times).

Ugh. My thoughts are racing and I want to cry, and this post is so disorganized. Thanks if you actually got through this mess..."
1300,I’m sick of needing help,"Just for context, 
In 7th grade I was diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety. I had it for a long time, ( started having depressive episodes in 5th grade) but I didn’t believe that I had depression because I was really young. In 7th grade I had asked my Mom to let me go to a therapist because I was very, very close to killing myself. ( I didn’t tell her that I wanted to kill myself, I just told her I felt needed help with my anxiety (((it was effecting school))) ). I was extremely suicidal from 6-8th grade, and 7th grade was just too close for me.

Today, I am not suicidal. I’m rarely depressed, and only get extreme anxiety from conflict. I went through withdrawals, because I didn’t know how to spend the extra time that I spent trying not to kill myself. It’s very hard to admit, or believe that myself. Mostly because (again), I was sooooo young. I’m still young,,, 16 as of last month. 
When I have depressive thoughts, I can’t take them seriously due to not believe they’re bad enough compared to when I was suicidal. But now, I’m really self conscious about my appearance. I’ll pick at the skin on my arms, avoid events because I’ll start crying from being self conscious about my body, I’ve avoided taking pictures for as long as I can remember??? I’ve looked it up, and seems like I have mild BDD ( Body Dysmorphic Disorder ), but I don’t want to self-diagnose. I’ve been so upset with my shape lately that I’ll only eat one meal a day. I don’t feel hunger, so it’s easy for me to skip out on meals. I can tell it’s affecting my performance in school though. 

I want to ask my Mom if I can go back to therapy to get help for it, but I feel so overdramatic. I feel like this situation isn’t bad because the time I was suicidal was /really bad/. I don’t want my Mom spend money on therapy even though we can afford it easily, but I can’t stop sobbing over my appearance. I’m so tired of needing help. I don’t know if this is enough to get help. I only asked my mom to get me a councilor when I was super close to killing myself, so I feel like getting one now is unnecessary. I don’t talk to anyone about my problems. I never show signs of something being wrong, and because I never show signs of something being wrong, nobody ever believes the severity of what’s going on with me. Because of all that, I never talk about my problems. Most of my friends have never been able to understand them either. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t take myself seriously. I don’t want to spend money on therapy when I can try to work this out myself, but it’s hard dealing with these feelings."
1301,Is weed making me go crazy??,"I think I’m definitely planning to stop smoking, but I’m very very worried that something bad is going on with my mental health. I’ve been smoking since I was 14, &amp; I’m 18 now. I didn’t smoke daily until last year. I went through some shit, it fucked with my head &amp; I use weed to cope. Every single day for about a year I’ve been smoking 3/4 times a day. Recently I’ve been noticing that I’m extremely paranoid though, it’s gotten worse over time and until I was around people and speaking my thoughts out loud I never realized how absolutely fucking insane I sound. The reason I’m even writing this is because I just got high, I was sitting in my living room eating, someone turned their lights on outside of their house but I was convinced it was someone looking at me with a fucking flashlight outside of my window. Seriously convinced for a minute or two. At night I’m always paranoid somethings in my house watching me but this has gone on since I’ve been a kid cuz my house is just creepy but obviously those fears went away as I got older, but now when I get high they come back. I get paranoid about the people I’m with, the shit they say, I wonder if they’re being honest or if they actually like me or not. One of the most memorable times is when I was sitting in my car in a parking lot next to a dollar general and I was paranoid that these two men wearing black that just pulled up were going to rob the store. Like seriously weird shit. It all goes away when I’m sober but i don’t know. I feel like it’s developing into some sort of schizophrenia or something but I just wanted to hear some thoughts on this"
1302,My friend is turning into a dick.,"I’ve been best friends with this boy for years, we’ve always clicked, been raving, festivals traveled to different countries but all of a sudden he’s become really opinionated and generally not nice to talk to (he is always right and always trying to tell me how to live). I’ve tried so hard to understand him and stay friends with him, but our whole group has seen the changes. I’ve been wandering if it’s because he lives so far away is, and seems to spend a lot of time by himself.

He has had a big battle with his mental health recently, but he’s got himself a pretty girlfriend and things seem to be getting better. I’m seeing him and meeting his girl for the first time this weekend. Gonna see if I can find time to ask how he’s doing and have a good chat."
1303,Why is it so hard to stay committed to using a mental health app?,"There are thousands of mental health apps in Apple and Google App Stores. I have used some of them but always stop using them within a few days of downloading. I find the non-stop reminders and notifications stress-inducing. It is hard work to develop the discipline to track and log data into these apps and when you are depressed it becomes even harder to do so. The other challenge is one of managing expectations and staying committed to the app when the changes are hard to observe. I am sure gamifying tracking can increase engagement but that will only take you so far. This is where I think some kind of support network within the app can come in very handy. This support network can be one’s therapist, family, friends or just folks going through similar issues. What are your thoughts?"
1304,Parents,"Can someone tell me if the problem is me or my parents? I don’t want to come off as “THAT UNGRATEFUL B*TCH” but everytime I try to reach out to them, I feel like they don’t care at all. We don’t live together so we communicate through texting and everytime I try to start a casual conversation, they just literally answer my question/s and sometimes they even ignore it. Please don’t tell me they’re busy because I just text them once or twice a week and I don’t even care how long they take. I just realized they don’t even ask me how my day was. Btw I come from an Asian household so I guess it’s given that we NEVER talk about these kind of things. But out of all the people in the world, I never expected my own parents to make me feel even more down."
1305,Help - It's ruining my life...,"I'm a straight female - early 30s and 8 years ago...

One day in the office lunch room, I was not paying attention and daydreaming when a lady I worked with acussed me of staring at her chest. I was absolutely mortified, and apologised saying sorry, I was day dreaming at definitely not looking at her chest. I already have anxiety but from then on something changed in my head and now everyday is a struggle.

Every interaction with someone, I am constantly thinking of where I am looking, and I mean constantly. And intentionly adverting my eyes from anything I know I am not suppose to stare at, womens chests, mens crotch, people with hand deformities, people with burns on their face. It's nothing to do with attraction (or being repulsed), It can be an old lady, but its just I know social conformities its not something you are suppose to stare at. 

I try my best to ""act normal"" but I feel like its so obvious and people know what I am thinking or trying to avoid and I hate it. I often think about how it would just be better if I was blind as it's causing me so much stress.

I stress if it's going to be a hot day and people will be in more revealing clothes, I worry that guys are intentionally crossing their legs around me becuase the know what i'm stressing over, I avoid lunches with friends becuase it means eye contact over lunch. 

I thought it would just be something that went away, something I would ""grow"" out of, but its getting worse. And I'm scared to talk to a doctor as I feel they will judge me and then treat me differently after they know what goes on in my head.

But i hate it, and I hate how much it's controlling my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like here is a good place to start to ask for help, anonminity and the mentalhealth subreddit I hope people keep their judgements to themselves (please do so for my mental health, I already feel like a freak)"
1306,Worried my anxiety will get my fired,"I have anxiety which my work is aware of. I had the week off work and then the doctor signed me off for another week when he finally put me on antidepressants which have helped a lot. 

I then couldn’t get another doctors appointment to get another prescription so I ran out for a couple days causing my anxiety to spike and miss even more work. 

In the middle of this I got quite a bad kidney infection which made me miss another week. My work please is very pro mental health, we work with SEN students so it’s a big part of our job. 

I have a meeting on Monday to discuss my absence and I’m terrified. They’re aware of my anxiety but I’m scared they’re going to want me to come up with some solutions which I don’t have mostly because I haven’t worked out what I’m anxious about yet. 

I’ve only been here for 5 months and it’s my first proper job and I love being here, I adore my students, I’m so scared they’re going to fire me. Can anyone help calm my anxiety"
1307,My OCD and anxiety are driving me insane,Recently my OCD has made me worry more and more about keeping my body in tact. By this I mean I’m terrified of major injuries that can affect my ability to function  on a day to day basis. Most recently I’ve been scared that if God forbid something like this happened I would have to kill myself. Although that’s terrible that’s not the part I’m concerned about. What I’m worried about is the fact that the injuries that would God forbid be sustained would be on my medical records and people finding out about the injury. I would be fine with people knowing I killed myself but I would hate for people to know why or for it to even be recorded in the medical history that something like that happened. I know I sound insane but if anyone understands where I’m coming from it would be nice to hear from you.
1308,My SO tried to commit suicide,"Hi, I really don't know if this is the right place for this, but I guess it's worth giving it a shot.

Three weeks ago my SO tried to commit suicide, as the title says. Thankfully, she sent a goodbye whatsapp to both me and her parents, and I got to her house before the tragedy happened, but she was really determined to die. Later, the doctors told us that it was probably a combination of both an untreated depression and abuse of these sleeping pills she was taking by the tens which could cause, as a secondary effect, suicidal thoughts.

After the attempt she insisted in going home and not being hospitalized but she could not be left alone, so I took it over my shoulders to watch over her 24 hours a day, since her parents lived far. Those were, with all probability, the worst days of my life. I could not sleep a single hour the first three days straight, since she was always threatening with ending her life for good this time. I will never forget her eyes as she was saying that to me. I don't think I've ever cried so much in my whole life.

After those days, and a few crysis on her part, she began to, lacking a better word, stabilize. We knew it could not be the drugs, since they take a long time to make effect, so we guessed it was either the lack of those sleeping pills or, and that's the worst part, she concealing her illness so we would lower our guards.

Anyway, both her parents and myself began calming down a little. And when she told me that she remembered the day of her failed attempt, and those following it, she does so as if she was in a dream, as if she was not in full control of her actions. She is also taking every med she has to (and only those she has to), and everything seems to be fine.

At least on her part.

Now it's me the one who has a problem. I want to trust her. I really do. I want to believe that she is fine and only getting better, now that she medicates and sees doctors. But the truth is, whenever she feels down, she is sad because of something that should not sadden her that much, I am terrified. I struggle to leave her alone, even if before she was a person that cared much for her space and individualism. We do not live together, but I spend more time at her place than at mine. I sleep with her almost every night (I already did that prior to her attempt). But I snore a lot, and she always had sleeping problems, so most of the time I go to sleep to a different bedroom. And each time I see her down just before going to bed, I am terrified to wake up and see her gone. I don't know what to do. I have almost become a controlling boyfriend when I have never ever been like that, only that instead of controlling her because of being jealous, I do it because I'm afraid she tries to take her life again. I've been sleeping an average of 4-5 hours a day since this began, and I'm on the edge.

To anyone who has been in a similar situation, or with enough knowledge, what should I do? What did you do? Besides seeing a professional, I mean, I know I will have to. Any word of advice will be welcome."
1309,Can I vent to somebody through the PMs? (TW: Sexual abuse),I need to vent to somebody about something that happened in my childhood because I literally have no one to talk to and haven't stated therapy yet.
1310,"What's needed to get clinical psychologists, specially trained social workers and expert registered psychotherapists covered by OHIP?","1. People need to write the heath minister to request coverage and tell why.
2. In my view, recounting psychiatry's horror stories would help as so people many have been harmed.
3. Pointing out that treatment is available now and can be funded just by limiting OHIP claims to actual psychotherapists rather than anyone with a medical degree who asks if you have siblings, and, asking for the coverage, are all key.
4. In the southern U,S psychologists also write prescriptions, which could be another major savings for OHIP.  No one ever has to talk to a psychiatrist to be assessed for depression, for example, as anyone can ask themself the 5-7 questions involved. Truly, a 10-year-old could figure it out."
1311,How do I not keep everything inside?,"I can't really express my emotions or feelings when I try doing it is if there's like a barrier inside my mind. It wasn't all the time like this when I was about 7-10 years old I could do it but people often sad that I'm weird, stupid, boring so I stopped and  I'm 15 now it's really hard living with this i sometimes get asked things like why don't you talk to me"

1313,It feels like I'm always acting,"Hi all. I've been meaning to look this up but always put it off because it sounds so... Unreal. And the fact that I couldn't really pinpoint what this is. I'm using the app so I'm sorry for the weird format. 

 To those of you who might know what this is, please let me know. (and yes I plan to go to therapy if this gets worse)

For context, it feels like I shift my personality when faced with people but go back to a blank state of mind when alone. For example, a few days ago I was happily chatting away with my friend, and up until the moment we separated I was all smiles and giggling. As soon as she left me though, it felt like the curtains of the theatre dropped and my act was finished. I couldn't go back to that state of happiness and took on another role. I'm aware of these personality changes so I don't think this could be a case of MPD, but idk. 

I sound so fake and a horrible friend but I can't help it. Any help would be appreciated."
1314,How can I help my sister dealing with suicidal thoughts?,"What can I do to help my sister? We're both teenagers and right now she is in the mental health ward of a hospital right now because of the severity of her thoughts (she had a full plan, but hasn't acted on it) I don't know what I should or can do when she gets home. We don't really have the best relationship and because of that I feel she will perceive me saying anything like, I'm there for her or I care about her, as condescending. I also have anxiety and have a hard time identifying and vocalizing my emotions. I just don't know what I can say that will help or offer any support and the situation is really scaring me right now."
1315,Seeing a Psychiatrist on Monday. What Should I expect?,"Monday is my first appointment with a physciatrist to be seen about bipolar 2 disorder. Ive gone through the process of seeing their therapist, who recommended me to the physciatrist in their office. The therapist believes I do have bipolar 2 disorder. What should I expect from the first appointment. Should I expect blood work, a full diagnosis, any sort of test?"
1316,help me understand what's happening,"(Yeah haha username I know)

I'm very warry of sharing this since I don't want to be labeled as a fourteen y/o who listens to Billie Ellish and thinks I'm depressed because I listen to her...

I'm a 15 F and ever since the new year started, I started to believe nothing in life matters, there's no point of doing anything since we all are going to die anyway so why go through the stress of life, I don't really see it in a depressing way, in fact, I don't know how I feel about it, but I know it's not in a depressing way. I brought this up with my mom and she says that it maybe be because I'm not getting out more and not eating right so she bought some multivitamin gummies and was getting me out more, but that was like on Jan 24 and I still feel the same.

another thing that pushes this belief is the afterlife, I believe that when I die I will be in my fantasy world, a world I have dreamed of ever since and it's very tempting, even if I am wrong, it's still is, basically I am suicidal but not depressed, I'm also getting more careless about everyone and everything and started to get easily irritated now.

I have been procrastinating more and more at school and I'm having a hard time sleeping and the thoughts are getting worse and it's really tiring. I have been having suicidal thoughts since I was like 7 since I believed my parents would argue less at night if I wasn't here, but they had argued less and less as I get older and since we figured out my dad has Bipolar 1 and a whole lot of other disorders.

I'm am quite desperate to talk to someone to help me understand, but I have no money and my parents won't let me see someone since I have to be ""strong-minded and learn how to get myself out the hole"". I did get a pet Betta so it can help get that thought out, but it hasn't worked.

even though I don't see this in a depressing way, I still want to understand and cry when I get very frustrated when I don't understand.

Mental illness does run on my dad's side of the family, like bipolar 1, dementia, and anxiety and I just want to make sure that its just hormones changing and this belief will pass when I'm older."
1317,How to stop comparing yourself to others?,"How do we not compare ourselves to others when, by the moment we are born, it's normal for adults/parents to compare us to other kids? We go to school and it's normal for teachers to make a general assessment of every student and compare the individual's performance to the rest of class. Parents are so used to saying, ""but look at [child A]..."" My mother used to compare me to her friend's kid saying ""oh, he's doing so great in school. He's a straight A student."" Was that supposed to make me feel like I should do better? The only thing it did was put me down. 

Let's imagine your parent lacks a little in the EQ department. They are not mindful of their tone of voice, so the unsaid information that is also being conveyed is ""you are not enough"" and ""I am disappointed in you"". 

With myself I realized that I can't just shut it off. It's always there and it makes me more insecure and it doesn't matter how indifferent I act. Because the truth is, you calculate the worth of a person by what they have accomplished. Isn't that how society works. However, the truth still hurts and words still hurt. It's a stab to the heart, every single time and it sets me back every single time. I build and build and then with only a few words, everything just crumbles to the ground and becomes dirt."
1318,How do I know I'm not faking it?,"I've supposedly been depressed for years at this point and I'm finally starting to actually do something about it and get the help I need. But every so often I can't help but feel like I'm subconsciously faking it for the attention and taking resources away from people who really need it. 
Writing it out now makes it sound silly but I was just wondering if anyone else has ever felt like this or knows what I can do about it."
1319,Could this be Bipolar? What does this sound like to you?,"Hello everyone, the last two years have been the absolute worst years of my life. My overall mental has declined. What does this sound like to you? 

•One major panic attack in 2017 triggered this decline in my mental health. I had a very bad drug experience smoking weed and had to be admitted to the hospital because I thought I was dying. 

•Constant fear that what I smoked was laced. Fear that the weed did permanent brain damage to me. 

•My overall mood is up and down. I tend to become very angry at my mother and father and last out at them.

•After having a good day (like going out with friends or a small trip) the next day is hell for me because of the sadness. I usually cry after having a good time. 

•Complete lack of motivation. I am an artist and now I rarely feel like working on any projects. At my job I feel like making through each shift is a challenge. 

•Was consumes for months (if not a full year) that I am schizophrenic. My doctor told me that I was not...but I couldn’t rationalize this in my brain. 

•Rarely spend my money because I fear that this shows that I am irresponsible and possibly manic/bipolar. Because I read that excessive spending is a sign of bipolar. 

•Constant scary existential thoughts about the nature of being a human. Almost as if I am scared to exist. 

•Feeling frequently disconnected from my life as if I am going through the motions 

• Constantly questioning my sexuality. Grew up in a very conservative house hold. I think I am gay but believe I will never be able to fully accept this aspect of my life. 

•sometimes sudden I treat in sex. 

•Sex is such a bizarre topic for me. Feel as if I want to have sex but feel that I am not attractive enough for it. Feel as if I am to disgusting for it. 

•Needing constant validation from others. I am convinced that I am ugly and overweight. When I look in the mirror I just think how disgusting I am. 

•Fear of being  narcissistic and or psychotic. Although everyone around me says that I am not...I can’t believe this. 

•Sometimes when I go out into public I feel like everyone is judging me and thinking that I am ugly, weird, and for some reason poor. 

•Think that most people hate me and do not enjoy my company 



What does this sound like to you? I am just in a very bad place and could use some advice. Sorry for the spelling and grammar errors I wrote this quick."
1320,She said I triggered something and now she broke up w me and utter cold. Asking for solutions,"My partner (now ex unfortunately) self diagnosed with BPD. 

On the 20th of January, she suddenly texted me, “relationship isn’t ideal for me right now. Let me go”. Of course I was shocked as we promised that we’ll be together for decades and even a lifetime. Weve been telling this as time pass by. She said she wants to find this inner peace alone. I argued that Ill be here for her and she doesnt have to push me away and we still love each other so why do we have to split. She’s worried that she might hurt me and cheat on me but I said that “as long as the feeling is mutual we’ll still hold on”. I expressed my care and love to her. 

We met on the 24th to celebrate our birthdays together (her on the 23rd and mine was 25th). She was in an off mood when we met but she slowly became warm and lovable again. We stayed the night and I asked if she’s happy and at peace. She said yes to both and felt that she was. Before we go to our separate ways, I asked about our situation. We had an agreement that we’re not in a relationship but the content is still there and I expressed that Ill be here for her, and she said so is she for me.  So we made everything clear.

But in the past 2 weeks her goal changed and she said “I have a problem and maybe I dont wanna fix it”. She also consumed some of her time by watching devastating docs like about rape, victims of misconducts, serial killers and anything dark. We’re into watching docs that are upsetting but not a marathon than could influence our mood. She also drank with her friends before we were supposed to meet and something almost happened to her friend on the way home. Her week last week was a rollercoaster. 

2 days ago I made her irritated by trying to reach her multiple times to clear things out with her, if what we talked about on my birthday as she unfollowed and removed me from her followers on IG. I think it’s due to my Story about me venting out that some people are cold. And when I was talking to her in my normal style, I think I used some terms that made her misunderstood my points. I just realized recently that I became pushy and made her think I was shoving self care sh*t to her. She said that she completely shut off from me. After that, she became really cold and said that we’ll just be friends but she’s not sure if she can still give more. The last part was really painful but Im not expecting her to take care of me and carry my weight. I expressed that. She also said that I triggered something 2 weeks ago. Ive been having difficulty in breathing almost a week now and how she ask me about my situation is still cold and sorry but irritating as she’s like intentionally doing it but Ill understand her.

Tomorrow we’ll meet as I forced her to tell me everything she said in front of my face and Im really careful with what I say after I made her upset so I cant  say that I still care for her, Im not gonna abandon her, I still love her and I accept the space she needs but I hope she doesnt forget that she’s not alone.* she’ll be leaving the country for work so this is the last chance Ill be seeing her in person for a very long time

So my question is: what should I say to make her realize that she’s not alone going through this? Or simply what should I say to her? 

Info about us: we have so much in common and our feelings for each other are always mutual. In the short period of time, we already know what we’re thinking about with minimum usage of words. Our relationship was effortless and we only had 2 minor arguments.

*earlier today she said that she doesnt like me to apologize as I said sorry earlier so Im not gonna use the word sorry and apologies tomorrow 

I’m sorry if this is long and I’m really panicking and thinking what I should do. I know she still loves me and just keeps pushing me away."
1321,How can i help a person cope with a brothers death,"told from a friend's perspective\*\* two days ago my best friend was awoken by 3 police officers in his room, one kneeled down and told him that his brother had been in a car accident during the night and the hospital wasn't able to save him. My friend is only fourteen and he has neither slept or eaten in the last two days. It's gotten so bad that his parents reached out to me asking me to help him. 

Does anybody know how I might be able to help him? I am very worried he is considering suicide since he has a history of depression, and the only person that could help him then was his brother."
1322,I made a self-help page on Instagram!,"Hi I recently made an Instagram page to share useful life insights and self-help advices. My story is that I suffered through depression and anxiety and whilst I'm on the road I thought about sharing what's helping me, what I'm discovering, and inviting people to share their ideas and minds too.

My hope is to make a difference in the life of people who are dealing with mental illnesses or even just difficult times in life. 

This is the page https://www.instagram.com/spiritual.selfhelp/ I hope you check it out and follow if you like."
1323,How to cope with depression alone?,"I (17) have had depression for a very long time now. Never talked to a professional about it cause I just simply can’t. I know I have depression. It could only be more obvious that I do if I were to write it on my forehead. My family doesn’t get it. I’m not close enough with them to talk to them about it. And if I’m gonna be honest I don’t want them to know about it at all. But I live with them I can’t just go to therapy and they wouldn’t know about it. I manage, suicide is not anywhere near an option. It won’t matter what the comments say, I’m not in a position to get help. So I was just hoping someone has an advice on how to cope with depression."
1324,Men are 3x more likely to die by suicide when compared to women. Women are 2x more likely to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder when compared to men.,Many statistics show that these mental health disparities exist. Do any of you know why these disparities occur?
1325,Struggling with the state of the world (vent),"High key, I'm just finding myself disgusted lately. I don't know if it's my constant work in customer service, compounded by my pregnancy and underlying mental illnesses. I just hate the way the world seems to operate. I'm all about people being who they wanna be, but these days it's ""pop a pill to make yourself happy"" ""trying open relationships and swinging"" ""monogamy is a thing of the past"" ""money is the only thing that matters"" ""look like this or you're simply not good enough"". It makes living exhausting. I used to be willing to end my life, but my daughter gives me purpose, honestly. I'm so thankful to be having her here soon. 

Tbh my dream is to end up in the middle of the mountains, kind of living off of the land, having a small little farm house with some animals and raising my daughter to appreciate what truly matters. That hard work with your two hands is more fufilling than whatever the fuck it is I'm currently doing with my life. The stress of it all, is THAT also takes money. 

Often times, I wish I had been born into that kind of life, but I appreciate the life my mother gave me, and for being alone, she did damn good. I just can't get over this feeling of disgust towards the way things are now. I almost miss my childhood ignorance."
1326,Im scared people will be angry at me if I kill myself,"Kinda fucking sad that my reason not to commit suicide makes no god damn sense. Like how df would people be angry at me if I was dead? Maybe im scared that if I failed to do it properly I'd be yelled at, but I don't think that's it. Im scared I will feel people being angry at me from beyond the grave. Makes no sense.
I spent the better part of my life being a good little girl that never says what she actually thinks and just scrambles out whatever the fuck it is people want to hear this time. Because I don't like it when people are angry at me and if im myself people are angry at me and I don't want people to be angry at me. Makes no god damn sense"
1327,"Best ""self-help"" resources?","I need some kind of book. A resource. Not any of those cushy touchy-feely bullshit inspirational books.

I need something that targets unhealthy relationships, anxiety, depression

Pretty much something to help me become healthy. Help me cope with my bad relationship habits, my horrible anxiety, my constant fear and anger and jealousy.

Some kind of guide to help me be fucking normal."
1328,Struggling with Highschool,"So I am currently in highschool and tuned 18 this year. For pretty much my entire life school has been hard for me and when I got to highschool I became even worse. For some reason I can make it through the first semester (barely) but when it gets to the second I can't seem to bring myself to do anything. Because of this I am behind on 8 credits and will be stuck at school for an extra year. I don't know why this happens but I start to feel like shit around this time and get really really sad. I do take Wellbutrin and Concerta now to help with my motivation and ADD but it's not like that would be an explanation because I have only started this medication within the last year. And other than during these last few months, they have been working really well. I am getting really annoyed with myself because I can't seem to figure out what's wrong with me. I think I may be ruining things for myself, maybe I don't believe I deserve to be happy or whatever, who knows. Do you have any idea as to what I could do to get out of this place I am in? 
ps. I do go to therapy and see a psychiatrist already :)"
1329,It's National Play Therapy Week...Why I became a Play Therapist.....,"This article is a short story about a personal journey into the world of play therapy...

1330,How did you open up about mental health problems with your friends?,
1331,I’m scared,My 9 year old brother has extreme mental health issues and he hasn’t spoken for months due to his depression and ocd and the last words I heard him say were “I want to die” and I’m always so horrible to him because he’s making everyone else suffer especially my mum as I’ve now friend anorexic and my brother and dad have Autism. Any tips on how to start being nice to him even when he spends hours doing his habits (throwing his neck back and making noises) and rituals ?
1332,I can’t grow emotional attachment to people anymore.,"Lately I‘ve been feeling empty inside I don’t think I can grow emotionally attached to people anymore. Expect for my parents since they have been with me through thick and thin even if they are a bit close minded. Although I can open up to them a bit I still feel like I need to put a fake mask when I interact with them. As for school, once I step into school I just feel a rush of depression and being drained. Every person I talk to drains my energy and I don’t even see the point of opening up to people and making friends anymore. The friends I made a while ago are growing apart from me but I don’t even see the point in maintaining the friendship anymore because I don’t even think I can benefit anything from that friendship to begin with. Every if I do wanna open to some people in my school a part of me is scared of people leaving me and burdening them because of multiple incidents that has happened with me in the past that’s affected my state of mind. I keep reminding of myself of the past and it keep hindering me from interacting with others. I see people enjoy having fun with their friends and I’m just alone. I don’t find joy in anything anymore and a part of me wants to end it all but the only thing keeping me here is my parents and two friends that aren’t even in the same school as me.  I don’t know if I should even put the effort in it anymore why would anyone care about my problems all they would do is give me shitty advice that I’ve heard multiple times or pity me, which I don’t want."
1333,Confusion All Around,"This probably seems silly, but I have been kind of struggling with my mental condition for a while but only recently began looking into getting help as the result of my doctor randomly doing a Depression test on me (It was VERY basic). She came away with the concern that I may have moderate recurrent episodes of Depression.

So she recommended a psychiatrist to go and see to find out more. I went to the psychiatrist, and she came away saying that I definitely have a problem with Anxiety but the issues with mood swings and depression need to be tested through hormone testing to see if it is a hormonal problem or not. She told me to go see an OBGYN, they don't do hormone testing I guess so that did nothing. They also while they were doing the typical questionnaire said that I was diagnosed with Anxiety (for like sure which I didn't know). Then I go to my account with them online and it says I have GAD which like NOBODY told me I had ANY legit diagnosis for anything so one I am SO confused. The Psychiatrist wanted me to get my hormones tested to see if I need medication or therapy or whatever. THAT wasn't done.

So I'm kind of like completely stumped about what the hell is going on with me? Am I the only one who looks at all of that and is like...what the fuck? Do I have an official diagnosis!? Also how can I even see if I have a possible mood disorder or depression if the OBGYN isn't doing what my psychiatrist wanted done? 

Also, I went to seek out therapy because now I'm unsure if I can even take medication but I have NO FUCKING clue what to tell the therapist????"
1334,Am I losing my mind?,"I am a college student taking a full load of courses, as well as working two jobs to make ends meet. I have a 4.0 GPA (I only mention this to note how much time I spend studying instead of sleeping). I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression as a teenager, but slowly was able to ween off of them with the assistance of therapy. I haven't taken medication in about five years. A couple of months ago I experienced a traumatic event that has really messed with my mental health. I think about it almost nonstop. Lately panic attacks have been happening more and more frequently, multiple times a day. I had a night where I stayed awake, having attack after attack until exhaustion finally knocked me out. I have booked an appointment to see about going back on medication for next week. What finally made me realize that I needed to book it was when I depersonalized for the first time ever. I was driving and suddenly had the feeling that I was not real, and that my surroundings were not real. I contemplated driving off the road to see what would happen. I feel like I'm spiraling. Like I am not in control of my thoughts. I am anxious every waking hour. I feel like I'm in a crisis. I don't have enough time to sleep. I have no days off. I have days where I have straight classes for 12 hours to give me days off to work 8 hour days. I even have a day where I go from one 8 hour job to another job. I'm stuck in this routine because I need to have money to live, and I need to finish my degree. My parents do not support me. Can anyone give me any sort of reassurance that I'm okay? Any advice to keep myself going? Has anyone else experienced something like this?"
1335,Spousal Therapy,How do I get my wife to see a therapist.  She's counter offered to just increase her meds when I ask her to see a therapist.  I know this won't solve the problems she's experiencing.  I'm getting close to the point where I'm ready to offer up an ultimatum of divorce because I think it's the only thing that will work but I'm coming here for alternatives.
1336,i can't break the cycle (repost), for about a year and a half i have struggled with mental health issues. most causes have been out of my control. anyways during this time period i feel happy and it's like a cycle we're the mental health problems keep coming back around. i can't trust anyone close to me and my mental health is really unstable right now worse then ever before. i just don't what to do

I am currently in my final year of my undergraduate psychology degree and for my final project I am carrying out an online survey to investigate men's mental health literacy, self stigma and whether that plays a role on their attitudes towards help seeking. 

It is entirely anonymous and takes between 10 and 15 minutes to complete.

1339,Anxiety,I'm not really sure why I feel this way but sometimes when I'm in the shower or just walking I get this feeling and voice in my head that makes me start to hyperventilate but the feeling feels so familiar like I know I've felt that way and heard that voice before but I cant remember what memory and it's not my voice it's a mixture of women and men voices just talking and I cant even understand them so I just wanted to know what's wrong
1340,"Does anyone else just cry multiple times throughout the day, but briefly?","This started when i was on a medication over the summer that we thought to be making my depression worse. My physical health condition was not getting better and i was very clearly stressed beyond my comprehension. This got better with therapy though. 

I recently have been going through a break up. It’s my first and this is like nothing i’ve experienced. The person is long distance and i can’t even find them if i felt like it. I am just heartbroken. 

I find myself crumpling. Actually, physically crumpling where i feel like i can’t breathe and i sob and panic for a solid 60 seconds. I just let it happen until my chest feels like it’s not caving. I sob like i have never sobbed before, but only briefly. This happens literally every hour and i don’t want to go in public at the moment because i won’t know how to collect myself. 

I know it gets better. But it still hurts. 

I don’t even know what this is. Is it just from mental pain? I have experienced it over the summer, but never to this extent."
1341,I don't feel like I'm actually alive.,"The days I just passing me by. Sometimes I'll feel emotions (usually sadness), but most of the time I just don't feel anything at all. I feel like I'm meandering my way through this pointless existence and I'm not actually living any of it. I'm so jaded and disconnected from everything that I can't imagine a life where I'm happy, I feel connected with people, &amp; where it feels meaningful.

I feel like a husk of a human being and I don't know why I even exist."
1342,Just had my fourth crying this week,"Every little thing just snowballs and it feels like a lot. I'd be alone playing on my phone and then suddenly I just feel so shitty with all these thoughts in my head and the next thing  I know I'm suddenly sobbing. I can't trace it to a solid reason. There were times I cried until my head hurt. 


I try to stop it in the first moments in case if someone walks in the room, but it just feels looser when I cry it all out. I just want a day where I'm not obligated to do anything and cry all I want."
1343,If I could cure my depression I would,"Lately I’ve been having very depressive episodes lasting me up to weeks sometimes months. And it just bothers me because I want it gone, I don’t want to feel like this the moment I go to bed to when I wake up. I want to just figure out a way to get rid of it. I take my pills, I go to therapy, I have hobbies to cope. But you know how it is- you do these things to cope with depression. I just want it gone, not have to go through it everyday for weeks and weeks. Every time I hear someone use depress as an adjective I just wish I could have a luxury of saying that and not having to worry about suffering through it. 

I’m sick of it."
1344,Should I see a therapist?,"So I broke off a pretty big relationship a few weeks ago, and it's just been hard to function. Some days I can barely get out of bed. I can't do my homework, my grades are dropping, and all I want to do is lie down and listen to music and do nothing at all. I feel like I'm just rolling through the days without any reason. Like I'm just going to class because it's what I'm supposed to do. But it feels like it's just heartache, and it'll probably go away, so I don't know."
1345,I can't find a telepsychiatrist that takes PA Medicaid,I have PA Aetna Medicaid but the nearest provider is over 2hrs away and I can't find a telepsychiatrist that takes my insurance. Any ideas?
1346,Feeling indecisive about life.,"I’m 26 years old and I don’t know what to do with my life. 

I’m indecisive about which path I should take: the traditional academic route or non traditional. 

I want to be able to travel, to be free but to also make a decent living. One of my options is to get my AA Degree, teach English abroad while doing my BA degree online. Eventually building my career up to become an international school counselor. However, that would require a MA Degree. The money doesn’t have to be an issue, I’m just afraid of wasting it on something I don’t end up liking and I frankly never liked school. 

The other option is to just travel abroad for a few months after getting my AA by the end of 2020, maybe get a TEFL certificate so I can have something to fall back on and just explore.  Challenge, figure myself out since I would be completely out of my comfort zone and alone. 

I honestly thought about learning graphic design and tattooing whether or not I decide to leave the states and travel. When it comes to anything artistic and creative, I feel confident that I would enjoy it immensely. Even with the challenges and the periods of boredom. But I’m afraid of possibly becoming a starving artist because either field is very competitive and the possibility of it not benefitting me in the long run as I get older (if I get older). 

I just feel so lost, sad and hopeless. I want to at least have half of my shit figure out before turning 30. Making a decision in something and sticking to it. 

It’s a mess, but I would appreciate any advice/thoughts  from personal experience or otherwise. 

Do you believe in the saying of doing something that scares you?

Thank you for reading 🙏🏽"
1347,Out of meds and can’t afford a refill for another week...trying to figure out options?,"Hey guys, I’m prescribed Lamictal and Wellbutrin and have run out of both and waited too late to contact my doctor for a refill. He filled them but now I’m realizing I do not have the money to pick them up until I get paid next Friday. By that point I’ll have been off of everything for 9 days. I don’t know about the Wellbutrin (I’m taking 300mg) but I do know with Lamictal that it’s not something you can just start taking again once you’ve been off of it for more than a couple days and you basically have to start back from square one and reintroduce it. 
In years past I was very stubborn with my medication and regularly took myself off of it and would just wait until someone would prescribe me something new and I’d start the process all over again. For about 18 months now I’ve been consistent with my medication and RARELY miss a day which has been a first for me in almost 10 years of treating my bipolar. 
Because I feel like this isn’t my first rodeo, while I’m not totally looking forward to restarting my medication from scratch after I am able to pick it up next week (knowing I’ll need to consult my dr first of course), I do have some concerns of going off cold turkey. I also am taking my GRE in 3 days and am really concerned that by then my head will be all over the place being off of everything. 
Any advice on this? Warning signs to look for? 
I’m not looking to be told that I need to find a way to pay for the medication bc I know that and would love to be able to do that.
The fact of the matter is that I can not afford it right now and will not have access for another week. Just looking for advise on what to prepare for. 
I have not told my doctor what is going on because this is embarrassing and I don’t want to admit in this moment that I can’t afford the medication. I would rather wait until I can afford it and have it again for them to tell me what to do once I’ve already been off of it
Thanks guys"
1348,I don’t know what’s going on with me.,"I’m 29 years old and recently have just lost all motivation, energy, drive. 

I haven’t been to work in a week, and before that another week. 

Up until this point I’ve always been a hardworking person, I’ve managed to make an amazing career out of little to no opportunities or resources. Now I just... can’t... get up in the morning. 

The hardest thing about it is that I’m not happy with myself when I don’t get up. Like I WANT TO WAKE UP and go to work. And when I don’t I hate myself for it. I’ll go to sleep saying you MUST go to work and then sleep through all of my alarms. 

I’m super depressed. I feel worthless. This has been going for months now. I’m not sure what to do. If anybody out there has gone through a similar phase and worked their way out of it I would love to hear how. I feel like I’ve tried everything."
1349,I keep hurting myself with drugs,"Hey Everyone I'm not ok, I'm so tired that I barely even feel sad or anything. I come from a fucked up house hold my mom and her boyfriends always drank and broke shit and yelled at each other keeping me up all night multiple times a week for my whole life it never stopped. My dad has been in jail for most of my life so I never had a father figure so I was just left with this toxic evil bitch to raise me. As I got older she started taking her anger out on me more and more as I became a man. When my grandmother died (probably form my mom getting her drunk while in critical condition the night before) she started keeping up all night with abuse for like 2 weeks strait and her and her boyfriend would gang up on me for not wanting to go to school in the morning. I end up getting drunk at a friend's house one day and when she came to get me she hit me. That just set me off from all the shit she put me through and I ended up destroying the house she was renting. So I moved back in with my dad but he had manipulative meth head girlfriend and I watched him slowly descend into delirium as the power and water got shut off and eventually he went back to jail and I ended up at my grandparents Wich is run by my junkie aunt. Some time when I was living with my dad I picked up a dxm habbit and I could get it for free so I was taking high doses every day. I didn't have a bed to sleep in I had to ask my grandfather for his car keys so I could sleep in there in the middle of winter and wake up freezing. Eventually I went crazy from brain damage of heavy dxm use I took over the dose that can kill you multiple times and was drinking it every day for like 3 months. I slowly came back and my mom eventually let me move back in but continued with the abuse while Making every one around her think I'm a minster. Shes been acting worse lately and the only person I can go to for help is my aunt who shoots up meth so I started using meth like every other day and I feel like that is bringing back the heart and brain damage from the dxm. I feel like shit haven't slept right in over a week. To top it off a girl has never even loved me or held my hand. My friend ended up talking me into getting an escort. But I feel even more lonlely than before I wanted love not sex and I couldn't even climax because I was on a Suboxone. I just want love and this world feels like shit"
1350,Does the prospect of living ever make you tired?,"Do you ever feel tired if you think about having to live until you're old? Working and having all those responsibilities that come a with it? If most of your energy is spent on getting up, going out of the house and working, what is left? Really, how do people do it?

Honestly, I'm a young person and call me naive and immature and all that, but I can't help but feel like all my energy has already been spent on school. How do I get enough to find real work? My motivation is in the negative and my anxiety concerning my future is through the roof, I have no hope left. I've never had any aspirations. I've been a loser and coward ever since I was born, so what do I do? Where do I go? There's no place for someone like me. I just want to sleep forever. /*siiiggghhh/*"
1351,Trauma/Stress after being stuck in a potential fire,"I live in a building of 9 floors and live on the 6th floor

A few weeks ago, i heard a fire alarm. There are only detectors in people's apartments.  
It usually happens when people are cooking and burn something and forget to open their windows  
But normally it stops after a few seconds, max 15-30 seconds  
This time, it was going on for more than 2 minutes  
I looked outside the window and down, i saw smoke coming out of an apartment on the 4th floor  
I started panicking because i thought of this situation a few days ago, i don't know why  
I put on my shoes and went in the hall and stairs and smelt burnt   
So i thought i can't use the elevator because it's non recommended during a fire and i didn't want to take the stairs in case there were dangerous smokes.  
So i really started to panic   
Anyway to be sure, i called firefighter line and explained the situation.  
They advised me to go downstairs and check and knock on the neighbors. There was just burnt smells but not smokes so they said it was ok.  
So i went downstairs and knocked at the door, the neighbor opened and yeah it was only burnt bread.  
After that, i had to lie down 2-3 hours on my bed to calm down and i thought of it a little days after.  
Then i stopped thinking of it until today. 

Why am I telling this story ? Because 2 weeks ago, i was stuck in the traffic and i started to panic. I don't like to be stuck somewhere on in a situation where i cannot extract myself easily. But this time it was real hard time. I had to pullover once and then on the motorway, i really had the feeling i would faint and have an accident. And last week, i started having chest pain just where the heart is and also 2 nights where i felt like i was choking and could not breathe. I even went twice to the emergency, once sent by my doctor for a check up. And everything is clear.  
The choke feeling last days seems to come only when i'm resting or alone not talking to someone. But when i'm busy out of home or with people, i don't think of it. And i think it grows when i'm home  
I only understood today that maybe this is post traumatic stress after the supposedly ""fire"" incident

  
I plan to talk about it with my doctor beginning next week and maybe get psychological help  
But now it's weekend so won't be possible to have an appointment before next week  
Has anyone been like this kind of situation ? How did you live this ? What are the advices you got ?  
We plan to move in a different city, in a house (it was planned before the incident) maybe april or may but i'm thinking : is it a good option to leave this place earlier because it would be good to go out of this ""toxic"" zone where i experienced the stress/trauma ?

Thank you"

1356,Feeling of dread?,Sometimes I get random feeling of dread and self loathing.. kind of. It’s this feeling that I don’t want to be anywhere (not like I want to die) but I don’t want to be anywhere with anyone. I just want to be out of where I’m at because I feel so dreadful. Then it goes away and I’m fine? I’m having a good day what’s going on. There’s no reason to feel this way.
1357,Anxious mess,"I have been dealing with work and family related anxiety as of lately due to an abundance of things piling up. I am seeking therapy for that but today I realized that I also have separation anxiety from my SO...so much that I have become clingy and though I apologize for it and try to distract myself when they are not around, I still feel lonely and feel like they are going to disappear on me.

I game so I get it but we don’t play TOGETHER I’m a pc gamer hes a console player he doesn’t want to play games where we both interact and will literally throw on the headset to chat with other ppl mid conversation.

But as “joking manner” but I took it seriously because she never made fun of me like that before. She also starts ignoring me for her friend. I feel like I wasted my 3 years to be friends with this stupid friend. She calls me stupid because (I have ADHD she doesn’t know that but sometimes I get hyper or quiet or just weird) she judges me for being different from others. Even for what I do and like. I just Hate her so much. I keep telling myself she’s is useless and I have to move on that she’s not worth my time but it’s still bothering me. Help. I just cried just now because I was sad,hopeless,angry."
1360,suicide (maybe trigger warning),"so a close friend of mine has childhood trauma, and in turn it's really helped develop her depression. I say help develop because I honestly think she has like genetic depression passed down, based on what she's told me about her dad. I think what he did to her, and childhood bullying and some other things were just environmental factors that brought it out and worsened it. she goes to therapy but she says her therapist doesn't help her and she's not on medication. recently she's been getting really bad and is saying that after (insert event here) or a date or whatever, that she needs to ""think on it"" and maybe after those events she will have done enough with her life to be done with it and rest. I am so scared that I'm naseous all the time and I just don't know what to do. I don't know what moves are in my place to make. I don't even believe in God either but I've been praying I'm so lost."
1361,Please help. Mother going through psychosis,"Hello all, my mom is in her 50s and has had no prior mental health issues that were apparent atleast. These past two months have been really stressful for my family, my grandpa died and my mom has been organizing this huge event for the company she works for. I knew she was stressed out organizing this event but today I get a call from her co workers she’s yelling and crying in the bathroom. I was immediately taken aback because this is not like my mom AT ALL. When we picked her up she’s talking about this storm we had last night and that were going “home” she thinks my siblings are coming in to town to go “home” I think home is heaven. Shes crying, slightly aggressive and refusing to go to ER. Never in my life have I ever seen her act even close to this. It’s breaking my heart. I’m scared she may act on a delusion to take us “home”. What can I do??"

Im so anxous and so stuck In my thoughts its driving me crazy.
 Im wanting to start taking substances to make me feel something for a while but Im not going to because I don't want to go down that path again. I've already gone so far.

You know this is temporary? 
I know..
You're gonna feel better tomorrow you know that
I don't know... 
You know you will. 
I know..."
1363,At home therapies,"Hey there all, this sounded like an interesting topic and it might be kinda useful so I thought i'd ask, so what are some good at home therapies people can do

So I know of cognitive behavioural therapy, i'm not sure if its as effective on your own, but might still work.
Also exposure therapy, I've tried it a few times, best example would be how I amn't as scared of spiders anymore.
And music therapy, I hear thats pretty good, and I think I read it can help people who suffer from schizophrenia which is pretty interesting
Maybe one more I can think of, art therapy, maybe thats what its called, I have a colouring book which doesn't seem to bad. 

Anyway knowing some more would be cool to know, thanks in advance!"
1364,"Having difficultly talking about sexual assault, is this okay?","Thinking or talking about sexual assault sends me into a frenzied panic. While myself and my loved one have gone through it in some way or another, I just can’t seem to handle it. I was talking with my s/o the other day just about our opinions on a policy and I couldn’t mentally handle it and had to stop the conversation almost as soon as it started. I get so anxious about it because scenarios and horror stories start to fill my head and I can’t think about anything else, and they aren’t even my memories most of the time. I’m just not sure of what’s going on or if it’s reasonable to feel and act this way."
1365,Everything feels like so much,"I just feel like there's so much I need to fix about myself and my life and I feel so lost and I don't know where to start. And when I think about it, it just makes me want to curl up and not leave my bed, so I don't, which is not helpful. these are all of the things that are swarming around this lil brain of mine that is making it feel like i can't get it together.


I'm crazy in relationships, when i'm in them, I don't respect my boyfriend's boundaries. I get compulsive urges to snoop in their shit and not trust them and obsess and I hate it. And I know that if I just keep going to therapy I can get a handle on it and not be like that in my next relationship but in the meantime, it's left me with so much shame and hatred of myself that I don't see how anyone could ever want me again.

I can't seem to stop thinking about my ex and his new girlfriend, it's like this awful pain in my heart that I can't get relief from. I've gone no contact, i've deleted all my social media, I know it'll get better, but in the meantime my stupid obsessive brain wont shut up about my anger towards our breakup and the ways she's probably better than me and how much I hate myself. it just wont shut the fuck up ever. i'm so sick of being in my head.

i'm scared of the slow progression of my disease. i'm tired all the fucking time for no reason, i trip on shit, i get confused all the time, and it's just gonna get worse and there's nothing i can do about it. positive attitudes about it have shown to help, but i seem to just... not be able to. every time i think about my eventual and probable disabilities i just feel so overwhelmed and so so so alone and again get that awful creeping feeling that no one will ever love me again.

all of this might be ok if i had a killer personality or anything to offer but i don't really!! i have no talents or skills or even really hobbies anymore. i have a dead end job and i'm not qualified to get into any career, really, and even if i could take the steps to get into a career, i worry about my ability to handle it because of my disease.

also!! i have social anxiety up the butt, like Real Bad. i don't know how to talk to people. when i'm introduced to people who seem too cool for me, i just don't talk. my mind goes blank. i look like a weirdo. i also don't know how to explain the weird, bad things about me and my past like why i don't have friends, why i barely leave the house, why i moved out of my mom's so late in my life. i feel like everyone can tell what an anxious mess i am all the time, like they know all this bad stuff about me and are just ready to make fun of me. i'm also in a new city and i don't know anyone and i don't know if i can push myself to talk to anyone so i just feel like i'm gonna be alone forever. i went on a few dates with one guy but he rejected me bc i'm such an anxious nightmare mess and i don't blame him.

i also just feel so inferior in terms of how to be an adult person. i moved here 3 months ago and i still don't have enough furniture for my room, everything is a mess. i don't know how to decorate my room like a functioning adult person. i'm not eating well and i don't know how to cook meals to get myself to eat well. and i'm way too old to be like any of this!! i'm 27, i should've gotten over all of these things a long time ago but nope!!

i just!!! want a break from my brain for like five minutes. i hate everything about my life right now, i'm so sad and anxious all of the time and i'm so so so tired. i just want a break from my stupid brain.

thank you for coming to my ted talk"
1366,Had an episode...,"So I tend to come up with an idea and run away with it and cause myself great stress for no reason. This is something that has caused me issues over the last couple years. 

I was called into work last night and have not left still. As of now, I’m at 32 hours without sleep which isn’t a crazy amount of time but I think it’s probably a little bit of a factor. 

So I’m sitting in the break room and realize how bleak the room is. The walls are that grayish blue administrative color and there’s a clock that just sits there right in the middle. So it reminded me of detention from when I was in school. Then I thought it was ironic that detention was punishment in school but working in almost the same situation is just kinda normal in real life. 

Then I blast off on an hour long mind fuck where I became convinced that I have committed some crime in the past and that this is a shutter island type scenario where I’m completely delusional about everything and that all my coworkers are actually just fellow inmates or maybe this is a mental institution. Then I validate this by looking at all the strange things that have happened since I’ve been working here that would back it up and also I’m looking at my coworkers and thinking “yea they could definitely be a criminal because _______.  

So I’m still not completely out of this but I’m coming back around. Just by telling one of my coworkers that no sleep was making me go crazy immediately relieved a lot of the pressure. 

I guess what I want to ask is do you think that this is a serious condition I have if similar types  kid of paranoid delusions like this or do I just have an issue overthinking?"
1367,I got diagnosed with ASPD but Psychiatrust also said I have psychopathic tendencies what does that mean in particular?,Ha ha?
1368,What does normal feel like?,I don’t think I’ve ever had normal brain chemistry so I just wonder what life is like when it is. I’ve always felt as if my perception of things feels abnormal. So I just wonder what life is like for a person with normal brain chemistry. Like what is it like. I’m jealous.
1369,Urge to shave my head,"Hi everyone.

  
I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time. In the last few years I've been getting better, but some days are harder than others. This week was really weird and bad and I'm with an urge to shave my head. I've long natural curly hair who needs to be taken care of and for a long time I've been neglecting it and just wearing it in a messy-not-cute bun every day.

  
I've never had short hair, except for when I transition from relaxed to natural. My relationship with my hair was very problematic once growing up, got bullied a lot. Since I was a child, my scalp gets very itchy when I'm too anxious and it's just being overall annoying.

  
I'm a bit scared of shaving and regretting it after the bad days are gone. I'm ago scared that ""urge"" is kinda like a breakdown, and I'm really scared to know if I'm going to feel better or worse after I did.  
Has someone else felt like this urge and did it? How did you feel after?"
1370,Any tips on how to deal with body dysmorphia and a lack of motivation for school caused by depression?,"I'm starting to get back into old habits. I feel disgusting about my body and I have had no desire to eat to the point I'm getting headaches and feeling nauseous and irritable because I'm not eating regularly. I keep thinking ""why should I bother eating since I'm so disgusting anyways?"" When I look in the mirror, all I see is someone who is fat and disgusting and shouldn't be seen in public, despite the fact that realistically I'm not fat and even got picked up by a body positive modeling agency. My bdd combines with my anxiety and creates those racing thoughts in my head for hours but not like an anxiety attack that I've had before, this is different. I also have no desire to complete my college assignments despite the fact that I'm more than capable, I just can't seem to get myself to do them even though I want to pass. I've been feeling really exhausted lately again but not like physical exhaustion, something else. I lost my job last month and I'm nearly out of the limited student loan money I was giving as I have to commute 3 days a week and pay 4 fares a day (some of my transit systems don't cross over), sometimes 5 if I miss a connection. I only worked 4 hours during the paycheck prior to my being fired, and at minimum wage that gives me barely any money to live off of. I've been applying to jobs but I have had no luck and I feel like this is compounding the pressure and worthlessness. I really don't know what to do. My family is poor so I can't get any money from them. My family life is also very negative and stressful at the moment which sucks because I live at home still; my older brother recently detoxed from weed and is unemployed and constantly upset with us for everything (we were blamed for him getting sick, and yelled at, despite none of us being sick), and my mother takes out her stresses primarily on me as my father is basically only a financial support, she has to deal with my older brother's shit, and my younger brother is mildly autistic. She doesn't seem to understand how the stress and negativity compounds on to me and that it makes things worse, but I can't afford to even think about moving out. Please help me to figure out a way through this, I'm so lost."
1371,"confused, scared and in need of help","for a while now i've been dealing with sudden moments of existential dread, its not common for my age, at least i think, and i don't know what to do anymore. I've fell asleep crying my eyes out due to the fact that im gonna die one day, that ive become numb to everything and i just have no motivation to live anymore, i just want to get out of this mess, any way i can. I've been dealing with this since last year when it started in November, and i just cant get away from it. I just want to do something, and I've been desperate enough to ask my parents for help, even crying while doing so, just for them to laugh and tell me ""your too young to think that""and ""just stop thinking about it"" and  of course, that didn't help at all. i don't know what to do anymore, when all this was at its peak i almost broke down in tears in the middle of class because my teacher just mentioned life. I've even become so desperate to consider becoming a christian once more but decided its best for me if i don't. Right now my last metal brake down was 2 days ago in the back of a car while my mom had gone and went to get some toilet paper, as always i cried my eyes out due to me being such a god damn failure. i just want to restart my life and be a normal god damn kid. I've been brushing these feelings off for so long due to thinking I'm just having some dumb emo phase and that i'll get better in a week but so far, absoloutley no luck. I hate this so much, I hate how I've considered self harm and even suicide, so please if you can, PLEASE help me in any way you can, any advice would be really nice, thank you."
1372,Any tips for treating identity crisis?,When I am around people I sometimes feel like I am not me and I'm only playing a character?
1373,how do i tell my family i've been thinking of suicide?,"i'm asking because i don't know how to tell my girlfriend, specifically. i've recently been sexually harassed by a pedophile, who says he wants to r@p3 me, and i'm dissociating 90% of the time. things are just really bad right now, i've noticed a lot of warning signs that could mean relapse. if i hadn't flushed all of my razors a few nights ago i definitely would have. if i tell my parents they'll worry more than they need to, i won't kill myself. i don't want anyone to be sad. but although my girlfriend is understanding and we've been together for a long time, she's been very distant and i don't know how to tell her that it hurts a lot. i know she might have things going on in her life, but she isn't really talking to me at all. i miss her.
it just feels like there's not much to be alive for anymore, especially after all the harassment."
1374,I can't get out of bed,"I've been struggling with anxiety for the past few years.  It started when I got promoted to GM, I was hyper-stressed at work so when I came home I would just sit in front of the TV.  My house is cluttered with garbage,  I can't tell if I'm just lazy,  apathetic or something else. 
Last September I found out that my extension wasn't being approved. (I work on a military base in Germany as a civilian.) Basically,  I was being fired but my contract ended on January 14th and would have to return to the US, after 10 years.  
In October my replacement was moved in and the following few weeks were very difficult for me, for a few different reasons.  I made the decision to resign early.
I took the rest of my paid leave so I could enjoy the holiday culture here one last season.  I should've used my time to get my household sorted,  but just couldn't bring myself to get out of bed.  
Now I'm beyond broke, my family helped me purchase a flight home and I still can't get out of bed.   My flight leaves on Sunday, and I've been working in spurts to try to get handle on it but today, but every time I start making a plan of action I get nauseous and light headed.  
I just want to get on the plane and leave it all, I'm so lost.  I know what my plan is when I return to the States and I'm excited about it, handling tomorrow is what fills me with anxiety."
1375,my depression,"Here’s a vent that nobody will see but I don’t care because I just need to vent. Maybe I’ll delete this again when I’m half way done writing it because I don’t have the effort to finish it. My life is what everybody would want. Straight A’s, friends and a “somewhat” good family. But apparently that’s not enough for my brain. I have to feel sad for no apparent reason and now that’s affecting my life now. I can’t solve easy problems I school, my ability to think fast is almost gone and I don’t feel like arguing or talking to anyone, it’s almost like my brain did a factory reset and went 8 years back. Nobody in my family knows I’m dealing with this because my dad doesn’t believe in depression and I’m uncomfortable explaining this type of stuff to my mother or sister. My family also argues a whole lot and puts a lot of stress on me and I have  told them this but they couldn’t care less. I just want to be alone and think but I can’t even think because of my depression! So I just stay in my room agitated and staring at nothing waiting for something to just click in my brain and let me return to a normal life."
1376,Crying in bed before falling asleep,I do this and yeah wanted to know if you guys do this as well. I've been crying myself to sleep for some time now. Is it ok?
1377,Not suicidal but would not care if I were to die,Is this normal? I mean I have been going through some stuff for some years now and I honestly would not regret dying even though I am not suicidal at all.
1378,Need advice on how to handle a situation about mental health discrimination,"So recently, I need the advice I can get from this. Sorry it’s long. Some background context:

I attend university, I was a previous transfer student. I joined this club that caters to my ethnicity. It is more of a social club than a cultural one. I joined because my boyfriend introduced me to it and I was interested by how they ran the club. It’s been over a year since joining the club. I was worried to be around new people especially cause my boyfriend knew a lot of people from his club (he was previously Treasurer and now he’s internal Vice President) and I have diagnosed social anxiety/GAD/depression. His friend initially were very nice to me and I felt the need to maybe be friends with them because they seem to be good people. His friends are on the same executive board for this club so they’re almost like a team... but it’s more of a group of friends. Time goes by, it’s now spring semester of 2020. My bf is internal VP still and they handed out applications for new interns to be on the e-board. I applied, wanting to spread new ideas for this club such as more community work, connecting with our rival university who has the same cultural club, and bringing more cultural stuff into general meetings. I thought my interview was fine and did my BF. I wanted to go by the mission statement that the club has established in its development. 

This past Tuesday, they voted for interns during the weekly executive board meeting. I didn’t make the cut and I asked my bf why for the details. He initially said that my visions weren’t what they (the co presidents, in which by the way are a couple romantically) wanted from me. I didn’t believe my boyfriend so I asked for more and knew it was an excuse. He mentioned that one of the people at the meeting pointed out my mental health as the biggest issue. She thought I wasn’t capable of being an intern because I get overwhelmed easily. I was clearly upset at her words as my boyfriend summarized it for me. All of my disappointment for not getting the cut went away and I was angry about her saying that my mental health was the biggest reason why I could not join their board. My bf made a thought about that they could be threatened by my ideas, which to me aren’t threatening , but they tend to think in “groupthink” at meetings. I am very outspoken with ideas so I can see why they would feel that I wouldn’t agree to why they think all the time. But, it’s no excuse to use my mental health as a reason not to pick me as an intern. I even emphasized that I will be professional at all times during my interview, but of course they didn’t give me a chance. My boyfriend feels hurt about what his friend said about me and is silently mad at her. She doesn’t know that, but everyone during that meeting felt uncomfortable talking about me.

In my anger, I vented to a friend from my hometown who I’m close to. She told me that I could report the story to my university’s ADA department (disability department) so that I can make a grievance report. However, I am hesitant to report because that would mean I could ultimately burn bridges with the e board (who were originally my friends) and my boyfriend will likely have to burn those bridges too. I hate that my boyfriend is stuck in a position in choosing sides, I don’t want to subject him to that. And if I do report, they would know that I know what happened during the meeting because my boyfriend tells me everything. I’ve already started to distance myself already from them and making sure I keep my guard up at all times if I can’t avoid them while hanging out. I am just mad she and the others who didn’t stand up for me believed that I couldn’t do it. I signed up for a reason. I still have the high functioning parts of me despite my mental illnesses trying to function on the daily basis. I don’t let my mental health stop me from being a hard worker. They don’t know that I know so far. Only one person on the board knows and she wasn’t even there. She’s a true friend and is gravely upset at the situation that she’s considering tor ending because she hates the way they’re running this cultural club. 

It’s so hypocritical of them to think that me being part of the e board is going to ruin their reputation. When in reality, it’s not because I’m not going to be a figurehead and the two co presidents are a couple who actually voted themselves last year to be presidents. The club is even a clique themselves. And even if my boyfriend is on the e board, I would have still maintained professionalism. 

I am very passionate about mental health due to my diagnoses, past experiences and I want to be a social worker focusing on mental health in the future. I want to be able to protect myself other side than just avoiding these people, which will be hard because they are my boyfriend’s friends. I also don’t like the discrimination people with mental health issues face when it comes to the workforce. I want to prevent any further discrimination in the future. 

Thank you for reading if you’ve made it this far. 

Any advice would be helpful."

1380,Addiction,"Hi, I’m a broke 20 year old pre-med student majoring in biochemistry. And since I was 17 I’ve been struggling with findom, or financial domination. For those of you who dont know, I basically have a fetish for sending money to hot girls. And it return, they’ll humiliate me, call me “loser”, “weak”, “worthless”, “pathetic” and basically bully me but it makes me so hard. If you’re curious, go to twitter and look at the tag “findom”. I’ve tried twice to quit this fetish and have been unsuccessful, I’ve spent a total of maybe 500 dollars on it. I’ve never had a girlfriend. And I have low self esteem. I just sent like 100 on a girl like 7 minutes ago. She’s was super hot, perfect body, beautiful face, wickedly innocent smile, she wasn’t a dominatrix though but I just wanted to “protect her”, I just wanted to give to her, to provide for her. So I sent her 160 bucks, and she texted thanks and then we went our separate ways. This is just one instance, I’ve also had interactions with professional “dommes”. I just feel like this is the worse fetish to have, I literally get off on losing money, on people stepping on me, telling me I’m a loser, I get off on feeling like shit, I have all of these negatives thoughts and my sexual reward circuits just reinforces these negative affirmations further and further. I’ve lost time and money to this fetish, and I can’t stop. I’m so depressed, no one knows about this fetish. It’s so embarrassing, I just want to be better, I hate my self for hating my self. I freaking hate this fetish. What are things I can do to leave this all behind? I can’t afford therapy, and university and government therapy services take months to schedule. I don’t want my friends to know either. I’m so ashamed and I just want this fetish to stop. Like my horny reptilian brain craves it, but my actual self hates it. It’s so stupid. Please help."
1381,I feel like a burden,"I think I need help but afraid to ask for it again. I have had some awful things happen to me but I think when it all happened I was so emotional I didn't really work through it in a healthy manner. I talked down all what happened and kind of joked about. I went to a psychologist for a year and a half but had to stop going when they started a new job some where else. I felt fine about dealing about it on my own and for a while I was fine but now I think I need help. I feel fine and super happy and can get a lot done in one day and another I feel so miserable my thoughts go to suicide.

My good days are so wonderful and feel like I have just started remembering and being able to do things that I love, which I have not been able to do. Then I feel like my life has purpose which is a feeling I think I never have felt  before but the other miserable days just feel awful. 
  
I'm sorry if it's too long or hard to understand but what should i do I'm quite lost. 

Female, English is not my first language"
1382,Venting,"Sooo, it's been 2 days of me not talking to my mom much.
I only talk to her when I have to.
I'm still angry at her for basically calling me crazy...it still hurts...the memory of that coversation.
She still thinks that if I'm angry at her that she will be angry at me. Fair enough I guess.
Today she asked me how much will this continue and said that she doesn't like how we don't talk.
Even though I calmed I still can't forgive her...
I just said ""For a longer period of time"".
She showed me that  I can't tell her how I feel. If I can't even express my emotions other than happiness...then I just can't forgive her.
She's a great mom...but she hurt me by saying that literally at the worst possible time.
Niw I can't trust her...teachers...and bullies are annoying af...
At least my isolation helps by not letting anyone hurt me...
I've been self harming for now 2 weeks...my only relief in life rn.
All in all I had like 3 suicide visions...pretty shocking at first because it felt so real...but they don't happen often and are just getting annoying.
Before my argument with my mom, she showed me a video of people colapsing on the streets in china because of the corona virus. At first I was a bit shocked...but then nothing...I just watched the video...numb...disinterested...
I've never been diagnosed with anything...but my reation was evwn weird for me.
I've been feeling low for 3 or 4 weeks...And I just gave up on everything...people...myself...
I decided not to let anyone know of any of this.
They (students) would just use my weakness against me...
My mom even told me that if I don't like it in the UK or living with her I can just go live with my dad in the county I come from...I just told her that I would rather kill myself that live with him and just gave her a blank stare...
He's an alcoholic with no real job whom my mom divorced when i was a little kid...and I despise him...and I forever will.
I don't regret my decision to just givre up...if I can't defend myself against bullies(school rules and if a fight breaks out they might call the f-ing cops), teachers took the word of the bully that he won't continue...he did and my mom doesn't let me tell her how I trully feel...
When the odds are so against me...then I'm just done with everything and everyone.
I am not going to kill myself...scared of dying.
But I am going to do with my life what I want.
Even though I'm just a stupid 15M...I will do what I see is fhe only option...I'm not scared of giving up on everything. 
This isn't a post when I want to get talked out of giving up. This is just a venting post...to just let my mind speak.
And, yes. I still do love my mom...I just can't forgive her for what she said.

Anyway, thanks for reading."
1383,"Do you ever feel that if one thing makes you feel bad, then you should never feel good?","If only one thing in existence is capable of making me feel sad, lost, angry, then happiness is forbidden. Why can't that be the other way around? Because being happy is a risk, there's so much to lose that my mind creates patterns to avoid that risk. Therefore, I feel bad literally all the time."
1384,Life is alright. Actually pretty good. But I still feel doomed.,"A few years ago, I moved away from controlling/dysfunctional/emotionally abusive family to live with my SO, a childhood friend of mine (their sibling), and a mutual group of friends. Aside from wanting to escape the drama llama, I also thought about enjoying my life and living with these awesome people near a lively city while pursuing life as a freelancer/artist.

I've been surviving off a combination of my savings (I saved up \*a lot\* years before moving out), a chill part-time job doing data entry for some office, and the occasional writing gig. (I originally thought I would be a freelance writer but distanced myself from it after realizing that I'm a slow writer and actually don't enjoy writing for long periods of time as a source of living.) I kind of re-purposed my freelance visions to pursue digital art. Maybe it seems crazy. I used to think about doing this only to think ""naaahhh."" But after making peace with how long it might take me and having to learn the marketing aspects, here I am. And I actually enjoy the learning and the creating enough to get into a state of flow. So I've been working on this while enjoying the day to day life I have with my SO/squad. 

But I could never shake off this unsettling feeling that no matter what I do, I'm doomed to burnout, give up, and fail. It used to be a mere fly in the background. Perhaps it's always been a fear--even while living back home--that I stuffed away in favor of survival. Maybe it's because I remember previous failures/aspirations I gave up during college. But since the beginning of 2020, it's only been growing worse. 

It tells me that I'll fail, learn, and try again with my artwork. Over and over and over again... until I burnout and give up. 

It also tells me that I'll lose my current part-time job, and that I'll either throw myself entirely into art--causing me to burnout and give up faster--or I'll get another job out of desperation and I'll most likely end up with something that leaves me little time or energy to create--which will cause me to burnout and fail at both the new job and art stuff.

It also tells me that my parents will one day decide to meddle with my life, find where I live (I kept my whereabouts secret) and then when they see me in a pathetic state of anxiety, they'll try to drag me away from this found family/life I created for myself.

If I indulge these thoughts long enough, I feel like I'm running out of time. Almost like dying. Like a self-defeating piece of shit who somehow doesn't deserve the love/acceptance of my SO and my friends. Like the life I have now is some silly dream and it'll end in a devastating way. 

Such feelings could obviously sabotage what I have now so how to make them go away?"
1385,My sister has bipolar disorder and I don't know what to do,"Hi, sorry if there any mistake, I'm French and it's the first time I post on reddit or on any social network in english.

My sister (19) was diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently, and this week she was admitted to the hospital because she had some dark thought. She came by herself in the emergency room because her therapist told her that if she had any suicidal thought, she should go. 
On the week day, she's 2 hours away from home to be near her university, and live in a small student room. I'm (21F) live close by to, but we don't live together.

She was out of the hospital but was re-admitted 2 days after, so my mom came to pick her up.
My mom saw scar along her thighs, and I don't know if she has any on her arms.
She's really tired all the time, because of the medication and her general state of mind.

I don't know what to do to help her. I'm afraid she will kill herself.
I have depression, and had it since my teens, but it's not the same, I never try to scar myself.
I'm afraid that telling her that we love her will not be enough for her to not go through.

What can I do to help her? What can my family do to help?
What should I expect of someone with this mental disorder? (She doesn't have the maniac part of the disorder)"
1386,"I feel like like shit every week, but when the weekends come, life is not that bad.","During the weeks I’m just so unmotivated, I can never concentrate on anything and I just can’t do any schoolwork. Sometimes I even think about suicide, when I feel like I can’t take it anymore.

When the weekend finally arrives, almost all of that goes away. I usually don’t do any schoolwork or any other things that could be useful to do. I just sleep, eat, chill, game, and listen to music. I don’t have the energy to do anything else, but I’m okay with just being at home. When I’m at home I feel so much better than I do at school."
1387,I don't know anymore.,"I have a much better life than what I have heard from this subreddit but I still feel sad everyday although my parents are (mostly) the best, (only) my best friend is actually supportive, and no one bullies me directly, but I can't shake the thought that everything that I'm doing matters. I want to end it all but I'm not scared of death, I'm just scared of the pain. I know I don't like myself and who I've become. I don't do anything wrong but I struggle so much just holding up a common conversation with anyone I don't know a lot about. The fact that I'm shy, introverted, unknown mental problems and that I hate my physical body doesn't help at all. Each day is just the same horrible feeling every time."
1388,Experiencing mood swings,Hi this my first time posting here I want to Know if there is something wrong I for a while have been experiencing something weird I have sudden happiness surges like one minute I am sitting trying to study and the next I am very very Happy to may even say ecstatic and I want to dance and like I am high and after a couple of minutes it is gone and it is so random like I was one time watching a sad movie crying a little boom happiness surge walking in the street nothing to make me happy boom happiness surge I don't understand why but it really is weird is something wrong I don't drink or do drugs

Thank You."
1390,I want friends,"I've tried to make friends over the years, people have come and gone.  Love or hate or something much more insidious or toxic.  I've realized at 33 I may be imposing, or pretentious or accidently overbearing at times.  It's an accident, I'm really quite an amazing jack ass, off the clock, I have a sense of humor.  So I cut up with people and they misundertand me and I presume they're not going to be a bit alarmed or stand off.  I lose more friends because we undermind one anothers leverage in our brief acqaintences.  A friend that can reason with you in the midst of first imrpessions is not worth a fuck anyway, so fuck'em.  Sometimes all you have is yourself and that's all you need to survive, and do quite well in complete solitude.  That's until you want to talk to somebody, like Wilson.  
That Tom Hanks film was kind of bullshit and I assume the man would have died of sun sickness or something else, starvation, disease, septic tooth cavity, still fat ass pasty old ass Tom Stanks, survivin somewhere off  Samoa or some shit..  It's was a miracle, he stays over 20% body fat as well, which was the real give away this film was bullshit because he didn't die.  Mr.Hanks need to get slim throughout the course of living off berries and exotic sea life and turtles for a couple of years, real slim, like dead.
So my social needs did start to kick in after an extensive time of solitude on some things, like my metaphyscial and spiritual experiences.  No good had come of much of it, hadn't been executed yet.  Keeps me tickled pink what a fucked up world we live in.  I have some experience in this world and it is just fucked up and corrupt.  
These suicide notes fuck me up, everyday just suicide notes all over the internet.  I had found my reason to survive and it is still hard to the end.  When people lose their will to live it is not something I know how to deal with, besides asking them not to.  I do not know how to console some one that wants to end their life.  
I'm not struggling with suicide as much as propogating my offspring across the lands.  My bad ass children that would make this world a better and less parasitic wasteland. Why bare children into this horrific fucking world in any age, this has to be better.  Is it really?  Ya, it's better, we got abortion legalized in some places.  So if it's before the 3rd trimester and anyone wants to bail, we can flush those little souls.  People, that little soul would probably be grateful you flushed it instead of baring it into this insidious nightmare cess pool of a world, particularly if you don't love them or their illigitement or otherwise fucked up and not born into wealth, flush'em you piece of shit, and get spaded.  Come to think of it, we always used abortion for those bad seeds and eugenics to keep the brood all strong, fuckin nitwits.  I'll be god damned enraged if I'm any more fucked up floatin around, you fucked up bastards.


Fuck you."
1391,i've been seeing what i normally see while on LSD,"*not sure if this post can be posted here but i think im hallucinating so i figured it would be okay (if not pls tell me where i should post :) )*

This started around a month ago and caught me completely off guard. i was sitting on a step outside and i suddenly saw part of the ground in front of me sort of levitating and hovering from side to side. (this happens when i take lsd, i barely ever take it so i doubt that it effected my mind in this way) i don't know what this means, has it ever happened to any one of you?"
1392,"Told my mom I needed space, now I'm a wreck (vent)","So my mom and I have a usually good relationship. It was horrible from when I started puberty until I moved out at 20 basically. But after that we really bonded and became close. She's now turned 60, I'm 25 and finished my master and looking for a job.

For the last couple of weeks I've been feeling a lot like I need a break from her. At first I had a hard time figuring out why, but thinking a lot about it I think it has several possible reasons.
One is that I feel like she expects me to share every little detail of my life, and then telling me what to do, even though I already had it all figured out.
Another is how I often feel that I have to be in tear/total wreck mode for her to truly listen to my issues. But at the same time she expects me to listen to all kinds of things. Often mental health stuff of people I know, a topic that is known to be a trigger of my own bad mental health. And its also often the same topics, for instance Tupperware (she became a saleswoman again after a very long break). I don't mind tw, but because I've shown interest it just seems like it's all we can talk about sometimes. 
And well I just feel like I need a breather from her. No questions for a while, I'll tell her when I have news etc.
I'm aware that her questions are based in the fact that she cares, but I just can't help feeling smothered.

Because of these feelings I've been taking a bit of distance for at least the last week. I guess she noticed, because when she called me tonight she ended up asking me why I've been pulling away. I was a bit taken a back to didn't have the true reasons ready (I'm the type that rehearses and writes things down when I'm gonna have a serious conversation) so I said I didn't know why, but that I just needed a break. I could hear that it upset her, but she said okay and that it would be up to me to decide when I wanted to spend time with her again.

The reason I'm a wreck now is that I know I upset her. And I hate upsetting her. I love my mom. But I also feel like I needed to tell her, since I've gotten a pit in my stomach every time she's texted me for a while now. But I just can't seem to get past the fear of having hurt her feelings. Because I can so put myself in her spot, I would feel awful is someone said that to me. And I really don't know what to do right now. I feel like crap, I'm mad and sad at the same time, and my head is just a mess.
Anyone who has some support or a good piece of advice?
Please don't tell me I'm an asshole, I already know that."
1393,"[venting] that feeling of being insignificant, is that a sign of the ‘dragon’ sneaking back?","Just need a corner to flush it off the system. Don’t need an answer or anything, as I don’t think there is an “answer”. I am just delighted to have a place to let it out. 

Haven’t had this feeling in a long long time but it is now back stronger than ever. 
That feeling of being insignificant to people. That feeling that if I am not making the first step, “friends” just forget about my existence. No contact, no calls, no whatsapp, no “let’s go for coffee or a beer”, no “let’s do something”. I go to work, get back home, Netflix, PS4, bed and back again. Very lonely. I am getting very angry at my people and I am actually pushing my “friends” away as I am fed up with always having to be the active one, the initiator. 
Not even my family calls to ask how I am doing, And they bitch me because “I never call them”. I have this thought that if I didn’t have kids and an ex-wife that care about me, no one would notice if I were to disappear or die in my apartment. 
I have been recently “ghosted” for no apparent reason by 2 very good friends, which didn’t really help. 
This whole thing doesn’t really help in my non-existing love life. I am now dreading dates as I know that even when the go super well, I’ll get dropped, if I am lucky, after the second date. I am now starting to see some lady, but I am always thinking “she’ll ghost me very soon”. 

Golfing and fishing are what are keeping me “safe” as these are 2 activities I can do on my own and that I love. 

Leaving all this aside, I am terrified that this is the first step to letting the “dark dragon” back in my life."
1394,What should I do about tics brought on by anxiety?,"So I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for almost my whole life now, but recently I think it's been giving me tics, which is something that has never happened before. It used to be if a thought popped into my head that made me anxious or whatever and I wanted to scream or curse or move etc. I could keep it inside, but beginning sometime around last year it got noticeably harder to keep it in, and it kept getting harder until I just started to let it out, but only at home and in privacy. Then it started happening more frequently and feeling more involuntary and since the beginning of this year every time I've been out in public I've let out a loud scream or a swear or hit myself at least once and it happens so fast I don't have time to think and stop it. It's embarrassing and kinda scary. The weird thing is that I can't say my mental health is any worse than it's been, it's definitely not THE WORST it's been so I can't see any logical change that would make this happen. Is this something that's common with severe anxiety? Is there anything I can do to help it? Any insight would be appreciated. I'm a 21 year old male if that helps any."
1395,What should I do?,"Should I be talking to someone?

I’m 20 years old. I live with my girlfriend who I love and work full time. For the past, maybe, 6 months, I’ve been feeling really down and unmotivated. I don’t even feel like myself anymore. I haven’t told a single soul about the way I’m feeling. I try my hardest to act like the happy self I always have been around my coworkers, family and friends. But deep down I’m sad and anxious constantly. I feel like I never do good enough at anything no matter how hard I try, and I don’t know what has changed to make me feel this way. I should be proud of the accomplishments I’ve achieved as I’m quite young with my own house and a good career, but I feel like I’m never enough and I’m truly just constantly upset and anxious. No matter how much sleep I get, I wake up feeling mentally and physically tired, even though I drink coffee throughout the day. I can’t focus on anything and find myself second guessing if I’ve done something at work even if I had done it ten seconds prior. It’s the most unusual thing and I’ve never experienced this feeling before in my life until the past 6 months or so. I don’t know how to tell anyone how I’m feeling because I don’t want anyone to think less of me but I don’t think I can keep this charade or being happy going much longer because it seems to just make how I’m actually feeling deep down first. Does anyone at all know what this could possibly be and what could be causing this?"
1396,I've gotta get this out. I feel like I'm going to have another breakdown and I'm scared.,"I tried posting this in r/advice, but neglected to read that they remove posts that mention suicide.

To give some context, I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for many years - since I was a kid. Although I can function, I have been absolutely miserable for most of my life. I can't find joy in anything. I just fake anything positive - in reality, I'm almost always scared. I worry all the time and cannot stop it - I've gotten so worked up from the anxiety that I've actually (mildly) dissociated many times. The real world is terrifying. I feel like a burden on everyone, and I feel like an idiot with no potential. I know it's illogical, but it doesn't make a difference. I can't just talk my way out of it, and experiences in my life don't encourage me. If anything, it makes me feel worse because I continue to feel awful despite positive events in my life.

It all kind of came to a head a few years ago. I was going to go into a medical program at community college. I did very well in my coursework, and made it into the program. I immediately dropped it; I had very intense anxiety for almost a year and just knew that if I kept going, I would have a breakdown - if what I was having wasn't the beginning of a breakdown, or a mini one (I wasn't really...functioning). I knew it wasn't for me, despite doing well in the classes. Despite working hard for it, dropping my place in the program was an easy decision.

I had been passively suicidal for a few years before then, but this time it just got more intense. I researched methods. I probably wouldn't have gone through with anything, or I would have picked a shoddy method like slitting my wrists or overdosing - one with a high chance of failure. I posted on Reddit asking for advice then, too. Someone suggested making a drastic change in my life, since I really had nothing to lose. I decided they were right, and instead of taking any plans I had further, I chose to get my bachelor's degree so I could teach abroad. I've definitely still had my moments where the suicidal ideation has gotten more intense, at times it's been more active than passive. But I chose to keep going. I wish I knew why.
I worked to gain experience to help me teach. I took courses that were terrifying because I knew they would help me be a better teacher and a better individual. I pushed myself to get out of my comfort zone. It's been so hard making it through these past few years, but I've somehow made it through.

I was successful; I'm going to be leaving in about a week to teach overseas. I've prepared for this specific job for a full year, and I've invested a lot of time and money into it. I am literally about to leave my job, sell my car, etc so I can move across the world in 10 (!) days. I'm not ready for this at all. Despite everything I've done, I'm convinced that I'm going to fail or have another breakdown - but this time, I'll be on my own. I feel like I'm delusional for even trying to make this big move. I thought I had a handle on my mental illnesses, but they are really really overpowering me right now.
People tell me not to discount the hard work I've put into this. They say I worked hard and remind me that I graduated with highest honors from community college and university. They point out that I've done all of this on my own. I wish I could say I felt proud, but in reality I know that my ""success"" was fueled by anxiety. Every single assignment and class felt like torture, like life-or-death. I had to continue to do well, or else I may as well drop out.

I wish I attempted suicide a few years ago instead of choosing to do something like this. Maybe then I could have actually gotten help for this anxiety and depression. I've gotten therapy multiple times and tried about five medications since the medical program fiasco, but I still feel like I struggle to cope. It's silly, because I function very well.
I just don't know if I can handle the stress of leaving my life and going across the world. I've been crying for the past two weeks. I can't focus at my job. I've been obsessing over this move at unhealthy levels.

If I don't figure out a way to manage this soon, I will have a breakdown overseas. I'll be out thousands of dollars to return home, and I'll have to deal with the shame from ruining my life and showing that I can't be a real adult. I'll have to deal with it without any insurance, since leaving this job means I'm also out of insurance.

I'm so, so scared."
1397,I’m worthless,"No one would care if I killed myself. I’m not worth the tears, the sadness, none of it. I’m just garbage. Unable to do anything right. I’m so damn pathetic. I’m tired of fighting with depression and anxiety, I know I’ll never win. I’m just a waste, that’s all. I’m sorry to have wasted your time, you all deserve better than that."
1398,Depressed on solo backpacking trip,"Hi guys. I’ve been backpacking in Mexico for 2 months on a trip of undetermined length and I am very alone.  I should mention I didn’t take this trip with the intention of magically shedding my depression, I took this trip with the intention to grow. 

That said Im experiencing some debilitating mental health issues. Although my symptoms of depression come and go, this past 10 days have been bad. I will begin my day around 8 am and by 1 pm feel so powerless to my sadness that it can take me hours or the rest of the day to recover. 

This afternoon I am, once again, paralyzed by misery.  Once again I’ve needed to rush back to my hostel so that I can cry alone. These moments where I feel completely overcome with emotional pain seem involuntary and almost out of my control. 

I’ve been meditating, exercising, eating well and not drinking. 

Every decision I make is with the goal of being happier, but travelling alone involves a ton of decision making. At this point in my trip I feel incapable of making any definitive choices (where to go next, what to do today, how to get help etc...) and as a result am stuck in my current headspace. 

I don’t know what I can do to get on a different page, one with less suffering. I hope this makes sense. Does anyone know what I can do to gain some momentum again? 

It might be worth adding that I don’t have any plans to go back home unless I have to. I’d rather be depressed in Mexico than my hometown."
1399,Mental Health Cat Part 2,"Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dt61h2/my\_cat\_loves\_me\_mentally/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dt61h2/my_cat_loves_me_mentally/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: A year ago, my mom got a pair of Calico cat twins. My brother got to name them Heidi (I call her Babygirl) and Shadow. Heidi ADORES me and Shadow loves my brother. Shadow doesn't hate me, she just tolerates me petting her and prefers my brother over me. Which is fine since we each have our own cats who love us. Shadow also purrs a lot and pretty loudly. Her vibrations could make a Californian cower. We have no idea why she purrs so much, but my brother enjoys how relaxed he feels when she sleeps on his legs.

Time for the story.

This morning I woke up at 2AM due to a nightmare. I heard my dad listening to Pink Floyd's The Wall on full volume for the 20th time this week (probably because he gets annoyed when people WANT to sleep at night) After a quick bathroom break, I went back to my room and tried to go back to sleep. The music brought back some traumatic memories, including my dad yelling at me for not choosing a car HE wanted as MY new car. I started whimpering and even beginning to cry.

And then I felt four paws walking on my bed. It was dark, so I assumed it was my Babygirl. It was actually Shadow. I know it was because she's lighter and Babygirl RARELY purrs. Shadow quickly snuggled near my stomach and purred her little heart out. I moved my body a little bit to get my arm unstuck and Shadow literally moved to return to my stomach and continued her purring. I managed to go back to sleep quickly and felt completely safe. 

My alarm woke me up at 5AM for work and Shadow got up and walked away, without looking back. I calmly said, ""Bye... thanks for the help!"" and just laid there, wondering why she wanted to help and being grateful she did.

My mom got up to give the cats their breakfast and their treats. I gave Shadow an extra treat while my mom wasn't looking and told her ""Thank you"" before I left for work."
1400,violent and angry towards myself,"bit of backstory: ever since i was a baby i’ve had anger issues (from what my parents told me) i grew up as a toddler throwing fits and rages everyday at home. at like 4/5 i nearly broke my older brothers hand by slamming it in a door and i once broke a plastic chair by slamming it over his head. he never did anything to deserve these things but i always always took my anger out on him and i hated him for no reason. i feel fucking terrible about it now. i’ve never loved my parents either i always hated them for no reason and they’re good people but i still just don’t really like them or feel any type of connection to them. like if they disappeared right now i don’t think it’d bother me. but basically i couldn’t control my anger until i was like 10 and then i just bottled it up. and now i find myself coming home everyday and just fucking screaming and yelling at myself and hitting and punching myself in the head and legs and stuff. and i don’t know what to do.  i get so angry over little things like my parents say one thing to me that has nothing to do with anything and it pisses me off for the rest of the day. like i feel like i’m two people because obviously towards people i’m nice enough and polite but by myself im so fucking angry at everything and everyone and i literally hate these people who i’m supposed to love so much for no fucking reason. like yeah sometimes they were shit people but i wasn’t abused or neglected or anything major so i don’t understand. 
does anyone know if this is like a sign of a deeper problem or am i just a angry person? because like i said ive spent my entire life like this so i don’t know if this is just my normal. i deal with depression and anxiety as well and i’m 18 if that gives any indication of anything."
1401,Does anyone else have strange reactions to great amounts of stress? (ex: laughing uncontrollably),"I got stranded at school for an hour with a dead phone and at first, I was very frustrated and angry. Then, all of a sudden, I just started laughing. I couldn't stop. It was the strangest thing. I just kept laughing and it was like I was laughing out breaths. Very hard to explain but basically, I was laughing uncontrollably and I couldn't stop and it took me by surprise because it made me feel a bit crazy."
1402,I feel uncomfortable at school (15y/o F),"I don’t think I’ll be able to do this any longer. I feel like I’m gonna fail at everything.

This schoolyear is being the worst of my life. I have 0 motivation. I hate many of my teachers. They are not professional enough to teach teenagers. I don’t fit in with my classmates. They’ve put the “nerd” label on me. They sometimes poke fun at me for no reason. I feel like even my friends avoid me. I’m losing my motivation. I feel guilty about that. I am disappointing my parents. I’ve always wanted to get a degree but I’ve started to feel so much hatred towards studying I don’t think I can anymore. I don’t know what to do. My mental health is getting worse. I can’t stop having breakdowns and feeling bad. I can’t stop procrastinating. I wake up four times at night and barely sleep. I just need this to stop. School is ruining my life. It’s ruining my friendships, my motivation and my mental and physical health. 

I don’t know what to do."
1403,Does anyone else feel this way?,"For the longest time, I've had a feeling that nothing really matters (a kind of "" meh"" type of feeling). When I'm with friends, I laugh, but I never truly feel happy. It's like my feelings are just turned off. Physically, I feel. Mentally, there is nothing.

Then, when I'm alone, I just feel at peace, until I get these extreme feelings of sadness, which sometimes make me cry, and sometimes make me just lay there and think about everything and nothing.

I can sometimes find myself in a state of mind, where I just get these really deep thoughts. I don't feel sad about it, even if the thoughts are sad. It feels empty, like it's just a sad thought flying by. And then suddenly I get happy, and then suddenly I'm sad again. Went to a therapist some time ago, but she had no answer. 

It's even affecting relationships. I can just suddenly flip out, as in saying things I don't mean, and only then realize that I've said it. Or I can sometimes get irrational for no apparent reason. This is just examples.

It's tearing om me, making me say and making me be someone I don't wanna be. Anyone else feel this way? And how do you deal with it?"
1404,Does anyone else experience this really weird emotional feeling?,"I ran into this feeling tonight! I've experienced it plenty of times before, but this time, I want to figure it out. (Just for a little background, I'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I take meds for it and am doing pretty well.)

Often, I will consider making a decision, and all of a sudden, I just feel like I'm mentally mired in quicksand. Tonight, I was (am) trying to decide if I should order a pizza. I was in the middle of grading tests (I'm a teacher) and was texting my husband about whether or not we should spend money on pizza. This is something we are always talking about because we love ordering take-out and tend to spend too much money on it.

Anyway, we hit this conversation, and I began trying to make this decision, and all of a sudden, now I feel like I can't do ANYTHING. I feel like I can't move on to grade more tests, I can't go do my exercises (stretches, foam rolling, PT stuff), I can't decide what to eat if I don't order pizza, and the list goes on. I considered taking a minute for self-care: reading my tarot cards, meditating, or taking a bath, but I can't decide between those either.

Then, everything starts running through my mind like a movie reel on fast forward - all the things that I could be doing. Cleaning the house, going through mail, doing laundry, walking the dogs, etc., but I can't actually put words to them. It's like these blurry pictures just flashing through my mind that I don't get enough time with in order to realize what I'm thinking.

The best way I can describe the feeling is almost as though I can't form sentences or finish sentences in my mind. Like I'm mentally or emotionally glitching or something. What the hell is this? I'm so sick of it."
1405,"I need advice, dont know what to do","So i will be short as much as i can.
